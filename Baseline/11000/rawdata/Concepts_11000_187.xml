The '''12-hour clock''' is a time convention in which the 24 hours of the day are divided into two periods: a.m. (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''ante meridiem'', translates to, before midday) and p.m. (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''post meridiem'' translates to, past midday).&lt;ref name=EncyclopaediaBritannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =Time | encyclopedia =The New Encyclopædia Britannica | volume =28 | pages =660 2a | year= 1986 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =Time | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition | url = http://library.eb.com.au/eb/article-61027| accessdate = 20 November 2013}} {{subscription required}}&lt;br /&gt;"The use of AM or PM to designate either noon or midnight can cause ambiguity. To designate noon, either the word noon or 1200 or 12 M should be used. To designate midnight without causing ambiguity, the two dates between which it falls should be given unless the 24-hour notation is used. Thus, midnight may be written: May 15–16 or 2400 May 15 or 0000 May 16."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NISTFAQ/&gt; Each period consists of 12 hours numbered: ''12'' (acting as zero),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.csusb.edu/faculty/susan/number_bracelets/mod_arith.html |title=Modular Arithmetic |date=25 August 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2008 |author=Susan Addington |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704121745/http://www.math.csusb.edu/faculty/susan/number_bracelets/mod_arith.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,'' and ''11''. The 24 hour/day cycle starts at 12 midnight (may be indicated as 12 a.m.), runs through 12 noon (may be indicated as 12 p.m.), and continues to the midnight at the end of the day. The 12-hour clock has been developed from the middle of the [[second millennium]] BC to the 16th century [[Anno Domini|AD]].

The 12-hour time convention is common in several English-speaking nations and former British colonies, as well as a few other countries.

==History and use==
[[File:Exeter Cathedral astronomical clock.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Exeter Cathedral Astronomical Clock]], showing the double-XII numbering scheme]]
The natural day-and-night division of a calendar day forms the fundamental basis as to why each day is split into two cycles.
Originally there were two cycles; one cycle which could be tracked by the position of the Sun (day) followed by one cycle which could be tracked by the Moon and stars (night).
This would eventually evolve into the two 12-hour periods that started at midnight (a.m.) and noon (p.m.) which are used today.  Noon itself is rarely abbreviated today, but if it is, it is denoted M.&lt;ref name=EncyclopaediaBritannica/&gt;

The 12-hour clock can be traced back as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013135550/http://www.arcytech.org/java/clock/clock_history.html|title=The History of Clocks|date=13 October 2008|access-date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both an Egyptian [[sundial]] for daytime use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aon.at/sundials/berlin-egypte.htm|title=Berlin instruments of the old Eg.time of day destination|website=members.aon.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and an Egyptian [[water clock]] for night-time use were found in the tomb of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html A Walk through Time - Water Clocks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531063139/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |date=31 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dating to c. 1500 BC, these clocks divided their respective times of use into 12 hours each.

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] also used a 12-hour clock: daylight was divided into 12 equal hours (thus hours having varying length throughout the year) and the night was divided into four watches.

The first mechanical clocks in the 14th century, if they had dials at all, showed all 24 hours, used the [[24-hour analog dial]], influenced by astronomers' familiarity with the [[astrolabe]] and sundial, and their desire to model the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's apparent motion around the Sun]].
In [[Northern Europe]] these dials generally used the 12-hour [[numbering scheme]] in [[Roman numerals]], but showed both ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' periods in sequence. This is known as the double-XII system, and can be seen on many surviving clock faces, such as those at [[Wells Cathedral clock|Wells]] and [[Exeter Cathedral#Clock|Exeter]].

Elsewhere in Europe, particularly in [[Italy]], numbering was more likely to be based on the 24-hour system (I to XXIV), reflecting the Italian style of counting the hours. The 12-hour clock was used throughout the British empire.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, the 12-hour analog dial and time system gradually became established as standard throughout Northern Europe for general public use. The 24-hour analog dial was reserved for more specialized applications, such as [[astronomical clock]]s and chronometers.

Most analog clocks and watches today use the 12-hour dial, on which the shorter hour hand rotates once every 12 hours and twice in one day. Some analog clock dials have an inner ring of numbers along with the standard 1-to-12 numbered ring.  The number 12 is paired either with a 00 or a 24, while the numbers 1 through 11 are paired with the numbers 13 through 23, respectively. This modification allows the clock to be read also in the [[24-hour notation]]. This kind of 12-hour clock can be found in countries where the 24-hour clock is preferred.

===Use by country===
{{Main|Date and time representation by country}}
[[File:Westclox Big Ben.jpg|thumb|left|Typical [[Clock#Analog clocks|analogue 12-hour clock]]]]
In several countries the 12-hour clock is the dominant written and spoken system of time, predominantly in nations that were part of the former British Empire, for example, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Malaysia]] and others follow this convention as well such as [[Egypt]], [[Mexico]] and the former American colony of the [[Philippines]]. In most countries, however, the [[24-hour clock]] is the standard system used, especially in writing. Some nations in Europe and Latin America use a combination of the two, preferring the 12-hour system in colloquial speech but using the 24-hour system in written form and in formal contexts.

The 12-hour clock in speech often uses phrases such as '' ... in the morning, ... in the afternoon, ... in the evening,'' and ''...at night''. In the United Kingdom, these descriptive phrases are still used. ''Rider's British Merlin'' almanac for 1795 and a similar almanac for 1773 published in London used them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4881611 National Library of Australia catalogue entry] for ''Rider's British merlin: for the year of Our Lord God 1795''&lt;/ref&gt;. Other than English-speaking countries, the terms ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' are seldom used and often unknown.

===Computer support===
In most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. Most operating systems, including [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], activate the 12-hour notation by default for a limited number of language and region settings. This behavior can be changed by the user, such as with the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system "Region and Language" settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/customize-how-time-is-displayed-in-windows/|title=How to customize how the time is displayed in Windows|author=Lawrence Abrams|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=26 October 2013|publisher=Bleeping Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbreviations==

[[File:Digital-clock-alarm.jpg|thumb|Typical [[digital clock|digital]] 12-hour alarm clock indicating ''p.m.'' with a dot to the left of the hour]]The [[Latin]] abbreviations ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' (often written "am" and "pm", "AM" and "PM", or "A.M." and "P.M.") are used in [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario panhispánico de dudas, [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=hora2 HORA] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalents in [[Greek language|Greek]] are {{lang|el|π.µ.}} and {{lang|el|µ.µ.}}, respectively, and in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] {{lang|si|පෙ.ව.}} ({{transl|si|''pe.va.''}}) for {{lang|si|පෙරවරු}} ({{transl|si|''peravaru''}}, {{lang|si|පෙර}} {{transl|si|''pera''}} - fore, pre) and {{lang|si|ප.ව.}} ({{transl|si|''pa.va.''}}) for {{lang|si|පස්වරු}} ({{transl|si|''pasvaru''}}, {{lang|si|පස්සේ}} {{transl|si|''passē''}} - after, post). However, noon is rarely abbreviated in any of these languages, noon normally being written in full. In Portuguese, there are two official options and many other used, for example, using 21:45 pm: 21h45 or 21h45min (official ones) or 21:45 or 9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. In [[Irish language|Irish]], ''a.m.'' and ''i.n.'' are used, standing for ''ar maidin'' ("in the morning") and ''iarnóin'' ("afternoon") respectively.

Most other languages lack formal abbreviations for "before noon" and "after noon", and their users use the 12-hour clock only orally and informally.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} However, in many languages, such as Russian and Hebrew, informal designations are used, such as "9 in the morning" or "3 in the night".

When abbreviations and phrases are omitted, one may rely on sentence context and societal norms to reduce ambiguity. For example, if one commutes to work at "9:00", 9:00 a.m. may be implied, but if a [[social dance]] is scheduled to begin at "9:00", it may begin at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.

==Related conventions==

===Typography===
The terms "a.m." and "p.m." are abbreviations of the Latin ''ante meridiem'' (before midday) and ''post meridiem'' (after midday). Depending on the [[style guide]] referenced, the abbreviations "a.m." and "p.m." are variously written in [[small capital]]s ("{{smallcaps|am}}" and "{{smallcaps|pm}}"), [[uppercase]] letters without a [[Period (punctuation)|period]] ("AM" and "PM"), uppercase letters with [[Periods.|periods]], or [[lowercase]] letters ("am" and "pm" or, more commonly, "a.m." and "p.m.").

Some stylebooks suggest the use of a space between the number and the a.m. or p.m. abbreviation.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Style guides recommend not using a.m. and p.m. without a time preceding it,&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Diana, A Writer's Reference, six edition, Bedford, St Martin's, Boston, 2007, section M4-c, p.308.&lt;/ref&gt; although doing so can be advantageous when describing an event that always happens before or after noon.

The hour/minute separator [[Date and time representation by country|varies between countries]]: some use a colon, others use a [[period (punctuation)|period]] (full stop), and still others use the letter h. In many instances using the 24-hour clock, there is no separator between hours and minutes (0800, read as written, i.e. "oh-eight-hundred").

====Encoding====
In Unicode, there exist symbols for:
: "a.m." {{unichar
| 33C2
| &lt;!-- Unicode name --&gt;
| ulink =
| image =
| size  = 150%
| html  =
}} and
: "p.m." {{unichar
| 33D8
| &lt;!-- Unicode name --&gt;
| ulink =
| image =
| size  = 150%
| html  = }}.

They are meant to be used only with [[CJK characters|Chinese-Japanese-Korean]] character sets, as they take up exactly the same space as one [[Chinese character]].

===Informal speech and rounding off===
It is common to round the time to the nearest five minutes and express the time as so many minutes past an hour, for example, "five past five" or "five to five".15 minutes is often expressed as "a quarter" such as "a quarter past five" and 30 minutes as "half past five" or merely "half five"). The time would be spoken as 8:45, and "''(a) quarter to'' ''nine''".&lt;ref&gt;''American Heritage Dictionary,'' 3rd ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1992). s.v. usage note at end of "quarter" entry.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in situations where the relevant hour is obvious or has been recently mentioned, speakers can use terms "quarter to" and "half past" to avoid elaborate sentences in particularly informal conversations. These forms are often commonly used in television and radio broadcasts that cover multiple time zones at one-hour intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=TVTimes|date=21–27 May 1983|url=http://forums.doyouremember.co.uk/threads/8061-TVTimes-magazine-21-27-May-1983-part1|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of meaning 5:30, the "half five" expression is sometimes used to mean 4:30, or "half-way to five", especially for regions such as the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] and other areas that have been particularly [[German America|influenced by German culture]]. This meaning follows the pattern choices of many Germanic and [[Slavic languages]], including [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], as well as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

===Formal speech and times to the minute===
{{redirect|O'clock|the o'clock watch|O bag}}
Minutes may be expressed as an exact number of minutes past the hour specifying the time of day (e.g., 6:32&amp;nbsp;p.m. is "six thirty-two"). Additionally, when expressing the time using the "past (after)" or "to (before)" formula, it is conventional to choose the number of minutes below 30 (e.g., 6.32 pm is conventionally "twenty-eight minutes to seven" rather than "thirty-two minutes past six").

In spoken English, full hours are often represented by the numbered hour followed by ''o'clock'' (10:00 as ''ten o'clock'', 2:00 as ''two o'clock''). This may be followed by the "a.m." or "p.m." designator, though phrases such as ''in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening,'' or ''at night'' more commonly follow analog-style terms such as ''o'clock, half past three,'' and ''quarter to four. O'clock'' itself may be omitted, telling a time as ''four a.m.'' or ''four p.m.'' Minutes ":01" to ":09" are usually pronounced as ''oh one'' to ''oh nine'' (''nought'' or ''zero'' can also be used instead of ''oh''). Minutes ":10" to ":59" are pronounced as their usual number-words. For instance, 6:02&amp;nbsp;a.m. can be pronounced ''six oh two a.m.'' whereas 6:32&amp;nbsp;a.m. could be told as ''six thirty-two a.m.''

It is not always clear what times "12:00 a.m." and "12:00 p.m." denote. From the [[Latin]] words ''meridies'' (midday), ''ante'' (before) and ''post'' (after), the term ''ante meridiem'' (a.m.) means before midday and ''post meridiem'' (p.m.) means after midday. Since "noon" (midday - ''meridies'' (m.)) is neither before nor after itself, the terms a.m. and p.m. do not apply.&lt;ref name=NISTFAQ /&gt;  Although "12 m." was suggested as a way to indicate noon, this is seldom done&lt;ref name="chicago" /&gt;  and also does not resolve the question of how to indicate midnight.

''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' states "By convention, ''12 AM'' denotes midnight and ''12 PM'' denotes noon. Because of the potential for confusion, it is advisable to use ''12 noon'' and ''12 midnight''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=AM AM] at the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fifth Edition (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

E. G. Richards in his book ''Mapping Time'' provided a diagram in which 12 a.m. means noon and 12 p.m. means midnight.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. G., ''Mapping Time: the Calendar and its History'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The style manual of the [[United States Government Printing Office]] used 12 a.m. for noon and 12 p.m. for midnight until its 2008 edition, when it reversed these designations,&lt;ref name="GPO2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GPO2008" /&gt; later maintained in its 2016 revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/features/new-edition-gpo-style-manual|title=New Edition of the GPO Style Manual - govinfo|website=www.govinfo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many U.S. style guides, and [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]'s "Frequently asked questions (FAQ)" web page,&lt;ref name=NISTFAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/times-day-faqs|title=Times of Day FAQs |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=21 September 2016|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommend that it is clearest if one refers to "noon" or "12:00&amp;nbsp;noon" and "midnight" or "12:00&amp;nbsp;midnight" (rather than to "12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m." and "12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m."). The NIST website states that "12 a.m. and 12 p.m. are ambiguous and should not be used."

''The Associated Press Stylebook'' specifies that midnight "is part of the day that is ending, not the one that is beginning."&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; Thus, according to AP style, "midnight Friday" occurs one minute after 11:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. Friday, not one minute before 12:01&amp;nbsp;a.m. Friday.

''The Canadian Press Stylebook''&lt;ref name="CP"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canadian Press Stylebook|edition= 11th |date = 1999 | at = page 288}}&lt;/ref&gt; says, "write ''noon'' or ''midnight'', not ''12 noon'' or ''12 midnight''." Phrases such as "12 a.m." and "12 p.m." are not mentioned at all. Britain's National Physical Laboratory "FAQ-Time" web page&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;[http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/time-frequency/time/faqs National Physical Laboratory, ''FAQ-Time'']&lt;/ref&gt; states "In cases  where the context cannot be relied upon to place a particular event, the pair of days straddling midnight can be quoted"; also "the terms 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. should be avoided."

Likewise, some U.S. style guides recommend either clarifying "midnight" with other context clues, such as specifying the two dates between which it falls, or not referring to midnight at all. For an example of the latter method, "midnight" is replaced with "11:59 p.m." for the end of a day or "12:01 a.m." for the start of a day. That has become common in the United States in legal contracts and for [[airplane]], [[bus]], or [[train]] schedules, though some schedules use other conventions. Occasionally, when trains run at regular intervals, the pattern may be broken at midnight by displacing the midnight departure one or more minutes, such as to 11:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. or 12:01&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abelliogreateranglia.co.uk/f/62130/62130.pdf ''Interim train timetables''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526154117/http://www.abelliogreateranglia.co.uk/f/62130/62130.pdf# |date=26 May 2015 }}, Abellio Greater Anglia, London, 17 May 2015, pages 7 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

In July 2017 the municipalities of [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]], [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|Upper Saddle River]] and [[Montvale, New Jersey|Montvale]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]], in the United States, opposed extension of an [[eruv]] within their borders. An eruv is a land area surrounded by a boundary of religious significance, often marked by small plastic pipes (called ''lechis'') attached to [[utility pole]]s. The demarcation permits [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jews to push or carry objects (such as prayer books, keys or baby strollers) within the eruv on the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]], in a way that is otherwise considered forbidden under Orthodox Jewish law. Other [[Jewish_religious_movements#Modern_movements_or_denominations|Jewish denominations]], such as [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], do not hold such views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/living/eruv_1.shtml |title=Eruvs |date=July 23, 2009 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailynews.com/2007/01/29/eruv-in-oak-park-splits-community/ |title=Eruv in Oak Park Splits Community |date=January 29, 2007 |publisher=Los Angeles Daily News |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three municipalities ordered that the borders of the eruv be dismantled having been erected without the appropriate consents. Many Mahwah residents angrily protested against the prospect of Orthodox Jews from [[Rockland County, New York]], using local parks or seeking to buy homes there.

After no agreement could be reached short of litigation, the eruv association brought suit against each of the municipalities. Mahwah's actions in passing a [[local ordinance|township ordinance]] to bar nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks, and the hostility of some residents and council members towards those who supported the eruv led Democratic candidate for [[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Phil Murphy]] and others to make accusations of anti-Semitism. The presiding judge in the lawsuits, [[John Michael Vazquez]], in January 2018 made it clear he felt the municipalities did not have a strong case, and urged them to settle. The three municipalities have settled with the eruv association, allowing the eruv borders to remain. Mahwah has settled a lawsuit from the [[New Jersey Attorney General]] accusing it of discrimination.

==Background==
[[File:Bergen County, NJ municipalities labeled.svg|thumb|upright|Bergen County, New Jersey. Mahwah is the large area at upper left (northwest), with Upper Saddle River and Montvale the next to the east along the state line (at top).]]
[[File:Location map of Bergen County, New Jersey.svg|thumb|upright|Location map of Bergen County in New Jersey. Rockland County in New York is seen, in part, to the north.]]
The [[Township (New Jersey)|township]] of [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]], and the [[borough (New Jersey)|boroughs]] of [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|Upper Saddle River]] and [[Montvale, New Jersey|Montvale]], are neighboring municipalities in northwestern [[Bergen County, New Jersey]]. All three are adjacent to the state line with New York,&lt;ref name="have a talk"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah mayor wants to talk with eruv association |url = http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-mayor-wants-to-talk-with-eruv-association/ |accessdate = February 11, 2018 |date = July 25, 2017 |last = Yudelson |first = Larry |newspaper = The Jewish Standard |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180212005506/http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-mayor-wants-to-talk-with-eruv-association/ |archivedate = February 12, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other side of which is [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], where there are large communities of [[Orthodox Jew]]s.&lt;ref name = "prepare" /&gt;

An [[eruv]] (plural "eruvin", or sometimes "eruvim") is an enclosure defined by string, rope, wires, cables, etc., that allows observant Jews, including the Orthodox, to carry or push objects further than is normally permitted on [[Shabbat|the Jewish Sabbath]] (or Shabbat). Normally, on Shabbat, an object may not be taken from a private domain, such as a house, into a public one, such as a street or sidewalk, or moved, in a public area, more than 4 [[cubit]]s (about 6 feet; 1.7 meters). Note that "domain" is a technical term referring to how enclosed an area is, not property ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabadwmc.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/2270313/jewish/About-Eruv.htm |title=About Eruv |publisher=Chabad of West Monmouth County |access-date=July 27, 2018 |quote=Private and public do not refer to ownership. An enclosed area is considered a private domain, whereas an open area is considered public for the purposes of these laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects may be moved freely if they remain within a private domain, and an eruv effectively extends the private domain through the area it encloses, including streets and sidewalks. The boundary of an eruv is often marked by utility poles surrounding a given area, with the space between regarded as doorways, topped by lintels, the telephone or power wires.&lt;ref name="whatisaneruv"&gt;{{cite web |last = Lozovsky |first = Lorne |url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/700456/jewish/What-Is-an-Eruv.htm |title = What is an Eruv? |publisher = chabad.org |accessdate = February 7, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180208024846/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/700456/jewish/What-Is-an-Eruv.htm |archivedate = February 8, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poles are regarded as doorposts, and are marked by lechis (singular: lechi), solid objects such as lengths of twine or of plastic pipe, which run from near the ground to just below the wires.&lt;ref name="eruvglossary"&gt;{{cite web |title = Eruv Glossary |publisher = Greater Boston Eruv Corporation |url = http://www.bostoneruv.org/glossary.htm |accessdate = February 7, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011458/http://www.bostoneruv.org/glossary.htm |archivedate = March 19, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the act of stringing such a boundary around a public area by a Jewish community creates the pretense for its members that that public area is enclosed for the limited purpose of allowing the members to do some otherwise forbidden things in that public area on the Sabbath.

There are many requirements for eruvin; the [[Talmud]] devotes [[Eruvin (Talmud)|an entire tractate]] to the subject. This complexity makes [[Rabbi#Functions|rabbinic supervision]] and regular inspection mandatory. An operating eruv allows observant Jews to carry prayer books from home to synagogue on Shabbat, or to push strollers or baby carriages.&lt;ref name="whatisaneruv" /&gt;

[[File:Eruv segment.jpg|thumb|left|An eruv boundary, Airmont, New York. Note the white plastic lechi at right of nearest pole.]]
In [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]], in southeastern Bergen County and home to large numbers of Orthodox Jews, an eruv has existed since the 1970s with little controversy, and, as the Jewish population increased, was extended to nearby [[Bogota, New Jersey|Bogota]] and [[Bergenfield, New Jersey|Bergenfield]]. Other eruvin in Bergen County are in [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey|Fair Lawn]] and in [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]].&lt;ref name="prepare"&gt;{{cite news |title = Jewish group prepares for legal fight over religious boundary |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/07/27/jewish-group-prepares-legal-fight-over-religious-boundary/512083001/ |accessdate = February 7, 2018 |date = July 27, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |last2 = Burrow |first2 = Megan |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910121250/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/07/27/jewish-group-prepares-legal-fight-over-religious-boundary/512083001/ |archivedate = September 10, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous instance in which an eruv had been constructed in Bergen County, and had been challenged by local authorities, occurred in [[Tenafly, New Jersey|Tenafly]], in the eastern part of the county. Attempts by municipal authorities to ban eruvin had failed when challenged in the federal courts, and the settlement in 2006 after a six-year battle obliged the borough to pay $325,000 for the eruv association's legal costs.&lt;ref name = "prepare" /&gt; In some cases involving conflict over whether an eruv should be permitted, the municipality has lost and the construction of the eruv allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="three towns"&gt;{{cite news |title = Three North Jersey towns face lawsuits over alleged Orthodox Jewish discrimination |url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/three_north_jersey_towns_face_lawsuits_over_alleged_orthodox_jewish_discrimination.html |accessdate = April 10, 2018 |date = October 29, 2017 |last = Banco |first = Erin |work = NJ.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180213081351/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/three_north_jersey_towns_face_lawsuits_over_alleged_orthodox_jewish_discrimination.html |archivedate = February 13, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and controversy==
[[File:Lechi Mahwah.jpg|thumb|upright|Portion of a lechi attached to a utility pole, Mahwah, New Jersey]]
Orthodox Jews in Rockland County gained a license from [[Orange and Rockland Utilities]] (which serves parts of both Rockland County in New York and Bergen County in New Jersey) to construct an eruv using its utility poles in 2015,&lt;ref name = "Montvale" /&gt; and in March 2017 the company granted permission for the South [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]] Eruv Fund to install lechis, made from white [[PVC]] pipe, on its utility poles in northwestern Bergen County.&lt;ref name="engineer"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah engineer orders Jewish group to take down religious boundary |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/22/mahwah-engineer-orders-jewish-group-take-down-religious-boundary/501336001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 22, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170909173825/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/22/mahwah-engineer-orders-jewish-group-take-down-religious-boundary/501336001/ |archivedate = September 9, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an extension of an existing eruv in Rockland County, and was intended to run through Mahwah, Upper Saddle River and Montvale.&lt;ref name = "construction" /&gt; According to Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz, head of the eruv association, the purpose was to accommodate those living in Rockland County close to the border, near [[New York State Route 59]].&lt;ref name = "prepare" /&gt; The boundaries had to be run through New Jersey due to the lack of a road along the state line.&lt;ref name = "eruv live" /&gt; Mahwah police noted construction being done on utility poles in May and made inquiries. On learning that Orange and Rockland had authorized the work, they provided police protection, for which the department was paid about $2,000 by the eruv fund. The work in Mahwah was complete by June.&lt;ref name="construction"&gt;{{cite news |title = Attorney: Mahwah PD supervised eruv installation |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/attorney-mahwah-pd-supervised-eruv-installation/521157001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 22, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904200615/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/attorney-mahwah-pd-supervised-eruv-installation/521157001/ |archivedate = September 4, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the matter became generally known in mid-July, there was what local reporter Tom Nobile called a "firestorm of opposition" from local residents, with some expressing concerns that the eruv would allow Orthodox communities in Rockland County to expand into New Jersey.&lt;ref name = "construction"/&gt; Groups formed on [[social media]], including one named Mahwah Strong, in opposition to the eruv.&lt;ref name="Mahwah residents"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah residents voice opposition, support for eruv |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/mahwah-residents-voice-opposition-support-eruv/518944001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 28, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170912230307/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/mahwah-residents-voice-opposition-support-eruv/518944001/ |archivedate = September 12, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahwah Strong claimed 3,000 members within days; a founder, Robert Ferguson, stated that his group would act as a check and balance to ensure the township enforced its laws, and noted, "I don't view this as a hostile takeover of the town."&lt;ref name = "200 people"/&gt; Two hundred people gathered in a Mahwah park on July 22 to support the eruv's removal. An online petition to "Protect the Quality of Our Community in Mahwah", initiated by former township council member John Roth, reached 1,200 names before being taken down due to what Roth called inappropriate comments, made by some signers.&lt;ref name="200 people"&gt;{{cite news |title = 200 people meet to support removal of Mahwah eruv |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/07/25/200-people-gather-support-mahwahs-removal-eruv/506836001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 25, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195157/https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/07/25/200-people-gather-support-mahwahs-removal-eruv/506836001/ |archivedate = February 13, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Mahwah Strong lost its [[Facebook]] page following an influx of comments deemed "hateful".&lt;ref name="Facebook page"/&gt;

The borough's agreement was in exchange for an undertaking from the eruv association not to expand the eruv, and the motion for a restraining order was withdrawn.

On June 29, the Mahwah Township Council had passed an ordinance, effective July 27, barring nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks. Residents had complained that out-of-staters were flooding Mahwah's parks, sometimes by the busload. After the ordinance passed, but before it went into effect, Mahwah police chief James Batelli received many phone calls from residents asking that it be enforced against Orthodox Jews. He contacted the Bergen County Prosecutor, [[Gurbir Grewal]], for advice. On July 27, the date the ordinance was to go into effect, Grewal issued a directive ordering Mahwah police to disregard the ban, stating that the ban could lead to racial profiling, unlawful searches and seizures and the illegal targeting of Orthodox Jews.&lt;ref name="nj parks"&gt;{{cite news |title = Prosecutor: Mahwah park ban could illegally target Jews |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/prosecutor-mahwah-park-ban-could-illegally-target-jews/517984001/ |first = Svetlana |last = Shkolnikova |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 28, 2017 |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170913021311/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/prosecutor-mahwah-park-ban-could-illegally-target-jews/517984001/ |archivedate = September 13, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Rob Hermansen, president of the township council, stated that that body would rework the ordinance to continue putting Mahwah residents first.&lt;ref name="prosecutor"&gt;{{cite news |title = Prosecutor tells NJ police to ignore rule that may target Jews |url = http://pix11.com/2017/07/28/prosecutor-tells-nj-police-to-ignore-rule-that-may-target-jews/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 28, 2017 |publisher = WPIX-TV |agency = Associated Press |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171223075638/http://pix11.com/2017/07/28/prosecutor-tells-nj-police-to-ignore-rule-that-may-target-jews/ |archivedate = December 23, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Mahwah Township Council met on the evening of July 27, it did so before an overflow crowd. Despite warnings from the township attorney not to discuss issues of religion, some did. Others complained of nonresidents crowding parks, and that they had been visited by people wanting to buy their homes. The lawyer for Mahwah Strong urged the council to enforce the law by requiring the takedown of the eruv.&lt;ref name="Mahwah residents"/&gt; Ferguson was quoted as saying at the meeting, "We do not not want these people living in our neighborhoods. We want them following the law."&lt;ref name = "have a talk" /&gt;

As the eruv controversy intensified, Mahwah and Montvale, as well as neighboring boroughs, enacted or made stricter ordinances restricting those making unsolicited offers to buy houses from knocking on doors. Municipal officials stated that this was being done because of the concerns of residents, who feared the Orthodox moving in would result in a population explosion, that the schools would suffer, and high-density housing built. Residents cited [[Lakewood, New Jersey|Lakewood]] in [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]] as an example of such problems.&lt;ref name="bergen"&gt;{{cite news |title = As eruv heads south, Bergen County on alert |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/08/04/eruv-heads-south-bergen-county-alert/539837001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = August 4, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170913021251/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/08/04/eruv-heads-south-bergen-county-alert/539837001/ |archivedate = September 13, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To a standing ovation from some 200 residents in attendance, the Mahwah council on August 10 unanimously voted to issue [[summons]]es because the eruv had not been taken down. Mayor Laforet, though, urged the council not to take this step, pointing to the large expense the unsuccessful eruv litigation had cost Tenafly, and advocated negotiation. In response to the council's action, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association (of which the South Monsey group is a part) and several Orthodox Jews resident in Rockland County filed suit in federal court against Mahwah on August 11, and promised to defy any summonses.&lt;ref name="need to know"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2017/08/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_the_eruv_dispute.html |title = Here's what you need to know about the eruv dispute brewing in North Jersey |accessdate = February 11, 2018 |date = August 11, 2017 |last = Jerde |first = Sara |work = NJ.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170914185253/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2017/08/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_the_eruv_dispute.html |archivedate = September 14, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "mahwah lawsuit"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/09/15/n-y-group-sues-expand-eruv-upper-saddle-river/670790001/ |title = Orthodox Jewish group sues Mahwah over plan to issue eruv summonses |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = August 11, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |first2 = Svetlana |last2 = Shkolnikova |work = NorthJersey.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of Teaneck and [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], each in southeastern Bergen County and home to large communities of Orthodox Jews, had gone to Mahwah and Upper Saddle River to make known their views at council meetings.

Citizens for a Better Upper Saddle River posted a screenshot of the Teaneck council schedule online, urging members to mark their calendars with the dates. Council member Mark Schwartz of Teaneck stated that visitors would be welcome, and could view how a diverse community functioned. Michael Cohen of the Englewood council stated, "We have repeatedly attempted to communicate to the leadership of Upper Saddle River and Mahwah why it is that the rhetoric and actions being seen and taken by certain members of their governing bodies and by certain members of their communities are being viewed by the outside world as anti-Semitic.

==Litigation==
Following failed settlement negotiations and a closed-door council meeting on October 10, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association and individual plaintiffs sued Montvale on October 18, alleging that Mayor Ghassali's stop work order inhibited them in practicing their religion. They cited a 2015 statement from then-mayor Roger Fyfe, from when rumors of an eruv had first circulated, that an eruv was a simple accommodation and a matter in which the borough had only a slight part. The plaintiffs also alleged that Mahwah and Upper Saddle River were aware of the eruv construction, but had no problem with it until they gave in to a campaign of xenophobia and anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="Montvale"&gt;{{cite news |title = Montvale sued for blocking eruv expansion |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/10/20/montvale-sued-blocking-eruv-expansion/781025001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = October 20, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171020223732/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/10/20/montvale-sued-blocking-eruv-expansion/781025001/ |archivedate = October 20, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Democratic candidate for governor, [[Phil Murphy]], accused the residents of Mahwah of causing an "overarching perception of anti-Semitism and discrimination".&lt;ref name = "Murphy" /&gt; According to Murphy, "When a Holocaust survivor at a public meeting is heckled, and then denounced as a fraud, there is a problem. When well-intentioned residents are disparaged as 'paid actors' for a 'Jewish money conspiracy scheme' there is a problem."&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite news |title = Murphy slams 'anti-Semitic' rhetoric around Mahwah eruv |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/10/20/murphy-slams-anti-semitic-rhetoric-around-mahwah-eruv/786169001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = October 20, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171023235938/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/10/20/murphy-slams-anti-semitic-rhetoric-around-mahwah-eruv/786169001/ |archivedate = October 23, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, the [[Attorney General of New Jersey]], [[Christopher Porrino]], sued Mahwah and its council, alleging that by voting for the parks ban and for the summonses, they had violated the constitutional rights of Orthodox Jews. The case, filed in [[New Jersey Superior Court|state court]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], sought nullification of the council's actions, statutory penalties, attorney's fees, and the return of $3.5 million in state-provided Green Acres funds with which Mahwah had purchased and maintained parks. Under the Green Acres program, parks benefitting from the funds may not discriminate, including on the basis of religion or residency. Porrino stated, "To think that there are local governments here in New Jersey, in 2017, making laws on the basis of some archaic, fear-driven and discriminatory mindset, is deeply disappointing and shocking to many, but it is exactly what we are alleging in this case. Of course, in this case we allege the target of the small-minded bias is not African-Americans, but Orthodox Jews. Nonetheless, the hateful message is the same."&lt;ref name="press release"&gt;{{cite press release |title = Attorney General Porrino announces state lawsuit charging Mahwah Township Council with excluding Orthodox Jews |publisher = Attorney General of New Jersey |date = October 24, 2017 |url = http://nj.gov/oag/newsreleases17/pr20171024a.html |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171026042437/http://nj.gov/oag/newsreleases17/pr20171024a.html |archivedate = October 26, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Laforet accused Council President Hermansen of fear-mongering and stoking passions, "His disgraceful behavior is now worsened by the severe potential financial penalties facing the township's taxpayer."&lt;ref name="second suit"&gt;{{cite news |title = New Jersey sues Mahwah over eruv, alleging discriminatory ordinance against Orthodox Jews |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2017/10/24/nj-sues-mahwah-alleging-discriminatory-ordinance-against-orthodox-jews-over-eruv/792345001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = October 24, 2017 |last = Racioppi |first = Dustin |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180208133940/https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2017/10/24/nj-sues-mahwah-alleging-discriminatory-ordinance-against-orthodox-jews-over-eruv/792345001/ |archivedate = February 8, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the municipal election on November 7, Mahwah voters easily re-elected two anti-eruv council members, defeating challengers supported by Laforet.&lt;ref name="patch"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mayor Laforet says election results have no bearing on him |url = https://patch.com/new-jersey/mahwah/mayor-laforet-says-election-results-have-no-bearing-him |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = November 9, 2017 |last = Hubbard |first = Daniel |work = Mahwah Patch |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180212083150/https://patch.com/new-jersey/mahwah/mayor-laforet-says-election-results-have-no-bearing-him |archivedate = February 12, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was removed from state to federal court by Mahwah on November 22 as it raised questions under [[United States Constitution|the federal constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format = PDF |title = Letter from Eric L.

In the Upper Saddle River case, on October 10, 2017, the eruv association moved for a  [[preliminary injunction]] allowing the eruv to remain pending the outcome of the litigation. In support, the association provided documentation showing that Mayor Minichetti had told the borough council about the proposed eruv in 2015, and the new sign ordinance had rapidly followed.&lt;ref name = "preliminary injunction"&gt;{{cite web |title = Notice of Motion for Preliminary Injunction |url = http://www.eruvlitigation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/17cv5512_25.pdf |format = PDF |date = October 10, 2017 |accessdate = April 10, 2018 |author = Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP |via = EruvLitigation.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the motion, filed on November 2, Upper Saddle River stated that the sign law was tightened because of a divisive municipal election in 2014, that had seen many signs. The borough argued that the lawsuit was premature, as the eruv association had not sought permission. It argued that it had not violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs; its sign ordinance was content-neutral, banning all signs of whatever sort, and thus the plaintiffs had not been discriminated against. It alleged that permission to erect the lechis from Orange and Rockland was insufficient; the eruv association also had to comply with local law, and in any event the communications company [[Verizon]] had joint use of the poles and had not been asked for consent. Upper Saddle River distinguished its situation from that of Tenafly, stating that in Tenafly, exceptions had been made to the sign ordinance, but in Upper Saddle River it had been strictly enforced.&lt;ref name="usr brief"&gt;{{cite web |title = Defendant Borough of Upper Saddle River's Memorandum of Law |url = https://www.usrtoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FILED-Brief-Doc-29.pdf |format = PDF |pages = 3–5 |publisher = Borough of Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = November 2, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011458/https://www.usrtoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FILED-Brief-Doc-29.pdf |archivedate = March 19, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of December, Montvale Mayor Ghassali indicated that his borough was negotiating with the plaintiffs, seeking to reach an amicable settlement of the federal lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Montvale negotiations"&gt;{{cite news |title = Montvale working to settle eruv lawsuit |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/12/28/montvale-working-settle-eruv-lawsuit/985488001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = December 28, 2017 |last = Nolan |first = Sarah |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180104100021/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/12/28/montvale-working-settle-eruv-lawsuit/985488001/ |archivedate = January 4, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlements==
Murphy was elected governor in November and designated Bergen County Prosecutor Grewal as the new Attorney General. Thus, once they took office, opponents of Mahwah's position would hold powerful posts in the state capital of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], and municipal officials began to have second thoughts about whether to fight the eruv.&lt;ref name="Mahwah change"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah changes its mind |url = http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-changes-its-mind/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = December 21, 2017 |last = Yudelson |first = Larry |work = The Jewish Standard |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180212085109/http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-changes-its-mind/ |archivedate = February 12, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, 2017, following the advice of legal counsel, the Mahwah council repealed the still-unenforced ban on out-of-state park users, and abandoned an attempt to amend the sign ordinance to bar "other matter" (the lechis) from being affixed to utility poles.&lt;ref name = "Mahwah walk back" /&gt; The "other matter" language would have imitated the 2015 changes to the Upper Saddle River sign law which had followed Minichetti informing the borough council about the plans for the eruv, and was withdrawn, according to Hermansen, lest Mahwah's motives be misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="usr discrimination"&gt;{{cite news |title = Upper Saddle River sign ordinance targeted eruv, Orthodox Jewish group alleges |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/12/06/upper-saddle-river-sign-ordinance-targeted-eruv-orthodox-jewish-group-alleges/925507001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = December 6, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171206125835/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/12/06/upper-saddle-river-sign-ordinance-targeted-eruv-orthodox-jewish-group-alleges/925507001/ |archivedate = December 6, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote to repeal the park ban was unanimous, with one council member absent. After the vote, Laforet called the ordinances "ill-advised" before being silenced by the council. He resumed outside the council chamber and disclosed that the members could have faced prosecution. "They are hiding from you that if they failed to do so, the Attorney General can come into Mahwah to press civil or criminal bias charges.

The Upper Saddle River lawsuit was scheduled for argument before Judge [[John Michael Vazquez]] of the federal court for New Jersey. When he convened that hearing on January 9, 2018, rather than hear the lawyers argue the positions set forth in the legal briefs, Judge Vazquez told them his views. He questioned whether the borough had consistently enforced the ordinance, as plaintiffs' lawyers had discovered a number of signs and even mailboxes attached to utility poles, that Upper Saddle River had not taken down. The judge voiced his skepticism that the 2015 sign ordinance had been passed because of a contentious municipal election the previous year, as the borough maintained, and indicated that he was inclined to believe it was passed because of the eruv. He urged Upper Saddle River to try to settle the case, and to do so in coordination with the other two municipalities—he was also presiding judge in those cases.&lt;ref name = "January 9 settlement"&gt;{{cite news |title = Judge urges Upper Saddle River to settle eruv litigation |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2018/01/09/upper-saddle-river-urged-settle-eruv-litigation/1018844001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = January 9, 2018 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2018, the Mahwah council voted 5–2 to accept a negotiated settlement of the eruv litigation, despite  some residents who urged the council to fight all the way to the Supreme Court.

Montvale also undertook negotiations with the eruv association plaintiffs.

Yehudah Buchweitz, an attorney for the eruv association, stated: "Our lawsuit against Montvale was filed to permit an eruv in a small portion of Montvale, so families could enjoy the same religious freedom as so many others throughout Bergen and Rockland counties and beyond.

{{italic title}}
'''''Amor fati''''' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "love of fate") is a [[Latin]] phrase that may be translated as "love of fate" or "love of one's fate".  It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including [[suffering]] and [[grief|loss]], as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, ''amor fati'' is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.&lt;ref name="ds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amor Fati: The Formula for Human Greatness|url=https://dailystoic.com/amor-fati-love-of-fate/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This acceptance does not necessarily preclude an attempt at change or improvement, but rather, it can be seen to be along the lines of what [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] apparently means by the concept of "[[Eternal recurrence#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence]]": a sense of contentment with one's life and an acceptance of it, such that one could live exactly the same life, in all its minute details, over and over for all eternity.

==Concept==
The concept of ''amor fati'' has been linked to [[Epictetus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus]]'' Ch. VIII: "Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy."—as quoted in [[Pierre Hadot]] (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dLVyyDE-vQC&amp;redir_esc=y The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius]'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to [[Meditations|the writings]] of [[Marcus Aurelius]],&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' IV.23: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All that is in accord with you is in accord with me, O World! Nothing which occurs at the right time for you comes too soon or too late for me. All that your seasons produce, O Nature, is fruit for me. It is from you that all things come: all things are within you, and all things move toward you." — as quoted in [[Hadot]] (1998), p. 143.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  who did not himself use the words (he wrote in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], not Latin).&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with the Master: Robert Greene on Stoicism|url=https://dailystoic.com/robert-greene-interview/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is used in a few of Nietzsche's writings and is representative of the general outlook on life that he articulates in section 276 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. ''Amor fati'': let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. ''Looking away'' shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is important to note that Nietzsche in this context refers to the "Yes-sayer", not in a political or social sense, but as a person who is capable of uncompromising acceptance of reality ''per se''.

Quotation from "Why I Am So Clever" in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', section 10:&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Writings of Nietzsche''. trans. and ed. by Walter Kaufmann (1967), p. 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for greatness in a human being is ''amor fati'': that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity.  Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it&amp;mdash;all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary&amp;mdash;but ''love'' it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, Nietzsche's spirit of acceptance occurs in the context of his radical embrace of suffering.  For to love that which is necessary, demands not only that we love the bad along with the good, but that we view the two as inextricably linked.  In section 3 of the preface of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', he writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Leiter|first=Brian|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit….I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’; but I know that it makes us more profound.    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15840">'''Behavioral momentum''' is a theory in [[quantitative analysis of behavior]] and is a behavioral [[metaphor]] based on physical [[momentum]]. It describes the general relation between resistance to change (persistence of behavior) and the [[rate of reinforcement]] obtained in a given situation.

[[B.F. Skinner]] (1938) proposed that all behavior is based on a fundamental unit of behavior called the discriminated operant. The discriminated operant, also known as the three-term contingency, has three components: an antecedent discriminative stimulus, a response, and a reinforcing or punishing consequence. The organism responds in the presence of the [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] because past responses in the presence of that stimulus have produced reinforcement. 

==Resistance to change==
According to behavioral momentum theory, there are two separable factors that independently govern the rate with which a discriminated operant occurs and the persistence of that response in the face of disruptions such as punishment, extinction, or the differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors. (see [[John Anthony Nevin|Nevin]] &amp; Grace, 2000, for a review). First, the positive contingency between the response and a reinforcing consequence controls response rates (i.e., a response–reinforcer relation) by shaping a particular pattern of responding. This is governed by the relative law of effect (i.e., the [[matching law]]; [[Richard Herrnstein|Herrnstein]], 1970). Secondly, the [[Pavlovian]] relation between surrounding, or context, stimuli and the rate or magnitude (but not both) of reinforcement obtained in the context (i.e., a stimulus–reinforcer relation) governs the resistance of the behavior to operations such as extinction. Resistance to change is assessed by measuring responding during operations such as extinction or satiation that tend to disrupt the behavior and comparing these measurements to stable, pre-disruption response rates. 

Resistance to disruption has been considered a better measure of response strength than a simple measure of response rate.(Nevin, 1974). This is because variations in reinforcement contingencies such as differential-reinforcement-of-high- or low-response-rate schedules can yield highly variable response rates even though overall reinforcement rates are equal. Thus it is questionable whether these differences in response rates indicate differences in the underlying strength of a response (see Morse, 1966, for a discussion).

According to behavioral momentum theory, the relation between response rate and resistance to change is analogous to the relation between [[velocity]] and [[mass]] of a moving object, according to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[second law of motion]] (Nevin, Mandell &amp; Atak, 1983). Newton's second law states that the change in velocity of an object when a force is applied is directly related to that force and inversely related to the object's mass. Similarly, behavioral momentum theory states that the change in response rate under conditions of disruption (''Bx'') relative to baseline response rate (''Bo'') is directly related to the force or magnitude of disruption (''f'') and inversely related to the rate of reinforcement in a stimulus context (''r''):
:&lt;math&gt;\log{\left({Bx\over Bo}\right)}\ = \ -\left({f\over r^b}\right)&lt;/math&gt;{{spaces|8}}(1)

The free parameter ''b'' indicates the sensitivity of resistance to change to the rate of reinforcement in the stimulus context (i.e., the stimulus–reinforcer relation). Resistance to disruption typically is assessed when two distinctive discriminative stimulus contexts alternate and signal different schedules of reinforcement (i.e., a multiple schedule). Equation 1 can be rewritten to account for resistance to change across two stimulus contexts (Nevin, 1992; Nevin, Grace, &amp; McLean, 2001) when a disrupter is uniformly applied across contexts (i.e., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;{ {\log(Bx_1/Bo_1)} \over{\log(Bx_2/Bo_2)} }\ = \ \left({r_2\over r_1}\right)^a&lt;/math&gt;{{spaces|7}}(2)

The subscripts indicate the different stimulus contexts. Thus, Equation 2 states that relative resistance to change is a power function of the relative rate of reinforcement across stimulus contexts, with the ''a'' parameter indicating sensitivity to relative reinforcement rate. Consistent with behavioral momentum theory, resistance to disruption often has been found to be greater in stimulus contexts that signal higher rates or magnitudes of reinforcement (see Nevin, 1992, for a review). Studies that add response-independent (i.e., free) reinforcement to one stimulus context strongly support the theory that changes in response strength are determined by stimulus–reinforcer relations and are independent of response–reinforcer relations. For instance, Nevin, Tota, Torquato, and Shull (1990) had pigeons pecking lighted disks on separate variable-interval 60-s schedules of intermittent food reinforcement across two components of a multiple schedule. Additional free reinforcers were presented every 15 or 30 s on average when the disk was red, but not when the disk was green. Thus, the response–reinforcer relation was degraded when the disk was red because each reinforcer was not immediately preceded by a response. Consistent with the matching law, response rates were lower in the red context than in the green context. However, the stimulus–reinforcer relation was enhanced in the red context because the overall rate of food presentation was greater. Consistent with behavioral momentum theory, resistance to presession feeding (satiation) and discontinuing reinforcement in both contexts (extinction) was greater in the red context. Similar results have been found when reinforcers are added to a context by reinforcing an alternative response.

The findings of Nevin et al. (1990) have been extended across a number of procedures and species including goldfish (Igaki &amp; Sakagami, 2004), rats (Harper, 1999a, 1999b; Shull, Gaynor &amp; Grimes, 2001), pigeons (Podlesnik &amp; Shahan, 2008), and humans (Ahearn, Clark, Gardenier, Chung &amp; Dube, 2003; Cohen, 1996; Mace et al., 1990). The behavioral momentum framework also has been used to account for the partial-reinforcement extinction effect (Nevin &amp; Grace, 1999), to assess the persistence of drug-maintained behavior (Jimenez-Gomez &amp; Shahan, 2007; Shahan &amp; Burke, 2004), to increase task compliance (e.g., Belfiore, Lee, Scheeler &amp; Klein, 2002), and to understand the effects of social policies on global problems (Nevin, 2005).

Although behavioral momentum theory is a powerful framework for understanding how a context of reinforcement can affect the persistence of discriminated operant behavior, there are a number of findings that are inconsistent with the theory (see Nevin &amp; Grace, 2000, and accompanying commentary). For instance, with equal reinforcement rates across stimulus contexts, resistance to change has been shown to be affected by manipulations to response–reinforcer relations, including schedules that produce different baseline response rates (e.g., Lattal, 1989; Nevin, Grace, Holland &amp; McLean), delays to reinforcement (e.g., Bell, 1999; Grace, Schwendimann &amp; Nevin, 1998; Podlesnik, Jimenez-Gomez, Ward &amp; Shahan, 2006; Podlesnik &amp; Shahan, 2008), and by providing brief stimuli that accompany reinforcement (Reed &amp; Doughty, 2005). Also, it is unclear what factors affect relative resistance to change of responding maintained by conditioned reinforcement (Shahan &amp; Podlesnik, 2005) or two concurrently available responses when different rates of reinforcement are arranged within the same context for those responses (e.g., Bell &amp; Williams, 2002).

==Preference and resistance to change==
As resistance to disruption across stimulus contexts is analogous to the inertial mass of a moving object, behavioral momentum theory also suggests that preference in concurrent-chains procedures for one stimulus context over another is analogous to the gravitational attraction of two bodies (see Nevin &amp; Grace, 2000). In concurrent-chains procedures, responding on the concurrently available initial links provides access to one of two mutually exclusive stimulus contexts called terminal links. As with multiple schedules, independent schedules of reinforcement can function in each terminal-link context. The relative allocation of responding across the two initial links indicates the extent to which an organism prefers one terminal-link context over the other. Moreover, behavioral momentum theory posits that preference provides a measure of the relative conditioned-reinforcing value of the two terminal-link contexts, as described by the contextual-choice model (Grace, 1994).

Grace and Nevin (1997) assessed both relative resistance to change in a multiple schedule and preference in a concurrent-chains procedure with pigeons pecking lighted disks for food reinforcement. When the relative rate of reinforcement was manipulated identically and simultaneously across stimulus contexts in the multiple schedule and concurrent-chains procedure, both relative resistance to change and preference was greater with richer contexts of reinforcement. When all the extant resistance to change and preference data were summarized by Grace, Bedell, and Nevin (2002), they found that those measures were related by a structural relation slope of 0.29. Therefore, relative resistance to change and preference both have been conceptualized as expressions of an underlying construct termed response strength, conditioned reinforcement value, or more generally, behavioral mass of discriminated operant behavior (see Nevin &amp; Grace, 2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7905">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[category theory]], the '''category of sets''', denoted as '''Set''', is the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] whose [[Category theory|objects]] are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  The arrows or [[morphism]]s between sets ''A'' and ''B'' are the [[total function]]s from ''A'' to ''B'', and the composition of morphisms is the [[Function composition|composition of functions]].

Many other categories (such as the [[category of groups]], with [[group homomorphisms]] as arrows) add structure to the objects of the category of sets and/or restrict the arrows to functions of a particular kind.

==Properties of the category of sets==
The axioms of a category are satisfied by '''Set''' because composition of functions is [[Associative property|associative]], and because every set ''X'' has an [[identity function]] ''id&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; : X → X'' which serves as identity element for function composition.

The [[epimorphism]]s in '''Set''' are the [[surjective]] maps, the [[monomorphism]]s are the [[injective]] maps, and the [[isomorphism]]s are the [[bijective]] maps.

The [[empty set]] serves as the [[initial object]] in '''Set''' with [[empty function]]s as morphisms.  Every [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] is a [[terminal object]], with the functions mapping all elements of the source sets to the single target element as morphisms. There are thus no [[zero object]]s in '''Set'''. 

The category '''Set''' is [[complete category|complete and co-complete]]. The [[product (category theory)|product]] in this category is given by the [[cartesian product]] of sets. The [[coproduct (category theory)|coproduct]] is given by the [[disjoint union]]: given sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''i'' ranges over some index set ''I'', we construct the coproduct as the union of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;×{''i''} (the cartesian product with ''i'' serves to ensure that all the components stay disjoint).

'''Set''' is the prototype of a [[concrete category]]; other categories are concrete if they are "built on" '''Set''' in some well-defined way.

Every two-element set serves as a [[subobject classifier]] in '''Set'''. The power object of a set ''A'' is given by its [[power set]], and the [[exponential object]] of the sets ''A'' and ''B'' is given by the set of all functions from ''A'' to ''B''. '''Set''' is thus a [[topos]] (and in particular [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] and [[Regular_category#Exact_%28effective%29_categories|exact in the sense of Barr]]).

'''Set''' is not [[abelian category|abelian]], [[additive category|additive]] nor [[preadditive category|preadditive]].

Every non-empty set is an [[injective object]] in '''Set'''. Every set is a [[projective module|projective object]] in '''Set''' (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]).

The [[Accessible category|finitely presentable objects]] in '''Set''' are the finite sets. Since every set is a [[direct limit]] of its finite subsets, the category '''Set''' is a [[Accessible category|locally finitely presentable category]].

If ''C'' is an arbitrary category, the [[Contravariant functor|contravariant functors]] from ''C'' to '''Set''' are often an important object of study. If ''A'' is an object of ''C'', then the functor from ''C'' to '''Set''' that sends ''X'' to Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''A'') (the set of morphisms in ''C'' from ''X'' to ''A'') is an example of such a functor. If ''C'' is a small category (i.e. the collection of its objects forms a set), then the contravariant functors from ''C'' to '''Set''', together with natural transformations as morphisms, form a new category, a [[functor category]] known as the category of [[presheaves]] on ''C''.

==Foundations for the category of sets==

In [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] the collection of all sets is not a set; this follows from the [[axiom of foundation]]. One refers to collections that are not sets as [[proper class]]es. One cannot handle proper classes as one handles sets; in particular, one cannot write that those proper classes belong to a collection (either a set or a proper class). This is a problem: it means that the category of sets cannot be formalized straightforwardly in this setting. Categories like '''Set''' whose collection of objects forms a proper class are known as [[Large category|large categories]], to distinguish them from the small categories whose objects form a set. 

One way to resolve the problem is to work in a system that gives formal status to proper classes, such as [[NBG set theory]]. In this setting, categories formed from sets are said to be ''small'' and those (like '''Set''') that are formed from proper classes are said to be ''large''.

Another solution is to assume the existence of [[Grothendieck universe]]s. Roughly speaking, a Grothendieck universe is a set which is itself a model of ZF(C) (for instance if a set belongs to a universe, its elements and its powerset will belong to the universe).  The existence of Grothendieck universes (other than the empty set and the set &lt;math&gt;V_\omega&lt;/math&gt; of all [[hereditarily finite set]]s) is not implied by the usual ZF axioms; it is an additional, independent axiom, roughly equivalent to the existence of [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]]s. Assuming this extra axiom, one can limit the objects of '''Set''' to the elements of a particular universe. (There is no "set of all sets" within the model, but one can still reason about the class ''U'' of all inner sets, i.e., elements of ''U''.)

In one variation of this scheme, the class of sets is the union of the entire tower of Grothendieck universes. (This is necessarily a [[proper class]], but each Grothendieck universe is a set because it is an element of some larger Grothendieck universe.) However, one does not work directly with the "category of all sets". Instead, theorems are expressed in terms of the category '''Set'''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; whose objects are the elements of a sufficiently large Grothendieck universe ''U'', and are then shown not to depend on the particular choice of ''U''. As a foundation for [[category theory]], this approach is well matched to a system like [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]] in which one cannot reason directly about proper classes; its principal disadvantage is that a theorem can be true of all '''Set'''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; but not of '''Set'''.

Various other solutions, and variations on the above, have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Lane 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feferman 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blass 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The same issues arise with other concrete categories, such as the [[category of groups]] or the [[category of topological spaces]].

'''Charles Dixon''' (1858-17 June 1926) was an [[English people|English]] [[ornithology|ornithologist]], born in [[London]].  He discovered the [[St Kilda wren]] and a new species in North Africa.  He collaborated with [[Henry Seebohm]] on his great work on ''British Birds'', in the second volume of which he summarized and modified [[Alfred Russel Wallace|A. R. Wallace's]] theory of the relation between nests and coloration of birds. Elliott Coues wrote in the preface to the American edition of Dixon's book "Rural bird life" pointing out the originality of the observations made from the field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |place=Boston|title=Rural bird life |author=Dixon, Charles| publisher=Estes and Lauriat| year=1880|url=https://archive.org/stream/ruralbirdlifebei00dixo#page/n13/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julian Huxley]] noted Dixon for recognizing the value of prismatic binoculars for bird study. In his later years, he wrote in the newspapers on agricultural fairs and horse shows. 

==Biography==

Little is known of Dixon's early life. Dixon's early studies on ornithology were followed by numerous books. He did not believe in the role of [[natural selection]] in evolution and in his ''Evolution without Natural Selection'' (1885) he used examples of adaptations that were apparently of little survival value to illustrate his position. Reviewers were quick to point out that natural selection essentially works on adaptations that do have a survival value. He also argued that Darwin was mistaken to conclude that ornate male plumages evolved due to female selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature |volume=33|page=100|date=3 December 1885|doi=10.1038/033100a0| title=[Letters to the editor] “Evolution without Natural Selection”|author=Dixon, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/29th-january-1898/8/curiosities-of-bird-life-by-charles-dixon-george-r|newspaper=The Spectator|date=29 January 1898|page=8|title=Curiosities of Bird Life. By Charles Dixon.|author=Anon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dixon made a special study of [[bird migration]] &amp;mdash; especially in his 1892 book ''The Migration of Birds'' (new edition, 1897), an ingenious theoretical work &amp;mdash; and of geographical distribution of birds. Dixon changed his ideas drastically between the two editions of his book on migration. In the 1892 edition he supported the idea that birds moved out of unfavourable environmental conditions but in the 1897 edition he suggested that migration is essentially derived from dispersal and range extension of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Journal of Biogeography| year=2008| volume=35| pages=1951–1959| author1=Bruderer, Bruno| author2=Salewski, Volker| title=Evolution of bird migration in a biogeographical context| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01992.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that glaciation in former times could not have induced migration on its own and that southward migration was because of a former mass of tropical land that stretched around the equator. Reviewers did not think of his theories as being well-founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: Dixon's Migration of Birds |author=Allen, J.A.| journal=Auk| volume=15| issue=1| year=1898| pages=67–70|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v015n01/p0067-p0070.pdf| doi=10.2307/4068450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Huxley recognized him for noting the potential of prismatic binoculars to unravel the life of living birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v033n02/p0142-p0161.pdf|pages=142–161|author=Huxley, Julian|volume=33| issue=2|journal=The Auk|year=1916|title=Bird-watching and biological science|doi=10.2307/4072162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published behavioural observations on birds and often incorporated these in his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Towering of Wounded Birds| author=Dixon, Charles| journal=Nature| volume=17| issue=420| page=45| year=1877| doi=10.1038/017045b0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized the threats to birds posed by human activity and was an early conservationist. He was quite opposed to the ideas of [[Acclimatisation society|acclimatisation]] and recognized the problem of introduction of species into Australia and New Zealand and their effects, especially on flightless birds.&lt;ref&gt;Lost and Vanishing Birds. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed his conservation ethic thus:&lt;ref&gt;Lost and Vanishing Birds. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolutionary psychology]], the '''Cinderella effect''' is the phenomenon of higher incidence of different forms of child-abuse and mistreatment by [[Stepfamily|stepparents]] than by biological parents. It takes its name from the [[fairy tale]] character [[Cinderella]]. Evolutionary psychologists describe the effect as a byproduct of a bias towards kin, and a conflict between reproductive partners of investing in young that are unrelated to one partner. There is both supporting evidence for this theory and criticism against it.

==Background==
In the early 1970s, a theory arose on the connection between stepparents and [[child maltreatment]].  "In 1973, forensic psychiatrist P. D. Scott summarized information on a sample of "fatal battered-baby cases" perpetrated in anger ... 15 of the 29 killers – 52% – were stepfathers."&lt;ref name=TAC33&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially there was no analysis of this raw data, empirical evidence has since been collected on what is now called the Cinderella effect through official records, reports, and census.

For over 30 years, data has been collected regarding the validity of the Cinderella effect, with a wealth of evidence indicating a direct relationship between step-relationships and abuse. This evidence of [[child abuse]] and [[homicide]] comes from a variety of sources including official reports of child abuse, clinical data, victim reports, and official homicide data.&lt;ref name=DalyWilson2007&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (2007) [http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf Is the "Cinderella Effect" controversial?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516102016/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf |date=May 16, 2011 }} In Crawford &amp; Krebs (Eds) Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 383-400. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have concluded that "stepchildren in [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], and the [[United States]] indeed incur greatly elevated risk of child maltreatment of various sorts, especially lethal beatings".&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daly|first=M.|author2=M. Wilson|title=An assessment of some proposed exceptions to the phenomenon of nepotistic discrimination against stepchildren|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|year=2001|volume=38|pages=287–296|url=ftp://psyftp.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Papers/ZoologicaFennica/daly.pdf}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powerful evidence in support of the Cinderella effect comes from the finding that when abusive parents have both step and genetic children, they generally spare their genetic children. In such families, stepchildren were exclusively targeted 9 out of 10 times in one study and in 19 of 22 in another.&lt;ref name="Crawford2008p387"&gt;Crawford (2008), p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to displaying higher rates of negative behaviors (e.g., abuse) toward stepchildren, stepparents display fewer positive behaviors toward stepchildren than do the genetic parents. For example, on average, stepparents invest less in education, play with stepchildren less, take stepchildren to the doctor less, etc.&lt;ref name="Crawford2008p388"&gt;Crawford (2008), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination against stepchildren is unusual compared with abuse statistics involving the overall population given "the following additional facts: (1) when child abuse is detected, it is often found that ''all'' the children in the home have been victimized; and (2) stepchildren are almost always the eldest children in the home, whereas the general ... tendency in families of uniform parentage is for the youngest to be most frequent victims."&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2001" /&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology theory==
{{See also|Infanticide (zoology)|Kin selection}}

[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] propose that the Cinderella effect is a direct consequence of the [[Evolution|modern evolutionary]] theory of [[inclusive fitness]], especially [[Parental investment|parental investment theory]]. They argue that human child rearing is so prolonged and costly that "a parental psychology shaped by natural selection is unlikely to be indiscriminate".&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = M. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/0162-3095(85)90012-3 | title = Child abuse and other risks of not living with both parents | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 197–210 | year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, "research concerning animal social behaviour provide a rationale for expecting parents to be discriminative in their care and affection, and more specifically, to discriminate in favour of their own young".&lt;ref name=TAC8&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusive fitness theory proposes a selective criterion for the evolution of social traits, where social behavior that is costly to an individual organism can nevertheless emerge when there is a statistical likelihood that significant benefits of that social behavior accrue to (the survival and reproduction of) other organisms whom also carry the social trait (most straightforwardly, accrue to close genetic relatives). Under such conditions, a net overall increase in reproduction of the social trait in future generations can result.

The initial presentation of inclusive fitness theory (in the mid 1960s) focused on making the mathematical case for the possibility of social evolution, but also speculated about possible mechanisms whereby a social trait could effectively achieve this necessary statistical correlation between its likely bearers. Two possibilities were considered: One that a social trait might reliably operate straightforwardly via social context in species where genetic relatives are usually concentrated in a local home area where they were born ('viscous populations'); The other, that genetic detection mechanisms ('supergenes') might emerge that go beyond statistical correlations, and reliably detect ''actual'' genetic relatedness between the social actors using direct 'kin recognition'. The relative place of these two broad types of social mechanisms has been debated (see [[Kin selection]] and [[Kin recognition]]), but many biologists consider 'kin recognition' to be an important possible mechanism. Martin Daly and Margo Wilson follow this second mechanism, and expect that parents "discriminate in favour of their own young", i.e. their ''actual'' genetic relatives.

===Daly and Wilson research===
The most abundant data on stepchild mistreatment has been collected and interpreted by psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson, who study with an emphasis in Neuroscience and Behavior at [[McMaster University]].  Their first measure of the validity of the Cinderella effect was based on data from the [[American Humane Association]] (AHA), an archive of child abuse reports in the United States holding over twenty thousand reports.&lt;ref name=TAC26&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; These records led Wilson and Daly to conclude that "a child under three years of age who lived with one genetic parent and one stepparent in the United States in 1976 was about seven times more likely to become a validated child-abuse case in the records than one who dwelt with two genetic parents".&lt;ref name="TAC27"&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Their overall findings demonstrate that children residing with stepparents have a higher risk of abuse even when other factors are considered.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

====Explanation====
All organisms face [[trade-off]]s as to how to invest their time, energy, risk, and other resources, so investment in one domain (e.g., [[parental investment]]) generally takes away from their ability to invest in other domains (e.g. [[mating|mating effort]], growth, or investment in other offspring).&lt;ref name="Trivers1971"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | doi = 10.1086/406755 | title = The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | pages = 35–57 | year = 1971 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment in non-genetic children therefore reduces an individual's ability to invest in itself or its genetic children, without directly bringing reproductive benefits. Thus, from an [[evolutionary biology]] perspective, one would not expect organisms to regularly and deliberately care for unrelated offspring.

Daly and Wilson point out that [[infanticide]] is an extreme form of biasing parental investment that is widely practiced in the animal world.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = Martin  | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Margo  | year = 1980  | title = Discriminative Parental Solicitude: A Biological Perspective  | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family  | volume = 42  | issue = 2  | pages = 277–288  | publisher = National Council on Family Relations  | jstor = 351225  | doi = 10.2307/351225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when an immigrant male [[lion]] enters a pride, it is not uncommon for him to kill the cubs fathered by other males.&lt;ref name="Bertram1975"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bertram | first1 = B.

E. | doi = 10.1086/284097 | title = Adaptations of Female Lions to Infanticide by Incoming Males | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 121 | issue = 5 | pages = 716 | year = 1983 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations indicate that in the animal world, males employ certain measures in order to ensure that parental investment is geared specifically toward their own offspring.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1980" /&gt;

Unlike the lion, however, humans in a stepparenting situation face a more complicated tradeoff since they cannot completely disown their partner's offspring from a previous relationship, as they would risk losing sexual access to their partner and any chance of producing potential offspring. Thus, according to Daly and Wilson, stepparental investment can be viewed as mating effort to ensure the possibility of future reproduction with the parent of their stepchild.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1996a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = M. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = M. I. | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.ep10772793 | title = Violence Against Stepchildren | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 77–81 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mating effort hypothesis suggests that humans will tend to invest more in their genetic offspring and invest just enough in their stepchildren. It is from this theoretical framework that Daly and Wilson argue that instances of child abuse towards non-biological offspring should be more frequent than towards biological offspring.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1996a" /&gt;

One would therefore expect greater parental responsiveness towards one's own offspring than towards unrelated children, and this will result in more positive outcomes and fewer negative outcomes towards one's own children than towards other children in which one is expected to invest (i.e., stepchildren). "If child abuse is a behavioral response influenced by natural selection, then it is more likely to occur when there are reduced [[inclusive fitness]] payoffs owing to uncertain or low relatedness".&lt;ref name="Burgess1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burgess | first1 = R.

Daly and Wilson report that this parental love can explain why genetic offspring are more immune to lashing out by parents.&lt;ref name="DWHomP.83"&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1988), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that, "Child-specific parental love is the emotional mechanism that permits people to tolerate—even to rejoice in—those long years of expensive, unreciprocated parental investment".&lt;ref name="DWHomP.83" /&gt; They point to a study comparing natural father and stepfather families as support for the notion that stepparents do not view their stepchildren the same as their biological children, and likewise, children do not view their stepparents the same as their biological parents.&lt;ref name="DWBussP.22"&gt;Buss (1996), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perkins1979"&gt;{{Cite journal

Daly and Wilson's reports on the overrepresentation of stepparents in [[child murder|child homicide]] and abuse statistics support the evolutionary principle of maximizing one's inclusive fitness, formalized under [[Kin selection#Hamilton's rule|Hamilton's Rule]], which helps to explain why humans will preferentially invest in close kin.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1988a"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Methods====
In their 1985 Canadian sample, Daly and Wilson classify the frequencies of different living arrangements (two natural parents, one natural parent, one natural parent with one stepparent, or other) according to child age. This was accomplished by administering a randomized telephone survey.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

Records of child abuse from children's aid organizations as well as police reports on runaways and juvenile offenders were then used to determine whether children from stepparental living situations were overrepresented as abuse victims when compared to the demographic data gathered from the telephone survey data. The results indicate that the only living situation that has a significant correlation to increased child abuse is one natural parent and one stepparent in the same household. While rates of running away and crime were comparable for children living with stepparents and children of single-parents, abuse rates for children living with stepparents were much higher.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

Daly and Wilson examined several potentially [[confounding| confounding variables]] in their research, including [[socioeconomic status]], family size, and maternal age at childbirth, however only minor differences between natural-parent and stepparent families with respect to these factors were found, indicating that none of these are major contributing factors to the observed Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{further|Attachment theory}}

Evolutionary psychologists have also suggested that one of the causes of stepchild abuse may be the lack of a parental [[attachment theory|attachment bond]] that the mother would normally form with her own child {{Citation needed |date=February 2016}}. An attachment bond will, in general, be more secure if formed before the age of two, and adoption can often disrupt the development of this bond. An infant who is fed by the primary parental figure, usually the mother, and has the mother present during severely physically painful events will have form a stronger parental attachment bond, and either a consistent omission of the mother from this process or an alteration between two people (the original mother and the adoptive mother) can cause either an insecure attachment or disorganized attachment from the parent to the child {{Citation needed |date=February 2016}}. As a result, it is highly recommended by most psychologists that the adoptive mother be present very early in the infant's life, preferably immediately after its birth, in order to avoid attachment disruptions and attachment disorders.&lt;ref name=Cooper1998&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory cannot be a whole explanation for the Cinderella effect, as psychological research has shown that secure attachment bonds can be developed between a parent and adopted child, and the quality of the relationship between parent and child will more often depend on the child's pre-adoption experiences, such as length of time in social care and previous trauma, more than characteristics of the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Londen |first1=W.

===Misunderstandings===
It is sometimes argued that this evolutionary psychological account does not explain why the majority of stepparents do not abuse their partners' children, or why a significant minority of genetic parents do abuse their own offspring. However, their argument is based on a misunderstanding: the evolutionary psychological account is that (all else equal) parents will love their own children more than other people's children – it does not argue that stepparents will "want" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is absolute proof against abuse. Under this account, stepparental care is seen as "mating effort" towards the genetic parent, such that most interactions between stepparent and stepchildren will be generally positive or at least neutral, just usually not as positive as interactions between the genetic parent and the child would be.&lt;ref name=TAC&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supportive evidence==
Strong support for the Cinderella effect as described by Daly and Wilson comes from a study of unintentional childhood fatal injuries in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Tooley2006"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Tooley | first1 = G.| last2 = Karakis | first2 = M.| last3 = Stokes | first3 = M.| last4 = Ozannesmith | first4 = J.| title = Generalising the Cinderella Effect to unintentional childhood fatalities| journal = Evolution and Human Behavior| volume = 27| pages = 224–230| year = 2006| doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooley et al. follow the argument of Daly and Wilson to extend the Cinderella effect from cases of abuse to incidences of unintentional fatalities. Children are not only vulnerable to abuse by their parents, but they are also dependent on their parents for supervision and protection from a variety of other harms.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadsworth1983"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wadsworth | first1 = J. | last2 = Burnell | first2 = I. | last3 = Taylor | first3 = B. | last4 = Butler | first4 = N. | title = Family type and accidents in preschool children | doi = 10.1136/jech.37.2.100 | journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 100–104 | year = 1983 | pmid =  | pmc = 1052270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that parental supervision is fundamentally correlated to incidences of unintentional childhood injury as shown by Wadsworth et al. and Peterson &amp; Stern, Tooley et al. posit that selective pressures would favor an inclination towards parental vigilance against threats to offspring well-being.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadsworth1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson1997"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooley et al. further argue that parental vigilance is not as highly engaged in stepparents as genetic parents, therefore placing stepchildren at greater risk for unintentional injury.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;

Based on data gathered from the Australia National Coroners' Information System, stepchildren under five years of age are two to fifteen times more likely to experience an unintentional fatal injury, especially drowning, than genetic children.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; Additionally, the study finds that the risks of unintentional fatal injury are not significantly higher for genetic children in single parent homes versus two-parent homes.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; This difference suggests that removing one biological parent from the home does not significantly increase risk to the children, but that adding a nonbiological parent to the home results in a drastic increase in the risk of unintentional fatal injury.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; Despite the fact that adding a stepparent to the home increases the available resources in terms of supervision in comparison to a single-parent home, risk of unintentional fatal injury still significantly rises.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; This higher risk of injury for stepchildren can be attributed to the fact that stepparents occupy the same supervisory role as a genetic parent, yet they have a lower intrinsic commitment to protecting the child and therefore are less likely to be adequately vigilant.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; The authors conclude that the Cinderella effect applies not only to purposeful abuse by stepparents, but is also relevant to explaining increased rates of accidental fatalities among stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;

Furthermore, a study of parental investment behaviors among American men living in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], reveals a trend of increasing financial expenditures on genetic offspring in comparison to step-offspring, which also suggests that parents are less inclined to preserve the well-being of stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = K.

Though the general trend of the data from this study supports the Cinderella effect, Anderson and colleagues note that the observed differences between investment in children and stepchildren might be slightly reduced by a few confounding factors.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999a" /&gt; For example, the authors point out that stepparenting is a [[self-selection bias|self-selective]] process, and that when all else is equal, men who bond with unrelated children are more likely to become stepfathers, a factor that is likely to be a confounding variable in efforts to study the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999a" /&gt; Anderson and colleagues also conducted a similar study of [[xhosa people|Xhosa]] students in [[South Africa]] that analyzes the same four classifications of adult-child relationships, and this study offers similar results to those observed among men in Albuquerque.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999b"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = K.

Additionally, a study of [[Hadza people|Hadza]] foragers in [[Tanzania]] by Marlowe also finds evidence of decreased care provided by men to stepchildren when compared with genetic children.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marlowe | first1 = F. | doi = 10.1007/s002650050592 | title = Male care and mating effort among Hadza foragers | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 46 | pages = 57–64 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author uses the [[Mann-Whitney U| Mann-Whitney U-tests]] to evaluate most of the observed differences in care exhibited towards children and stepchildren, and finds that Hadza men spend less time with (U=96), communicate less with (U=94.5), nurture less, and never play with their stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1999" /&gt; Marlowe further argues that any care that is provided towards stepchildren is likely attributable to the man's mating efforts and not parental interest in the well-being of the stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1999" /&gt;

In further support of the Cinderella effect as elaborated by Daly and Wilson, a study conducted in a rural village in [[Trinidad]] demonstrates that in households containing both genetic children and stepchildren, fathers devote approximately twice as much time to interaction with genetic offspring in comparison to stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flinn | first1 = M.

This includes, for example, spanking, screaming, crying, and arguing. The duration of the relationship between genetic fathers and children shows a positive correlation with both relative proportion of interaction time and antagonistic interaction.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988" /&gt; The author argues that these results show that in terms of time invested, men favor their children over stepchildren, and this preference is not attributable to the duration of the adult-child relationship, a factor which is sometimes believed to be a confounding variable in the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988" /&gt; Though this study does claim a significant increase in antagonistic behavior between stepparents and stepchildren and therefore supports the Cinderella effect, it also notes that only six percent of all the observed parent-child interactions were considered antagonistic, and that the researchers never noticed any blatant physical child abuse.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988" /&gt;

==Criticism==

=== David Buller ===
[[Philosopher of science]] David Buller, as a part of his general critique of evolutionary psychology &lt;ref name="Holcomb2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holcomb|first=H. R.|title=Book Review: Buller does to Evolutionary Psychology what Kitcher did to Sociobiology|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|year=2005|volume=3|pages=392–401|url=http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep03392401.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has reviewed Daly and Wilson's data. He argues that evolutionary psychology (EP) mistakenly attempts to discover human [[psychological adaptation]]s rather than "the evolutionary causes of psychological traits." Buller also argues that Daly and Wilson's 1985 Canadian sample included cases of sexual abuse as well as cases of unintentional omission, such as not buckling a child's seatbelt in the car. Buller asserts that unintentional omission does not fall under the realm of dangerous acts, and rather should be designated "maltreatment". He argues that since sexual abuse is not often accompanied by physical abuse, it is unreasonable to assume that it is motivated by the same kind of psychological mechanism as child homicide. Buller also points out that the conclusion that non-biological parents are more likely to abuse children is contradicted by the fact that even if the rate of abuse among stepparents was disproportionate, most child abuse is in fact committed by biological parents, and that the lowest rate of child abuse is found among adoptive parents.&lt;ref name="Buller2005a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buller | first1 = D.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this study, by Crume et al., when the perpetrator of the murder was a parent, maltreatment was correctly noted on the death certificate only 46 percent of the time. Furthermore, they found that when the perpetrator was an "Other unrelated (including boyfriend)" individual, maltreatment was reported on the death certificate 86 percent of the time, significantly higher than for parents.&lt;ref name="Crume2002" /&gt; Although these statistics seem to provide evidence of bias against stepparents, further review of the data undermines this conclusion. As Crume et al. and Daly and Wilson note, maltreatment was only likely to be reported on the death certificates 47 percent of the time in the case of "Other relatives (including step-parents)," which represents a marginal increase from the amount of parental maltreatment.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2005"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Temrin et al. Sweden study ===
The findings of Daly and Wilson have been called into question by one study of child homicides in [[Sweden]] between 1975 and 1995, which found that children living in households with a non-genetic parent were not at an increased risk of homicide when compared to children living with both genetic parents. The study, published in 2000 and conducted by Temrin and colleagues argued that when Daly and Wilson classified homicides according to family situation, they did not account for the genetic relatedness of the parent who actually committed the crime. In the Swedish sample, in two out of the seven homicides with a genetic and non-genetic parent, the offender was actually the genetic parent and thus these homicides do not support Daly and Wilson's definition of the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="Temrin2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Temrin | first1 = H. | last2 = Buchmayer | first2 = S. | last3 = Enquist | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2000.1094 | title = Step-parents and infanticide: New data contradict evolutionary predictions | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1446 | pages = 943–945 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10853739| pmc = 1690621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daly and Wilson attribute the contrasting findings of the Swedish study to an analytical oversight. Temrin and colleagues neglect to consider the fact that the proportion of children in living situations with a stepparent is not constant for all child age groups, but rather increases with age. After correcting for age differences, the Swedish data set produces results in accordance with the previous findings of Daly and Wilson. The Swedish sample does show, however, decreased risk to children living with a stepparent compared to the North American samples collected by Daly and Wilson, suggesting that there is some degree of cross-cultural variation in the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2001" /&gt;

===Alternative hypotheses===
It has been noted by multiple researchers that child abuse is an intricate issue and is affected by other factors.&lt;ref name="Burgess1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Temrin2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giles-Sims1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giles-Sims | first1 = Jean  | last2 = Finkelhor | first2 = David  | year = 1984  | title = Child Abuse in Stepfamilies  | journal = Family Relations  | volume = 33  | issue = 3  | pages = 407–413  | publisher = National Council on Family Relations  | jstor = 584711  | doi = 10.2307/584711 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daly and Wilson state, however, that even if evolutionary psychology cannot account for every instance of stepparental abuse, this does not invalidate their empirical findings.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2005" /&gt;

Burgess and Drais propose that child maltreatment is too complex to be explained fully by genetic relatedness alone and cite other reasons for child maltreatment, such as social factors, ecological factors and child traits such as disability and age.&lt;ref name="Burgess1999" /&gt; However, they also note that these traits are simply indicative, and do not inevitably lead to child maltreatment.&lt;ref name="Burgess1999" /&gt; Temrin and colleagues also suggest that there may be other factors involved with child homicide, such as prior convictions, drug abuse problems, lost custody battles and mental health problems.&lt;ref name="Temrin2000" /&gt;

In 1984, Giles-Sims and [[David Finkelhor]] categorized and evaluated five possible hypotheses that could explain the Cinderella effect: "social-evolutionary theory", "normative theory", "stress theory", "selection factors", and "resource theory". The social-evolutionary theory is based on the proposal that non-genetically related parents will invest less in costly parental duties, due to the fact that their genes are not being passed on by that individual. The normative theory proposes that, due to genetic repercussions, incest among genetically related individuals is a widespread taboo and would thus be less common among biological relatives. They propose that incest among stepfamilies would be less taboo, since there is no risk of genetic degradation. The stress theory proposes that increased stressors, which are inherently more common among stepfamilies, cause an increased risk of abuse. The selection factors theory proposes that individuals who are likely to be stepparents (divorcees) are likely to be inherently more violent due to emotional disturbances, aggressive impulses, and self-esteem issues. Due to this, stepparents as a group would have a higher proportion of individuals with violent-prone characteristics, which would suggest that the abuse is happening due to personality factors, rather than the stepparental relationship directly. Finally, according to resource theory, individuals who contribute resources are granted authority, while individuals that lack resources are denied authority and more likely to resort to violence to obtain authority. It is therefore hypothesized that stepparents who are able to contribute resources to a family and have those resources be accepted by the family are less likely to be abusive. However, this hypothesis had yet to be tested directly on stepfamilies.&lt;ref name="Giles-Sims1984" /&gt; This paper of Giles-Sims and Finkelhor predates however practically all empirical studies on the Cinderella effect.

===Ethical issues===
Discussing the implications of this line of research, Australian psychologist Greg Tooley, author of a 2006 study confirming the existence of the effect,&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; confessed that "it is certainly difficult to talk about because it is such a hot issue".&lt;ref name=Trounson2008&gt;Andrew Trounson, [http://flwg.com.au/pg/news/view/general_2/children-safer-with Children 'safer with biological parent'], ''[[The Australian]]'', May 07, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clan badge''', sometimes called a '''plant badge''', is a [[badge]] or [[emblem]], usually a sprig of a specific plant, that is used to identify a member of a particular [[Scottish clan]].&lt;ref&gt;Highland Heritage: Scottish Americans in the American South; p.39; By Celeste Ray; Published 2001 UNC Press; {{ISBN|0-8078-4913-8}}; [https://books.google.com/books?id=2pyqgupHqtgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=A+clan+badge++plant&amp;sig=ACfU3U0cz-m0IEssD9Hi3XrqPawRlusuPg see]&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually worn in a [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]&lt;ref&gt;Antiquity; p.42; By Nederlands Instituut te Rome; Published 1949 Antiquity Publications; [https://books.google.com/books?id=OeMzAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=A+clan+badge++plant&amp;dq=A+clan+badge++plant&amp;pgis=1 see]&lt;/ref&gt; behind the [[Scottish crest badge]],&lt;ref&gt;The Clans, Septs, and Regiments of the Scottish Highlands; p.544; By Frank Adam, Thomas Innes of Learney; Published (1965) Johnston &amp; Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; or attached at the shoulder of a lady's tartan sash. According to popular lore clan badges were used by Scottish clans as a means of identification in battle. An authentic example of plants being used in this way (though not by a clan) were the sprigs of [[oats]] used by troops under the command of [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]] during the [[History of Aberdeen|sack of Aberdeen]]. Similar items are known to have been used by military forces in Scotland, like paper, or the "White [[Cockade]]" (a bunch of white ribbon) of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]].&lt;ref name="Campbell-p289–290"/&gt;

==Authenticity==
Despite popular lore, many clan badges attributed to Scottish clans would be completely impractical for use as a means of identification. Many would be unsuitable, even for a modern clan gathering, let alone a raging clan battle. Also, a number of the plants (and flowers) attributed as clan badges are only available during certain times of year. Even though it is maintained that clan badges were used long before the [[Scottish crest badge]]s used today, according to a former [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] the oldest symbols used at gatherings were [[heraldic flag]]s such as the banner, standard and pinsel.&lt;ref name="AdamInnes-p541–543"/&gt;

There is much confusion as to why some clans have been attributed more than one clan badge. Several 19th century writers variously attributed plants to clans, many times contradicting each other. It has been claimed by one writer that if a clan gained new lands it may have also acquired that district's "badge" and used it along with their own clan badge. It is clear however, that there are several large groups of clans which share badges and also share a historical connection. The [[Clan Donald]] group (clans ''[[Clan Macdonald|Macdonald]]'', ''[[Clan Macdonald of Clanranald|Macdonald of Clanranald]]'', ''[[Clan Macdonell of Glengarry|Macdonell of Glengarry]]'', ''[[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch|MacDonald of Keppoch]]'') and clans/[[sept (social)|septs]] which have been associated with Clan Donald (like certain ''MacIntyres'' and the ''Macqueens'' of Skye) all have [[Calluna vulgaris|common heath]] attributed as their badge. Another large group is the [[Clan Chattan]] group (clans ''[[Clan Mackintosh|Mackintosh]]'', ''[[Clan Macpherson|Macpherson]]'', ''[[Clan Macgillivray|Macgillivray]]'', ''[[Clan Macqueen|Macqueen]]'', ''[[Clan Macbain|Macbain]]'', ''[[Clan Farquharson|Farquharson]]'', ''[[Clan Davidson|Davidson]]'') which have been attributed [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|red whortleberry]] (sometimes called [[cranberry]] in Scotland), or [[bearberry]], or [[Boxwood (genus)|boxwood]]. The leaves of these three plants are very similar, and at least one writer has claimed that whatever plant which happened to be available was used. One group, the [[Siol Alpin]] group, of clans are said to have claimed or are thought to share a common descent. The Siol Alpin clans (clans ''[[Clan Grant|Grant]]'', ''[[Clan Gregor|Gregor]]'', ''[[Clan MacAulay|MacAulay]]'', ''[[Clan Macfie|Macfie]]'', ''[[Clan Macnab|Macnab]]'', ''[[Clan Mackinnon|Mackinnon]]'', ''[[Clan Macquarrie|Macquarrie]]'') are all attributed the clan badge of pine (Scots fir). In some cases, clan badges are derived from the heraldry of clan chiefs. For example, the [[Clan Farquharson|Farquharsons]] have [[pine]] attributed as a clan badge of theirs (pine also appears on the uniforms of the [[Invercauld Highlanders]]). Pine was actually used in the Invercauld [[coat of arms|Arms]] as a mark of cadencing to the basic Shaw-Mackintosh Arms.&lt;ref name="AdamInnes-p541–543"/&gt;

|Menzies's heath&lt;ref name="AdamInnes-p541–543"/&gt;
|&lt;small&gt;Probably intended to be blue heath, ''[[Phyllodoce caerulea]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Stace]], ''New Flora of the British Isles'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt; a very rare member of the heather family, Ericaceae, found on several Scottish mountains. Its scientific name has changed since it was first found more than two centuries ago on the Sow of Atholl,&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Nelson, ''The Western Naturalist'' vol. 6 (1977), pp 45-72&lt;/ref&gt; but for much of the 19th century it was called ''Menziesia caerulea''. Hence the reputed association with Clan Menzies. ''Menziesia'' was coined by James Edward Smith in 1793 to honour the Scottish physician and naturalist Dr [[Archibald Menzies]] (1754- 1842) who was attached to Capt. George Vancouver's circumnavigation, 1790-1795. The original ("type") species was ''Menziesia ferruginea'', now named ''[[Rhododendron menziesii]]'', a native of northwestern North America. No plants are now assigned to ''Menziesia'' which has been subsumed into ''[[Rhododendron]]''. The name "Menzies's heath" is unknown in botanical literature.&lt;/small&gt;

A '''closed-ended question''' refers to any question for which a researcher provides research participants with options from which to choose a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-open-ended-and-closed-ended-questions.html|website=''yourdictionary.com''|publisher=yourdictionary.com|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a [[Declarative sentence|statement]] which requires a response.

A closed-ended question contrasts with an [[open-ended question]], which cannot easily be answered with specific information.

Examples of close-ended questions which may elicit a "yes" or "no" response include:
*Were you born in {{CURRENTYEAR}}?
*Is [[Lyon]] the capital of France?
*Did you steal the money?

Similarly, variants of the above close-ended questions which possess specific responses are:
*On what day were you born? ("[[{{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}}]].")
*What is the capital of France? ("Paris.")
*Where did you steal the money? ("From the bank.")

At the same time, there are closed-ended questions which are sometimes impossible to answer correctly with a yes or no without confusion, for example: "Have you stopped taking heroin?" (if you never took it) or "Who told you to take heroin?"; see "[[loaded question]]".

A study by the [[University of Cincinnati]] found 20 to 40 percent of Americans will provide an opinion when they do not have one because of [[social pressure]], using [[Contextual learning|context clues]] to select an answer they believe will please the questioner. A classic example of this phenomenon was the 1947 study of the fictional [[Metallic Metals Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kivitv.com/-/the-bomb-agrabah-survey-shows-how-problematic-polling-can-be |title=The 'Bomb Agrabah' Survey Shows How Problematic Polling Can Be |last=Daniels |first=Eugene |date=18 December 2015 |publisher=[[KIVI-TV]] |access-date= 17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closed-ended questions in education ==
Some in the field of education argue that closed-ended questions are broadly speaking "bad" questions. They are questions that are often asked to obtain a specific answer and are therefore good for testing knowledge. It is often argued that open-ended questions (i.e. questions that elicit more than a yes/no answers) are preferable because they open up discussion and enquiry.

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are "grammatically closed, but conceptually open".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=3 December 2016|title=Ariadne's Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in standard parlance, "is it ever right to lie?" would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes–no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes–no answer to it can be "opened up" by the questioner ("why do you think that?", "Could there be an instance where that's not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry.

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, "gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=19 April 2017|work=Tes|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed questions, simply require "opening up" strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential.

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention "Open Questioning Mindset" (OQM). OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student's contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls "guess what's in my head" teaching, that relies on closed and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=29 November 2015|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{LGBT sidebar}}

'''''Closeted''''' and '''''in the closet''''' are adjectives for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]] etc. ([[LGBTQ+]]) people who have not disclosed their [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] and aspects thereof, including [[sexual orientation identity|sexual identity]] and [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]]. It can also be used to describe anyone who is hiding part of their identity because of social pressure.

==Background==
In late 20th-century America, the closet had become a central metaphor for grasping the history and social dynamics of gay life. The notion of the closet is inseparable from the concept of [[coming out]]. The closet narrative sets up an implicit dualism between being "in" or being "out". Those who are "in" are often stigmatized as living false, unhappy lives.&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, though many people would prefer to be “out” of the closet, there are numerous social, economic, familial, and personal repercussions that lead to them remaining, whether consciously or unconsciously, “in” the closet. The decision to come out or remain in the closet is considered a deeply personal one, and [[outing]] remains controversial in today’s culture.

In the 21st century, the related concept of a "glass closet" emerged in LGBT discourse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet|title=The Glass Closet|date=2008-09-23|website=www.out.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term describes public figures, such as entertainers or politicians, who are out of the closet in their personal lives and do not engage in the tactics (such as entering a [[lavender marriage]] or publicly dating a person of the opposite sex as a "beard") that were historically used by closeted celebrities to disguise their sexual identity, but have not formally disclosed their sexual orientation on the public record — and who, thus, are technically neither fully in the closet nor fully out of it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effects==

In the early stages of the lesbian, gay or bisexual identity development process, people often feel confused and experience turmoil. In 1993, [[Michelangelo Signorile]] wrote ''Queer in America'', in which he explored the harm caused both to a closeted person and to society in general by being closeted.&lt;ref&gt;re-released in 2003 by University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|0-299-19374-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999) argue that "the closet" may be becoming an antiquated metaphor in the lives of modern-day Americans for two reasons.
# Homosexuality is becoming increasingly normalized and the shame and secrecy often associated with it appear to be in decline.
# The metaphor of the closet hinges upon the notion that [[stigma management]] is a way of life. However, stigma management may actually be increasingly done situationally.

The closet, however, is difficult for any [[non-heterosexual]], non-[[cisgender]] identified person to fully come "out" of, whether or not that person desires to do so. Scholar [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], author of the ''[[Epistemology of the Closet]]'', discusses the difficulty with the closet: {{cquote|...the deadly elasticity of heterosexist presumption means that, like Wendy in [[Peter Pan]], people find new walls springing up around them even as they drowse: every encounter with a new classful of students, to say nothing of a new boss, social worker, loan officer, landlord, doctor, erects new closets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sedgwick|first=Eve Kosofsky|title=The Epistemology of the Closet}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recent attention to bullying of LGBTQ youth and teens in the United States gives an indication that many youth and teens remain closeted throughout their educational years and beyond for fear of disapproval from parents, friends, teachers, and community members. To remain in the closet offers an individual a layer of protection against ridicule and bullying.{{cn|date=March 2012}} However to remain in the closet typically takes a toll on the mental health of the individual, especially in the adolescent years as reflected in suicide rates among LGBTQ youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lambda.org/youth_suicide.htm|title=Generation Q Pride Store brought to you by LAMBDA GLBT Community Services|website=www.lambda.org|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
In general, given an ''n''-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the suspension &lt;math&gt;\Sigma{X}&lt;/math&gt; has dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. Thus, the operation of suspension creates a way of moving up in dimension. In the 1950s, to define a way of moving down, mathematicians introduced an inverse operation &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, called desuspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spectra and the Steenrod Algebra|author=H. R. Margolis|url=|publisher=[[North-Holland]]|year=1983|page=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, given an ''n''-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the desuspension &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{-1}{X}&lt;/math&gt; has dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1.

Note that in general &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{-1}\Sigma{X}\ne X&lt;/math&gt;.

==Reasons==
The reasons to introduce desuspension:
#Desuspension makes the category of spaces a [[triangulated category]].
#If arbitrary [[coproduct]]s were allowed, desuspension would result in all [[cohomology]] [[functor]]s being representable.

'''Dhairya Dand''' (born 27 April 1989) is an Indian-born New York City based inventor and artist.

His work investigates the human body as a medium for computation, new materials as a tool to embody interactions and design as a vehicle for mindfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedxhamburg.de/speaker-2015 | title=Dhairya Dand |publisher=TEDxHamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work takes form of devices, objects, installations, new technology and materials.

Currently Dand is a Principal at ODD Industries, a futurist factory and lab in NYC, an artist in residence at the [[New Museum|NEW Museum]] and on the advisory board of the [[X PRIZE Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://safety.xprize.org/about/advisory-board | title=Advisory Board, Women's Safety XPRIZE|publisher=XPRIZE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dand is a core member of the [[W3C]] Standards Committee which governs the Internet at large. He has taught conceptual design based courses at the [[The Art Institute of Seattle|Art Institute of Seattle]], the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Design]], [[Tisch School of the Arts]] and the MIT Design Innovation Workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhairyadand |title=Dhairya Dand LinkedIn Page |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=LinkedIn |access-date=January 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dand is a graduate of the Media, Arts and Sciences program at the [[MIT Media Lab]].

== Early life ==
Dand was born in [[Nashik, India]] to parents who were plumbers and storytellers. Dand attributes his cross-disciplinary work to being trained as a plumber by his father and listening to stories and mythologies from his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/interview-dhairya-dand-moved-by-stories-driven-by-curiosities-2145335 | title=Dhairya Dand: Moved by stories, driven by curiosities |publisher=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/dhairya-dands-journey-from-nashik-to-mit-media-lab-a-dedication-to-hard-work/articleshow/34762675.cms | title=Dhairya Dand's journey from Nashik to MIT Media Lab a dedication to hard work  |publisher=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Victoria Jubilee Technological Institute]] for an undergraduate in Computer Science and the [[Industrial Design Centre]] for courses in design. Dand later lived in Singapore, [[Phnom Penh]], Tokyo, London, [[Kampala]] before moving to the United States to study at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/30-under-30/dhairya-dand-blending-imagination-and-reality/39559/1 | title=Dhairya Dand: Blending imagination and reality |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/interview-dhairya-dand-moved-by-stories-driven-by-curiosities-2145335 | title=Dhairya Dand: Moved by stories, driven by curiosities |publisher=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hDHd6NsZKU

== Works ==

Dand's inventions range from sensorial interfaces, [[smart devices]], [[display technologies]], [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]], [[social systems]], [[prosthesis]], bio-based architecture, [[educational toys]], [[robotics|emotional robots]].

In SuperShoes, Dand created insoles that work on a tickling interface, they tickle the feet and guide the wearer across the city. The insoles talk to the smartphone for location, data and access to the users personality preferences. The insoles help with navigation, reminders, taking mindful breaks, discovering new places in a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3029610/mits-vibrating-supershoes-tell-you-where-to-walk | title= MIT's Vibrating Supershoes Tell You Where To Walk

In Programmable Hair, Dand made a contraption worn on the hair that allows the wearer to program their hairstyle, either by choosing from a library of hairstyles or by taking a picture of someone else's hairstyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uop2Rj6HI2s | title='Love, See, Do.

While in Seattle, Dand was part of [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s secretive Concept Lab, where he is credited for key inventions and [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] devices. Some of his inventions which are public, involve invisible interfaces and using hand gestures to use the air as a medium for computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20170046037.PGNR.| title=Gestures for sharing data between devices in close physical proximity|publisher=USPTO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dand designed a bio-building that responds and reacts to its environment. During the day, cells in the building's 'membranes' open up, allowing for more ventilation; at night, they generate and conserve warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/30-under-30/dhairya-dand-blending-imagination-and-reality/39559/1 | title=Dhairya Dand: Blending imagination and reality |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}

A '''disability''' is an impairment that may be [[Cognitive disability|cognitive]], [[Developmental disability|developmental]], [[Intellectual disability|intellectual]], [[mental disorder#Disability|mental]], [[physical disability|physical]], [[Sense|sensory]], or some combination of these. It substantially affects a person's life activities and may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Journal of Applied Physiology"&gt;[http://jap.physiology.org/content/95/5/2152 Journal of Applied Physiology]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. Disability is thus not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.|author=[[World Health Organization]]|source=Disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disabilities |url=http://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Disability is a contested concept, with different meanings in different communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity|last = Linton|first = Simi|publisher = New York University Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be used to refer to physical or mental attributes that some institutions, particularly medicine, view as needing to be fixed (the [[Medical model of disability|medical model]]). It may refer to limitations imposed on people by the constraints of an [[ableism|ableist]] society (the [[Social model of disability|social model]]). Or the term may serve to refer to the identity of disabled people. [[Physiological functional capacity]] (PFC) is a related term that describes an individual's performance level. It gauges one's ability to perform the physical tasks of daily life and the ease with which these tasks are performed. PFC declines with advancing [[aging|age]] to result in [[Frailty syndrome|frailty]], cognitive disorders or physical disorders, all of which may lead to labeling individuals as disabled.&lt;ref name="Journal of Applied Physiology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28400984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mugueta-Aguinaga I, Garcia-Zapirain B | title = Is Technology Present in Frailty?

The discussion over disability's definition arose out of [[Disability rights movement|disability activism]] in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1970s, which challenged how the medical concept of disability dominated perception and discourse about disabilities. Debates about proper terminology and their implied politics continue in disability communities and the academic field of [[disability studies]]. In some countries, the law requires that disabilities are documented by a healthcare provider in order to assess qualifications for [[disability benefits]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Contemporary understandings of disability derive from concepts that arose during the West's scientific [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; prior to the Enlightenment, physical differences were viewed through a different lens.

During the [[Middle Ages]], madness and other conditions were thought to be caused by demons. They were also thought to be part of the natural order, especially during and in the fallout of the [[Black Death|Plague]], which wrought impairments throughout the general population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Braddock, David, and Susan Parrish, "An Institutional History of Disability," in ''Handbook of Disability Studies'', ed. Gary Albrecht, Katherine Seelman, and Michael Bury (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early modern period]] there was a shift to seeking biological causes for physical and mental differences, as well as heightened interest in demarcating categories: for example, Ambroise Pare, in the sixteenth century, wrote of "monsters", "prodigies", and "the maimed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Enlightenment]]'s emphases on knowledge derived from reason and on the value of natural science to human progress helped spawn the birth of institutions and associated knowledge systems that observed and categorized human beings; among these, the ones significant to the development of today's concepts of disability were [[Psychiatric hospital|asylums]], [[clinic]]s, and, [[prison]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Contemporary concepts of disability are rooted in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century developments. Foremost among these was the development of clinical medical discourse, which made the human body visible as a thing to be manipulated, studied, and transformed. These worked in tandem with scientific discourses that sought to classify and categorize and, in so doing, became methods of normalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History of Sexuality, vol. 1|last = Foucault|first = Michel|publisher = Vintage|year = 1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "norm" developed in this time period, and is signaled in the work of the [[Belgian]] [[statistician]], [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[mathematician]], and [[astronomer]] [[Adolphe Quetelet]], who wrote in the 1830s of l'homme moyen – the average man. Quetelet postulated that one could take the sum of all people's attributes in a given population (such as their height or weight) and find their average, and that this figure should serve as a norm toward which all should aspire.

This idea of a statistical norm threads through the rapid take up of statistics gathering by Britain, United States, and the Western European states during this time period, and it is tied to the rise of [[eugenics]]. Disability, as well as other concepts including: abnormal, non-normal, and normalcy came from this.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Lennard. "Constructing Normalcy." In his ''Enforcing Normalcy: Disability, Deafness, and the Body'' (New York: Verso, 1995), pp. 23–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The circulation of these concepts is evident in the popularity of the [[freak show]], where showmen profited from exhibiting people who deviated from those norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit|last = Bogdan|first = Robert|publisher = |year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of eugenics in the latter part of the nineteenth century, such deviations were viewed as dangerous to the health of entire populations. With disability viewed as part of a person's biological make-up and thus their genetic inheritance, scientists turned their attention to notions of weeding such "deviations" out of the gene pool. Various metrics for assessing a person's genetic fitness, which were then used to deport, sterilize, or institutionalize those deemed unfit. At the end of the Second World War, with the example of Nazi eugenics, eugenics faded from public discourse, and increasingly disability cohered into a set of attributes that medicine could attend to – whether through augmentation, rehabilitation, or treatment. In both contemporary and modern history, disability was often viewed as a by-product of [[incest]] between [[first-degree relatives]] or [[second-degree relatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barlow, Kathleen | year = 2006 | title = Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century | doi = 10.1525/aa.2006.108.2.447| journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 108 | issue = 2| pages = 447–448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, disability activists began to challenge how society treated disabled people and the medical approach to disability. Due to this work, physical [[Accessibility|barriers to access]] were identified. These conditions functionally disabled them, and what is now known as the [[social model of disability]] emerged. Coined by Mike Oliver in 1983, this phrase distinguishes between the [[medical model of disability]] – under which an impairment needs to be fixed – and the social model of disability – under which the society that limits a person needs to be fixed.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, Tom. "The Social Model of Disability." In ''The Disability Studies Reader'', ed. Lennard Davis (New York: Routledge, 2006, 2d ed.), 197–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology ===
Different terms have been used for disabled people in different times and places.  ''Disability'' or ''impairment'' are commonly used, as are more specific terms, such as ''blind'' (to describe having no vision at all) or ''visually impaired'' (to describe having limited vision).

''Handicap'' has been disparaged as a result of [[List of common false etymologies#Other|false folk etymology]] that says it is a reference to begging.  It is actually derived from an old game, [[Hand-i'-cap]], in which two players trade possessions and a third, neutral person judges the difference of value between the possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/handicap|title=Definition of handicap in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English)|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of a neutral person evening up the odds was extended to [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap racing]] in the mid-18th century.  In handicap racing, horses carry different weights based on the umpire's estimation of what would make them run equally.  The use of the term to describe a person with a disability—by extension from handicap racing, a person carrying a heavier burden than normal—appeared in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=ety&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/?term=handicap|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People-first language ===
{{Main|People-first language}}
People-first language is one way to talk about disability that some people prefer. Using people-first language is said to put the person before the disability, so those individuals who prefer people-first language, prefer to be called, "a person with a disability". Some people prefer person-first phrasing, while others prefer identity-first phrasing.

For people-first guidelines, check out, "Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care" at the [[University of Delaware]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cerebral Palsy: a Guide for Care |url=http://gait.aidi.udel.edu/res695/homepage/pd_ortho/clinics/c_palsy/cpweb.htm |publisher=The Nemours Foundation |accessdate=July 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[American Psychological Association]] [[APA style|style guide]] states that, when identifying a person with a disability, the person's name or pronoun should come first, and descriptions of the disability should be used so that the disability is identified, but is not modifying the person. Acceptable examples included "a woman with [[Down syndrome]]" or "a man who has [[schizophrenia]]". It also states that a person's adaptive equipment should be described functionally as something that assists a person, not as something that limits a person, for example, "a woman who uses a wheelchair" rather than "a woman in/confined to a wheelchair".&lt;/blockquote&gt;A similar kind of "people-first" terminology is also used in the UK, but more often in the form "people with impairments" (such as "people with visual impairments"). However, in the UK, the term "disabled people" is generally preferred to "people with disabilities". It is argued under the [[Social model of disability|social model]] that while someone's impairment (for example, having a spinal cord injury) is an individual property, "disability" is something created by external societal factors such as a lack of accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcil.org.uk/FileAccess.aspx?id=59 Glasgow Centre for Inclusive Living: The Social Model of Disability] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103084307/http://www.gcil.org.uk/FileAccess.aspx?id=59 |date=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction between the individual property of impairment and the social property of disability is central to the [[Social model of disability|social model]]. The term "disabled people" as a political construction is also widely used by international organisations of disabled people, such as [[Disabled Peoples' International]] (DPI).

The use of “people-first” terminology has given rise to the use of the acronym PWD to refer to person(s) (or people) with disabilities (or disability).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=Stephen |year=2014 |chapter=Chapter 23.

Which style of language used varies between different countries, groups and individuals.

=== Aging ===
To a certain degree, physical impairments and changing mental states are almost ubiquitously experienced by people as they age. Aging populations are often stigmatized for having a high prevalence of disability. [[Kathleen Woodward]], writing in ''Key Words for Disability Studies'', explains the phenomenon as follows:
{{Quote|Aging is invoked rhetorically—at times ominously—as a pressing reason why disability should be of crucial interest to all of us (we are all getting older, we will all be disabled eventually), thereby inadvertently reinforcing the damaging and dominant stereotype of aging as solely an experience of decline and deterioration. But little attention has been given to the imbrication of aging and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodward|first1=Kathleen|editor1-last=Adams|editor1-first=Rachel|editor2-last=Reiss|editor2-first=Benjamin|editor3-last=Serlin|editor3-first=David|title=Key Words for Disability Studies|date=2015|publisher=New York University Press|location=Washington Square New York NY 10003|isbn=978-1-4798-4115-8|pages=33–34|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== The workforce ==
As stated above, studies have illustrated a correlation between disabilities and poverty. Notably, jobs offered to disabled people are scarce. ''For global demographic data on unemployment rates for the disabled, see [[Disability and poverty]].'' However, there are current programs in place that aid intellectually disabled (ID) people to acquire skills they need in the workforce.&lt;ref name=":0x"&gt;Blick, R. N., Litz, K. S., Thornhill, M. G., &amp; Goreczny, A. J. (2016). Do inclusive work environments matter? Effects of community-integrated employment on quality of life for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Research In Developmental Disabilities, 53358-366. doi:10.1016/j.ridd.2016.02.015&lt;/ref&gt;  Such programs include sheltered workshops and adult day care programs. Sheltered programs consist of daytime activities such as, gardening, manufacturing, and assembling. These activities facilitate routine-oriented tasks that in turn allow intellectually disabled people to gain experience before entering the workforce. Similarly, adult day care programs also include day time activities. However, these activities are based in an educational environment where intellectually disabled are able to engage in educational, physical, and communication based tasks. This educational based environment helps facilitate communication, memory, and general living skills. In addition, adult day care programs arrange opportunities for their students to engage in community activities. Such opportunities are arranged by scheduling field trips to public places (e.g. Disneyland, Zoo, and Movie Theater). Despite, both programs providing essential skills for intellectually disabled prior to entering the workforce researchers have found that intellectually disabled people prefer to be involved with community-integrated employment.&lt;ref name=":0x" /&gt; Community-integrated employment are job opportunities offered to intellectually disabled people at minimum wage or a higher rate depending on the position. Community-integrated employment comes in a variety of occupations ranging from customer service, clerical, janitorial, hospitality and manufacturing positions. Within their daily tasks community-integrated employees work alongside employees who do not have disabilities, but who are able to assist them with training. All three options allow intellectually disabled people to develop and exercise social skills that are vital to everyday life. However, it is not guaranteed that community-integrated employees receive the same treatment as employees that do not have ID. According to Lindstrom, Hirano, McCarthy, and Alverson, community-integrated employees are less likely to receive  raises. In addition, studies conducted in 2013 illustrated only 26% of employees with ID retained full-time status.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;L. Lindstrom, K.A. Hirano, C. McCarthy, C.Y. Alverson
“Just having a job”: Career advancement for low-wage workers with intellectual and developmental disabilities
Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals, 37 (1) (2014), pp. 1–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, many with disabilities, intellectual and (or) psychical, finding a stable workforce poses many challenges. According to a study conducted by JARID (Journal of Applied Research and Intellectual Disability, indicates that although finding a job may be difficult for an intellectually disabled individual, stabilizing a job is even harder.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Banks, P., Jahoda, A., Dagnan, D., Kemp, J., &amp; Williams, V. (2010). Supported Employment for People with Intellectual Disability: The Effects of Job Breakdown on Psychological Well-Being. Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities, 23(4), 344-354. doi:10.1111/j.1468-3148.2009.00541.x
&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to two main factors: production skills and effective social skills. This idea is supported by Chadsey-Rusch, who claims that securing employment for the intellectually disabled, requires adequate production skills and effective social skills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, other underlying factors for job loss include, structural factors and the integration between worker and workplace. As stated by Kilsby, limited structural factors can effect a multitude of factors in a job. Factors such as a restricted number of hours an intellectually disabled person is allowed to work. This in return, according to Fabian, Wistow, and Schneider leads to a lack of opportunity to develop relationships with coworkers and a chance to better integrate within the workplace. Nevertheless, those who are unable to stabilize a job often are left discouraged. According to the same study conducted by JARED, many who had participated, found that they had made smaller incomes when compared to their co-workers, had an excess of time throughout their days, because they did not have work. They,also, had feelings of hopelessness and failure. According to the NOD ( National Organization On Disability), not only do the (ID) face constant discouragement, but many live below the poverty line, because they are unable to find or stabilize employment and (or) because of employee restricting factors placed on ID workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This then causes the (ID) the incapacity to provide for themselves basic necessities one needs. Items such as, food, medical care, transportation, and housing.

=== Poverty ===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 024.jpg|alt=painting of a group of people, some missing feet, hunched over crutches as a beggar walks past|thumb|upright|''[[The Beggars|The Cripples]]'', [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], 1568]]
There is a global correlation between [[disability and poverty]], produced by a variety of factors. Disability and poverty may form a vicious circle, in which physical barriers and stigma of disability make it more difficult to get income, which in turn diminishes access to health care and other necessities for a healthy life.{{sfn|Yeo|2005}} The [[World report on disability]] indicates that half of all disabled people cannot afford health care, compared to a third of abled people.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, ''World report on disability'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries without public services for adults with disabilities, their families may be impoverished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centrodiba.org|title=Centro DÍBÁ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disasters ===
{{Main|Disability and disasters}}
There is limited research knowledge, but many anecdotal reports, on what happens when disasters impact disabled people.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdra.colostate.edu/Data/Sites/1/cdra-research/peek-stough2010.pdf |title=Children With Disabilities in the Context of Disaster: A Social Vulnerability Perspective |publisher=Child Development |date= |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512111637/http://cdra.colostate.edu/Data/Sites/1/cdra-research/peek-stough2010.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rep-55-3-211.pdf |title=Disaster Case Management and Individuals With Disabilities |date= |accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with disabilities are greatly affected by disasters.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt;{{sfn|Stough|2009}} Those with physical disabilities can be at risk when evacuating if assistance is not available.

Research studies have consistently found discrimination against individuals with disabilities during all phases of a disaster cycle.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt; The most common limitation is that people cannot physically access buildings or [[transportation]], as well as access disaster-related services.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt; The exclusion of these individuals is caused in part by the lack of disability-related training provided to emergency planners and [[disaster relief]] personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1546 |title=UN Enable&amp;nbsp;– Disability, natural disasters and emergency situations |publisher=Un.org |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202131058/http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1546 |archivedate=February 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF), produced by the [[World Health Organization]], distinguishes between body functions (physiological or psychological, such as vision) and body structures (anatomical parts, such as the eye and related structures). Impairment in bodily structure or function is defined as involving an anomaly, defect, loss or other significant deviation from certain generally accepted population standards, which may fluctuate over time. Activity is defined as the execution of a task or action. The ICF lists 9 broad domains of functioning which can be affected:
* Learning and applying knowledge
* General tasks and demands
* Communication
* Basic physical mobility, Domestic life, and Self-care (for example, [[activities of daily living]])
* Interpersonal interactions and relationships
* Community, social and civic life, including [[employment]]
* Other major life areas
In concert with disability scholars, the introduction to the ICF states that a variety of conceptual models have been proposed to understand and explain disability and functioning, which it seeks to integrate. These models include the following:

=== Medical model ===
{{Main|Medical model of disability}}

The [[medical model]] views disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health conditions which therefore requires sustained medical care in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a "cure", or the individual's adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an "almost-cure" or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming [[healthcare]] policy.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=5}}{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}}

=== Social model ===
{{Main|Social model of disability}}
The social model of disability sees "disability" as a socially created problem and a matter of the full [[Inclusion (disability rights)|integration of individuals into society]]. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, created by the social environment. The management of the problem requires [[social activist|social action]] and it is the collective responsibility of society to create a society in which limitations for disabled people are minimal. Disability is both [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] in creation. According to the social model, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights concern.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=6–7}}{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}} The social model of disability has come under criticism. While recognizing the importance played by the social model in stressing the responsibility of society, scholars, including [[Tom Shakespeare]], point out the limits of the model, and urge the need for a new model that will overcome the "medical vs. social" dichotomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shakespeare T | title = The social model of disability: An outdated ideology? | journal = Research in Social Science and Disability | volume = 2 | pages = 9–28 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S1479-3547(01)80018-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations of this model mean that often the vital services and information persons with disabilities face are simply not available, often due to limited economic returns in supporting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=May|first2=Andrew|last3=Mitchell|first3=Val|last4=Burrows|first4=Alison|title=Capturing Volunteered Information for Inclusive Service Design: Potential Benefits and Challenges|journal=The Design Journal|date=2015|volume=16|issue=11|pages=197–218|doi=10.2752/175630613X13584367984947|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175630613X13584367984947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say [[medical humanities]] is a fruitful field where the gap between the medical and the social model of disability might be bridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garden R | title = Disability and narrative: new directions for medicine and the medical humanities | journal = Med. Humanit. | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 70–4 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21393285 | doi = 10.1136/jmh.2010.004143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social construction ====
The social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed by social expectations and institutions rather than biological differences. Highlighting the ways society and institutions construct disability is one of the main focuses of this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Winter 2014|title = Naturalistic Approaches to Social Construction|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/social-construction-naturalistic/|date = 2014-01-01|first = Ron|last = Mallon|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way that race and gender are not biologically fixed, neither is disability.

Around the early 1970s, sociologists, notably Eliot Friedson, began to argue that [[labeling theory]] and [[social deviance]] could be applied to disability studies. This led to the creation of the [[social construction of disability]] theory. The social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed as the social response to a deviance from the norm. The medical industry is the creator of the ill and disabled social role. Medical professionals and institutions, who wield expertise over health, have the ability to define health and physical and mental norms. When an individual has a feature that creates an impairment, restriction, or limitation from reaching the social definition of health, the individual is labeled as disabled. Under this idea, disability is not defined by the physical features of the body but by a deviance from the social convention of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Profession of Medicine: A Study of the Sociology of Applied Knowledge |last=Freidson |first=Eliot |publisher=Harper and Row Inc |year=1970 |isbn=0-06-042205-X |location= |pages=205–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social construction of disability would argue that the [[medical model of disability]]'s view that a disability is an impairment, restriction, or limitation is wrong. Instead what is seen as a disability is just a difference in the individual from what is considered "normal" in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Disability History Vol. 2 |last=Burch |first=Susan |publisher=Facts on File |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8160-7030-5 |location= |pages=543–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other models ===
* The '''spectrum model''' refers to the range of audibility, sensibility, and visibility under which people function. The model asserts that disability does not necessarily mean reduced spectrum of operations. Rather, disability is often defined according to thresholds set on a continuum of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bites August 2011 - International organisations report on disability |url=http://www.dpa.org.nz/news/bites-newsletter/55-bites-august-2011 |publisher=Disabled Persons Assembly New Zealand |accessdate=March 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205123349/http://dpa.org.nz/news/bites-newsletter/55-bites-august-2011 |archivedate=February 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''moral model''' refers to the attitude that people are ''morally responsible'' for their own disability.&lt;ref name="Disability Model"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Deborah |title=Disability Model |url=http://www.peoplewho.org/debate/kaplan.htm |publisher=World Institute on Disability |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, disability may be seen as a result of bad actions of parents if [[congenital]], or as a result of practicing witchcraft if not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lum|first=Doman|title=Culturally Competent Practice: A Framework for Understanding Diverse Groups and Justice Issues|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780840034434|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of this can be seen in the doctrine of [[karma]] in Indian religions. It also includes notions that a disability gives a person "special abilities to perceive, reflect, transcend, be spiritual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olkin|first=Rhoda|title=What Psychotherapists Should Know About Disability|year=2012|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781462506132|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''expert/professional model''' has provided a traditional response to disability issues and can be seen as an offshoot of the medical model. Within its framework, professionals follow a process of identifying the impairment and its limitations (using the medical model), and taking the necessary action to improve the position of the disabled person. This has tended to produce a system in which an authoritarian, over-active service provider prescribes and acts for a passive client.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=5–6}}
* The '''tragedy/charity model''' depicts disabled people as victims of circumstance who are deserving of [[pity]]. This, along with the medical model, are the models most used by non-disabled people to define and explain disability.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=6}}
* The '''legitimacy model''' views disability as a value-based determination about which explanations for the atypical are legitimate for membership in the disability category. This viewpoint allows for multiple explanations and models to be considered as purposive and viable.{{sfn|DePoy|Gilson|2004}}
* The '''social adapted model''' states although a person's disability poses some limitations in an able-bodied society, often the surrounding society and environment are more limiting than the disability itself.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=7}}
* The '''economic model''' defines disability in terms of reduced ability to work, the related loss of productivity and economic effects on the individual, employer and society in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Economic Model of Disability |url=http://www.copower.org/models-of-disability/176-economic-model-of-disability.html |publisher=Michigan Disability Rights Coalition |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''empowering model''' (also, '''customer model''') allows for the person with a disability and his/her family to decide the course of his/her treatment. This turns the professional into a service provider whose role is to offer guidance and carry out the client's decisions. This model "empowers" the individual to pursue his/her own goals.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=7}}
*The '''market model''' of disability is minority rights and consumerist model of disability that recognizing disabled people and their stakeholders as representing a large group of consumers, employees and voters.  This model looks to personal identity to define disability and empowers people to chart their own destiny in everyday life, with a particular focus on economic empowerment.  By this model, based on US Census data, there are 1.2 billion people in the world who consider themselves to have a disability. "This model states that, due to the size of the demographic, companies and governments will serve the desires, pushed by demand as the message becomes prevalent in the cultural mainstream."{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}}
*The '''consumer model''' of disability is based upon the “rights-based" model and claims that disabled people should have equal rights and access to products, goods and services offered by businesses.  The consumer model extends the rights-based model by proposing that businesses, not only accommodate customers with disabilities under the requirements of legislation, but that businesses actively seek, market to, welcome and fully engage disabled people in all aspects of business service activities.  The model suggests that all business operations, for example websites, policies and procedures, mission statements, emergency plans, programs and services, should integrate access and inclusion practices.  Furthermore, these access and inclusion practices should be based on established customer service access and inclusion standards that embrace and support the active engagement of people of all abilities in business offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, T.B. (2012). A New and Emerging Model of Disability:  The Consumer Model.  White Paper. The Pennsylvania State University&lt;/ref&gt;
*Different theories revolve around prejudice, stereotyping, discrimination, and stigma related to disability. One of the more popular ones, as put by Weiner, Perry, and Magnusson 's (1988) work with '''attribution theory''', physical stigmas are perceived as to be un-controllable and elicit pity and desire to help, whereas, mental-behavioral stigmas are considered to be controllable and therefore elicit anger and desire to neglect the individuals with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An attributional analysis of reactions to stigmas|author1=Weiner, B. |author2=Perry, R.

*The '''‘just world hypothesis'''’ talks about how a person is viewed as deserving the disability. And because it is the fault of that person, an observer does not feel obligated to feel bad for him or to help him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The belief in a just world: A fundamental delusion.|last = Lerner|first = M.

== Identity ==
In contexts where their differences are visible, persons with disabilities often face stigma. People frequently react to disabled presence with fear, pity, patronization, intrusive gazes, revulsion, or disregard. These reactions can, and often do, exclude persons with disabilities from accessing social spaces along with the benefits and resources these spaces provide.&lt;ref name=":1x"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://donnareeve.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ReeveChapter2004b.pdf|title=Reeve Chapter 2004|format=PDF|last=Reeve|first=Donna|publisher=The Disability Press|year=2004|isbn=0-9528450-8-3|editor-last=Barnes|editor-first=Colin|location=Leeds, U.K.|pages=83–100|chapter=Psycho-emotional dimensions of disability and the social model|editor-last2=Mercer|editor-first2=Geof}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled writer/researcher Jenny Morris describes how stigma functions to marginalize persons with disabilities:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repositoriocdpd.net:8080/bitstream/handle/123456789/605/L_MorrisJ_PrideAgainstPrejudice_1991.pdf?sequence=1|title=Pride Against Prejudice Transforming Attitudes to Disability|last=Morris|first=Jenny|publisher=The Women's Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Aylesbury, Bucks, England|pages=21, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|“Going out in public so often takes courage. How many of us find that we can't dredge up the strength to do it day after day, week after week, year after year, a lifetime of rejection and revulsion? It is not only physical limitations that restrict us to our homes and those whom we know. It is the knowledge that each entry into the public world will be dominated by stares, by condescension, by pity and by hostility.”}}
Additionally, facing stigma can cause harm to psycho-emotional well-being of the person being stigmatized. One of the ways in which the psycho-emotional health of persons with disabilities is adversely affected is through the internalization of the oppression they experience, which can lead to feeling that they are weak, crazy, worthless, or any number of other negative attributes that may be associated with their conditions. Internalization of oppression damages the self-esteem of the person affected and shapes their behaviors in ways that are compliant with nondisabled dominance.&lt;ref name=":1x" /&gt; Ableist ideas are frequently internalized when disabled people are pressured by the people and institutions around them to hide and downplay their disabled difference, or, "pass". According to writer Simi Linton, the act of passing takes a deep emotional toll by causing disabled individuals to experience loss of community, anxiety and self-doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linton|first1=Semi|title=Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity|date=1998|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814751343|pages=19–21|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail/bmxlYmtfXzQ3ODY0X19BTg2?sid=edb39fe1-bae0-4c9c-9dc5-d0c2903f2346@sessionmgr106&amp;vid=0&amp;detailAuthError=true#AN=47864&amp;db=nlebk|accessdate=3 May 2016}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The media play a significant role in creating and reinforcing stigma associated with disability. Media portrayals of disability usually cast disabled presence as necessarily marginal within society at large. These portrayals simultaneously reflect and influence the popular perception of disabled difference.

=== Tropes ===
{{Further|Disability in the media}}
There are distinct tactics that the media frequently employ in representing disabled presence. These common ways of framing disability are heavily criticized for being dehumanizing and failing to place importance on the perspectives of persons with disabilities.

==== Inspiration porn ====
[[Inspiration porn]] refers to portrayals of persons with disabilities in which they are presented as being inspiring simply because the person has a disability. These portrayals are criticized because they are created with the intent of making able-bodied viewers feel better about themselves in comparison to the individual portrayed. Rather than recognizing the humanity of persons with disabilities, inspiration porn turns them into objects of inspiration for a nondisabled audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rampup/articles/2012/07/02/3537035.htm|title=We're not here for your inspiration|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Supercrip ====
The supercrip trope refers to instances when media reports on or portray a disabled person who has made a noteworthy achievement; but center on their disability rather than what they actually did. They are portrayed as awe-inspiring for being exceptional compared to others with the same or similar conditions. This trope is widely used in reporting on disabled athletes as well as in portrayals of autistic savants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representing Autism Culture, Narrative, Fascination|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84631-092-8|location=Liverpool, U.K.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physed.otago.ac.nz/sosol/v7i1/v7i1_1.html|title=sosol - Volume 7 Issue 1|website=physed.otago.ac.nz|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many disabled people denounce these representations as reducing people to their condition rather than viewing them as full people. Furthermore, supercrip portrayals are criticized for creating the unrealistic expectation that disability should be accompanied by some type of special talent, genius, or insight.

==== Disabled villain ====
Characters in fiction that bear physical or mental markers of difference from perceived societal norms are frequently positioned as villains within a text. Lindsey Row-Heyveld notes, for instance, “that villainous pirates are scraggly, wizened, and inevitably kitted out with a peg leg, eye patch, or hook hand whereas heroic pirates look like Johnny Depp's [[Jack Sparrow]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Row-Heyveld|first=Lindsey|date=2015|title=Reading Batman, Writing X-Men Superpowers and Disabilities in the First-Year Seminar|url=http://pedagogy.dukejournals.org/content/15/3/519.full.pdf|journal=Pedagogy: Critical Approaches to Teaching Literature, Language, Composition, and Culture| volume = 15 |number =3|doi=10.1215/15314200-2917105|pmid=|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled people's visible differences from the abled majority are  meant to evoke fear in audiences that can perpetuate the mindset of disabled people being a threat to individual or public interests and well-being.

=== Self advocacy ===
Some disabled people have attempted to resist [[marginalisation]] through the use of the social model in opposition to the medical model; with the aim of shifting criticism away from their bodies and impairments and towards the social institutions that oppress them relative to their abled peers. Disability activism that demands many grievances be addressed, such as lack of [[accessibility]], poor representation in media, general disrespect, and [[ignorance|lack of recognition]], originates from a social model framework.

Embracing disability as a positive identity by becoming involved in disabled communities and participating in disabled culture can be an effective way to combat internalised prejudice; and can challenge dominant narratives about disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reeve|first=Donna|date=2002|title=Negotiating Psycho-Emotional Dimensions of Disability and their Influence on Identity Constructions|url=http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/69654/1/ReeveArticle2002.pdf|journal=Disability &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=5|doi=10.1080/09687590220148487|pmid=|access-date=April 19, 2016|pages=493–508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersections ===

{{expand section|date=February 2018}}

The experiences that disabled people have navigating social institutions vary greatly as a function of what other social categories they may belong to. The categories that intersect with disability to create unique experiences of ableism include, but aren't limited to, race and gender. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities differentiates two kinds of disability intersection, race disability intersection and gender disability intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Anna|title=European Union Non-Discrimination Law and Intersectionality:|publisher=Routledge|date=2016|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=-iu3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;q=disability%20intersections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Race ====
Disabled people who are also racial [[minority group|minorities]] generally have less access to support and are more vulnerable to violent discrimination. For example, in the United States people of color who are mentally ill are more frequently victims of police brutality than their white counterparts. Camille A. Nelson, writing for the ''Berkeley Journal of Criminal Law'', notes that for “people who are negatively racialized, that is people who are perceived as being non-white, and for whom mental illness is either known or assumed, interaction with police is precarious and potentially dangerous.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Camille|title=Racializing Disability, Disabling Race: Policing Race and Mental Status|journal=Berkley Journal of Criminal Law|date=Spring 2010|volume=15|issue=1|url=http://www.bjcl.org/articles/15_1%20Nelson%20(1-64).pdf|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender ====
The marginalization of disabled people can leave persons with disabilities unable to actualize what society expects of gendered existence. This lack of recognition for their gender identity can leave persons with disabilities with feelings of inadequacy. Thomas J. Gerschick of Illinois State University describes why this denial of gendered identity occurs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerschick|first1=Thomas|title=Towards a Theory of Disability and Gender|journal=Signs|date=Summer 2000|volume=25|pages=1263–1268|jstor=3175525|doi=10.1086/495558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text="Bodies operate socially as canvases on which gender is displayed and kinesthetically as the mechanisms by which it is physically enacted. Thus, the bodies of disabled people make them vulnerable to being denied recognition as women and men."}}
To the extent that women and men with disabilities are gendered, the interactions of these two identities lead to different experiences. Disabled women face a sort of “double [[social stigma|stigmatization]]” in which their membership to both of these marginalized categories simultaneously exacerbates the negative stereotypes associated with each as they are ascribed to them. According to The UN Woman Watch, "Persistence of certain cultural, legal and institutional barriers makes women and girls with disabilities the victims of two-fold discrimination: as women and as persons with disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/enable/|title=WomenWatch: Feature on Women with Disabilities|last=WomenWatch|first=UN|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Rosemarie Garland-Thomson puts it, “Women with disabilities, even more intensely than women in general, have been cast in the collective cultural imagination as inferior, lacking, excessive, incapable, unfit, and useless.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Winter 2005|title=Feminist Disability Studies|doi=10.1086/423352|journal=Signs|volume=30|pages=1557–1587|last1=Garland-Thomson|first1=Rosemarie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistive technology==
{{Main|Assistive technology}}
[[Assistive Technology]] is a generic term for devices and modifications (for a person or within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example of the use of a [[prosthesis]] dates to at least 1800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Social History Project&amp;nbsp;– Timeline |url=http://www.disabilityhistory.org/timeline_new.html |publisher=Disabilityhistory.org |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wheelchair]] dates from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooper, Rory A |author2=Hisaichi Ohnabe |author3=Douglas A. Hobson |title=An Introduction to Rehabilitation Engineering|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420012491|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[curb cut]] is a related structural innovation. Other examples are [[standing frames]], text [[telephones]], accessible [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], [[large print]], [[Braille]], &amp; [[speech recognition]] [[software]]. Disabled people often develop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to suppress tics in public (for example in [[Tourette's syndrome]]), or [[sign language]] in [[deaf]] communities.

As the [[personal computer]] has become more ubiquitous, various organizations have formed to [[software development|develop software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] to make computers more accessible for disabled people. Some software and hardware, such as [[Voice Finger]], [[Freedom Scientific]]'s ''[[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]]'', the Free and Open Source alternative ''[[Orca (assistive technology)|Orca]]'' etc. have been specifically designed for disabled people while other software and hardware, such as [[Nuance Communications|Nuance]]'s [[Dragon NaturallySpeaking]], were not developed specifically for disabled people, but can be used to increase accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unh.edu/disabilityservices/dragon-naturally-speaking Dragon Naturally Speaking] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408025058/http://www.unh.edu/disabilityservices/dragon-naturally-speaking |date=April 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LOMAK]] keyboard was designed in [[New Zealand]] specifically for persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sobh|first=Tarek|title=Innovations and Advanced Techniques in Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402062681|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The World Wide Web consortium recognised a need for International Standards for Web Accessibility for persons with disabilities and created the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/ |title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) - home page |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As at Dec 2012 the standard is WCAG 2.0 (WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ |title=Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adapted sports==
{{Main|Disabled sports}}

[[File:Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.jpg|alt=an athlete tilts his wheelchair and raises an arm to block his opponent's shot|thumb|upright|[[Wheelchair basketball]] match between South Africa and Iran at the [[Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|2008 Summer Paralympics]]]]
The [[Paralympic Games]] (meaning "alongside the Olympics") are held after the (Summer and Winter) [[Olympics]]. The Paralympic Games include athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities. In member countries, organizations exist to organize competition in the Paralympic sports on levels ranging from recreational to elite (for example, [[Disabled Sports USA]] and [[BlazeSports America]] in the United States).

The Paralympics developed from a rehabilitation programme for British war veterans with spinal injuries. In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist working with World War II veterans with spinal injuries at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] in [[Aylesbury]] in the UK, began using sport as part of the rehabilitation programmes of his patients.

In 2006, the [[Extremity Games]] were formed for physically disabled people, specifically limb loss or limb difference, to be able to compete in [[extreme sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Extremity Games was first class success|url=http://www.oandp.com/articles/2006-08_12.asp|publisher=oandp.com|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights and government policies==
{{Main|Ableism}}

===Rights movement===
{{main|Disability rights movement}}
The disability rights movement aims to secure equal opportunities and equal rights for disabled people. The specific goals and demands of the movement are [[accessibility]] and [[safety]] in transportation, architecture, and the physical environment; equal opportunities in independent living, employment, education, and housing; and freedom from abuse, neglect, and violations of patients' rights.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Rights Wisconsin |url=http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/priority-issues/abuse-neglect-and-patient-rights |publisher=Disabilityrightswi.org |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective civil rights legislation is sought to secure these opportunities and rights.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bagenstos | first = Samuel | title = Law and the Contradictions of the Disability Rights Movement | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-300-12449-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Löve |first1=Laufey |last2=Traustadóttir |first2=Rannveig |last3=Rice |first3=James |title=Achieving disability equality: Empowering disabled people to take the lead |journal=Social Inclusion |date=26 March 2018 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.17645/si.v6i1.1180 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/view/1180 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early disability rights movement was dominated by the medical model of disability, where emphasis was placed on curing or treating disabled people so that they would adhere to the social norm, but starting in the 1960s, rights groups began shifting to the social model of disability, where disability is interpreted as an issue of discrimination, thereby paving the way for rights groups to achieve equality through legal means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kemple|first1=Miriam|last2=Ahmad|first2=Fatima|last3=Girijashanker|first3=Suraj|title=Shaping Disability Rights through Shaping the Disability Movement|journal=Journal of Human Rights Practices|date=2011|volume=3|issue=3|pages=355–363|doi=10.1093/jhuman/hur019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies and actions===

====Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities====
On December 13, 2006, the [[United Nations]] formally agreed on the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], the first human rights treaty of the 21st century, to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of the world's estimated 650 million disabled people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kayess|first1=Rosemary|last2=French|first2=Phillip|title=Out of darkness into light? Introducing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.|journal=Human rights law review|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2011|April}}, 99 of the 147 signatories had ratified the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Enable&amp;nbsp;– Promoting the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/ |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that sign the convention are required to adopt national laws, and remove old ones, so that persons with disabilities will, for example, have equal rights to education, employment, and cultural life; to the right to own and inherit property; to not be discriminated against in marriage, etc.; and to not be unwilling subjects in medical experiments. UN officials, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights, have characterized the bill as representing a paradigm shift in attitudes toward a more rights-based view of disability in line with the social model.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====International Year of Disabled Persons====
In 1976, the [[United Nations]] began planning for its [[International Year of Disabled Persons]] (1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=International Year for Disabled Persons|journal=Public Health Reports|date=1981|volume=95|issue=5|pages=498–499}}&lt;/ref&gt; later renamed the [[International Year of Disabled Persons]]. The UN Decade of Disabled Persons (1983–1993) featured a World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons. In 1979, [[Frank Bowe]] was the only person with a disability representing any country in the planning of IYDP-1981. Today, many countries have named representatives who are themselves individuals with disabilities. The decade was closed in an address before the General Assembly by [[Robert Davila]]. Both Bowe and Davila are [[deaf]]. In 1984, [[UNESCO]] accepted [[sign language]] for use in education of deaf children and youth.

====Policies in the United States====
In the United States, the Department of Labor's 2014 rules for federal contractors, defined as companies that make more than $50,000/year from the federal government, required them to have as a goal that 7% of their workforce must be disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Labor Department announces final rules to improve employment of veterans, disabled people|url=https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20131578|website=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=18 December 2017|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools, the ADA says that all classrooms must be wheelchair accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.freeadvice.com/government_law/education_law/accommodations-for-children-with-disabilities.htm|title=Accommodations for Children with Disabilities &amp; the ADA|work=FreeAdvice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, commonly known as the Access Board, created the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to help offer guidelines for transportation and accessibility for the physically disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ansley |first=James |date=2000 |title=Creating Accessible Schools |website=National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities |publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences |url=http://www.ncef.org/pubs/accessibility.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 12.6% of the U.S. population are individuals who suffer from a mental or physical disability. Many are unemployed because of prejudiced assumptions that a person with disabilities is unable to complete tasks that are commonly required in the workforce. This became a major [[Human rights]] issue because of the discrimination that this group faced when trying to apply for jobs in the U.S. Many advocacy groups protested against such discrimination, asking the [[Federation|federal government]] to implement laws and policies that would help individuals with disabilities.

=====Rehabilitation Act of 1973=====

The [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] was enacted with the purpose of protecting individuals with disabilities from prejudicial treatment by government funded programs, employers, and agencies. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 has not only helped protect U.S. citizens from being discriminated against but it has also created confidence amongst individuals to feel more comfortable with their disability. There are many sections within The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that contains detailed information about what is covered in this policy.

; Section 501
:   An employer must hire an individual who meets the qualifications of a job description despite any preexisting disabilities.
; Section 503
:   Requires contractors or subcontractors, who receive more than $10,000 from the government to hire people with disabilities and to accommodate them with the needs that they need to achieve in the work force.
; [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504]]
:   States that receive federal money may not discriminate against any person with disabilities who qualifies for a program or job.

=====The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990=====

The federal government enacted The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which was created to allow equal opportunity for jobs, access to private and government funded facilities, and transportation for disabled people. This act was created with the purpose to ensure that employers would not discriminate against any individual despite their disability. In 1990, data was gathered to show the percentage of disabled people who worked in the U.S. Out of the 13% who filled out the survey, only 53% percent of individuals with disabilities worked while 90% of this group population did not, the government wanted to change this, they wanted Americans with disabilities to have the same opportunities as those who did not have a disability. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] not only required corporations to hire disabled people but that they also accommodate them and their needs.

; Title I: Employment
:   An employer must give a qualified individual with disabilities the same opportunities as any other employee despite their disability. The employer must offer equal work privileges to someone who has a disability including but not limited to pay, work hours, training, etc. The employer must also create accommodations suitable for the person and their physical or mental disabilities.
; Title II: State and Local Government Activities
:   Requires that the government give disabled people the same opportunities involving work, programs, building access, and services. Title II also requires that buildings create easy access for disabled people and provide communicators who will be able to help those with [[Hearing loss|hearing]] or speaking impairments. Public spaces are however not required to create accommodations that would in turn alter their services as long as the services proved that they did all they could to prevent discrimination against disabled people.f
; Title II: Transportation
:   [[Public transport]]ation should be customized so that disabled people may have easy access to public transit. [[Paratransit]] is a service that provides transportation to people who are unable to get from one destination to another due to their mental or physical disability.
; Title II: Public Accommodations
:   Public accommodations require that private businesses create accommodations that will allow disabled people easy access to buildings. Private businesses may not discriminate against disabled people and must provide accommodations that are reasonable, alterations may be made so that a person with disabilities can have equal access to facilities that are provided, communicators for the [[hearing impaired]], devices for the visually impaired, and wheelchair access. Facilities must regulate with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]], when regulating the buildings infrastructure so it meets the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] regulations.
; Title IV: Telecommunication Relay Services
:   Requires telephone companies to have [[Telecommunications relay service|TRS]] seven days a week, twenty four hours a day. It requires telephone companies to create accommodations for deaf/hard of hearing people by providing a third party that will be able to assistant both parties in communicating with one another.

====Policies in the United Kingdom====
In the UK, the Department for Work and Pension is a government department responsible for promoting disability awareness and among its aims is to increase the understanding of disability and removal of barriers for disabled people in the workplace. According to a news report, a people survey conducted in the UK shows a 23% increase in reported discrimination and harassment in the workplace at The Department for Work and Pension. The survey shows the number of reports for discrimination due to disability was in majority compared to discrimination due to gender, ethnicity or age. DWP received criticism for the survey results. As a department responsible for tackling discrimination at work, the DWP results may indicate room for improvement from within. A DWP spokesperson said the survey results do not necessarily indicate an increase in the number of reports, but rather reflecting the outcomes of efforts to encourage people to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Disabled staff at the DWP are reporting increased discrimination|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/disabled-dwp-staff-report-increased-discrimination-in-the-workplace-a6856191.html|website = The Independent|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political issues===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
[[File:USMC-00772.jpg|alt=woman seated in a wheelchair with military personnel in background|thumb|left|upright|A 28-year-old Iraqi woman who lost both of her legs during the [[Iraq War]] in 2005]]
Political [[rights]], [[social inclusion]] and [[citizenship]] have come to the fore in developed and some developing countries. The debate has moved beyond a concern about the perceived cost of maintaining dependent disabled people to finding effective ways to ensure that disabled people can participate in and contribute to society in all spheres of life.

In developing nations, where the vast bulk of the estimated 650 million disabled people reside, a great deal of work is needed to address concerns ranging from accessibility and education to self-empowerment, self-supporting employment, and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/pwdfs.pdf|title=Fact Sheet on Persons with Disabilities, by United Nation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past few years, disability rights activists have focused on obtaining full citizenship for the disabled.

There are obstacles in some countries in getting full employment; public perception of disabled people may vary.

====Abuse====
{{main|Disability abuse}}
Disability abuse happens when a person is abused physically, financially, verbally or mentally due to the person having a disability. As many disabilities are not visible (for example, asthma, learning disabilities) some abusers cannot rationalize the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on.

As the prevalence of disability and the cost of supporting disability increases with medical advancement and longevity in general, this aspect of society becomes of greater political importance. How political parties treat their disabled constituents may become a measure of a political party's understanding of disability, particularly in the social model of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hough |first=Andrew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9626664/Disability-hate-crimes-rise-by-a-quarter-in-a-year.html |title='Disability hate crimes' rise by a quarter in a year |publisher=Telegraph |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insurance====
Disability benefit, or [[disability pension]], is a major kind of [[disability insurance]] that is provided by government agencies to people who are temporarily or permanently unable to work due to a disability. In the U.S., disability benefit is provided in the category of [[Supplemental Security Income]]. In Canada, it is within the [[Canada Pension Plan]]. In other countries, disability benefit may be provided under [[social security]] systems.

Costs of disability pensions are steadily growing in Western countries, mainly in Europe and the United States. It was reported that, in the UK, expenditure on disability pensions accounted for 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980; two decades later it had reached 2.6% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. Transforming disability into ability: Policies to promote work and income security for disabled people.

A study by researchers in Denmark suggests that information on self-reported days of absence due to sickness can be used to effectively identify future potential groups for disability pension.&lt;ref name="Labriola-Lund-2007"/&gt; These studies may provide useful information for policy makers, case managing authorities, employers, and physicians.

Private, for-profit disability insurance plays a role in providing incomes to disabled people, but the nationalized programs are the safety net that catch most claimants.

==Demographics==

Estimates of worldwide and country-wide numbers of individuals with disabilities are problematic. The varying approaches taken to defining disability notwithstanding, demographers agree that the world population of individuals with disabilities is very large. For example, in 2012, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated a world population of 6.5 billion people. Of those, nearly 650 million people, or 10%, were estimated to be moderately or severely disabled.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability World Report 2011 |url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2011 |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018 the [[International Labour Organization]] estimated that about a billion people, one seventh of the world population, had disabilities, 80% of them in developing countries, and 80% of working age.  Excluding disabled people from the workforce was reckoned to cost up to 7% of [[gross domestic product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For many, disability is part of what it means to be human |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f4e2dc50-3dab-11e8-bcc8-cebcb81f1f90 |accessdate=14 August 2018 |publisher=Financial Times |date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, there were some 56.7 million disabled people, or 19% (by comparison, African Americans are the largest racial minority in the U.S., but only constitute 12.6% of the U.S. population).&lt;ref name="U.S. Bureau of the Census"&gt;{{cite web |title=American FactFinder |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S1801&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_ |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell|year=1991|title=The Demographics of Disability|url=|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=69|pages=55–77|doi=10.2307/3350158}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2014 Disability status report of the Cornell University Yang Tan Institute the prevalence rate of individuals with disabilities in the United States was 12.6% in that year. {{as of|2014}} ambulatory disability had the highest prevalence (7.1%) in the United States. By contrast, visual disability had the lowest prevalence (2.3%). Additionally, 3.6% of people in the United States were reported to have had an auditory disability in the same year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=W.|year=2014|title=2014 Disability Status Report: United States|url=|journal=Cornell University Yang Tan Institute on Employment and Disability|volume=|pages=1–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5.8% of individuals ages 16–20 reported having any disability, physical and/ or cognitive. Adults 21 to 64 had a prevalence of 10.8% with over half of these (5.5%) being ambulatory disabilities. Ambulatory disability prevalence raised to 15.8% in adults 65–74 years of age. Adults 75 years and older comprised the highest prevalence with any disability at 50.3%.

Female individuals across all ages reported a total 0.4% higher prevalence rate than males who reported 12.4%.

In the U.S. 17.9% of Native American peoples reported having a disability while 4.5% reporting were of Asian descent, these were the two opposing poles of the prevalence rate within race {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Although there are acts that have been imposed in order to prevent the discrimination of individuals with disabilities in the workplace, there is still an employment gap that can be seen between those with and without disabilities. In regards to employment, the institute's status report accounts that 34.6% of people with any disability reported being employed. By comparison; 77.6% of individuals, who did not report having a disability, reported having a full-time job in 2014.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For those employed full-time, individuals with disabilities on average earned $5,100 less than employees without a disability who were also employed full-time. Those affected the most by these differences were intellectually disabled people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Developing nations===
There is widespread agreement among experts{{who|date=May 2014}} in the field, that disability is more common in developing than in developed nations.

'''Flotation of flexible objects''' is a phenomenon in which the bending of a flexible material allows an object to displace a greater amount of fluid than if it were completely rigid. This ability to displace more fluid translates directly into an ability to support greater loads, giving the flexible structure an advantage over a similarly rigid one. Inspiration to study the effects of  [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] are taken from nature, where plants and animals living at the water surface have evolved to take advantage of the load-bearing benefits elasticity imparts.

==History==
In his work "On Floating Bodies", Archimedes&lt;ref name=acottLaw&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Acott, Chris |title=The diving "Law-ers": A brief resume of their lives |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5990}}&lt;/ref&gt; famously stated:

{{Quotation|Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.| [[Archimedes]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]}}

While this basic idea carried enormous weight and has come to form the basis of understanding why objects float, it is best applied for objects with a characteristic length scale greater than the [[capillary length]]. What Archimedes had failed to predict was the influence of [[surface tension]] and its impact at small length scales.

More recent works, such as that of Keller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Joseph B.|title=Surface tension force on a partly submerged body|journal=Physics of Fluids|year=1998|volume=10|issue=11|page=3009|doi=10.1063/1.869820|bibcode=1998PhFl...10.3009K}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; have extended these principles by considering the role of surface tension forces on partially submerged bodies. Keller, for instance, demonstrated analytically that the weight of water displaced by a [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] is equal to the vertical component of the surface tension force.

[[File:Water strider.jpg|thumbnail|right|The well known phenomena by which water striders support themselves through surface tension effects can be re-examined by considering the compliance and resultant deformation of the insect's leg at the water line.]]

Nonetheless, the role of flexibility and its impact on an object's load-bearing potential is one that did receive attention until the mid-2000s and onward. In an initial study, Vella&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vella|first=Dominic|author2=Metcalfe, Paul D. |author3=Whittaker, Robert J. |title=Equilibrium Conditions for the Floating of Multiple Interfacial Objects|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|year=2006|volume=549|issue=215|pages=215–224|doi=10.1017/s0022112005008013|arxiv=physics/0509009|bibcode=2006JFM...549..215V}}&lt;/ref&gt;  studied the load supported by a raft composed of thin, rigid strips. Specifically, he compared the case of floating individual strips to floating an aggregation of strips, wherein the aggregate structure causes portions of the meniscus (and hence, resulting surface tension force) to disappear. By extending his analysis to consider a similar system composed of thin strips of some finite bending stiffness, he found that this later case in fact was able support a greater load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Vella|first=Dominic|title=The fluid mechanics of floating and sinking |type=PhD Dissertation |publisher=Trinity College, University of Cambridge |location=Cambridge |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known work in the area of surface tension aided flotation was the analysis of [[water strider]] locomotion along the surface of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=David|author2=Chan, Brian |author3=Bush, John W.M. |title=The hydrodynamics of water strider locomotion|journal=Nature|year=2003|volume=424|pages=663–666|doi=10.1038/nature01793|pmid=12904790|issue=6949|bibcode=2003Natur.424..663H}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the idea of flexible structures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ji|first=Xiang-Ying|author2=Wang, Jia-Wen |author3=Feng, Xi-Xiao |title=Role of flexibility in the water repellency of water strider legs: Theory and experiment|journal=Physical Review E|year=2012|volume=85|issue=2|pages=021607|doi=10.1103/physreve.85.021607 |pmid=22463223|bibcode=2012PhRvE..85b1607J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ji et al. re-examined this problem by considering the [[stiffness|compliance]] of a water strider leg. By modeling the leg as a compliant structure that deforms at the water surface (rather than pierce it), Ji was able to ascertain what added benefit this flexibility has in supporting the insect. Other studies on the water strider have examined the ways in which flexibility can affect wetting properties of the leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Kun Joong|author2=Kim, Ho-Young|title=Bending of floating flexible legs|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|year=2008|volume=610|pages=381–390|doi=10.1017/s0022112008002784|bibcode=2008JFM...610..381P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another track of research has been to investigate how exactly the interaction between liquid and a compliant object leads to the resulting deformation. In one example, such analysis has been extended to explain the difficulty in submerging hairs in a fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderotti|first=B.|author2=Marchand, A. |author3=Das, S. |author4= Snoeijer, J.H. |title=Elastocapillary instability under partial wetting conditions: Bending versus buckling|journal=Physical Review E|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages=061601|doi=10.1103/physreve.84.061601 |pmid=22304096|arxiv=1109.3414|bibcode=2011PhRvE..84f1601A|url=https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/elastocapillary-instability-under-partial-wetting-conditions-bending-versus-buckling(44b54537-e7c8-4f1a-9b71-3915f76822e4).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works focus on behavior near the contact line, and consider what role non-linear effects such as slippage play.

==Physical explanation of phenomena==

In a liquid solution, any given liquid molecule experience strong [[cohesion (chemistry)|cohesive]] forces from neighboring molecules. While these forces are balanced in the bulk, molecules at the surface of the solution are surrounded on one side by water molecules and on the other side by gas molecules. The resulting imbalance of cohesive forces along the surface results in a net "pull" toward the bulk, giving rise to the phenomena of surface tension.

[[File:Flexible plate displaced below water line.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Rigid plate submerged below water line. If the plate is flexible, its deformation (dashed) results in the displacement of additional fluid (blue, diagonal). However, doing so results in a simultaneous loss due to the narrowing of the above column (red, vertical).]]

When a [[hydrophobic]] object of weight &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is placed on the surface of water, its weight begins deforming the water line. The hydrophobic nature of the object means that the water will attempt to minimize contact due to an unfavorable energy tradeoff associated with wetting. As a result, surface tension attempts to pull back on the water line in order to minimize contact with the hydrophobic object and retain a lowest energy state. This action by the surface to pull back on the depressed water interface is the source of a capillary force, which acts tangentially along the contact line and thereby gives rise to a component in the vertical direction. An attempt to further depress the object is resisted by this capillary force until the contact line reaches a vertical position located about two capillary lengths below the undisturbed water line.&lt;ref name=Can_flex&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burton|first=L.J.|author2=Bush, J.W.M|title=Can flexibility help you float?|journal=Physics of Fluids|year=2012|volume=24|issue=10|doi=10.1063/1.4757121|pages=101701–101701–7|bibcode=2012PhFl...24j1701B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this occurs, the meniscus collapses and the object sinks.

The more fluid a floating object is able to displace, the greater the load it is able to bear. As a result, the ultimate payoff of flexibility is in determining whether or not a bent configuration results in an increased volume of displaced water. As a flexible object bends, it penetrates further into the water and increases the total fluid displaced above it. However, this bending action necessarily forces the cross-section at the water line to decrease, narrowing the column of displaced water above the object. Thus, whether or not bending is advantageous is ultimately given by a tradeoff of these factors.

==Mathematical model: flotation of hinged plates==

===Two rigid plates connected by a torsional spring===

The following analysis is taken largely from the work of Burton and Bush,&lt;ref name=Can_flex /&gt; and offers some mathematical insight into the role that flexibility plays in improving load-bearing characteristics of floating objects.

Consider two plates of infinite width, thickness &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and length &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; that are connected by a torsional spring with spring constant per unit width &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, let &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be the angle between a plate and the horizontal, and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; the from where the meniscus meets the plate to the horizontal. The distance from the undisturbed water line to the plate's outer edge is &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. The density of water is &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, the density of air is considered negligible, and the plate density, &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt;, shall be varied. All systems naturally assume a configuration that minimizes total energy. Thus, the goal of this analysis is to identify the configurations (i.e., values of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) that result in a stable equilibrium for a given value of &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt;.

For a total system energy of &lt;math&gt;\Pi &lt;/math&gt;, it is natural to distinguish sub-components:

[[File:Submering hinged plates.jpg|right|frame|Two rigid plates connected by a torsional spring and submerged between the water line. Since the material is taken to be hydrophobic, the water deforms, forming the meniscus at the plate edge.]]

&lt;math&gt; \Pi = U - V &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;: Work done on the system
:&lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt;: System potential energy

In defining &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, there are several associated components:

&lt;math&gt; V = W_{H,i} + W_{H,p} - W_{g,p} + W_{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W_{H,i} &lt;/math&gt; is the work done on the interface by hydrostatic pressure
:&lt;math&gt;W_{H,p} &lt;/math&gt; is the work done on the plates by hydrostatic pressure
:&lt;math&gt;W_{g,p} &lt;/math&gt; is the work done on the plates by gravitational force
:&lt;math&gt;W_{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt; is the work done on the plates by surface tension forces

Similarly, the system potential energy, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, is taken to be composed of two terms:
&lt;math&gt;U = S + E_s &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface energy]] of the water/air interface
:&lt;math&gt; E_s &lt;/math&gt; is the energy stored in the torsional spring and is equal to  &lt;math&gt;E_s = K_s(2\alpha)^2/2 &lt;/math&gt;

There are two ways in which the system energy can change by an incremental amount. The first is a translation of the center of mass of the plates by some distance &lt;math&gt;\delta h&lt;/math&gt;. The second is an incremental change, &lt;math&gt;\delta \alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the hinge angle. Such a change will induce a new moment.

As mentioned, the system will seek the orientation that minimizes &lt;math&gt;\delta \Pi = \delta U - \delta V &lt;/math&gt; in order to find point of stable equilibrium. Writing out these terms more explicitly:

&lt;math&gt; \delta V = \delta W_{H,i} + \delta W_{H,p} - \delta W_{g,p} + \delta W_{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W_{H,i} = \rho g\int \eta(x)dx\delta\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W_{H,p} = \rho g\left( \left(2bh \text{cos}\alpha + b^2 \text{cos}\alpha \text{sin}\alpha\right) \delta h + \left( \frac{b^3}{3}\text{sin}\alpha + b^2 h\right) \delta\alpha\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W_{g,p} = \rho_s g t\left(2b\delta h + b^2 \text{cos}\left(\alpha\right)\delta\alpha\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W_{\sigma} = 2\sigma\left( \text{sin}\phi\delta h + b\left(\text{sin}\left(\phi-\alpha\right)\delta\alpha\right)\right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \delta U = \sigma\delta \mathcal{L} + 4K_s\alpha\delta\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\eta(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the equation air/water interface, &lt;math&gt;\delta\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the incremental displacement of the interface, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension of water.

For a given value of &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt;, stable equilibrium configurations are identified as being those values of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta\Pi}{\delta h} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta\Pi}{\delta\alpha} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Taken in a different light, these conditions can be seen as identifying &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that result in zero net force and zero net torque for a given &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt;.

===Analytical results for maximum load===

Defining non-dimensional plate length &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{b}{2 l_c}&lt;/math&gt;, non-dimensional plate edge depth &lt;math&gt; H = \frac{h}{l_c}&lt;/math&gt;, and non-dimensional load &lt;math&gt;D = \frac{\rho_s-\rho}{\rho}\frac{t}{l_c}&lt;/math&gt;, Burton and Bush derived the following analytical results:

&lt;math&gt; H_{\text{max}, D} = \frac{2\left(\sqrt{2}+\beta\right)}{\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}\beta + \beta^2}} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \alpha_{\text{max}, D} = \text{arcos}\left( \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{8+\beta^2\left(-2+\sqrt{2}\beta\right)}{16+\beta^2} }\right) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; D_{\text{max}} = \frac{\beta}{4} + \sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{\beta} &lt;/math&gt;

The equations for &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; give the configuration parameters that give the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. For further insight, it is helpful to examine various regimes of the non-dimensional plate length, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

====Case 1: Small scale &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;&lt; H &lt;/math&gt;====

When the characteristic plate length is much smaller than the characteristic plate edge depth, the effects of gravity, surface tension, and spring energy become dominant. In this limiting case, it turns out that flexibility does not improve load-bearing capabilities of the plates; indeed, the optimal configuration is a flat plate. Since the plate length is so much smaller than the displacement from the undisturbed water line, the extra fluid displaced by bending a rigid plate is outweighed by the loss of fluid in the column above the plate.

====Case 2: Mid scale &lt;math&gt; \beta \sim H &lt;/math&gt; ====

In this regime, flexibility may or may not improve load-bearing capabilities of the plates. The two characteristics lengths are of comparable dimension, so particular values for each determine whether or not additional fluid displaced through bending exceeds fluid lost through the narrowing of the column.

====Case 3: Large scale &lt;math&gt;\beta &gt;&gt; H &lt;/math&gt;====

In this regime, the benefit of flexibility is most pronounced. The characteristic plate length is significantly longer than the characteristic depth to which the plate is submerged beneath the water line. As a result, the narrowing column above the plate is negligible, which the additional displacement of water due to bending is significant.

===Extensions to continuously deformable body===

To relate this mathematical to physical systems, the above analysis can be extended to continuously deformable bodies. Generalizing the equations of the two plate system allows one to write a corresponding set of equations for the case of a continuously deformable plate. This continuously deformable plate is composed of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; sub-plates, where similar force and torque equilibrium conditions described before must be satisfied for each sub-plate. Such analysis reveals that for a highly compliant 2D structure with a characteristic length much greater than the capillary length, the shape bearing the highest load is a perfect semi-circle. As stiffness increases, the semi-circle is deformed to shapes with lower [[curvature]].

This initial look at continuously deformable bodies represents an initial stab into a very complicated problem. With the groundwork laid here in this analysis, it is likely that future works will implement this general ideology in a finite element approach. Doing so will allow much closer simulation of real world phenomena and will aid in determining how effects of elasticity can aid in the design of robots, instruments, and other devices that operate along the water line.

==Examples in nature==

===Fire ants===
[[File:Fire ants cluster in water.jpg|thumbnail|left|To survive floods, colonies of fire ants will join limbs to create a living raft.]]

In the Brazilian rain forest, sudden rainfall can trigger flooding at a moment's notice. Given that flooding can potentially destroy a colony and drown the insects, [[fire ants]] have developed a unique adaptation to this situation. While individual fire ants are hydrophobic and flounder at the waters surface, large groups of ants can link together to form a living raft. As the queen and larvae are evacuated from the flooding colony, they sit upon this living raft, floating along the waterline until reaching some solid land.

The importance of flexibility in this self-assembled ant raft is several fold. The extra weight-bearing that flexibility imparts is vital as hungry fish will swim along the underside of the raft and eat at many of the members. Furthermore, as waves travel along the water surface, the ant raft's flexibility allows it to effectively "roll" with the wave and minimize disturbances it would otherwise cause for a similar but rigid structure.

===Aquatic vegetation===
[[File:Dscn3156-daisy-water 1200x900.jpg|thumbnail|right|To protect its reproductive material, the daisy's petals fold in during floods to prevent the rush of water.]]

Among aquatic vegetation, the [[Nymphaeaceae|lily pad]] is perhaps the most recognizable, commonly associated with ponds and lakes. Their flexibility allows for increased loads, enabling them to support animals, such as frogs, many times their own weight.

Some aquatic flowers, such as the daisy [[Bellis perennis]], use compliance as a survival mechanism. Such flowers have roots that extend down to the underlying soil, anchoring the flower to the surface of the water. When flooding occurs, the petals pull inward and deform the water line, shielding the genetic material in the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reis|first=Pedro M. |author2=Hure, Jérémy |author3=Jung, Sungwan |author4=Bush, John W.M. |author5=Clanet, Cristophe |title=Grabbing water |journal=Soft Matter |year=2010 |volume=6 |issue=22 |pages=5705–5708 |doi=10.1039/c0sm00895h|arxiv=1207.3756 |bibcode=2010SMat....6.5705R |hdl=1721.1/77954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some flowers are even known to completely close up into a shell in this fashion, trapping air inside.

'''Form perception''' is the recognition of visual elements of objects, specifically those to do with shapes, patterns and previously identified important characteristics. An object is perceived by the [[retina]] as a [[two-dimensional]] image,&lt;ref name=tse&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tse|first=P.|author2=Hughes|title=Visual Form Perception|journal=The Encyclopedia of Neuroscience|year=2004|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the image can vary for the same object in terms of the context with which it is viewed, the apparent size of the object, the angle from which it is viewed, how illuminated it is, as well as where it resides in the field of vision.&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Thomas|author2=Hogendoorn, Kanai, Mesik, Turret|title=High temporal resolution decoding of object position and category|journal=Journal of Vision|year=2011|volume=10|issue=9|pages=1–17|doi=10.1167/11.10.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Despite the fact that each instance of observing an object leads to a unique retinal response pattern, the [[visual processing]] in the brain is capable of recognizing these experiences as analogous, allowing invariant [[object recognition]].&lt;ref name=dicarlo&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiCarlo|first=James|author2=Zoccolan, Rust|title=How does the brain solve visual object recognition?|journal=Neuron|year=2012|issue=3|pages=415–434|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2012.01.010|volume=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual processing occurs in a hierarchy with the lowest levels recognizing lines and contours, and slightly higher levels performing tasks such as completing boundaries and recognizing contour combinations. The highest levels integrate the perceived information to recognize an entire object.&lt;ref name=changizi&gt;{{cite book|last=Changizi|first=Mark|title=The Vision Revolution|year=2010|publisher=BenBella Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially object recognition is the ability to assign labels to objects in order to categorize and identify them, thus distinguishing one object from another.&lt;ref name=dicarlo /&gt; During visual processing information is not created, but rather reformatted in a way that draws out the most detailed information of the stimulus.&lt;ref name=dicarlo/&gt;

==Physiology==

Form perception is a demanding task for the brain because a retina has a significant blind spot and [[retinal vein]]s that obstruct light from reaching cells that detect light, or [[photoreceptor cell]]s. The brain handles the blind spots through boundary processes, includes perceptual grouping, boundary completion, and [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure-ground separation]], and through surface processing, including compensation for variable illumination (“discounting the illuminant”), and filling blank areas with the surviving illuminant-discounted signals.&lt;ref name="cns"&gt;http://cns.bu.edu/~steve/GrossbergFormPerception2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to photoreceptors, the eye requires a properly functioning lens, retina, and an undamaged [[optic nerve]] to recognize form. Light travels through the lens, hits the retina, activates the appropriate photoreceptors, depending on available light, which convert the light into an electrical signal that travels along the optic nerve to the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] of the [[thalamus]] and then to the [[primary visual cortex]]. In the cortex, the adult brain processes information such as lines, orientation, and color. These inputs are integrated in the occipito-temporal cortex where a representation of the object as a whole is created. Visual information continues to be processed in the posterior [[parietal cortex]], also known as the dorsal stream, where the representation of an object’s shape is formed using motion-based cues. It is believed that simultaneously information is processed in the anterior temporal cortex, also known as the ventral stream, where object recognition, identification and naming occur. In the process of recognizing an object, both the dorsal and ventral streams are active, but the ventral stream is more important in discriminating between and recognizing objects. The dorsal stream contributes to object recognition only when two objects have similar shapes and the images are degraded.  Observed latency in activation of different parts of the brain supports the idea of hierarchal processing of visual stimuli, with object representations progressing from simple to  complex.&lt;ref name="cns" /&gt;

==Development==
By five months of age infants are capable of using line junction information to perceive [[3D image|three-D images]], including depth and shape, like adults are able.&lt;ref name=corrow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corrow|first=Sherryse|author2=Granrud, Mathison, Yonas|title=Infants and adults use line junction information to perceive 3D shape|journal=Journal of Vision|year=2012|volume=12|series=1|issue=8|pages=1–7|doi=10.1167/12.1.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are differences between younger infants and adults in the ability to use motion and color cues to discriminate between two objects.&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilcox|first=Teresa|author2=Stubbs, Hirshowitz, Boas|title=Functional activation of the infant cortex during object processing|journal=NeuroImage|year=2012|issue=3|pages=1833–1840|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.05.039|volume=62|pmc=3457789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual information then continues to be processed in the posterior parietal cortex, also known as the [[dorsal stream]], where the representation of an objects shape is formed using motion-based cues.&lt;ref name=wilcox /&gt; The identification of differences between the infant and adult brain make it clear that there is either functional reorganization of the infant’s cortex or simply age related differences in which the breed impulses have been observed in infants. Although the infant brain is not identical to the adult brain, it is similar with areas of specialization and a hierarchy of processing&lt;ref name=wilcox /&gt;. However, adult abilities to perceive form from stationary viewing are not fully understood.&lt;ref name= kellmanlab&gt;http://kellmanlab.psych.ucla.edu/HPL/files/Kellman%20%26%20Short%20-%20Development%20of%203D%20Form%20Perception%20(JEP%201987.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dysfunction==

Dysfunctions in distinguishing differences in sizes and shapes of objects can have many causes, including [[brain injury]], [[stroke]], [[epilepsy]], and [[oxygen deprivation]]. [[Lesion]]s on the brain that develop as a result of injury or illness impair object recognition. Regions that specifically lead to deficits in object recognition when a lesion is present include the right lateral fusiform gyrus and the ventrolateral  occipito-temporal cortex. These areas are crucial to the processing of shape and contour information, which is the basis for object recognition.&lt;ref name=konen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konen|first=Christina|author2=Behrmann, Nishimura, Kastner|title=The functional neuroanatomy of object agnosia: a case study|journal=Neuron|year=2011|issue=1|pages=49–60|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.05.030|volume=71|pmid=21745637|pmc=4896507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is evidence to support that damage to the areas mentioned leads to deficits in object recognition, it is important to note that brain damage, regardless of the cause, typically is extensive and present on both halves of the brain, complicating the identification of key structures.[12] Although most damage cannot be undone, there is evidence of reorganization in the unaffected areas of the affected hemisphere, making it possible for patients to regain some abilities.&lt;ref name=karnath&gt;{{cite journal|last=karnath|first=Hans-Otto|author2=Ruter, Mandler, Himmelbach|title=The anatomy of object recognition - visual form agnosia caused by medial occipitotemporal stroke|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=29|series=18|pages=5854–5862|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5192-08.2009|pmid=19420252|issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysfunctions in form perception occur in several areas that involve visual processing, which is how visual information is interpreted. These dysfunctions have nothing to do with actual vision but rather affect how the brain understands what the eye sees.  Problems can occur in the areas of visual closure, visual-spatial relationships, visual memory, and visual tracking. After identifying the specific visual problem that exists, intervention can include eye exercises, work with computer programs, neurotherapy, physical activities, and academic adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adhd.com.au/Visual_Processing_Disorders.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Injury and illness===
Potential injuries to the brain include but are not limited to [[stroke]], oxygen deprivation, blunt force trauma, and surgical injuries. When patients have lesions on their brain that develop as a result of injury or illness, such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or [[epilepsy]], it is possible that they may have impaired object recognition which can manifest in the form of many different [[agnosia]]s.&lt;ref name=konen /&gt; Similar deficits have also been observed adults that have suffered blunt force trauma, strokes, severe carbon monoxide poisoning as well as in adults that have surgical damage following removal of tumors.&lt;ref name=karnath /&gt; Deficits have also been observed in children with types of epilepsy that do not lead to the formation of lesions.&lt;ref name=brancati&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brancati|first=Claudia|author2=Barba, Metitieri, Melani, Pellacani, Viggiano, Guerrini|title=Impaired object identification in idiopathic childhood occipital epilepsy|journal=Epilepsia|year=2012|volume=53|issue=4|pages=686–694|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2012.03410.x|pmid=22352401}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that in these cases the seizures cause a functional disruption that is capable of interfering with the processing of objects.&lt;ref name=brancati /&gt; Regions that specifically lead to deficits in object recognition when a lesion is present include the right lateral fusiform gyrus and the ventrolateral or ventromedial occipito-temporal cortex.&lt;ref name=karnath /&gt;&lt;ref name=brancati /&gt;  These structures have all been identified as being crucial to the processing of shape and contour information, which is the basis for object recognition.&lt;ref name=karnath /&gt; Although people with damage to these structures are not able to properly recognize objects, they are still capable of discerning the movement of objects.&lt;ref name=karnath /&gt; Only lesions in the parietal lobe have been associated with deficits in identifying the location of an object.&lt;ref name=pennick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pennick|first=Mark|author2=Kana|title=Specialization and integration of brain responses to object recognition and location detection|journal=Brain and Behavior|year=2011|pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is strong evidence to support that damage to the above-mentioned areas leads to deficits in object recognition it is important to note that brain damage, regardless of the cause, is typically extensive and present on both halves of the brain, complicating the identification of key structures.&lt;ref name=konen /&gt; Although most damage cannot be undone, there is evidence of reorganization in the unaffected areas of the affected hemisphere, making it possible for patients to regain some function.&lt;ref name=konen /&gt;

===Aging===
Whether or not visual form learning is retained in older humans is unknown.  Studies prove that training causes improvement in form perception in both young and old adults. Learning to integrate local elements is negatively affected by age, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kuai|first=Shu-Guang|title=Learning to See, but not Discriminate, Visual Forms Is Impaired in Aging|journal=[[Psychological Science]]|year=2013|volume=24|issue=4| doi=10.1177/0956797612459764| first2=Z.| pages=412–422|last2=Kourtzi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancing age hinders the ability to process stimuli efficiently to identify objects. More specifically, recognizing the most basic visual components of an object takes a lot longer. Since the time it takes to recognize the object-parts is expanded, the recognition of the object itself is also delayed.&lt;ref name=cabeza&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cabeza|first=R|author2=Nyberg|title=Cognitive neuroscience of aging: linking cognitive and cerebral aging|journal=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of partially blocked objects also slows down as we age In order to recognize an object that is partially obscured we need to make perceptual inferences based on the contours and borders that we can see. This is something that most young adults are able to do, but it slows down with age.&lt;ref name=danzigera&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danzigera|first=W.|author2=Salthouseb|title=Age and the perception of incomplete figures|journal=[[Experimental Aging Research]]|year=1978|volume=4|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, aging causes a decrease in the processing capabilities of the central nervous system, which delays the very complex process of form perception.&lt;ref name=cabeza /&gt;

'''Fourth Bottom Line''' is a concept extended from the [[Triple bottom line]]; instead of simply focusing on the 3 Ps: people, planet and profit, this concept involves extending to a fourth factor which not only has motivation for a business but also transcends to a humanistic value and beyond by factoring in terms such as "spirituality",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "ethics",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Environmental Ethics and Sustainability: A Casebook for Environmental Professionals|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jM7MBQAAQBAJ|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2013-07-29|isbn = 9781466584211|language = en|first = Hal|last = Taback|first2 = Ram|last2 = Ramanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; "purpose",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "culture", "compassion".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Compassion as the fourth bottom line?|url = http://valuesbased.biz/2014/08/10/compassion/|website = The Values-Based Business|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triple Bottom Line==
{{main article|Triple bottom line}}

In traditional business accounting and common usage, the "[[bottom line]]" refers to either the "profit" or "loss", which is usually recorded at the very bottom line on a statement of revenue and expenses. Over the last 50 years, environmentalists and "social justice" advocates have struggled to bring a broader definition of bottom line into public consciousness by introducing [[full cost accounting]]. For example, if a corporation shows a monetary profit, but their asbestos mine causes thousands of deaths from asbestosis, and their copper mine pollutes a river, and the government ends up spending taxpayer money on health care and river clean-up, how do we perform a full societal [[cost benefit analysis]]? The triple bottom line adds two more "bottom lines”: social and environmental (ecological) concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/ges/umw/dos/nac/den/en3106180.htm Sustainability – From Principle To Practice] ''[[Goethe-Institut]]'', March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With the ratification of the [[United Nations]] and [[ICLEI]] TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/delc/Portals/119/industrryRoleOfIndclean.pdf Enhancing the role of industry through for example, private-public partnerships], May 2011. [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; this became the dominant approach to [[public sector]] full cost accounting.  Similar UN standards apply to [[natural capital]] and [[human capital]] measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting [[ecological footprint]]. The TBL seems to be fairly widespread in South African media, as found in a 1990-2008 study of worldwide national newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;What the Papers Say: Trends in Sustainability'' [[Ralf Barkemeyer et al]]'', Spring 2009, Greenleaf Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept of the Fourth Bottom Line==

On the whole, the multiple bottom lines are a concept that help clearly define parts in 
the ecosystem. In addition to the above-mentioned triple bottom line's people, planet, and profit, there is a fourth component, ''purpose''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term was first coined and introduced into mainstream usage by [[Ayman Sawaf]] in a bid to factor in the return to one's ''spiritual self'' as an additional, fourth bottom line. Spirituality, according to Sawaf, is defined as your own unique relationship and partnership with God or The Divine. It is great to make money, to have a positive impact on society/people and the environment. It is also important to have a positive impact on one’s own spiritual growth. The fourth bottom line lifts business activities to a sacred form. The fourth bottom line is measured by how much more loving, understanding, happy, joyful, in touch with their destiny, deeper relationship or partnership with god or higher powers the person has become, while performing their business responsibilities. And as these qualities are acquired they are infused back into one's own business activities&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sacred Commerce: A Blueprint for a New Humanity (2nd Edition)|last = Sawaf|first = Ayman|publisher = EQ Enterprises|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-9906987-0-8|location = |pages = 24–28|last2 = Gabrielle|first2 = Rowan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition, thus, identified spirituality as the fourth bottom line by businesses that relate it with happiness of stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Happiness-Spirituality as The Fourth Bottom Line {{!}} Triple Bottom Line Magazine|url = http://www.tbl.com.pk/happiness-spirituality-as-the-fourth-bottom-line/|website = www.tbl.com.pk|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = T02-Fourth Bottom Line|url = https://futuristguy.wordpress.com/tutorial-02/|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is when the question of ''why'' one is doing business becomes relevant. The first bottom line deals with the ''what''. "What do I get?" is usually measured by money. The second and third bottom lines deal with the ''how''. "How will I do this?" factors in that the means of doing business now matters. The question of whether one is doing business with honesty, trust, character, integrity, without hurting people and the environment. The Fourth Bottom Line has to do with ''why''. To ask oneself, "Why am I doing this?" involves a deeper sense of [[self]] being nurtured by such a choice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With the fourth bottom line, commerce/business becomes a spiritual path. The context of spirituality as a fourth factor is further elaborated upon by Dr. Sohail Inayatullah, a professor at [[Tamkang University]] and [[Queensland University of Technology]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spirituality as the fourth bottom line? {{!}} USC Research Bank - University of the Sunshine Coast|url = http://research.usc.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/usc:11504|website = research.usc.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SPIRITUALITY AS THE FOURTH BOTTOM LINE|url = http://www.metafuture.org/Articles/spirituality_bottom_line.htm|website = www.metafuture.org|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth bottom line is also conceptualized based on the fact that improving lives can be a factor valuable enough to rival other business objectives due to being a key motivating factor for any business to continue. The concept introduces the fourth bottom line as being a way to utilize core business principles to factor in compassion, for example by being compassionate to the customers and hence developing value for the business in an [[altruistic]] way.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

{{emotion}}

'''Hatred''' or '''hate''' is a [[human]] [[emotion]]. Hatred could invoke feelings of [[wikt:animosity|animosity]], [[anger]] or [[resentment]], which can be directed against certain individuals, [[Social group|group]]s, [[entity|entities]], objects, [[behavior]]s, [[concept]]s, or [[idea]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, A.S., &amp; Reber, E. (2002). ''The Penguin dictionary of psychology''. New York: [[Penguin Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatred is often associated with feelings of [[anger]], [[disgust]] and a [[disposition]] towards the source of [[hostility]].

== As emotion ==
As an emotion, hatred can be short-lived or long-lasting.&lt;ref&gt;Y Ito ed., ''Encyclopedia of Emotion'' (2010) p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; It can be of low intensity - 'I hate broccoli' - or high intensity: 'I hate the whole world'.&lt;ref&gt;S Kucuk, ''Brand Hate'' (2016) p. 12-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Steinberg]] saw three main elements in hatred: 
# a negation of intimacy, by creating distance when closeness had become threatening; 
# an infusion of passion, such as fear or anger; 
# a decision to devalue a previously valued object.&lt;ref&gt;Y Ito ed., ''Encyclopedia of Emotion'' (2010) p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;
The important self-protective function, to be found in hatred,&lt;ref&gt;I Craib, ''Psychoanalysis'' (Cambridge 2001) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; can be illustrated by Steinberg's analysis of 'mutinous' hatred, whereby a dependent relationship is repudiated in a quest for autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Y Ito ed., ''Encyclopedia of Emotion'' (2010) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Psychoanalytic views ==
[[Dr. Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud]] defined hate as an ego state that wishes to destroy the source of its unhappiness, stressing that it was linked to the question of self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, 'The instincts and their vicissitudes' (1915) in ''On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 135-5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Winnicott]] highlighted the developmental step involved in hatred, with its recognition of an outside object: "As compared to magical destruction, aggressive ideas and behaviour take on a positive value, and hate becomes a sign of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;D W Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Penguin 1973) p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

In his wake, [[Object relations theory]] has emphasised the importance of recognising hate in the analytic setting: the analyst acknowledges his own hate (as revealed in the strict time-limits and the fee charged),&lt;ref&gt;J Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis'' (London 1988) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn may make it possible for the patient to acknowledge and contain ''their'' previously concealed hate for the analyst.&lt;ref&gt;I Craib, ''Psychoanalysis'' (Cambridge 2001) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]] went so far as to suggest that true kindness is impossible in a relationship without hating and being hated, so that an unsentimental acknowledgement of interpersonal frustrations and their associated hostilities can allow real fellow-feeling to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;A Phillips/B Taylor, ''On Kindness'' (London 2004) p. 93-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In the English language, a [[hate crime]] (also known as a "bias-motivated crime") generally refers to [[crime|criminal acts]] which are seen to have been motivated by hate. Those who commit hate crimes target victims because of their perceived membership in a certain [[social group]], usually defined by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], [[mental disorder]], [[disability]], [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[Ageing|age]], [[gender identity]], or [[political affiliation]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Stotzer, R.: [http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Stotzer-Comparison-Hate-Crime-June-2007.pdf Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups], [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06. Retrieved on 2007-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents may involve [[physical assault]], [[destruction of property]], [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[verbal abuse]] or [[insults]], or offensive graffiti or letters ([[hate mail]]).&lt;ref name="ovrbwx"&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/ Hate crime] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126000000/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/ |date=November 26, 2005 }}, [[Home Office]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hate speech]] is speech perceived to disparage a person or group of people based on their social or ethnic group,&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com: Hate speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hate%20speech |title=Dictionary.com: Hate speech |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[Ageing|age]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[mental disorder]], [[disability]], [[language]] ability, [[ideology]], [[social class]], occupation, appearance (height, weight, skin color, etc.), mental capacity, and any other distinction that might be considered a liability. The term covers written as well as oral communication and some forms of behaviors in a public setting. It is also sometimes called [[antilocution]] and is the first point on [[Allport's scale]] which measures [[prejudice]] in a society. In many countries, deliberate use of hate speech is a [[criminal offence]] prohibited under ''incitement to hatred'' legislation.  It is often alleged that the criminalization of hate speech is sometimes used to discourage legitimate discussion of negative aspects of voluntary behavior (such as political persuasion, religious adherence and philosophical allegiance). There is also some question as to whether or not hate speech falls under the protection of freedom of speech in some countries.

Both of these classifications have sparked debate, with counter-arguments such as, but not limited to, a difficulty in distinguishing motive and intent for crimes, as well as philosophical debate on the validity of valuing targeted hatred as a greater crime than general [[misanthropy]] and contempt for humanity being a potentially equal crime in and of itself.

== Neurological research ==
The neural correlates of hate have been investigated with an [[fMRI]] procedure. In this experiment, people had their brains scanned while viewing pictures of people they hated. The results showed increased activity in the [[middle frontal gyrus]], right [[putamen]], bilaterally in the [[premotor cortex]], in the [[frontal pole]], and bilaterally in the medial [[insular cortex]] of the [[human brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Zeki, S. |author2=Romaya, J.P. |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003556;jsessionid=0C68BB34FD6B6212E02B082F9B250990 |title=Neural Correlates of Hate |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=3 |issue=10 |pages=e3556 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003556 |pmid=18958169 |pmc=2569212 |authorlink1=Semir Zeki |editor1-last=Lauwereyns |editor1-first=Jan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103151609/http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003556;jsessionid=0C68BB34FD6B6212E02B082F9B250990 |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnolinguistics==
Hate, like love, takes different shapes and forms in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Underhill, ''[[Ethnolinguistics]] and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war'', (2012) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; While it may be fair to say that one single emotion exists in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] (haine), and [[German language|German]] (Hass), hate is historically situated and culturally constructed: it varies in the forms in which it is manifested. Thus a certain relationless hatred is expressed in the French expression ''J'ai la haine'', which has no precise equivalent in English; while for English-speakers, loving and hating invariably involve an object, or a person, and therefore, a relationship with something or someone, ''J'ai la haine'' (literally, I have hate) precludes the idea of an emotion directed at a person.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Underhill, ''[[Ethnolinguistics]] and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war'', (2012) p. 161-2&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of frustration, apathy and animosity which churns within the subject but establishes no relationship with the world, other than an aimless desire for destruction. 

French forms of [[anti-Americanism]] have been seen as a specific form of cultural resentment, registering joy-in-hate.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Underhill, ''[[Ethnolinguistics]] and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war'', (2012) p. 173-181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious perspectives==

===Old Testament===
The Hebrew word describing David's "perfect hatred" (KJV) means that it "brings a process to completion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=R Laird|title=Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament|date=10/01/2003|publisher=Moody Publishers; New Edition|isbn=0802486495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary explications==
*[[W B Yeats]] had his (imaginary) hermit Ribh proclaim:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I study hatred with great diligence,
For that's a passion in my own control,
A sort of besom that can clear the soul
Of everything that is not mind or sense."&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (London 1983) p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Doris Lessing]] considered there was a hate-region of the mind that could be tapped rather like a radio: "you discover hatred is a kind of wavelength you can tune into...''plugged into Hater''."&lt;ref&gt;D Lessing, ''The Four-Gated City'' (London 1993) p. 69 and p. 564&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heart corazón.svg|thumb|A conventional heart symbol]]
The '''heart shape''' ({{red|♥}}) is an [[ideograph]] used to express the idea of the "heart" in its [[heart (metaphor)|metaphorical]] or [[symbol]]ic sense as the center of [[human emotion|emotion]], including [[affection]] and [[love]], especially [[romantic love]].

The "wounded heart" indicating [[lovesickness]] came to be depicted as a heart symbol pierced with an arrow ([[Cupid]]'s), or heart symbol "broken" in two or more pieces.

==History==

===Origins of symbol===
Greek. In the 6th-5th century BC, the heart shape was used to represent the heart-shaped fruit of the plant [[Silphium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Favorito|first=E. N.|last2=Baty |first2=K.|date=February 1995|title=The Silphium Connection|journal=Celator|volume=9|issue=2|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a plant possibly used as a contraceptive&lt;ref name ="Straight Dope"&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/061013.html ''Did the ancient Romans use a natural herb for birth control?''], [[The Straight Dope]],  October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many species in the [[Apiaceae|parsley family]] have [[estrogen]]ic properties, and some, such as [[wild carrot]], were used to induce abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance|first1=John M.|last1=Riddle|pp=58|publisher=harvard university press|year=1994|isbn=978-0674168763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver coins from Cyrene of the 6–5th BC bear a similar design, sometimes accompanied by a silphium plant and is understood to represent its seed or fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buttrey |first=T. V. |date=Spring–Summer 1992 |url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/34-1-2/Buttrey.pdf |title=The Coins and the Cult |journal=Expedition |volume=34 |issue=1–2 |pages=59–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that the heart symbol was found in devotion to God. The symbol appears as one rights themselves up, after having prayed with one's head to the ground. The hands form the symbol as one is in the process of standing up. 

===Earliest use===
[[File:Roman de la poire heart metaphor.jpg|thumb|The earliest known visual depiction of a heart symbol, as a lover hands his heart to the beloved lady, in a manuscript of the ''[[Roman de la poire]]'', mid-13th century.]]
The combination of the heart shape and its use within the heart metaphor developed at the end of the [[Middle Ages]], although the shape has been used in many ancient epigraphy monuments and texts.  With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp (2011), 96–99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of ivy and of the water-lily. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's "sweet gaze" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel.  The heart here resembles a pine cone (held "upside down", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into "Novel Of The Pear" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.&lt;ref name="Vinken 2001"&gt;Vinken (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held "upside down"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Vinken 2001"/&gt;

The "scalloped" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''Documenti d'amore ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459–70, fol 192v. Royal Library of Belgium). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.&lt;ref&gt;Vinken (2001): "The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since."&lt;/ref&gt; The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various hypotheses attempted to connect the "heart shape" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.&lt;ref name="mcdonell"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.  Specific suggestions include: the shape of the seed of the [[silphium]] plant, used in ancient times as an [[herbal contraceptive]],&lt;ref name="mcdonell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/sowing-the-seeds-of-love-20060212-ge1qsr.html|title=Sowing the seeds of love|first=Luke|last=Benedictus|date=12 February 2006|website=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stylized depictions of features of the human female body, such as the female's [[breasts]], [[buttocks]], [[mons pubis|pubic mound]], or spread [[vulva]].&lt;ref&gt;proposed by [[Gloria Steinem]] in the 1998 introduction to the ''[[Vagina Monologues]]'' [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/random043/97029393.htm online copy]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; "For example, the shape we call a heart—whose symmetry resembles the vulva far more than the asymmetry of the organ that shares its name—is probably a residual female genital symbol. It was reduced from power to romance by centuries of male dominance.", based on an earlier suggestion by Tanzer (1969) that the shape was used as a symbol indicating brothels in ancient Pompeii. Tanzer (1969). ''The Common People of Pompeii. A study of the graffiti. With illustrations and a map ''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance and early modern===
[[File:Empress Zoe mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumbnail|Mosaic of the Empress Zoe in the Hagia Sophia, 1239]]
Heart shapes can be seen on the [[Bible]] Jesus holds in the [[Zoë Porphyrogenita|Empress Zoë]] mosaic in the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]], but a reference to the organ was probably not intended.  It probably dates from 1239.

Likewise, heart shapes can be seen on various [[stucco]] reliefs and wall panels excavated from the ruins of [[Ctesiphon]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] capital (circa 90 BC – 637 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Roundel with radiating palmettes.

The [[Luther rose]] was the [[seal (device)|seal]] that was designed for [[Martin Luther]] at the behest of Prince [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick]], in 1530, while Luther was staying at the [[Coburg]] Fortress during the [[Diet of Augsburg]]. Luther wrote an explanation of the symbol to [[Lazarus Spengler]]: "a black cross in a heart, which retains its natural color, so that I myself would be reminded that faith in the Crucified saves us. 'For one who believes from the heart will be justified' ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 10:10)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/Playing%20Cards/decks/france/index.html gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010201917/http://gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/Playing%20Cards/decks/france/index.html |date=2006-10-10 }}, [http://i-p-c-s.org/faq/history_6.php i-p-c-s.org] {{cite web |url=http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/p-11469.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927130238/http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/p-11469.jpg |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }} [http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/a-history-of-wood-engraving.htm antiquemapsandprints.com], obviously more research is needed here. {{unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aorta]] remains visible, as a protrusion at the top centered between the two "chambers" indicated in the symbol, in some depictions of the Sacred Heart well into the 18th century, and is partly still shown today (although mostly obscured by elements such as a crown, flames, rays, or a cross) but the "hearts" suit did not have this element since the 15th century.

The heart symbol reached Japan with the [[Nanban trade]] of 1543 to 1614, as evidenced by an [[Edo period]] [[Samurai armor|Samurai]] helmet (dated c. 1630), which includes both the rounded and indented forms of the heart symbol, representing the heart of [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marishiten]], goddess of archers.&lt;ref&gt;Samurai helmet representing the flaming jewel, by Unkai Mitsuhisa ca 1630, Ann and Gabriel Barbier-Mueller Collection, exhibited at Boston Fine Arts Museum,  April–August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
Since the 19th century, the symbol has often been used on [[Valentine's Day]] [[greeting card|cards]], [[candy]] boxes, and similar [[popular culture]] artifacts as a symbol of [[romantic love]].

The use of the heart symbol as a [[logograph]] for the English verb "to love" derives from the use in "[[I ♥ NY]]," introduced in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;"Subsequently the heart symbol became a shorthand for enthusiasm for everything form software to Yorkshire terriers. It was a stamp that validated lifestyles. People could ♥ their grandchildren or line dancing or Buddha." Stephen Amidon, Thomas Amidon, ''The Sublime Engine: A Biography of the Human Heart'' (2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart symbols were used to symbolize [[Health (gaming)|"health" or "lives"]] in [[video game]]s; influentially so in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986). ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (1987, 1988) had a "life bar" composed of [[hexagon]]s, but in 1990s remakes of these games, the hexagons were replaced by heart shapes. Since the 1990s, the heart symbol has also been used as an ideogram indicating health outside of the video gaming context, e.g. its use by restaurants to indicate heart-healthy nutrient content claim (e.g. "low in [[cholesterol]]"). A copyrighted "heart-check" symbol to indicate heart-healthy food was introduced by the [[American Heart Association]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;"the heart-check mark that began to appear on a wide array of food packaging in 1995. The symbol consists of a heart branded with a bold, efficient check mark. It is copyrighted by the American Heart Association (AHA) which licences it for a nominal fee to companies whose products meet the organization's criteria for saturated fat and cholesterol content." Stephen Amidon, Thomas Amidon, ''The Sublime Engine: A Biography of the Human Heart'' (2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
{{Hatnote|"Heart field" or "heart shield" are terms for an [[inescutcheon]] placed ''en surtout''.}}
[[File:COA family de Fürsten von Lüneburg.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of the [[Principality of Lüneburg]], originating with [[William of Winchester, Lord of Lüneburg]] (d. 1213) who married [[Helena of Denmark|Helena]], daughter of [[Valdemar I of Denmark]], and therefore adopted the "Danish tincture" to the arms of his father, [[Henry the Lion]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Weyers in: Stengel (ed.), ''Archiv für Diplomatik: Schriftgeschichte, Siegel, und Wappenkunde'', Volume 54, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jNPEDfce9fgC&amp;pg=PA100 p. 100].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The earliest heart-shaped charges in heraldry appear in the 12th century; the hearts in the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] go back to the royal banner of the kings of Denmark, in turn based on a seal used as early as the 1190s. However, while the charges are clearly heart-shaped, they did not in origin depict hearts, or symbolize any idea related to love. Instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the [[Nuphar|water-lily]]. Early heraldic heart-shaped charges depicting the leaves of water-lilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline (''e.g.'' [[Flags of Frisia]]).

Inverted heart symbols have been used in heraldry as stylized [[testicle]]s (''coglioni'' in Italian) as in the [[canting arms]] of the [[Colleoni]] family of Milan.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, John and George Burnett (1969). ''Woodward's a treatise on heraldry, British and foreign'', [https://archive.org/stream/treatiseonherald00wooduoft#page/202/mode/2up page 203]. Originally published 1892, Edinburgh: W. &amp; A. B. Johnson. {{ISBN|0-7153-4464-1}}. {{LCCN|02020303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seal attributed to [[William IV, Lord of Douglas|William, Lord of Douglas]] (of 1333) shows a heart shape, identified as the heart of [[Robert the Bruce]]. The authenticity of this seal is "very questionable",&lt;ref&gt;McAndrew, ''Scotland's Historic Heraldry'', 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QFkI3G31HTMC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. it could possibly date to the late 14th or even the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;McAndrew 2006, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic charges actually representing hearts became more common in the [[early modern period]], with the [[Sacred Heart]] depicted in [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], and hearts representing love appearing in bourgeois coats of arms. Hearts also later became popular elements in municipal coats of arms.

==Botanical symbolism==
{{Main|Silphium}}
There has been some conjecture regarding the link between the traditional heart symbol and images of the fruit of Silphium, a (probably) extinct plant known to [[classical antiquity]] and belonging to the genus [[Ferula]], used as a condiment and medicine, (the medicinal properties including [[contraceptive]] and [[abortifacient]] activity, linking the plant to sexuality and love).&lt;ref&gt;Favorito, E. N.; Baty, K. (February 1995). "The Silphium Connection". Celator. 9 (2): 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver coins from the ancient Libya of the 6th - 5th BC bear images strongly reminiscent of the heart symbol, sometimes accompanied by images of the Silphium plant.&lt;ref&gt;T. V. Buttrey, "The Coins and the Cult", Expedition magazine vol. 34, Nos. 1–2 "Special Issue: Gifts to the Goddesses—Cyrene's Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone", Spring–Summer 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koerper |first1=H. |last2=Kolls |first2=A.

In [[Code page 437]], the original character set of the IBM PC, the value of 3 (hexadecimal 03) represents the heart symbol. This value is shared with the non-printing [[End-of-text character|ETX]] control character, which overrides the glyph in many contexts.

The Unicode character of the letter ''ghan'' of the [[Georgian alphabet]] ([[wikt:ღ|ღ]]) has seen some use as a surrogate heart symbol in online communication.{{according to whom|date=November 2013}}{{year needed|date=November 2013}}

==Parametrisation==
A number of [[parametrisation]]s of approximately heart-shaped [[mathematical curve|curves]] have been described.
The best-known of these is the [[cardioid]], which is an [[epicycloid]] with one [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric W. Weisstein|Weisstein, Eric W.]], "[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cardioid.html Cardioid]" from [[MathWorld]].&lt;/ref&gt; though as the cardioid lacks the point, it may be seen as a stylized water-lily leaf, a so-called [[seeblatt]], rather than a heart. Other curves, such as the [[Level set|implicit curve]] (x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;−x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;y&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=0, may produce better approximations of the heart shape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric W. Weisstein]], [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html "Heart Curve."] From [[MathWorld]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the Max Frisch novel|Homo Faber (novel)}}
{{merge|Artificiality|date=April 2018}}
'''''Homo faber''''' ([[Latin]] for "[[Human being|Man]] the Maker") is the concept that human beings are able to control their fate and their environment as a result of the use of tools.

== Original phrase ==

In Latin literature, [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] uses this term in his ''Sententiæ'', referring to the ability of man to control his destiny and what surrounds him: ''Homo faber suae quisque fortunae'' (Every man is the artifex of his destiny).

In older [[anthropology]] theories, ''Homo faber'', as the "working man", is confronted with ''[[Homo ludens]]'', the "playing man", who is concerned with amusements, humor, and leisure.

== Modern usage ==

The classic ''homo faber suae quisque fortunae'' was "rediscovered" by [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] in 14th century and was central in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

In the 20th century, [[Max Scheler]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]  made the philosophical concept central again.

[[Henri Bergson]] also referred to the concept in ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' (1907), defining [[intelligence]], in its original sense, as the "faculty to create artificial objects, in particular tools to make tools, and to indefinitely variate its makings."

''[[Homo Faber (novel)|Homo Faber]]'' is the title of an influential novel by the Swiss author [[Max Frisch]], published in 1957.

== Other contemporary era mentions ==

''Homo faber'' can be also used in opposition or juxtaposition to ''[[Demiurge|deus faber]]'' ("God the Creator"), an archetype of which are the various [[Vulcan (mythology)|gods of the forge]].

''Homo faber'' is used by [[Pierre Schaeffer]] in the [[Traité des objects Musicaux]] as the man creator of music, which uses its brute experience, an instinctive practice in music creation; Concluding that the ''homo faber''  aways precedes the [[Homo sapiens]] in the process of creation.

Frisch' book was made into the film ''[[Voyager (film)|Voyager]]'', starring [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Julie Delpy]].

''Homo Faber'' was one of the five [[IB Middle Years Programme|IBMYP]] areas of interaction, before it was replaced with "Human Ingenuity".

The concept of ''homo faber'' is referenced in [[Umberto Eco]]'s "Open Work": he refutes its negative connotation and instead argues that ''homo faber'' is a manifestation of man's innate being in nature. Use of ''homo faber'' in this negative light is argued by Eco to represent the alienation from and objectification of nature.

"Homo Faber" is also the title of a short poem by [[Frank Bidart]] that is included in his collection ''Desire'' (1997).

''Homo faber'' is often placed in juxtaposition to ''homo adorans'', the worshiping man.  In other words, under traditional [[Judeo-Christian]] philosophy, the ultimate purpose of humankind is to worship God, whereas, under (for example) [[Marxist]] or [[Capitalist]] ideology, the purpose of humankind was embedded in what he or she can make or produce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6227">'''Hospitium''' ({{lang-gr|ξενία}}, ''[[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'', προξενία) is the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] concept of [[Hospitality|hospitality]] as a divine right of the guest and a divine duty of the host. Similar or broadly equivalent customs were and are also known in other cultures, though not always by that name. Among the Greeks and Romans, hospitium was of a twofold character: private and public.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Hospitium |volume=13 |page=801 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Homer]]ic times, all strangers, without exception, were regarded as being under the protection of [[Zeus#Roles and epithets|Zeus Xenios]], the god of strangers and suppliants, and had the ''right to hospitality''. (It is doubtful whether, as is commonly assumed,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} they were considered as [[ipso facto]] enemies; they were rather guests.) Immediately on his arrival, the stranger was clothed and entertained, and no inquiry was made as to his name or [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedents]] until the duties of hospitality had been fulfilled. When the guest parted from his host he was often presented with gifts (ξένια), and sometimes a die (ἀστράγαλος) was broken between them. Each then took a part, a family connection was established, and the broken die served as a symbol of recognition; thus the members of each family found in the other hosts and protectors in case of need.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Violation by the host of the ''duties of hospitality'' was likely to provoke the wrath of the gods; but it does not appear that anything beyond this religious sanction existed to guard the rights of a traveler. Similar customs seem to have existed among the Italian peoples.{{Tone-inline|date=January 2012}} Amongst the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], private hospitality, which had existed from the earliest times, was more accurately and legally defined than amongst the Greeks, the tie between host and guest being almost as strong as that between patron and client. It was of the nature of a contract, entered into by mutual promise, the clasping of hands, and exchange of an agreement in writing (''tabula hospitalis'') or of a token ([[tessera]] or symbolum), and was rendered hereditary by the division of the tessera. The advantages thus obtained by the guest were, the right of hospitality when traveling and, above all, the protection of his host (representing him as his patron) in a court of law. The contract was sacred and inviolable, undertaken in the name of Jupiter Hospitalis, and could only be dissolved by a formal act.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Public==
This private connection developed into a custom according to which a state appointed one of the citizens of a foreign state as its representative [[Proxenos]] (πρόξενος) to protect any of its citizens travelling or resident in his country. Sometimes an individual came forward voluntarily to perform these duties on behalf of another state ''etheloproxenos'' (ἐθελοπρόξενος). The proxenus is generally compared to the modern consul or minister resident. His duties were to afford hospitality to strangers from the state whose proxenus he was, to introduce its ambassadors, to procure them admission to the assembly and seats in the theatre, and in general to look after the commercial and political interests of the state by which he had been appointed to his office.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Many cases occur where such an office was hereditary; thus the family of [[Callias]] at [[Athens]] were proxeni of the [[Sparta]]ns. We find the office mentioned in a [[Corcyraean]] inscription dating probably from the 7th century BC, and it continued to grow more important and frequent throughout Greek history. There is no proof that any direct emolument was ever attached to the office, while the expense and trouble entailed by it must often have been very great. Probably the honors which it brought with it were sufficient recompense. These consisted partly in the general respect and esteem paid to a proxenus, and partly in many more substantial honors conferred by special decree of the state whose representative he was, such as freedom from taxation and public burdens, the right of acquiring property in Attica, admission to the senate and popular assemblies, and perhaps even full citizenship.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Public hospitium seems also to have existed among the Italian races; but the circumstances of their history prevented it from becoming so important as in Greece. Cases, however, occur of the establishment of public hospitality between two cities ([[Rome]] and [[Caere]], [[Livy]] v. 50), and of towns entering into a position of clientship to some distinguished Roman, who then became patronus of such a town. Foreigners were frequently granted the right of public hospitality by the senate down to the end of the republic. The public ''hospes'' had a right to entertainment at the public expense, admission to sacrifices and games, the right of buying and selling on his own account, and of bringing an action at law without the intervention of a Roman patron.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A full bibliography of the subject will be found in the article in Daremberg and Saglio, ''Dictionnaire des antiquités'', to which may be added [[Rudolf von Jhering]]. ''Die Gastfreundschaft im Altertum'' (1887); see also Smith's ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' (3rd ed., 1890).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Medieval Hospitia==
[[File:Hospitium, York.jpg|thumb|The former Hospitium of [[St Mary's Abbey, York]], England]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], the term was extended, across [[Europe]], to refer to the building or complex of buildings attached to a [[monastery]], where [[pilgrim]]s and other lesser guests could find hospitality or ''hospitium'', including [[dormitory]]-based accommodation.

{{Politics of Malaysia}}

The '''Human Rights Party Malaysia''' is a [[Malaysia]]n [[human rights]]-based [[political party]] founded on 19 July 2009, led by human rights activist [[P. Uthayakumar|P.Uthayakumar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightspartymalaysia.com/2009/07/17/announcement-of-human-rights-party-hrp-malaysia/|title=ANNOUNCEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS PARTY (HRP), MALAYSIA.|publisher=Human Rights Party Malaysia|date=2009-07-17|accessdate=2009-07-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511213120/http://www.humanrightspartymalaysia.com/2009/07/17/announcement-of-human-rights-party-hrp-malaysia/|archivedate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Uthayakumar is the Secretary General (pro tem) of HRP with the support of Uthayakumar's brother and Leader of [[HINDRAF]] [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy|P.Waythamoorthy]].

Human Rights Party Malaysia was formed as a multiracial party which promises that it would carry on with the [[HINDRAF|Hindraf Makkal Sakthi’s]] initial 18-point demands dated August 2007 to the government of Malaysia and in particular Article 8 (Equality before the law) Article 12 (1) (b) (no discrimination) and Article 153(1) (legitimate interests of other communities) of the Federal Constitution. The main thrust of this party is to be the focus group in putting the Malaysian Indians back onto the national mainstream development of Malaysia after 52 years of having been left out.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The party also focus on all other communities that are suffering from the worst forms of violations of human rights in Malaysia, in particular the Malaysian Indians who instead get the least attention not only from the ruling [[UMNO]] regime but also from the opposition parties [[People's Justice Party, Malaysia|PKR]], [[Democratic Action Party|DAP]], [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|PAS]], NGOs, civil society and the print and electronic media generally, albeit to a lesser extent. {{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The main struggle of HRP is against all forms of racism and racial discrimination by the current ruling government in Malaysia, namely UMNO.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Methods of '''hydrogen storage''' for subsequent use span many approaches including high pressures, cryogenics, and chemical compounds that reversibly release H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon heating. [[Underground hydrogen storage]] is useful to provide [[grid energy storage]] for [[intermittent energy source]]s, like [[wind power]], as well as providing fuel for transportation, particularly for ships and airplanes.

Most research into hydrogen storage is focused on storing hydrogen as a lightweight, compact [[energy carrier]] for [[Hydrogen vehicle|mobile applications]].

[[Liquid hydrogen]] or [[slush hydrogen]] may be used, as in the [[Space Shuttle]]. However liquid hydrogen requires [[cryogenic]] storage and boils around 20.268 [[Kelvin|K]] (−252.882&amp;nbsp;°C or −423.188&amp;nbsp;°F). Hence, its [[liquefaction]] imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent [[Boiling point|boil off]] but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less [[energy density]] ''by volume'' than [[hydrocarbon]] fuels such as [[gasoline]] by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: there is actually about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.

[[Compressed hydrogen]], by comparison, is stored quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good [[Energies per unit mass|energy density by weight]], but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it requires a larger tank to store. A large [[hydrogen tank]] will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store the same amount of energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see [[hydrogen tank]]). Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080307082839/http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2005/hydrogen2005.pdf Energy technology analysis]. International Energy Agency (2005) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; to power the compressor. Higher compression without [[energy recovery]] will mean more energy lost to the compression step. Compressed hydrogen storage can exhibit very low [[permeation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |title=Modeling of dispersion following hydrogen permeation for safety engineering and risk assessment |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142016/http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-23 |conference=II International Conference "Hydrogen Storage Technologies" Moscow, Russia, 28–29 October 2009 |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Established technologies==
[[File:Storage Density of Hydrogen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Net storage density of hydrogen]]

=== Compressed hydrogen ===

Compressed hydrogen is a storage form where hydrogen gas is kept under pressures to increase the storage density. Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.&lt;ref name=store&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=8780 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484 |last1=Eberle |first1=Ulrich |first2=Bernd |last2=Mueller |first3=Rittmar |last3=von Helmolt |accessdate=2014-12-19 |doi=10.1039/C2EE22596D |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Car manufacturers have been developing this solution, such as Honda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.honda.com/FCXClarity/package/index.html |website=Honda Worldwide |title=FCX Clarity |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Nissan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |title=X-TRAIL FCV '03 model |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917105718/http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |website=Nissan-global.com |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liquid hydrogen ===

BMW has been working on [[liquid hydrogen]] tanks for cars, producing for example the [[BMW Hydrogen 7]]. Japan have liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage at a tanker port in Kobe, and are anticipated to receive the first shipment of liquid hydrogen via LH2 carrier in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savvides|first1=Nick|title=Japan plans to use imported liquefied hydrogen to fuel Tokyo 2020 Olympics|url=https://fairplay.ihs.com/ship-construction/article/4280251/japan-plans-to-use-imported-liquefied-hydrogen-to-fuel-tokyo-2020-olympics |website=Fairplay|publisher=IHS Markit Maritime Portal|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is liquified by reducing its temperature to -253°C, similar to liquified natural gas (LNG) which is stored at -162°C. A potential efficiency loss of 12.79% can be achieved, or 4.26kWh/kg out of 33.3kWh/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sadaghiani |first1=Mirhadi S. |title=Introducing and energy analysis of a novel cryogenic hydrogen liquefaction process configuration|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=2 March 2017 |volume=42 |issue=9 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals and research==
Hydrogen storage technologies can be divided into physical storage, where hydrogen molecules are stored (including pure hydrogen storage via compression and liquefaction), and chemical storage, where hydrides are stored.

===Chemical storage===
Chemical storage could offer high storage performance due to the strong binding of hydrogen and the high storage densities. However, the regeneration of storage material is still an issue. A large number of chemical storage systems are under investigation, which involve [[hydrolysis]] reactions, [[hydrogenation]]/dehydrogenation reactions, [[ammonia borane]] and other [[boron hydride]]s, ammonia, and [[Aluminium hydride|alane]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The U.S. Department of Energy's National Hydrogen Storage Project: Progress towards meeting hydrogen-powered vehicle requirements|last = Sunita|first = Satyapal|date = 2007|journal = Catalysis Today|doi = 10.1016/j.cattod.2006.09.022|pmid = |access-date =|volume=120|issue = 3–4|pages=246–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Storage in hydrocarbons may also be successful in overcoming the issue with low density.  For example, supercritical hydrogen at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 500 bar only has a density of 15.0&amp;nbsp;mol/L while [[methanol]] has a density of 49.5&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L methanol and saturated [[dimethyl ether]] at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 7 bar has a density of 42.1&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L dimethyl ether.  These liquids would use much smaller, cheaper, safer storage tanks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The most promising chemical approach is electrochemical hydrogen storage, as the release of hydrogen can be controlled by the applied electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319917333529|title = Electrochemical hydrogen storage: Opportunities for fuel storage, batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors|last1 = Eftekhari|first1 = Ali|last2 = Baizeng| first2=Fang|date = 2017|journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.08.103|pmid = |access-date =|volume=42|issue = 40|pages=25143–25165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the materials listed below can be directly used for electrochemical hydrogen storage.

==== Metal hydrides ====
[[Image:Metal hydride hydrogen.storage.graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.25|Metal hydride hydrogen storage]]
[[Metal hydrides]], such as [[Magnesium hydride|MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Sodium aluminium hydride|NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium aluminum hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium hydride|LiH]], [[LaNi5H6|LaNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[TiFeH2|TiFeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[palladium hydride]], with varying degrees of efficiency, can be used as a storage medium for hydrogen, often reversibly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/storage/metal_hydrides.html DOE Metal hydrides]. eere.energy.gov (2008-12-19). Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are easy-to-fuel liquids at ambient temperature and pressure, others are solids which could be turned into pellets. These materials have good [[energy density]], although their [[specific energy]] is often worse than the leading [[hydrocarbon]] fuels.

Most metal hydrides bind with hydrogen very strongly. As a result, high temperatures around 120&amp;nbsp;°C (248&amp;nbsp;°F) – 200&amp;nbsp;°C (392&amp;nbsp;°F) are required to release their hydrogen content. This energy cost can be reduced by using alloys which consists of a strong hydride former and a weak one such as in [[Lithium amide|LiNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[lithium borohydride|LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[sodium borohydride|NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Christian|first1= Meganne|last2= Aguey-Zinsou|first2= Kondo François|year= 2012|title= Core–Shell Strategy Leading to High Reversible Hydrogen Storage Capacity for NaBH4|journal= [[ACS Nano]]|volume= 6|issue= 9|pages= 7739–7751|doi=10.1021/nn3030018 |pmid= 22873406}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are able to form weaker bonds, thereby requiring less input to release stored hydrogen. However, if the interaction is too weak, the pressure needed for rehydriding is high, thereby eliminating any energy savings. The target for onboard hydrogen fuel systems is roughly &lt;100&amp;nbsp;°C for release and &lt;700 bar for recharge (20–60 kJ/mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/efchp_hydrogen3.pdf EU Hydrogen Storage]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative method for reducing dissociation temperatures is doping with activators. This has been successfully used for [[aluminium hydride]] but its complex synthesis makes it undesirable for most applications as it is not easily recharged with hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Graetz | first1 = J. | last2 = Reilly | first2 = J. | last3 = Sandrock | first3 = G. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = J. | last5 = Zhou | first5 = W.

Currently the only hydrides which are capable of achieving the 9 wt% gravimetric goal for 2015 (see chart above) are limited to lithium, boron and aluminium based compounds; at least one of the second-row elements or Al must be added. Research is being done to determine new compounds which can be used to meet these requirements.

Proposed hydrides for use in a hydrogen economy include simple hydrides of [[magnesium hydride|magnesium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://neel.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article1281 CNRS Institut Neel H2 Storage]. Neel.cnrs.fr. Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[transition metal]]s and [[complex metal hydride]]s, typically containing [[sodium]], [[lithium]], or [[calcium]] and [[aluminium]] or [[boron]]. Hydrides chosen for storage applications provide low reactivity (high safety) and high hydrogen storage densities. Leading candidates are [[lithium hydride]], [[sodium borohydride]], [[lithium aluminium hydride]] and [[ammonia borane]]. A French company McPhy Energy is developing the first industrial product, based on magnesium hydride, already sold to some major clients such as Iwatani and ENEL.

''[[New Scientist]]'' reported that [[Arizona State University]] is investigating using a [[borohydride]] solution to store hydrogen, which is released when the solution flows over a catalyst made of ruthenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn10066-new-type-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-powers-up.html | title=New type of hydrogen fuel cell powers up | publisher= newscientist | accessdate=2006-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Georgia Tech]] performed extensive benchmarking simulations on mixtures of several light metal hydrides to predict possible reaction thermodynamics for hydrogen storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Examining the robustness of first-principles calculations for metal hydride reaction thermodynamics by detection of metastable reaction pathways|author1=Ki Chul Kim |author2=Anant D.

==== Non-metal hydrides ====
The Italian [[catalyst]] manufacturer [[Acta (chemical company)|Acta]] has proposed using [[Hydrazine#Fuel cells|hydrazine as an alternative to hydrogen]] in [[fuel cell]]s. As the hydrazine fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen.

==== Carbohydrates ====
[[Carbohydrates]] (polymeric C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a bioreformer mediated by the enzyme cocktail—cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation. Carbohydrate provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a solid powder. Carbohydrate is the most abundant renewable bioresource in the world.

In May 2007 biochemical engineers from the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] and biologists and chemists from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced a method of producing high-yield pure hydrogen from starch and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000456 |title=High-Yield Hydrogen Production from Starch and Water by a Synthetic Enzymatic Pathway|year=2007|editor1-last=Melis|editor1-first=Anastasios|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.-H.

==== Synthesized hydrocarbons ====
An alternative to hydrides is to use regular [[hydrocarbon]] fuels as the hydrogen carrier. Then a small [[hydrogen reformer]] would extract the hydrogen as needed by the [[fuel cell]]. However, these reformers are slow to react to changes in demand and add a large incremental cost to the vehicle powertrain.

[[Direct methanol fuel cell]]s do not require a reformer, but provide a lower energy density compared to conventional fuel cells, although this could be counterbalanced with the much better energy densities of [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]] over hydrogen. [[Alcohol fuel]] is a [[renewable resource]].

[[Solid-oxide fuel cells]] can operate on light hydrocarbons such as [[propane]] and [[methane]] without a reformer, or can run on higher hydrocarbons with only partial reforming, but the high temperature and slow startup time of these fuel cells are problematic for automotive applications.

===== Aluminum =====
{{Main|Aluminum}}

[[Aluminum]] has been proposed as an [[energy storage]] method by a number of researchers. [[hydrogen]] can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water.&lt;ref name="Alchemy white paper"&gt;[http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf White Paper: A Novel Method For Grid Energy Storage Using Aluminum Fuel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531060548/http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf |date=2013-05-31 }}, Alchemy Research, April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To react with water, however, aluminum must be stripped of its natural [[oxide]] layer, a process which requires pulverization,&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite web |title=Army discovery may offer new energy source {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory |url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3036 |website=www.arl.army.mil |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; chemical reactions with caustic substances, or alloys.&lt;ref name="Woodall"&gt;{{cite web |title=New process generates hydrogen from aluminum alloy to run engines, fuel cells |url=https://phys.org/news/2007-05-hydrogen-aluminum-alloy-fuel-cells.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is [[aluminum oxide]], which can be recycled back into aluminum with the [[Hall–Héroult process]], making the reaction theoretically renewable.

==== Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) ====
[[File:Perhydro-N-Carbazol.PNG|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Reversible hydrogenation of N-ethylcarbazole]]
Unsaturated organic compounds can store huge amounts of hydrogen. These ''Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers'' (LOHC) are hydrogenated for storage and dehydrogenated again when the energy/hydrogen is needed. Research on LOHC was concentrated on cycloalkanes at an early stage, with its relatively high hydrogen capacity (6-8 wt %) and production of CO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-free hydrogen.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Liquid organic hydrogen carriers|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495615000546|journal = Journal of Energy Chemistry|date = 2015-09-01|pages = 587–594|volume = 24|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jechem.2015.08.007|first = Teng|last = He|first2 = Qijun|last2 = Pei|first3 = Ping|last3 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Heterocyclic compounds|Heterocyclic aromatic compounds]] (or N-Heterocycles) are also appropriate for this task.

Using LOHCs relatively high gravimetric storage densities can be reached (about 6 wt-%) and the overall energy efficiency is higher than for other chemical storage options such as [[Hydrogen storage#Synthesized hydrocarbons|producing methane from the hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/cite.201100113 | volume=83 | issue=11 | title=Energiespeicherung mittels Methan und energietragenden Stoffen - ein thermodynamischer Vergleich |trans-title=Energy Storage by CO2 [[Methane|Methanization]] and Energy Carrying Compounds: A Thermodynamic Comparison|language=de| year=2011 | journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik | pages=2002–2013 | last1 = Müller | first1 = Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cycloalkanes
Cycloalkanes reported as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin. The dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes is highly endothermic (63-69 kJ/mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which means this process requires high temperature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dehydrogenation of decalin is the most thermodynamically favored among the three cycloalkanes, and methyl-cyclohexane is second because of the presence of the methyl group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kinetic modeling of pure hydrogen production from decalin|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951707004368|journal = Journal of Catalysis|date = 2008-01-25|pages = 229–238|volume = 253|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.jcat.2007.11.012|first = Bo|last = Wang|first2 = D.

Both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of LOHCs requires catalysts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was demonstrated that replacing hydrocarbons by hetero-atoms, like N, O etc. improves reversible de/hydrogenation properties.

* Formic acid
In 2006 researchers of EPFL, Switzerland, reported the use of [[formic acid]] as a hydrogen storage material.&lt;ref&gt;G. Laurenczy, C. Fellay, P. J.

==== Ammonia ====
{{Further|Ammonia production}}
[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an appropriate catalytic reformer. Ammonia provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a liquid at room temperature and pressure when mixed with water. Ammonia is the second most commonly produced chemical in the world and a large infrastructure for making, transporting, and distributing ammonia exists. Ammonia can be reformed to produce hydrogen with no harmful waste, or can mix with existing fuels and under the right conditions burn efficiently. Since there is no carbon in ammonia, no carbon by-products are produced; thereby making this possibility a "carbon neutral" option for the future. Pure ammonia burns poorly at the atmospheric pressures found in natural gas fired water heaters and stoves. Under compression in an automobile engine it is a suitable fuel for slightly modified gasoline engines. Ammonia is the suitable alternative fuel because it has 18.6 MJ/kg energy density at NTP and carbon-free combustion byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AVERY|first=W|date=1988|title=A role for ammonia in the hydrogen economy|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0360319988900377|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=13|issue=12|pages=761–773|doi=10.1016/0360-3199(88)90037-7|issn=0360-3199}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ammonia is a toxic gas at normal temperature and pressure and has a potent odor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html The ammonia economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513030624/http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html |date=2008-05-13 }}.

==== Amine borane complexes ====
{{Main article|Amine borane complex}}
Prior to 1980, several compounds were investigated for hydrogen storage including complex borohydrides, or aluminohydrides, and ammonium salts. These hydrides have an upper theoretical hydrogen yield limited to about 8.5% by weight. Amongst the compounds that contain only B, N, and H (both positive and negative ions), representative examples include: amine boranes, boron hydride ammoniates, hydrazine-borane complexes, and ammonium octahydrotriborates or tetrahydroborates. Of these, amine boranes (and especially [[ammonia borane]]) have been extensively investigated as hydrogen carriers. During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. Army and Navy funded efforts aimed at developing hydrogen/deuterium gas-generating compounds for use in the HF/DF and HCl chemical [[laser]]s, and gas dynamic lasers. Earlier hydrogen gas-generating formulations used amine boranes and their derivatives. Ignition of the amine borane(s) forms [[boron nitride]] (BN) and hydrogen gas. In addition to ammonia borane
(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BNH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), other gas-generators include diborane diammoniate, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Imidazolium ionic liquids====
In 2007 [[Jairton Dupont|Dupont]] and others reported hydrogen-storage materials based on imidazolium ionic liquids. Simple alkyl(aryl)-3-methylimidazolium N-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate salts that possess very low vapour pressure, high density, and thermal stability and are not inflammable can add reversibly 6–12 hydrogen atoms in the presence of classical Pd/C or Ir0 nanoparticle catalysts and can be used as alternative materials for on-board hydrogen-storage devices. These salts can hold up to 30 g L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ef060481t|title=Hydrogen-Storage Materials Based on Imidazolium Ionic Liquids|year=2007|last1=Stracke|first1=Marcelo P.|last2=Ebeling|first2=Günter|last3=Cataluña|first3=Renato|last4=Dupont|first4=Jairton|journal=Energy &amp; Fuels|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1695–1698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phosphino-borane on the left accepts one equivalent of hydrogen at one atmosphere and 25&amp;nbsp;°C and expels it again by heating to 100&amp;nbsp;°C. The storage capacity is 0.25 wt% still rather below the 6 to 9 wt% required for practical use.

==== Carbonite substances ====
Research has proven that [[graphene]] can store hydrogen efficiently. After taking up hydrogen, the substance becomes [[graphane]]. After tests, conducted by dr André Geim at the [[University of Manchester]], it was shown that not only can graphene store hydrogen easily, it can also release the hydrogen again, after heating to 450&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22689 Graphene as suitable hydrogen storage substance].

====Metal-organic frameworks====
[[Metal-organic framework]]s represent another class of synthetic porous materials that store hydrogen and energy at the molecular level. MOFs are highly crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid structures that contain metal clusters or ions (secondary building units) as nodes and organic ligands as linkers. When guest molecules (solvent) occupying the pores are removed during solvent exchange and heating under vacuum, porous structure of MOFs can be achieved without destabilizing the frame and hydrogen molecules will be adsorbed onto the surface of the pores by physisorption. Compared to traditional zeolites and porous carbon materials, MOFs have very high number of pores and surface area which allow higher hydrogen uptake in a given volume. Thus, research interests on hydrogen storage in MOFs have been growing since 2003 when the first MOF-based hydrogen storage was introduced. Since there are infinite geometric and chemical variations of MOFs based on different combinations of SBUs and linkers, many researches explore what combination will provide the maximum hydrogen uptake by varying materials of metal ions and linkers.

In 2006, chemists at [[UCLA]] and the [[University of Michigan]] have achieved hydrogen storage concentrations of up to 7.5 wt% in MOF-74 at a low temperature of 77 [[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2008_0401.htm#hydrogen MOF-74 – A Potential Hydrogen-Storage Compound].

Varying several factors such as surface area, pore size, catenation, ligand structure, and sample purity can result in different amounts of hydrogen uptake in MOFs.

====Encapsulation====
[[Cella Energy]] technology is based around the encapsulation of hydrogen gas and nano-structuring of chemical hydrides in small plastic balls, at room temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cellaenergy.com Cella Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case hydrogen remains in physical forms, i.e., as gas, supercritical fluid, adsorbate, or molecular inclusions. Theoretical limitations and experimental results are considered &lt;ref&gt;Compendium of Hydrogen Energy.Volume 2:hydrogen Storage, Transportation and Infrastructure. A volume in Woodhead Publishing Series in Energy 2016,Chapter 8 – Other methods for the physical storage of hydrogen {{DOI|10.1016/B978-1-78242-362-1.00008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
concerning the volumetric and gravimetric capacity of glass microvessels, microporous, and nanoporous media, as well as safety and refilling-time demands.

==== Activated carbons ====
Activated carbons are highly porous amorphous carbon materials with high apparent surface area. Hydrogen [[physisorption]] can be increased in these materials by increasing the apparent surface area and optimizing pore diameter to around 7 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sevilla|first=Marta|last2=Mokaya|first2=Robert|date=2014-03-21|title=Energy storage applications of activated carbons: supercapacitors and hydrogen storage|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C3EE43525C|journal=Energy Environ.

====Cryo-compressed====

Cryo-compressed storage of hydrogen is the only technology that meets 2015 DOE targets for volumetric and gravimetric efficiency (see "CcH2" on slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"/&gt;).

Furthermore, another study has shown that cryo-compressed exhibits interesting cost advantages: ownership cost (price per mile) and storage system cost (price per vehicle) are actually the lowest when compared to any other technology (see third row in slide 13 of &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lasher [http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review10/st002_lasher_2010_o_web.pdf Analyses of Hydrogen Storage Materials and On-Board Systems]. DOE Annual Merit Review June 7–11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, a cryo-compressed hydrogen system would cost $0.12 per mile (including cost of fuel and every associated other cost), while conventional gasoline vehicles cost between $0.05 and $0.07 per mile.

Like liquid storage, cryo-compressed uses cold hydrogen (20.3 K and slightly above) in order to reach a high energy density. However, the main difference is that, when the hydrogen would warm-up due to heat transfer with the environment ("boil off"), the tank is allowed to go to pressures much higher (up to 350 bars versus a couple of bars for liquid storage). As a consequence, it takes more time before the hydrogen has to vent, and in most driving situations, enough hydrogen is used by the car to keep the pressure well below the venting limit.

Consequently, it has been demonstrated that a high driving range could be achieved with a cryo-compressed tank : more than {{convert|650|mi|km}} were driven with a full tank mounted on an hydrogen-fueled engine of [[Toyota Prius]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llnl.gov/str/June07/Aceves.html S&amp;TR | Setting a World Driving Record with Hydrogen]. Llnl.gov (2007-06-12). Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Research is still on its way in order to study and demonstrate the full potential of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review10/st003_berry_2010_o_web.pdf Compact (L)H2 Storage with Extended Dormancy in Cryogenic Pressure Vessels].

As of 2010, the BMW Group has started a thorough component and system level validation of cryo-compressed vehicle storage on its way to a commercial product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisita2010.com/programme/programme/F2010A018 Technical Sessions]. FISITA 2010. Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon nanotubes====
[[Image:Carbon nanotubes.jpg|thumb|upright|Carbon nanotubes]]

Hydrogen carriers based on nanostructured carbon (such as carbon [[fullerene|buckyballs]] and [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]]) have been proposed. However, since Hydrogen usually amounts up to ~3.0-7.0 wt% at 77K which is far from the value set by US department of Energy (6 wt% at nearly ambient conditions), it makes carbon materials poor candidates for hydrogen storage.

====Clathrate hydrates====
[[hydrogen clathrate|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caged]] in a [[clathrate hydrate]] was first reported in 2002, but requires very high pressures to be stable. In 2004, researchers from [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[Colorado School of Mines]] showed solid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing hydrates could be formed at ambient temperature and 10s of [[Bar (unit)|bar]] by adding small amounts of promoting substances such as [[THF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1102076|title=Stable Low-Pressure Hydrogen Clusters Stored in a Binary Clathrate Hydrate|year=2004|last1=Florusse|first1=L.

====Glass capillary arrays====
A team of Russian, Israeli and German scientists have collaboratively developed an innovative technology based on glass capillary arrays for the safe infusion, storage and controlled release of hydrogen in mobile applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.017|title=Hydrogen storage in capillary arrays|year=2007|last1=Zhevago|first1=N.K.|last2=Glebov|first2=V.I.|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=48|issue=5|pages=1554–1559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.10.011|title=Experimental investigation of hydrogen storage in capillary arrays|year=2010|last1=Zhevago|first1=N.K.|last2=Denisov|first2=E.I.|last3=Glebov|first3=V.I.|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=35|pages=169–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C.En technology has achieved the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) 2010 targets for on-board hydrogen storage systems.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Eliezer ''et al.''

==Stationary hydrogen storage==
Unlike mobile applications, hydrogen density is not a huge problem for stationary applications. As for mobile applications, stationary applications can use established technology:
*[[Compressed hydrogen]] (CGH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in a [[hydrogen tank]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/ihfpv_zheng2.pdf R&amp;D of large stationary hydrogen/CNG/HCNG storage vessels]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Liquid hydrogen]] in a (LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [[cryogenic]] hydrogen tank

===Underground hydrogen storage===
[[File:Available storage technologies, their capacity and discharge time.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|'Available storage technologies, their capacity and discharge time.'&lt;ref name=CSTAFF /&gt;{{rp|12}}]]
[[Underground hydrogen storage]] is the practice of hydrogen storage in underground [[cave]]rns, [[salt dome]]s and depleted oil and gas fields. Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] for many years without any difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyweb.de/Knowledge/Ecn-h2a.html 1994 – ECN abstract]. Hyweb.de. Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The storage of large quantities of liquid hydrogen underground can function as [[grid energy storage]]. The round-trip efficiency is approximately 40% (vs. 75-80% for [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-hydro (PHES)]]), and the cost is slightly higher than pumped hydro, if only a limited number of hours of storage is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201202/20120208ATT37544/20120208ATT37544EN.pdf |title=European Renewable Energy Network Study |date=January 2012 |pages=86, 188 |publisher=European Union |location=Brussels }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study referenced by a European staff working paper found that for large scale storage, the cheapest option is hydrogen at €140/MWh for 2,000 hours of storage using an electrolyser, salt cavern storage and combined-cycle power plant.&lt;ref name=CSTAFF&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT: Energy storage – the role of electricity |url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/swd2017_61_document_travail_service_part1_v6.pdf |date=1 Feb 2017|publisher=European Commission |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} The European project [[Hyunder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why storing large scale intermittent renewable energies with hydrogen? |url=http://www.hyunder.eu/ |website=Hyunder |access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy an additional 85 caverns are required as it cannot be covered by PHES and [[CAES]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyunder.eu/images/Presentations%20EUSEW/2%20HyUnder%20EUSEW%20workshop%20Luis%20Correas.pdf Storing renewable energy: Is hydrogen a viable solution?]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A German case study on storage of hydrogen in salt caverns found that if the German power surplus (7% of total variable renewable generation by 2025 and 20% by 2050) would be converted to hydrogen and stored underground, these quantities would require some 15 caverns of 500,000 cubic metres each by 2025 and some 60 caverns by 2050 – corresponding to approximately one third of the number of underground gas caverns currently operated in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bringing North Sea Energy Ashore Efficiently |url=https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WEC-brochure_Online-offshore.pdf |publisher=World Energy Council Netherlands|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, Sandia Labs are conducting research into the storage of hydrogen in depleted oil and gas fields, which could easily absorb large amounts of renewably produced hydrogen as there are some 2.7 million depleted wells in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerdes|first1=Justin|title=Enlisting Abandoned Oil and Gas Wells as 'Electron Reserves' |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/enlisting-abandoned-oil-and-gas-wells-as-electron-reserves#gs.ByNEEjY|website=Greentech Media|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power to gas===
[[Power to gas]] is a technology which converts [[electricity|electrical]] power to a gas [[fuel]]. There are two methods: the first is to use the electricity for [[water splitting]] and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid; the second, less efficient method is used to convert [[carbon dioxide]] and hydrogen to [[methane]], (see [[natural gas]]) using [[electrolysis]] and the [[Sabatier reaction]]. A third option is to combine the hydrogen via electrolysis with a source of carbon (either carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide from [[biogas]], from industrial processes or via [[Carbon_dioxide_removal#Direct_air_capture_(DAC)|direct air-captured carbon dioxide]]) via [[biomethanation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rathi|first1=Akshat|title=Batteries can't solve the world's biggest energy-storage problem.

This process is highly efficient, as the archaea are self-replicating and only require low-grade (60°C) heat to perform the reaction.

Another process has also been achieved by [[SoCalGas]] to convert the carbon dioxide in raw biogas to methane in a single electrochemical step, representing a simpler method of converting excess renewable electricity into storable natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SoCalGas and Opus 12 Successfully Demonstrate Technology That Simplifies Conversion of Carbon Dioxide into Storable Renewable Energy|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/socalgas-and-opus-12-successfully-demonstrate-technology-that-simplifies-conversion-of-carbon-dioxide-into-storable-renewable-energy-300633313.html|website=prnewswire.com|publisher=prnewswire|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UK has completed surveys and is preparing to start injecting hydrogen into the gas grid as the grid previously carried 'town gas' which is a 50% hydrogen-methane gas formed from coal. Auditors KPMG found that converting the UK to hydrogen gas could be £150bn to £200bn cheaper than rewiring British homes to use electric heating powered by lower-carbon sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ambrose |first1=Jillian |title=Energy networks prepare to blend hydrogen into the gas grid for the first time |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/01/06/hydrogen/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=22 April 2018 |date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays can then be used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen, Fuel cell maker [[Hydrogenics]] and natural gas distributor [[Enbridge]] have teamed up to develop such a [[power to gas]] system in Canada.&lt;ref name="anscombe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anscombe|first=Nadya|title=Energy storage: Could hydrogen be the answer?|url=http://www.solarnovus.com/energy-storage-could-hydrogen-be-the-answer_N5028.html|accessdate=3 November 2012|newspaper=Solar Novus Today|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipeline storage of hydrogen where a natural gas network is used for the storage of hydrogen. Before switching to [[natural gas]], the German gas networks were operated using [[towngas]], which for the most part (60-65%) consisted of hydrogen. The storage capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200,000 GW·h which is enough for several months of energy requirement. By comparison, the capacity of all German pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 GW·h. The transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss (&lt;0.1%) than in a power network (8%). The use of the existing [[List of natural gas pipelines|natural gas pipelines]] for hydrogen was studied by NaturalHy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf Naturalhy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118102741/http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automotive Onboard hydrogen storage==

Targets were set by the [[FreedomCAR]] Partnership in January 2002 between the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. DOE]] (Targets assume a 5-kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage system). The 2005 targets were not reached in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscar.org/commands/files_download.php?files_id=82 Hydrogen Storage Technologies Roadmap]. uscar.org. November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The targets were revised in 2009 to reflect new data on system efficiencies obtained from fleets of test cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jun|author2=Sudik, A |author3=Wolverton, C |author4= Siegel, DJ |title=High capacity hydrogen storage materials: attributes for automotive applications and techniques for materials discovery|journal=Chem.

Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy|access&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2017}}{{verification failed|date=November 2017}}

It is important to note that these targets are for the hydrogen storage system, not the hydrogen storage material. System densities are often around half those of the working material, thus while a material may store 6 [[Mass fraction (chemistry)#Mass percentage|wt%]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a working system using that material may only achieve 3 wt% when the weight of tanks, temperature and pressure control equipment, etc., is considered.

In 2010, only two storage technologies were identified as having the potential to meet DOE targets: MOF-177 exceeds 2010 target for volumetric capacity, while cryo-compressed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds more restrictive 2015 targets for both gravimetric and volumetric capacity (see slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"&gt;R. K. Ahluwalia, T. Q. Hua, J. K. Peng and R. Kumar [http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review10/st001_ahluwalia_2010_o_web.pdf System Level Analysis of Hydrogen Storage Options]. 2010 DOE Hydrogen Program Review, Washington, DC, June 8–11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;).

Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies.  Hamilton noted that the "[[Taxing and Spending Clause|general welfare clause]]" and the "[[Necessary_and_Proper_Clause|necessary and proper clause]]" gave elasticity to the Constitution. Hamilton won the argument with Washington, who signed the bank bill into law.

Later, directly borrowing from Hamilton, Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] invoked the implied powers of government in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]''. In 1816, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation creating the [[Second Bank of the United States]].  The state of Maryland attempted to tax the bank.  The state argued the [[United States Constitution]] did not explicitly grant Congress the power to establish banks.  In 1819, the Court decided against the state of Maryland. Chief Justice Marshall argued that Congress had the right to establish the bank, as the Constitution grants to Congress certain implied powers beyond those explicitly stated.

In the case of the United States Government, implied powers are powers Congress exercises that the Constitution does not explicitly define, but are necessary and proper to execute the powers.

==Notes==
Implied powers are those that can reasonably be assumed to flow from express powers, though not explicitly mentioned. The legitimacy of these powers is derived from the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]], the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]], and the [[Commerce Clause]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14473">'''Intertemporal choice''' is the process by which people make [[decision theory|decision]]s about what and how much to do at various points in time, when choices at one time influence the possibilities available at other points in time. These choices are influenced by the relative value people assign to two or more payoffs at different points in time. Most choices require decision-makers to trade off costs and benefits at different points in time. These decisions may be about saving, work effort, education, nutrition, exercise, health care and so forth. 

Since early in the twentieth century, [[economist]]s have analyzed intertemporal decisions using the [[discounted utility]]  model, which assumes that people evaluate the pleasures and pains resulting from a decision in much the same way that financial markets evaluate losses and gains, exponentially 'discounting' the value of outcomes according to how delayed they are in time. Discounted utility has been used to describe how people actually make intertemporal choices and it has been used as a tool for public policy. Policy decisions about how much to spend on research and development, health and education all depend on the [[Social discount rate|discount rate]] used to analyze the decision.&lt;ref name=Berns2007&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intertemporal choice – Toward an Integrative Framework |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=482 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2007.08.011 |pmid=17980645 |year=2007 |last1=Berns |first1=Gregory S. |last2=Laibson |first2=David |last3=Loewenstein |first3=George |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4554332/Laibson_IntertemporalChoice.pdf?sequence=2 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530144016/https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4554332/Laibson_IntertemporalChoice.pdf?sequence=2 |archivedate=2016-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portfolio allocation==
{{Main|Intertemporal portfolio choice}}

Intertemporal portfolio choice is the allocation of funds to various assets repeatedly over time, with the amount of investable funds at any future time depending on the portfolio returns at any prior time. Thus the future decisions may depend on the results of current decisions. In general this  dependence on prior decisions implies that current decisions must take into account their probabilistic effect on future portfolio constraints. There are some exceptions to this, however: with a [[log utility|logarithmic utility]] function, or with a [[Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion|HARA utility]] function and [[serial correlation|serial independence]] of returns, it is optimal to act with (rational) myopia, ignoring the effects of current decisions on the future decisions.

==Consumption==
{{Main|Intertemporal consumption}}

The [[Keynesian consumption function]] was based on two major hypotheses. Firstly, the [[marginal propensity to consume]] lies between 0 and 1. Secondly, the average propensity to consume falls as income rises. Early empirical studies were consistent with these hypotheses. However, after World War II it was observed that saving did not rise as income rose. The Keynesian model therefore failed to explain the consumption phenomenon, and thus the theory of intertemporal choice was developed. The analysis of intertemporal choice was introduced by [[John Rae (economist)|John Rae]] in 1834 in the "Sociological Theory of Capital". Later, [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] in 1889 and [[Irving Fisher]] in 1930 elaborated on the model. A few other models based on intertemporal choice include the [[Life-cycle hypothesis|Life Cycle Income Hypothesis]] proposed by [[Franco Modigliani]] and the [[Permanent Income Hypothesis]] proposed by [[Milton Friedman]]. The concept of Walrasian equilibrium may also be extended to incorporate intertemporal choice. The Walrasian analysis of such an equilibrium introduces two "new" concepts of prices: futures prices and spot prices.

===Fisher's model of intertemporal consumption===
[[File:Budget constraint.jpg|thumb|left|Intertemporal budget constraint with consumption of period 1 and 2 on x-axis and y-axis respectively.]][[File:Intertemporal Choice.jpg|thumb|The figure depicts the intertemporal choice exercised by the consumer, given the utility preferences and the budget constraint.]]

Irving Fisher developed the theory of intertemporal choice in his book ''Theory of interest'' (1930). Contrary to Keynes, who related consumption to current income, Fisher's model showed how rational forward looking consumers choose consumption for the present and future to maximize their lifetime satisfaction.

According to Fisher, an individual's impatience depends on four characteristics of his income stream: the size, the time shape, the composition and risk. Besides this, foresight, self-control, habit, expectation of life, and bequest motive (or concern for lives of others) are the five personal factors that determine a person's impatience which in turn determines his time preference.&lt;ref name=Thaler1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thaler |first1=Richard H. |title=Irving Fisher: Modern Behavioral Economist |journal=The American Economic Review |date=1997 |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=439–441 |jstor=2950963 |url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/richard.thaler/research/pdf/IrvingFisher.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085631/http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/richard.thaler/research/pdf/IrvingFisher.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to understand the choice exercised by a consumer across different periods of time we take consumption in one period as a composite commodity. Suppose there is one consumer, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; commodities, and two periods. Preferences are given by &lt;math&gt;U(x_1, x_2)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_t = (x_{t1},\dots,x_{tN})&lt;/math&gt;. Income in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;Y_t&lt;/math&gt;. Savings in period 1 is &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt;, spending in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the interest rate. If the person is unable to borrow against future income in the first period, then he is subject to separate budget constraints in each period:

:&lt;math&gt;C_1 + S_1 \le Y_1,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1)

:&lt;math&gt;C_2 \le Y_2 + S_1(1 + r).&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2)

On the other hand, if such borrowing is possible then the person is subject to a single [[intertemporal budget constraint]]:

:&lt;math&gt;C_1 + \frac{C_2}{1+r} = Y_1 + \frac{Y_2}{1+r}.&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3)

The left hand side shows the present value of expenditure and right hand side depicts the present value of income. Multiplying the equation by &lt;math&gt;(1+r)&lt;/math&gt; would give us the corresponding future values.

Now the consumer has to choose a &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; so as to
:Maximize
::&lt;math&gt;U(C_1,C_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:subject to
::&lt;math&gt;C_1+C_2/(1+r) = Y_1 + Y_2/(1+r).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Saver.jpg|thumb|If the consumer is a net saver, an increase in interest rate will have an ambiguous effect on the current consumption.]][[File:Borrower.jpg|thumb|If the consumer is a net borrower, an increase in interest rate will reduce his current consumption.]]A consumer may be a net saver or a net borrower. If he's initially at a level of consumption where he's neither a net borrower nor a net saver, an increase in income may make him a net saver or a net borrower depending on his preferences.  An increase in current income or future income will increase current and future consumption(consumption smoothing motives).

Now, let us consider a scenario where the interest rates are increased. If the consumer is a net saver, he will save more in the current period due to the substitution effect and consume more in the current period due to the income effect. The net effect thus becomes ambiguous. If the consumer is a net borrower, however, he will tend to consume less in the current period due to the substitution effect and income effect thereby reducing his overall current consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Varian | first = Hal | title = Intermediate Micro Economics | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modigliani's life cycle income hypothesis===
{{main article|Life-cycle hypothesis}}
The life cycle hypothesis is based on the following model:

:&lt;math&gt;\max U_t = \sum_t U(C_t)(1+\delta)^{-t}  &lt;/math&gt;

subject to

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_t C_t (1+r)^{-t}=\sum_t Y_t (1+r)^{-t} +W_0,&lt;/math&gt;
where

:''U''(''C''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;) is satisfaction received from consumption in time period ''t'',

:''C''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the level of consumption at time ''t'',

:''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is income at time ''t'',

:''δ'' is the rate of [[time preference]] ( a measure of individual preference between present and future activity),

:''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial level of income producing assets.

[[File:Life Cycle Hypothesis.jpg|thumb|left|Life Cycle Hypothesis]]

Typically, a person's MPC ([[marginal propensity to consume]]) is relatively high during young adulthood, decreases during the middle-age years, and increases when the person is near or in retirement.  The Life Cycle Hypothesis(LCH) model defines individual behavior as an attempt to smooth out consumption patterns over one's lifetime somewhat independent of current levels of income. This model states that early in one's life consumption expenditure may very well exceed income as the individual may be making major purchases related to buying a new home, starting a family, and beginning a career. At this stage in life the individual will borrow from the future to support these expenditure needs. In mid-life however, these expenditure patterns begin to level off and are supported or perhaps exceeded by increases in income.
At this stage the individual repays any past borrowings and begins to save for her or his retirement.
Upon retirement, consumption expenditure may begin to decline however income usually declines dramatically. In this stage of life, the individual dis-saves or lives off past savings until death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barro|first1=Robert J.|title=Macroeconomics|date=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262024365|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtV1DDXaSi4C|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mankiw2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mankiw|first1=N.

===Friedman's permanent income hypothesis===
{{main article|Permanent income hypothesis}}
After the Second World War, it was noticed that a model in which current consumption was just a function of current income clearly was too simplistic. It could not explain the fact that the long-run average propensity to consume seemed to be roughly constant despite the marginal propensity to consume being much lower. Thus [[Milton Friedman]]'s permanent income hypothesis is one of the models which seeks to explain this apparent contradiction.

According to the permanent income hypothesis, permanent consumption, ''C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;'', is proportional to permanent income, ''Y&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Permanent income is a subjective notion of likely average future income.  Permanent consumption is a similar notion of consumption.

Actual consumption, ''C'', and actual income, ''Y'', consist of these permanent components plus unanticipated transitory components, ''C&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Y&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'', respectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adaptive expectations: Friedman's permanent income hypothesis|url=http://salome.lse.ac.uk/courses/ec220/G/ieppt/series2/C11F07.ppsx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''C&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; =β''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''Y&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''

:''C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''

:''Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = Y&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + Y&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''

==Labor supply==
{{Main|Labor supply}}

The choice of an individual as to how much labor to currently supply involves a trade-off between current labor and leisure. The amount of labor currently supplied influences not only current consumption opportunities but also future ones, and in particular influences the future choice of when to retire and supply no more labor. Thus the current labor supply choice is an intertemporal choice.

==Fixed investment==
{{Main|Fixed investment}}

Fixed investment is the purchasing by firms of newly produced machinery, factories, and the like. The reason for such purchases is to increase the amount of output that can potentially be produced at various times in the future, so this is an intertemporal choice.

==Hyperbolic discounting==
{{main article|Hyperbolic discounting}}
The article so far has considered cases where individuals make intertemporal choices by considering the present discounted value of their consumption and income. Every period in the future is exponentially discounted with the same interest rate. A different class of economists, however, argue that individuals are often affected by what is called the temporal myopia. The consumer's typical response to uncertainty in this case is to sharply reduce the importance of the future of their decision making.This effect is called [[hyperbolic discounting]]. In the common tongue it reflects the sentiment “Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellows|first=Alan|title=Hyperbolic Discounting|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/hyperbolic-discounting/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, it may be represented as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f_H(D)=\frac{1}{1+kD}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''f''(''D'') is the [[discount factor]],
:''D'' is the delay in the reward, and
:''k'' is a parameter governing the degree of discounting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyperbolic discounting]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When choosing between $100 or $110 a day later, individuals may impatiently choose the immediate $100 rather than wait for tomorrow for an extra $10. Yet, when choosing between $100 in a month or $110 in a month and a day, many of these people will reverse their preferences and now patiently choose to wait the additional day for the extra $10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=P. Redden|first=Joseph|title=Hyperbolic Discounting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Apis mellifera ligustica''''' is the '''Italian bee''' which is a [[subspecies]] of the [[western honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera'').

==Origin==
The Italian honey bee is thought to originate from the continental part of Italy, south of the [[Alps]], and north of [[Sicily]]. The [[subspecies]] may have survived the last [[Ice Age]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Franck, P; Garnery, L.; Celebrano G.; Solignac M.; Cornuet J.  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-294x.2000.00945.x/full  Hybrid origins of honeybees from Italy (Apis mellifera ligustica) and Sicily (A. m. sicula)]
Article first published online: 25 DEC 2001; Molecular Ecology Volume 9,  Issue 7,  pages 907–921, July 2000
&lt;/ref&gt;
It is genetically a different subspecies than that from the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] and from Sicily. It is the most widely distributed of all [[honey bee]]s, and has proven adaptable to most [[climate]]s from [[subtropical]] to cool temperate, but it is less successful in humid [[tropical]] regions. It is sometimes called the [[Liguria]]n bee.

Italian bees, having been conditioned to the warmer climate of the central [[Mediterranean]], are less able to cope with the "hard" winters and cool, wet springs of more northern [[latitude]]s. They do not form such tight [[winter cluster]]s. More food has to be consumed to compensate for the greater heat loss from the loose cluster. The tendency to raise broods late in autumn also increases food consumption. The noted beekeeper, [[Thomas White Woodbury]], first introduced the Italian bee to Britain in 1854 and regarded it as vastly superior to the [[European dark bee|English Black]].

==Anatomy==
* Color: Abdomen has brown and yellow bands. Among different strains of Italian bees, there are three different colors: Leather; bright yellow (golden); and very pale yellow (Cordovan).
* Size: Their bodies are smaller and their overhairs are shorter than those of the darker honeybee races.
* Tongue length: 6.3 to 6.6&amp;nbsp;mm
* Mean [[cubital index]]: 2.2 to 2.5

==Disease resistance==
There is no clear evidence that ''A. m. ligustica'' is more resistant to acarine mites than the [[Apis mellifera mellifera|Northern dark bee]]. They also appear to be less tolerant of ''[[Nosema (fungus)|Nosema]]'' than Northern dark bees. They are unable to retain [[faeces]] in the gut for long periods and require more frequent cleaning flights than the dark bees. They are affected by the [[parasite|parasitic]] [[varroa mite]], [[diseases of the honey bee#Acarine mites (Tracheal mites)|Tracheal Mites]], and the bacterial diseases [[diseases of the honey bee#European foulbrood|European Foulbrood]], [[diseases of the honey bee#American foulbrood|American Foul Brood]], [[diseases of the honey bee#Chalkbrood|Chalkbrood]] and other [[diseases of the honey bee]].

==Characteristics==

[[File:Swarm of Italian bees 2004.jpg|thumb|Italian honey bees swarming]]
[[File:Ligustica italian bee with pollen.jpg|thumb|Italian honey bee carrying pollen from flowers]]

[[Brother Adam]], a bee breeder and developer of the [[Buckfast bee|Buckfast]] bee, characterized the Italian bee in his book ''Breeding the Honeybee'':
{{quote|text=From the commercial and breeding point of view the value of the Ligustica lies in a happy synthesis of a great number of good characteristics. Among these we must mention industry, gentleness, fertility, reluctance to swarm, zeal for building comb, white honey-cappings, a willingness to enter supers, cleanliness, resistance to disease, and the tendency to collect flower honey rather than honey dew. The last-named trait is of value only in countries where the colour of the honey determines the price. The Ligustica has shown that she is able to produce good crops from the red clover. In one other characteristic has the Ligustica proved exceptional and that is in her resistance to Acarine. This is especially true of the dark, leather-coloured variety, whereas the golden strains are highly susceptible to Acarine. |sign=Brother Adam|source="Breeding the Honeybee" (Northern Bee Books: Mytholmroyd, 1987), pp. 96-98.}}

While the Italian bee has many strong points, among the ''A.m. ligustica'' it has a large number of weak points:

{{quote|text=The Ligustica has her drawbacks, and these are serious. She lacks vitality and is inclined to excessive brood rearing. These two faults are the root cause of her other disadvantages. She has too a tendency to drift which is caused by a poor sense of orientation and this can prove a drawback where colonies are set out in rows facing in one direction as is the common practice in apiaries almost world-wide....

Curiously enough, all the above mentioned faults of the Ligustica appear in greatly emphasised form in the very light coloured strains, with an additional one, an unusually high consumption of stores. In European countries such strains have proved highly unsatisfactory as they tend to turn every drop of honey into brood. These light coloured varieties are likewise as already stated unusually susceptible to Acarine. The reason for this is not known in spite of all the work spent on trying to find it. It is all the more surprising when we consider that the dark, leather-coloured Ligustica has over a period of more than 60 years proved to be one of the most resistant to Acarine.

The almost exclusive concentration of these light-coloured Italian strains in North America seems to be due to the fact that in sub-tropical Southern and Western States the large queen-rearing centres are concerned mainly with the sale of bees, where honey production plays a secondary role. Hence they need a bee which is given to brood rearing to an extreme degree, something which in entirely different climatic conditions constitutes a serious drawback. |sign=Brother Adam|source="Breeding the Honeybee" (Northern Bee Books: Mytholmroyd, 1987), pp. 97-98.}}

*inclined to excessive brood rearing
*susceptibility to disease
*high consumption of stores&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*more prone to drifting and [[robbing]] than the other principal races of Europe.

*brood rearing starts late and lasts long into late summer or autumn, irrespective of nectar flow
*tends to forage over shorter distances than either ''[[Apis mellifera carnica|carnica]]'' or ''mellifera'', and may therefore be less effective in poorer nectar flows
*for cool maritime regions
*for areas with strong spring flow
*for areas with periods of dearth of nectar in the summer

==Foraging behavior==

Bertram|title=Evidence for genetic variation in worker task performance by African and European honeybees|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2002|volume=52|issue=4|pages=318–25|doi=10.1007/s00265-002-0501-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selective breeding==
Breeders of Italian bees, as well as other honey bee races, look for certain beneficial characteristics. Depending on the breeding goal, one or more of the following characteristics may be emphasized:

#Gentleness or excitability
#Resistance to various diseases including tracheal mite and Varroa mite
#Early spring buildup in population
#Wintering ability
#Tendency to limited swarming
#Ability to ripen honey rapidly
#Honeycomb cappings are white
#Minimal use of propolis
#Availability and queen cost
#Color

==Worldwide distribution==
*1853 introduced to Germany
*1854 introduced into the [[Poland]] by Dr. [[Jan Dzierżon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15529680|title=14 Aug 1914 - BEE CULTURE|website=nla.gov.au|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1854 introduced into the United Kingdom
*1859 introduced to the United States
*1862 introduced to Australia, on 9 December into Victoria aboard the steam ship [[Alhambra (1855)|''Alhambra'']] There is strong evidence this introduction failed as the emerging Italian virgin queens hybridised with the English 'black' bee (source: Barrett, P. "The Immigrant Bees, 1788 to 1898", Vol. IV). Wilhelm Abram brought several queens from Italy to Sydney in December 1880 but it's probable they reached New South Wales through other hands earlier on.
*1866 introduced to [[Russian Empire]]
*1880 introduced to New Zealand
*1884 (Easter) introduced to [[Kangaroo Island]] in South Australia, sourced from Brisbane where they were previously imported in 1880 from Italy by Chas. Fullwood. Jas. Carroll received a hive of Italian bees in Brisbane, Queensland, in 1877 when Angus Mackay accompanied a hive aboard the City of New York, packaged by Harbison in California. After a week's stopover in Sydney, the bees arrived in Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, P. "The Immigrant Bees, 1788 to 1898", Vols. I-III)&lt;/ref&gt; Honey from Kangaroo Island is marketed (in 2014) as being from the only pure Ligurian bees in the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">The '''Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/jburgdec.htm Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development], A/CONF.199/20, Chapter 1, Resolution 1, Johannesburg, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD), sometimes referred to as '''Earth Summit 2002''', at which the '''Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/jburgpln.htm Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development], A/CONF.199/20, Chapter 1, Resolution 2, Johannesburg, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; was also agreed upon.

The Johannesburg Declaration builds on earlier declarations made at the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment], A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1, Chapter I, Stockholm, June 1972&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Stockholm]] in 1972, and the [[Earth Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/rio-dec.htm Rio Declaration on Environment and Development], A/CONF.151/26 (Vol. I), Chapter I, Annex I, Rio de Janeiro, June 1992&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992. While committing the nations of the world to [[sustainable development]], it also includes substantial mention of multilateralism as the path forward.

In terms of the political commitment of parties, the Declaration is a more general statement than the Rio Declaration.  It is an agreement to focus particularly on "the worldwide conditions that pose severe threats to the sustainable development of our people, which include: chronic hunger; malnutrition; foreign occupation; armed conflict; illicit drug problems; organized crime; corruption; natural disasters; illicit arms trafficking; trafficking in persons; terrorism; intolerance and incitement to racial, ethnic, religious and other hatreds; xenophobia; and endemic, communicable and chronic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis." Johannesburg Declaration 19.

'''Korean units of measurement''', called '''''cheokgwan-beop''''' ({{Korean|hangul=척관법|hanja=尺貫法|labels=no}}) or '''''cheokgeun-beop''''' ({{Korean|hangul=척근법|hanja=尺斤法|labels=no}}) in Korean, is the [[Customary units|traditional]] system of measurement used by the people of the [[Korean peninsula]]. It is largely based on the [[Chinese units of measurement|Chinese system]], with influence from [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese standards]] imposed following [[Japanese occupation of Korea|its annexation]] of the [[Korean Empire]] in 1910. Both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] currently employ the [[metric system]]. Since 2007, South Korea has criminalized the use of Korean units in commercial contexts but informal use continues, especially of the ''[[pyeong]]'' as a measure of residential and commercial floorspace. North Korea continues to use the traditional units, although their standards are now derived from metric conversions.

==History==
===Ancient Korea===
Customary Korean units are a local adaption of the [[Chinese units of measurement|traditional Chinese system]], which was adopted at a very early date.{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=285}} They were imposed and adjusted at various times by royal statutes.{{sfnp|Kim|2010}} The details of the system have varied over time and location in Korea's history.{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=1}}{{sfnp|Gwon|2010}} Standardization—to the extent it occurred—was accomplished by officially sanctioned rulers, ropes, [[odometer]]s, [[trigonometry|triangulation]] devices,{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=284}} weights, cups, and basins.

Although most of the measures operate on a [[decimal]] system, the standard form was to read out the units of each place (as, e.g., 3{{nbsp}}''cheok'', 1{{nbsp}}''chon'', 4{{nbsp}}''bun'', 1{{nbsp}}''ri'') rather than list them as a single number of the largest unit (as 3.141{{nbsp}}''cheok'').{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=285}}

===Joseon Kingdom===
[[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Dan]] established a Market Bureau ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|시사}}}}, {{lang|ko|{{linktext|市司}}}}) or Bureau of Weights and Measures ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|평시서}}}}, {{lang|ko|{{linktext|平市署}}}}) at the foundation of the [[Joseon dynasty]] in 1392.{{sfnp|NIKH|2017}} The [[Joseon Kingdom]] later attempted a standardization of length based on square brass rulers, which were used by [[yangban|magistrates]] and the [[Secret royal inspector|secret police]] to fight commercial fraud.{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} Under the [[Joseon]], different classes of society were permitted different numbers of ''[[kan (unit)|kan]]'' in their homes, but in its traditional sense—like the Japanese ''[[ken (unit)|ken]]''—of a [[bay (architecture)|bay]] between two [[pillar (architecture)|pillar]]s rather than as a set unit of length.{{sfnp|Kim|2015}}

The 1496 Great Codex of State Administration (''Kyŏngguk Taejŏn'') included a section on approved measures and their verification.{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=285}} It employed a [[li (unit)|li]] of 360{{nbsp}}paces or 2160{{nbsp}}feet, but did not explicitly mention that conversion until its 1746 supplement.{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=285}}

The 1897 Law on Weights and Measures uniting Korea's various local systems was the first legislation enacted upon the Joseon's establishment of the [[Korean Empire]].{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} 

{{anchor|Japanese occupation|Japanese Chosen|Chōsen|Chosen}}
===Japanese Chōsen===
During [[Japanese occupation of Korea|its long occupation]], Japan imposed [[Japanese units|its standards]] on Korea. Two of the most common "traditional" units in South Korea—the ''pyeong'' of [[floorspace]] and the jeweler's ''don''—were among those given their modern value by the Japanese.{{sfnp|Hong|2007}}

===South Korea===
[[South Korea]] signed the [[Meter Treaty]] in 1959&lt;ref name=lordylordy/&gt; and notionally [[metrification|adopted the metric system]] under [[Park Chung-hee]] on 10 May 1961,{{sfnp|DBI|1985|p=837}}{{sfnp|HMC|23 June 2007}} with a strict law banning the use of the Korean pound, li, ''gwan'', and ''don''&lt;ref name=applerok/&gt; effective as of 1 January 1964{{sfnp|DBI|1985|p=837}} and—after metric conversion of the [[land registry|land registries]]—the ''pyeong''.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} The metrication was not applied to imported or exported goods{{sfnp|DBI|1985|p=837}} and remained so generally spotty as to be considered a failure,{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} with the government abandoning its attempts to enforce the statute by 1970.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} The traditional units feature in many [[Korean language|Korean]] sayings{{efn|See, e.g., the proverbs on the importance of flattery and lying in [[Jeyseon Lee|Lee]].{{sfnp|Lee|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4CsWDEi52IC&amp;pg=PA82 82]}}}} and much of its literature and poetry, including the [[Aegukga|national anthem]], which mentions Korea's "three thousand lis of rivers and mountains".{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} Further attempts to fully metricate occurred in 1983,&lt;ref name=spy/&gt;&lt;ref name=applerok/&gt; 2000,{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} and 2001,{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} with publicity campaigns praising the [[metric system]] and condemning traditional units through TV and radio ads, brochures, signs, and contests.{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=4}} A common theme was the origin of the present values of the units under [[Japanese occupation of Korea|Japanese occupation]]; Yun Byeong-su of the [[Korea Association of Standards &amp; Testing Organizations]] noted that "even Japan has forsaken the ''don'' for the units of grams and ounces but here we are standing around like idiots still blathering on about ''don''."{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} Nonetheless, strong opposition from the construction and jewelry industries and negative media coverage forced Korean politicians to avoid the topic and regulators to settle for dual use of conventional and metric measures.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}}

A 2006 study found 88% of real estate companies and 71% of jewelers in 7 major markets were still using the ''pyeong'' and ''don'',{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} after which the [[South Korean government|government]] decided to simply criminalize further commercial use of traditional units. (Another important factor was the [[European Union]] regulation mandating the use of metric in all imported goods by 2010.){{sfnp|HMC|22 July 2007}} The sale of [[ruler (tool)|ruler]]s marking Korean feet was ended{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} and a Measure Act effective 1 July 2007 empowered the [[Korean Agency for Technology and Standards]]&lt;ref name=applerok/&gt; of the [[South Korean Ministry of Commerce|Ministry of Commerce]] to begin immediately levying fines of up to [[₩]]500,000 for commercial use of the ''pyeong'' and ''don'', with less common units enjoying a longer [[grace period]].{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} The ban also included use of [[American units]], such as describing the [[display size]] of televisions and [[computer monitor]]s in terms of inches.&lt;ref name=aak/&gt;{{efn|A particular exception to this policy was made for the continued use of [[Pound (mass)|pound]]s for [[bowling ball]] sizes and yards on [[golf course]]s, owing to the international conventions of those sports.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}}}} The "serving size" used as an informal and variable measure of meat cuts was standardized to 100{{nbsp}}g.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} Knowledge of the fine remained low for years, and it was later increased to a maximum of [[₩]]1,000,000 (about [[USD|$]]800) for users of illegal units{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=4}} and [[₩]]3,000,000 for sellers of measuring devices marked with unapproved units.&lt;ref name=applerok&gt;{{harvp|APLMF|2015|loc="[http://www.aplmf.org/republic-of-korea.html Republic of Korea]"}}.&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea's measurement standards are now maintained by the [[Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science]].&lt;ref name=applerok/&gt;

Despite this strong official discouragement, some use continues in retail, manufacturing, and farming.{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=4}} Even among those who adopt metric units, cheeky use of awkward metric fractions equivalent to round amounts of the former units is common, especially with regard to the very common ''pyeong'' of [[floorspace]].&lt;ref name=aak/&gt;{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} (Such treatment was avoided in the gold market by laws requiring pricing and denomination in even amounts of grams.){{sfnp|Jo|2006}} Another dodge has been to treat the traditional units as a nondescript 'unit', such as marketing an air conditioner appropriate for a 20{{nbsp}}py home as a "20-Type".&lt;ref name=aak&gt;{{citation |title=Ask a Korean! |contribution=Pyeong, and Old Habits Dying Hard |contribution-url=http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2012/07/pyeong-and-old-habits-dying-hard.html |date=21 July 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
Despite the importance of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Division of Korea|establishing North Korea]], [[Kim Il-sung]] continued official use of Korean units until the DPRK's notional [[metrication]] under National Standard 4077-75 in 14 April 1975.&lt;ref name=applenork&gt;{{harvp|APLMF|2015|loc="[http://www.aplmf.org/dpr-korea.html DPR Korea]"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This standard was subsequently superseded by National Standard 4077-91 in 1991,&lt;ref name=applenork/&gt; but that standard continued the use of the metric system as well.}} It joined the [[Meter Treaty]] in 1982&lt;ref name=lordylordy&gt;{{harvp|Lord|2001|loc="[https://sizes.com/units/General/met_sys_spred.htm Spread of the Metric System]"}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or 1989,{{sfnp|BIPM|2007|p=194}} although it was removed from the [[International Bureau for Weights and Measures]] and related organizations in 2012 for its years of failure to pay the necessary fees.{{sfnp|BIPM|2014|p=5}} North Korea has long used the metric system in its state-run media and international publications,{{sfnp|YNA|2013}} but continues to use traditional units alongside the metric system{{sfnp|TEG|2017}} in sectors approved by the government.{{sfnp|DPRK|1993|loc=Ch. II, §§13–15}} North Korea's standards are administered by the [[Central Institute of Metrology]]&lt;ref name=applenork/&gt; under the [[State Administration of Quality Management]] in accordance with the Law on Metrology{{sfnp|DPRK|1993}} ratified by the [[Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Supreme People's Assembly]] on 3 February 1993.{{sfnp|CooMet|2013}} North Korea uses the ''pyeong'' in various regulations, such as the 50{{nbsp}}py per person allowed for private farming in 1987,{{sfnp|Park &amp; al.|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mW2EBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 33]}} despite guides who disparage the unit as a historical relic of the South to foreign tourists visiting the country.{{sfnp|Burdick|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3TJ_-Tw3q0C&amp;pg=PA150 150]}} The metric system is thought not to have spread to domestic factories or stores prior to [[Kim Jong-un]]'s metrification initiative, announced in May 2013.{{sfnp|YNA|2013}} The change was part of Kim's policy of stressing the importance of science and technology and its "universal trends".{{sfnp|YNA|2013}} His announcement in the state-run quarterly ''Cultural Language Study'' said that increasing use of the metric system would "strengthen international exchange and cooperation... in the fields of industry, science, and technology and even in the area of general social life".{{sfnp|YNA|2013}}

==Length==
The base unit of Korean length is the foot,{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} with other units changing over time based on its dimensions and multiples. Different ancient Korean kingdoms had different exact measurements;{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} that of [[Sejong the Great]] ({{abbr|r|ruled}}.{{nbsp}}1418–1450) was 31.22{{nbsp}}cm.{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} Under the early [[Joseon Kingdom]], the value of the foot varied by trade, with different lengths used for the carpentry foot and the fabric foot.{{sfnp|Kim|2015}}

The biggest difference between the traditional Korean and Chinese units of length is that the Korean equivalent of the ''[[bu (unit)|bu]]'' uses a different character and its pre-[[Tang dynasty|Tang]] composition of six Korean feet rather than five. (The ''bu'' was usually treated as a synonym of this unit within Korea but sometimes distinguished as a length of 4{{nbsp}}feet.) In {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}369, during the reign of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|King Geunchogo]] of [[Baekje]], his realm seems to have used a foot of about 28.85{{nbsp}}cm.{{sfnp|Gwon|2010}}

The Korean li previously bore values around 434.16{{nbsp}}m (3rd century), 531.18{{nbsp}}m (6th–7th), 559.8{{nbsp}}m (7th–10th), 552.96{{nbsp}}m (10th–14th),&lt;ref name=sly/&gt; and 450{{nbsp}}m (19th);&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{citation|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/|ref={{harvid|OED}}|contribution=ri, ''n.''|contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/165428|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it was also reckoned based on travel time and therefore varied in length between the plains and mountains.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It was standardized as {{sfrac|10}}{{nbsp}}of the [[Japanese ri]] of {{nowrap|3{{sfrac|51|55}} km}} in 1905.&lt;ref name=sly&gt;{{harvp|Lord|2006|loc=[https://sizes.com/units/li.htm#Korea "Li"]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Both the 1955&lt;ref name="un" /&gt; and 1966 editions of the UN's report on national measurement systems report the Korean li as precisely equal to the Japanese ri, but this seems to be in error.&lt;ref name=sly/&gt;}}

==Area==
The base unit of Korean area is the ''pyeong'',{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} equivalent to a square ''kan'' or 36 square Korean feet. It comprised about 3.158{{nbsp}}m² during [[Korea's Three Kingdoms Era]];{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} the present value derives from the units established by the Japanese.{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} Despite being notionally illegal, the ''pyeong'' remains particularly common when discussing residential and commercial [[floorspace]]{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=5}}{{sfnp|Zatko|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2fU5TgWBTecC&amp;pg=PA204 204]}}&lt;ref name=aak/&gt; and tiles.&lt;ref name=spy/&gt; A separate ''pyeong'' of 0.09{{nbsp}}m² was used for selling glass.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} The floorspace ''pyeong'' is still prevalent enough that it continues to be glossed in the government's promotional material for foreign investors.{{sfnp|KOTRA|2010}}

Farms and large estates were formerly generally measured in ''majigi'', which is notionally not based on multiples of the ''pyeong'' but on the amount of land suitable for the planting of one ''mall'' of rice or grain seed.&lt;ref name="yu2"&gt;{{harvp|Yu &amp; al.|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CcqBYxSpvb8C&amp;pg=PA178 178]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it was standardized to the ''pyeong'' system but varied in size from province to province based on the average richness of their soil.

==Weight==
The base unit of Korean weight is the ''gwan''.{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} At the time of Korea's metrification, however, the pound was in more common use. Although it was usually taken as equivalent to 600{{nbsp}}g,{{sfnp|HMC|22 July 2007}} as with [[Crushed red pepper|red pepper]] and meats,{{sfnp|Jo|2006}}{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} a separate pound of 400{{nbsp}}g was used for fruits{{sfnp|Jo|2006}}{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} and another of 375{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} or 200{{nbsp}}g was used for vegetables.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} The ''nyang'' also sees some use among Korea's vendors of [[traditional Chinese medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=B. |first=Paul |title=An Acorn in the Dog's Food |contribution=Measurements |contribution-url=http://samedi.livejournal.com/369252.html |url=http://samedi.livejournal.com/ |publisher=LiveJournal |date=21 February 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "bag" (''kama'') was a variable unit usually figured as 54{{nbsp}}kg of [[rice husk|unhusked]] rice or 60{{nbsp}}kg of [[rice polishing|polished]] rice, although 90{{nbsp}}kg "bags" were also used.&lt;ref name=sorry/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="98005">'''Lamarckism''' (or '''Lamarckian inheritance''') is the hypothesis that an [[organism]] can pass on characteristics that it has acquired through use or disuse during its lifetime to its [[offspring]]. It is also known as the '''inheritance of acquired characteristics''' or '''soft inheritance'''. It is inaccurately&lt;ref name=Ghiselin1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gould2002p177/&gt; named after the French [[biologist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829), who incorporated the action of soft inheritance into his evolutionary theories as a supplement to his concept of [[orthogenesis]], a drive towards [[Evolution of biological complexity|complexity]]. The theory is cited in textbooks to contrast with [[Darwinism]]. This paints a false picture of the history of biology, as Lamarck did not originate the idea of soft inheritance, which was known from the [[classical era]] onwards, and it was not the primary focus of Lamarck's theory of evolution. Further, in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] supported the idea of "use and disuse inheritance", though rejecting other aspects of Lamarck's theory.

Many researchers from the 1860s onwards attempted to find evidence for the theory, but these have all been explained away either by other mechanisms such as genetic contamination, or as fraud. Later, [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits, eventually leading to the development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], and the general abandonment of the Lamarckism in [[biology]]. Despite this, interest in Lamarckism has continued.

==Early history==
===Origins===
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] repeated the ancient folk wisdom of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.]]

The inheritance of acquired characteristics was proposed in ancient times, and remained a current idea for many centuries. The historian of science [[Conway Zirkle]] wrote in 1935 that:&lt;ref name=Zirkle1935/&gt;

{{quote|Lamarck was neither the first nor the most distinguished biologist to believe in the inheritance of acquired characters. He merely endorsed a belief which had been generally accepted for at least 2,200 years before his time and used it to explain how evolution could have taken place. The inheritance of acquired characters had been accepted previously by [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Jerome Cardan]], [[Levinus Lemnius]], [[John Ray]], [[Michel Adanson|Michael Adanson]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Jo. Fried. Blumenbach]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]] among others.&lt;ref name=Zirkle1935&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zirkle | first1=Conway | authorlink=Conway Zirkle | year=1935 | title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis| journal=The American Naturalist | volume=69 | issue=724| pages=417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Zirkle noted that Hippocrates described [[pangenesis]], the theory that what is inherited derives from the whole body of the parent, whereas Aristotle thought it impossible; but that all the same, Aristotle implicitly agreed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics, giving the example of the inheritance of a scar, or of blindness, though noting that children do not always resemble their parents. Zirkle recorded that [[Pliny the Elder]] thought much the same. Zirkle also pointed out that stories involving the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics appear numerous times in ancient mythology and the Bible, and persisted through to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories]]''.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1946" /&gt; Erasmus Darwin's ''[[Zoonomia]]'' (c. 1795) suggested that [[warm-blooded]] [[animal]]s develop from "one living filament... with the power of acquiring new parts" in response to stimuli, with each round of "improvements" being inherited by successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1794–1796|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15707/15707-h/15707-h.htm#sect_XXXIX Vol I, section XXXIX]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin's pangenesis===
[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[pangenesis]] theory. Every part of the body emits tiny gemmules which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and contribute to the next generation via the fertilised egg. Changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as in Lamarckism.]]
{{main|Pangenesis}}

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' proposed natural selection as the main mechanism for development of species, but did not rule out a variant of Lamarckism as a supplementary mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=617}}: "But Darwin was {{sic|hide=y|loath}} to let go of the notion that a well-used and strengthened organ could be inherited."&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin called this pangenesis, and explained it in the final chapter of his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' (1868), after describing numerous examples to demonstrate what he considered to be the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Pangenesis, which he emphasised was a hypothesis, was based on the idea that [[somatic cell]]s would, in response to environmental stimulation (use and disuse), throw off '[[Gemmule (pangenesis)|gemmules]]' or 'pangenes' which travelled around the body, though not necessarily in the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]]. These pangenes were microscopic particles that supposedly contained information about the characteristics of their parent cell, and Darwin believed that they eventually accumulated in the [[germ cell]]s where they could pass on to the next generation the newly acquired characteristics of the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=April 27, 1871 |title=Pangenesis |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v3/n78/abs/003502a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=3 |issue=78 |pages=502–503 |bibcode=1871Natur...3..502D |doi=10.1038/003502a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's half-cousin, [[Francis Galton]], carried out experiments on [[rabbit]]s, with Darwin's cooperation, in which he transfused the [[blood]] of one variety of rabbit into another variety in the expectation that its offspring would show some characteristics of the first. They did not, and Galton declared that he had disproved Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis, but Darwin objected, in a letter to the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', that he had done nothing of the sort, since he had never mentioned blood in his writings. He pointed out that he regarded pangenesis as occurring in [[protozoa]] and [[plant]]s, which have no blood, as well as in animals.&lt;ref name=Liu2008&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Liu |first=Yongsheng |date=2008 |title=A new perspective on Darwin's Pangenesis |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=141–149 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x|pmid=18429766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lamarck's evolutionary framework===

[[File:Lamarck's Two-Factor Theory.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Lamarck's two-factor theory involves 1) a complexifying force that drives animal [[body plan]]s towards higher levels ([[orthogenesis]]) creating a ladder of [[phylum|phyla]], and 2) an adaptive force that causes animals with a given body plan to adapt to circumstances (use and disuse, [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]]), creating a diversity of [[species]] and [[genus|genera]]. Popular views of Lamarckism only consider an aspect of the adaptive force.]]
{{further|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck#Lamarckian evolution}}

Between 1800 and 1830, Lamarck proposed a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution. He saw evolution as comprising four laws:&lt;ref name="Larson2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Larson, Edward J. |date=2004 |title=A Growing sense of progress |work=Evolution: The remarkable history of a Scientific Theory |publisher=Modern Library |pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould2001"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gould | first=Stephen | title=The lying stones of Marrakech : penultimate reflections in natural history | publisher=Vintage | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-09-928583-0 | pages=119–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "Life by its own force, tends to increase the volume of all organs which possess the force of life, and the force of life extends the dimensions of those parts up to a extent that those parts bring to themselves;"
# "The production of a new organ in an animal body, results from a new requirement arising. and which continues to make itself felt, and a new movement which that requirement gives birth to, and its upkeep/maintenance;"
# "The development of the organs, and their ability, are constantly a result of the use of those organs."
# "All that has been acquired, traced, or changed, in the physiology of individuals, during their life, is conserved through the genesis, reproduction, and transmitted to new individuals who are related to those who have undergone those changes."

===Lamarck's discussion of heredity===

In 1830, in an aside from his evolutionary framework, Lamarck briefly mentioned two traditional ideas in his discussion of heredity, in his day considered to be generally true. The first was the idea of use versus disuse; he theorized that individuals lose characteristics they do not require, or use, and develop characteristics that are useful. The second was to argue that the acquired traits were heritable. He gave as an imagined illustration the idea that when [[giraffe]]s stretch their necks to reach leaves high in trees, they would strengthen and gradually lengthen their necks. These giraffes would then have offspring with slightly longer necks. In the same way, he argued, a [[blacksmith]], through his work, strengthens the muscles in his arms, and thus his sons would have similar muscular development when they mature. Lamarck stated the following two laws:&lt;ref name=Lamarck1830/&gt;

# ''Première Loi: Dans tout animal qui n' a point dépassé le terme de ses développemens, l' emploi plus fréquent et soutenu d' un organe quelconque, fortifie peu à peu cet organe, le développe, l' agrandit, et lui donne une puissance proportionnée à la durée de cet emploi ; tandis que le défaut constant d' usage de tel organe, l'affoiblit insensiblement, le détériore, diminue progressivement ses facultés, et finit par le faire disparoître.''&lt;ref name=Lamarck1830/&gt;
# ''Deuxième Loi: Tout ce que la nature a fait acquérir ou perdre aux individus par l' influence des circonstances où leur race se trouve depuis long-temps exposée, et, par conséquent, par l' influence de l' emploi prédominant de tel organe, ou par celle d' un défaut constant d' usage de telle partie ; elle le conserve par la génération aux nouveaux individus qui en proviennent, pourvu que les changemens acquis soient communs aux deux sexes, ou à ceux qui ont produit ces nouveaux individus.''&lt;ref name=Lamarck1830&gt;{{harvnb|Lamarck|1830|loc=[http://www.lamarck.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_page_detail.php?lang=fr&amp;type=text&amp;bdd=lamarck&amp;table=ouvrages_lamarck&amp;bookId=29&amp;search=no&amp;typeofbookDes=Livres&amp;facsimile=off&amp;pageOrder=260 p. 235]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English translation:

# First Law [Use and Disuse]: In every animal which has not passed the limit of its development, a more frequent and continuous use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops and enlarges that organ, and gives it a power proportional to the length of time it has been so used; while the permanent disuse of any organ imperceptibly weakens and deteriorates it, and progressively diminishes its functional capacity, until it finally disappears.
# Second Law [Soft Inheritance]: All the acquisitions or losses wrought by nature on individuals, through the influence of the environment in which their race has long been placed, and hence through the influence of the predominant use or permanent disuse of any organ; all these are preserved by reproduction to the new individuals which arise, provided that the acquired modifications are common to both sexes, or at least to the individuals which produce the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamarck|1914|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, a change in the environment brings about change in "needs" (''besoins''), resulting in change in behavior, bringing change in organ usage and development, bringing change in form over time—and thus the gradual [[Transmutation of species|transmutation of the species]]. However, as the evolutionary biologists and historians of science [[Michael Ghiselin]] and [[Steven Jay Gould]] have pointed out, these ideas were not original to Lamarck.&lt;ref name=Ghiselin1994/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weismann's experiment===
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the [[gonad]]s and the [[gamete]]s. Somatic cells (of the body) [[embryology|develop]] afresh in each generation from the germ plasm, creating an invisible "[[Weismann barrier]]" to Lamarckian influence from the soma to the next generation.]]

The idea that germline cells contain information that passes to each generation unaffected by experience and independent of the somatic (body) cells, came to be referred to as the [[Weismann barrier]], as it would make Lamarckian inheritance from changes to the body difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name="Romanes 1893"&gt;{{cite book |last=Romanes |first=George John |title=An examination of Weismannism |publisher=Open Court |year=1893 |url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23380098M/An_examination_of_Weismannism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[August Weismann]] conducted the experiment of removing the tails of 68 [[Laboratory mouse|white mice]], and those of their offspring over five generations, and reporting that no mice were born in consequence without a tail or even with a shorter tail. In 1889, he stated that "901 young were produced by five generations of artificially mutilated parents, and yet there was not a single example of a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weismann|1889|loc="The Supposed Transmission of Mutilations" (1888), [http://www.esp.org/books/weismann/essays/facsimile/contents/weismann-essays-1-ch08.pdf#page=14 p. 432]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment, and the theory behind it, were thought at the time to be a refutation of Lamarckism.&lt;ref name="Romanes 1893"/&gt;

However, the experiment's effectiveness in refuting Lamarck's hypothesis is doubtful, as it did not address the ''use and disuse'' of characteristics in response to the environment. The biologist Peter Gauthier noted in 1990 that:&lt;ref name="Gauthier 1990"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Can Weismann's experiment be considered a case of disuse? Lamarck proposed that when an organ was not used, it slowly, and very gradually atrophied. In time, over the course of many generations, it would gradually disappear as it was inherited in its modified form in each successive generation. Cutting the tails off mice does not seem to meet the qualifications of disuse, but rather falls in a category of accidental misuse... Lamarck's hypothesis has never been proven experimentally and there is no known mechanism to support the idea that somatic change, however acquired, can in some way induce a change in the germplasm. On the other hand it is difficult to disprove Lamarck's idea experimentally, and it seems that Weismann's experiment fails to provide the evidence to deny the Lamarckian hypothesis, since it lacks a key factor, namely the willful exertion of the animal in overcoming environmental obstacles.&lt;ref name="Gauthier 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=Peter |date=March–May 1990 |title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis? |journal=BIOS |volume=61 |number=1/2 |pages=6–8 |jstor=4608123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The biologist and historian of science [[Michael Ghiselin]] also considered the Weismann tail-chopping experiment to have no bearing on the Lamarckian hypothesis, writing in 1994 that:&lt;ref name="Ghiselin1994"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The acquired characteristics that figured in Lamarck's thinking were changes that resulted from an individual's own drives and actions, not from the actions of external agents. Lamarck was not concerned with wounds, injuries or mutilations, and nothing that Lamarck had set forth was tested or "disproven" by the Weismann tail-chopping experiment.&lt;ref name="Ghiselin1994"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Textbook Lamarckism==
[[File:Giraffe feeding, Tanzania.jpg|thumb|The long neck of the [[giraffe]] is often used as an example in popular explanations of Lamarckism.

The identification of Lamarckism with the inheritance of acquired characteristics is regarded by evolutionary biologists including Michael Ghiselin as a falsified artifact of the subsequent history of evolutionary thought, repeated in textbooks without analysis, and wrongly contrasted with a falsified picture of Darwin's thinking.

==Neo-Lamarckism==

===Context===
{{further|Eclipse of Darwinism}}
[[File:PSM V49 D527 Edward Drinker Cope.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Drinker Cope]]]]

The period of the [[history of evolutionary thought]] between Darwin's death in the 1880s, and the foundation of [[population genetics]] in the 1920s and the beginnings of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s, is called [[the eclipse of Darwinism]] by some historians of science. During that time many scientists and philosophers accepted the reality of evolution but doubted whether natural selection was the main evolutionary mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most popular alternatives were theories involving the inheritance of characteristics acquired during an organism's lifetime. Scientists who felt that such Lamarckian mechanisms were the key to evolution were called neo-Lamarckians. They included the British [[Botany|botanist]] [[George Henslow]] (1835–1925), who studied the effects of environmental stress on the growth of plants, in the belief that such environmentally-induced variation might explain much of [[plant evolution]], and the American entomologist [[Alpheus Spring Packard|Alpheus Spring Packard, Jr.]], who studied blind animals living in caves and wrote a book in 1901 about Lamarck and his work.&lt;ref name="Bowler236_244"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=236–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=218, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included were paleontologists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], who observed that the fossil record showed orderly, almost linear, patterns of development that they felt were better explained by Lamarckian mechanisms than by natural selection. Some people, including Cope and the Darwin critic [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], felt that inheritance of acquired characteristics would let organisms shape their own evolution, since organisms that acquired new habits would change the use patterns of their organs, which would kick-start Lamarckian evolution. They considered this philosophically superior to Darwin's mechanism of random variation acted on by selective pressures. Lamarckism also appealed to those, like the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] and the German anatomist [[Ernst Haeckel]], who saw evolution as an inherently progressive process.&lt;ref name="Bowler236_244" /&gt; The German [[Zoology|zoologist]] [[Theodor Eimer]] combined Larmarckism with ideas about [[orthogenesis]], the idea that evolution is directed towards a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the theory of evolution, and a lack of evidence for a mechanism for acquiring and passing on new characteristics, or even their heritability, Lamarckism largely fell from favour. Unlike [[neo-Darwinism]], neo-Lamarckism is a loose grouping of largely heterodox theories and mechanisms that emerged after Lamarck's time, rather than a coherent body of theoretical work.&lt;ref name=Bowler1989Demise&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |publisher=University of California Press |year=1989 |origyear=1983 |edition=Revised |isbn=978-0520063860 |pages=257, 264, 279–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

[[File:Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] tried to demonstrate Lamarckism by mutilating [[guinea pig]]s.]]

Neo-Lamarckian versions of evolution were widespread in the late 19th century. The idea that living things could to some degree choose the characteristics that would be inherited allowed them to be in charge of their own destiny as opposed to the Darwinian view, which placed them at the mercy of the environment. Such ideas were more popular than natural selection in the late 19th century as it made it possible for biological evolution to fit into a framework of a divine or naturally willed plan, thus the neo-Lamarckian view of evolution was often advocated by proponents of orthogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian of science Peter J. Bowler, writing in 2003:

{{blockquote|One of the most emotionally compelling arguments used by the neo-Lamarckians of the late nineteenth century was the claim that Darwinism was a mechanistic theory which reduced living things to puppets driven by heredity. The selection theory made life into a game of Russian roulette, where life or death was predetermined by the genes one inherited. The individual could do nothing to mitigate bad heredity. Lamarckism, in contrast, allowed the individual to choose a new habit when faced with an environmental challenge and shape the whole future course of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scientists from the 1860s onwards conducted numerous experiments that purported to show Lamarckian inheritance. Some examples are described in the table.

===Late 20th century===
The British anthropologist [[Frederic Wood Jones]] and the South African  paleontologist [[Robert Broom]] supported a neo-Lamarckian view of human evolution.&lt;!--so?--&gt; The German anthropologist [[Hermann Klaatsch]] relied on a neo-Lamarckian model of evolution to try and explain the origin of [[bipedalism]]. Neo-Lamarckism remained influential in biology until the 1940s when the role of natural selection was reasserted in evolution as part of the modern evolutionary synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Herbert Graham Cannon]], a British zoologist, defended Lamarckism in his 1959 book ''Lamarck and Modern Genetics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cannon|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, "biochemical Lamarckism" was advocated by the embryologist [[Paul Wintrebert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boesiger|1974|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Lamarckism was dominant in French biology for more than a century.&lt;!--so?--&gt; French scientists who supported neo-Lamarckism included [[Edmond Perrier]] (1844–1921), [[Alfred Mathieu Giard|Alfred Giard]] (1846–1908), [[Gaston Bonnier]] (1853–1922) and [[Pierre-Paul Grassé]] (1895–1985). They followed two traditions, one mechanistic, one [[vitalism|vitalistic]] after [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[Élan vital|philosophy of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loison |first=Laurent |date=November 2011 |title=French Roots of French Neo-Lamarckisms, 1879–1985 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=713–744 |doi=10.1007/s10739-010-9240-x |pmid=20665089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, [[Ryuichi Matsuda]] coined the term "pan-environmentalism" for his evolutionary theory which he saw as a fusion of [[Darwinism]] with neo-Lamarckism. He held that [[heterochrony]] is a main mechanism for evolutionary change and that novelty in evolution can be generated by [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first=Roy Douglas |date=March 1988 |title=Reviews |journal=Acta Biotheoretica |type=Book review |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=31–36 |doi=10.1007/BF00050806}} Book reviews of ''Animal Evolution in Changing Environments: With Special Reference to Abnormal Metamorphosis'' (1987) by [[Ryuichi Matsuda]] and ''The Evolution of Individuality'' (1987) by [[Leo Buss|Leo W.

Shapiro]] for providing no solid evidence for his theory. Shapiro noted that "Matsuda himself accepts too much at face value and is prone to wish-fulfilling interpretation."&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1988" /&gt;

===Ideological neo-Lamarckism===
[[File:Trofim Lysenko portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Trofim Lysenko]] promoted an ideological form of neo-Lamarckism which adversely influenced [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agricultural policy in the 1930s.]]

A form of Lamarckism was revived in the [[Soviet Union]] of the 1930s when [[Trofim Lysenko]] promoted the ideologically-driven research programme, [[Lysenkoism]]; this suited the ideological opposition of [[Joseph Stalin]] to [[genetics]]. Lysenkoism influenced Soviet agricultural policy which in turn was later blamed for crop failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baird|Scerri|McIntyre|2006|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique===
[[George Gaylord Simpson]] in his book ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]'' (1944) claimed that experiments in heredity have failed to corroborate any Lamarckian process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1944|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson noted that neo-Lamarckism "stresses a factor that Lamarck rejected: inheritance of direct effects of the environment" and neo-Lamarckism is closer to Darwin's pangenesis than Lamarck's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1964|pp=14–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson wrote, "the inheritance of acquired characters, failed to meet the tests of observation and has been almost universally discarded by biologists."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1965|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanist Conway Zirkle pointed out that Lamarck did not originate the hypothesis that [[Inheritance of acquired characteristics|acquired characters were heritable]], therefore it is incorrect to refer to it as Lamarckism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What Lamarck really did was to accept the hypothesis that acquired characters were heritable, a notion which had been held almost universally for well over two thousand years and which his contemporaries accepted as a matter of course, and to assume that the results of such inheritance were cumulative from generation to generation, thus producing, in time, new species. His individual contribution to biological theory consisted in his application to the problem of the origin of species of the view that acquired characters were inherited and in showing that evolution could be inferred logically from the accepted biological hypotheses. He would doubtless have been greatly astonished to learn that a belief in the inheritance of acquired characters is now labeled "Lamarckian," although he would almost certainly have felt flattered if evolution itself had been so designated.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1946"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=January 1946 |title=The Early History of the Idea of the Inheritance of Acquired Characters and of Pangenesis |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=91–151 |doi=10.2307/1005592 |jstor=1005592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peter Medawar]] wrote regarding Lamarckism, "very few professional biologists believe that anything of the kind occurs—or can occur—but the notion persists for a variety of nonscientific reasons." Medawar stated there is no known mechanism by which an adaptation acquired in an individual's lifetime can be imprinted on the genome and Lamarckian inheritance is not valid unless it excludes the possibility of natural selection but this has not been demonstrated in any experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Medawar|1985|pp=166–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Gardner]] wrote in his book ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'' (1957):

&lt;blockquote&gt;A host of experiments have been designed to test Lamarckianism. All that have been verified have proved negative. On the other hand, tens of thousands of experiments— reported in the journals and carefully checked and rechecked by geneticists throughout the world— have established the correctness of the gene-mutation theory beyond all reasonable doubt... In spite of the rapidly increasing evidence for natural selection, Lamarck has never ceased to have loyal followers.... There is indeed a strong emotional appeal in the thought that every little effort an animal puts forth is somehow transmitted to his progeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardner|1957|pp=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Ernst Mayr, any Lamarckian theory involving the inheritance of acquired characters has been refuted as "[[DNA]] does not directly participate in the making of the phenotype and that the phenotype, in turn, does not control the composition of the DNA."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1997|p=222}}: "...the recognition that DNA does not directly participate in the making of the phenotype and that the phenotype, in turn, does not control the composition of the DNA represents the ultimate invalidation of all theories involving the inheritance of acquired characters. This definitive refutation of Lamarck's theory of evolutionary causation clears the air."&lt;/ref&gt; Peter J. Bowler has written that although many early scientists took Lamarckism seriously, it was discredited by genetics in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2013|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Springer and Dennis Holley commented in 2013 that:&lt;ref name="SpringerHolley2013"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lamarck and his ideas were ridiculed and discredited. In a strange twist of fate, Lamarck may have the last laugh. Epigenetics, an emerging field of genetics, has shown that Lamarck may have been at least partially correct all along. It seems that reversible and heritable changes can occur without a change in DNA sequence (genotype) and that such changes may be induced spontaneously or in response to environmental factors—Lamarck's "acquired traits." Determining which observed phenotypes are genetically inherited and which are environmentally induced remains an important and ongoing part of the study of genetics, developmental biology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="SpringerHolley2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|Holley|2013|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] [[CRISPR]] system and [[Piwi-interacting RNA]] could be classified as Lamarckian, within a Darwinian framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |authorlink1=Eugene Koonin |last2=Wolf |first2=Yuri I. |date=November 11, 2009 |title=Is evolution Darwinian or/and Lamarckian? |journal=Biology Direct |volume=4 |page=42 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-4-42 |pmc=2781790 |pmid=19906303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the significance of epigenetics in evolution is uncertain. Critics such as [[Jerry Coyne]] point out that epigenetic inheritance lasts for only a few generations, so it is not a stable basis for evolutionary change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/epigenetics-the-light-and-the-way/ |title=Epigenetics: the light and the way? |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |date=October 24, 2010 |website=Why Evolution Is True |type=Blog |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/09/23/epigenetics-smackdown-at-the-guardian/ |title=Epigenetics smackdown at the Guardian |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |date=September 23, 2013 |website=Why Evolution is True |type=Blog |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="González 2015"&gt;González-Recio O, Toro MA, Bach A.

The evolutionary biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] contends that epigenetic inheritance should not be considered Lamarckian. According to Gregory, Lamarck did not claim the environment imposed direct effects on organisms. Instead, Lamarck "argued that the environment created needs to which organisms responded by using some features more and others less, that this resulted in those features being accentuated or attenuated, and that this difference was then inherited by offspring." Gregory has stated that Lamarckian evolution in the context of epigenetics is actually closer to Darwin's view rather than Lamarck's.&lt;ref name="Ryan 2009"/&gt;

In 2007, [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]] wrote that research into epigenetic processes does allow a Lamarckian element in evolution but the processes do not challenge the main tenets of the modern evolutionary synthesis as modern Lamarckians have claimed. Haig argued for the primacy of DNA and evolution of epigenetic switches by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haig |first=David |authorlink=David Haig (biologist) |date=June 2007 |title=Weismann Rules!

Recurrent, predictable changes of epigenetic state provide a useful set of switches that allow genetically-identical cells to acquire differentiated functions and allow facultative responses of a genotype to environmental changes (provided that 'similar' changes have occurred repeatedly in the past). However, most neo-Darwinists would claim that the ability to adaptively switch epigenetic state is a property of the DNA sequence (in the sense that alternative sequences would show different switching behavior) and that any increase of adaptedness in the system has come about by a process of natural selection.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haig has written that there is a "visceral attraction" to Lamarckian evolution from the public and some scientists, as it posits the world with a meaning, in which organisms can shape their own evolutionary destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haig |first=David |date=November 2011 |title=Lamarck Ascending! |journal=Philosophy &amp; Theory in Biology |type=Book essay |volume=3 |issue=e204 |doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0003.004}} "A Review of ''Transformations of Lamarckism: From Subtle Fluids to Molecular Biology'', edited by Snait B. Gissis and Eva Jablonka, MIT Press, 2011"&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Dickens and Qazi Rahman (2012) have argued that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of natural selection and do not challenge the modern synthesis. They dispute the claims of Jablonka and Lamb on Lamarckian epigenetic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickins |first1=Thomas E. |last2=Rahman |first2=Qazi |date=August 7, 2012 |title=The extended evolutionary synthesis and the role of soft inheritance in evolution |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=279 |issue=1740 |pages=2913–2921 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.0273 |pmc=3385474 |pmid=22593110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somatic hypermutation and reverse transcription to germline===

In the 1970s, the Australian immunologist [[Edward J. Steele]] developed a neo-Lamarckian theory of [[somatic hypermutation]] within the immune system and coupled it to the [[reverse transcription]] of RNA derived from body cells to the DNA of [[germline]] cells. This reverse transcription process supposedly enabled characteristics or bodily changes acquired during a lifetime to be written back into the DNA and passed on to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="Steele2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steele |first1=E.J. |title=Somatic hypermutation in immunity and cancer: Critical analysis of strand-biased and codon-context mutation signatures |year=2016 |journal=DNA Repair |volume=45|pages=1–24 |doi=10.1016/j.dnarep.2016.07.001 |pmid=27449479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steele |first=E.J. |last2=Pollard |first2=J.W. |year=1987 |title=Hypothesis : Somatic Hypermutation by gene conversion via the error prone DNA-to-RNA-to-DNA information loop |journal=Molecular Immunology |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=667–673 |doi=10.1016/j.dnarep.2016.07.001 |pmid=2443841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism was meant to explain why homologous [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequences]] from the [[V(D)J recombination|VDJ gene]] regions of parent mice were found in their germ cells and seemed to persist in the offspring for a few generations. The mechanism involved the somatic selection and clonal amplification of newly acquired [[antibody]] [[gene]] sequences generated via somatic hypermutation in [[B-cell]]s. The [[messenger RNA]] products of these somatically novel genes were captured by [[retrovirus]]es [[endogenous]] to the B-cells and were then transported through the bloodstream where they could breach the Weismann or soma-germ barrier and reverse transcribe the newly acquired genes into the cells of the germ line, in the manner of Darwin's pangenes.&lt;ref name="Steele1981"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somatic selection and adaptive evolution : on the inheritance of acquired characters |last=Steele |first=E.

===Hologenome theory of evolution===
{{further|hologenome theory of evolution}}

The [[hologenome theory of evolution]], while Darwinian, has Lamarckian aspects. An individual animal or plant lives in [[symbiosis]] with many [[microorganism]]s, and together they have a "hologenome" consisting of all their genomes. The hologenome can vary like any other genome by [[mutation]], [[sexual recombination]], and [[chromosome rearrangement]], but in addition it can vary when populations of microorganisms increase or decrease (resembling Lamarckian use and disuse), and when it gains new kinds of microorganism (resembling Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics). These changes are then passed on to offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Eugene |authorlink1=Eugene Rosenberg |last2=Sharon |first2=Gill |last3=Zilber-Rosenberg |first3=Ilana |date=December 2009 |title=The hologenome theory of evolution contains Lamarckian aspects within a Darwinian framework |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=11 |issue=12 |pages=2959–2962 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01995.x |pmid=19573132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism is largely uncontroversial, and natural selection does sometimes occur at whole system (hologenome) level, but it is not clear that this is always the case.&lt;ref name="Moran Sloan 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Moran | first=Nancy A. | authorlink=Nancy A.

===Baldwin effect===
{{further|Baldwin effect}}
The Baldwin effect, named after the psychologist [[James Mark Baldwin]] by George Gaylord Simpson in 1953, proposes that the ability to learn new behaviours can improve an animal's reproductive success, and hence the course of natural selection on its genetic makeup. Simpson stated that the mechanism was "not inconsistent with the modern synthesis" of evolutionary theory,&lt;ref name="depew03"&gt;Depew, David J. (2003), "Baldwin Boosters, Baldwin Skeptics" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last=Weber |first=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-23229-6 |pages=3–31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=baldwin+effect#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; though he doubted that it occurred very often, or could be proven to occur. He noted that the Baldwin effect provide a reconciliation between the neo-Darwinian and neo-Lamarckian approaches, something that the modern synthesis had seemed to render unnecessary. In particular, the effect allows animals to adapt to a new stress in the environment through behavioural changes, followed by genetic change. This somewhat resembles Lamarckism but without requiring animals to inherit characteristics acquired by their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Baldwin effect |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |year=1953 |journal=Evolution |volume=7 | issue=2 |pages=110–117 |doi=10.2307/2405746|jstor=2405746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baldwin effect is broadly accepted by Darwinists.&lt;ref name="dennett03"&gt;[[Daniel Dennett|Dennett, Daniel]] (2003), "The Baldwin Effect, a Crane, not a Skyhook" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last=Weber |first=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-23229-6 |pages=69–106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=baldwin+effect#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sociocultural evolution==

Within the [[history of technology]], Lamarckism has been used in linking cultural development to human evolution by classifying artefacts as extensions of human anatomy: in other words, as the acquired cultural characteristics of human beings. Ben Cullen has shown that a strong element of Lamarckism exists in [[sociocultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cullen|2000|pp=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

'''Lynn Hershman Leeson''' (born 1941) is an [[United States|American]] [[artist]] and [[filmmaker]]. Her work combines art with social commentary, particularly on the relationship between people and technology.  Leeson's work in media-based technology helped legitimize digital art forms.&lt;ref name="The Art and Films of Lynn Hershman Leeson: Secret Agents, Private I"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tromble|first1=Meredith|title=The Art and Films of Lynn Hershman Leeson: Secret Agents, Private I|date=2005|publisher=University of California|isbn=0-520-23970-9|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Leeson's work has as its themes: identity in a time of [[consumerism]], privacy in an era of surveillance, interfacing of humans and machines, and the relationship between real and [[virtual world]]s.  Her work grew out of an [[installation art]] and performance tradition, with an emphasis on interactivity.&lt;ref name="Wardrip-Fruin, Noah (2003)"&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah, and Nick Montfort, eds. ''The New Media Reader''. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2003, p. 643.&lt;/ref&gt; With a practice spanning more than 40 years, Leeson has worked in performance, moving image, drawing, collage, text-based work, site-specific interventions, and later new media / digital technologies, and interactive net-based works.

Her projects explore technology in digital media and science. Leeson was the first artist to launch an interactive piece using [[Videodisc]], a precursor to DVD (Lorna, 1983–84), as well the first artist to incorporate a [[touch screen]] interface into her artwork (Deep Contact, 1984-1989). Her networked robotic art installation (The Difference Engine #3, 1995-1998) is an example of her tendency to expand her artwork beyond the traditional realms of art.&lt;ref name="The Art and Films of Lynn Hershman Leeson: Secret Agents, Private I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Importance of Being Roberta, Katerina Gregos (2011)"&gt;[http://www.galeriewaldburger.com/lhershman/onroberta.pdf The Importance of Being Roberta, Katerina Gregos (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Work by Lynn Hershman Leeson is featured in the public collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the William Lehmbruck Museum, the [[ZKM]] (Zentrum fur Kunst und Medientechnologie), the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], the [[National Gallery of Canada]], di Rosa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collection|url=http://www.dirosaart.org/about/the-collection/|website=dirosaart.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Walker Art Center]] and the University Art Museum, [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], in addition to the private collections of Donald Hess and [[Arturo Schwarz]], among many others. Commissions include projects for the [[Tate Modern]], [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], [[de Young Museum]], [[Daniel Langlois]] and [[Stanford University]], and [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab]].

=== Alter ego ===
From 1974 until 1978, Leeson ‘developed’ a fictional [[persona]] and [[alter ego]] of "Roberta Breitmore." It consisted not only of a physical self-transformation through make-up, clothing, and wigs, but a fully-fledged personality existing over an extended period of time and whose existence could be proven in the world through physical evidence: from a driver’s license and credit card to letters from her psychiatrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fictive.arts.uci.edu/roberta_breitmore|title=Breitmore, Roberta (Lynn Hershman Leeson)|website=fictive.arts.uci.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artpractical.com/feature/looking_for_roberta_breitmore/|title=Looking for Roberta Breitmore|last=Maloney|first=Patricia|date=|work=Art Practical|access-date=2018-03-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was later taken to further lengths when Leeson introduced another three ‘Robertas’, by hiring other performers to enact her character. These ‘clones’ of Roberta adopted the same look and attire, engaged in some of Roberta’s correspondence and also went on some of Roberta (Leeson’s) dates. Towards the end, the ‘original’ Roberta, withdrew from her character leaving the three ‘clones’ to continue her work, until they were retired in a performance at the [[Palazzo dei Diamanti]] in Ferrara, Italy in 1978, during an exorcism at the grave of [[Lucrezia Borgia]]. What remains are the physical artefacts of any life: documentation and [[personal effects]] such as legal and medical documents and a diary).&lt;ref name="The Importance of Being Roberta, Katerina Gregos (2011)"/&gt;

Between 1995–2000 Roberta transformed into the CybeRoberta, an interactive artificial intelligent sculpture on the web. In 2006 Roberta Breitmore developed into a character in [[Second Life]]. After Stanford University acquired her archive, Leeson worked with [[Henry Lowood]] (Stanford Humanities Lab) to convert parts of the archive into something for a broader public. They worked to recreate and re-enact both Roberta Breitmore and The Dante Hotel in a virtual space.&lt;ref name="Hacking the Codes of Self Representation, LEA Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aceti |first=Lanfranco |url=http://www.leoalmanac.org/hacking-the-codes-of-self-representation-lea-magazine-article/ |title=Hacking the Codes of Self-representation LEA Magazine Article |publisher=Leoalmanac.org |date=2011-08-06 |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LORNA ===
LORNA was an early project of Leeson's. The first [[art game|interactive laser artdisk]], LORNA tells the story of an [[Agoraphobia|Agoraphobic]] woman. Viewers have the option of directing her life into several possible plots and endings.&lt;ref name="lynnhershman.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnhershman.com/lorna/ |title=Lynn Hershman Leeson – Lorna |publisher=Lynnhershman.com |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; LORNA never left her one-room apartment.  As LORNA watched the news and ads, she became fearful, afraid to leave her tiny room. Viewers were invited to liberate LORNA from her fears, using remote control units.

The plot has multiple variations that can be seen backwards, forwards, at increased or decreased speeds, and from several points of view. There is no hierarchy in the ordering of decisions. And the icons were often made of cut-off and dislocated body parts such as a mouth, or an eye.&lt;ref name="lynnhershman.com"/&gt;

=== Agent Ruby ===
In 2001, Leeson created the "Agent Ruby" for the [[SFMOMA]] . Since that time Agent Ruby&lt;ref&gt;[http://agentruby.sfmoma.org Lynn Hershman Leeson's Agent Ruby]&lt;/ref&gt; has conversed with online users, which has shaped her memory, knowledge, and moods. In 2013 the SFMOMA presented ''Lynn Hershman Leeson: The Agent Ruby Files''. This digital and analog presentation reinterprets dialogues drawn from the decade-long archive of text files of Agent Ruby’s conversations with online users and reflects on technologies, recurrent themes, and patterns of audience engagement.&lt;ref name="Lynn Hershman Leeson: The Agent Ruby Files"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmoma.org/exhib_events/exhibitions/512 |title=Exhibitions + Events &amp;#124; Calendar &amp;#124; Lynn Hershman Leeson: The Agent Ruby Files |publisher=SFMOMA |date= |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Films and documentaries ==
A 1990 documentary, ''[[Desire Inc.]]'' features a series of seductive television ads in which a sexy woman asked for viewers to call her.

Leeson's three feature films - ''[[Strange Culture]]'', ''[[Teknolust]]'', ''[[Conceiving Ada]]'' - have been part of the [[Sundance Film Festival]], the Toronto International Film Festival and The [[Berlin International Film Festival]], among others, and have won numerous awards.

In 2011 Hershman released the ground-breaking [[!Women Art Revolution]], a feature-length documentary about the [[Feminist art movement in the United States]].  According to Leeson:&lt;ref name="Hacking the Codes of Self Representation, LEA Magazine"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The films are all about loss and technology. Ada Lovelace invented computer language, but was never credited and was basically erased from history. Teknolust is about artificial intelligence clones: the bots that escape into reality and interact with human life, in effect a symbiosis between technological life and human life, and how the two can marry. Strange Culture again was about misidentity, where the media created a fictional character that they blame this crime on, rather than the actual person. All of these works are about erasure of identity and how technology adds to it and creates it. And how you can defeat that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As part of her 2014 exhibition "How To Disappear," she premiered her video ''The Ballad of JT LeRoy'',&lt;ref name="Birds Eye View"/&gt; examining [[Laura Albert]]'s use of the [[literary persona]] [[JT LeRoy]]. Reflecting on the parallels between JT LeRoy and Roberta Breitmore, Hershman Leeson has commented:&lt;ref name="KubaParis Interview"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of an alter ego is not new at all. Writers have been protecting themselves in that way for centuries. [[Mary Shelley]] did it. Of course Laura took this practice further and I think that was very smart and I do not think she deserves the kind of condemnation that she got. If I had done the Roberta thing ten years later, I would have faced the same problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Retrospectives ==
In 2007 a retrospective at the [[Whitworth Art Gallery]] in [[Manchester]], ''Autonomous Agents'', featured a comprehensive range of the artist's work - from the ''Roberta Breitmore'' series (1974–78) to videos from the 1980s and interactive installations that use the Internet and artificial intelligence software. Her influential early ventures into performance and photography are also featured in the current touring exhibition ''WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution'', organized by the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]]. ''The Art and Films of Lynn Hershman Leeson: Secret Agents, Private I'', was published by The [[University of California Press]] in 2005 on the occasion of another retrospective at the [[Henry Gallery]] in [[Seattle]].

In 2014 a retrospective at The ZKM Museum of Contemporary Art in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]], "Civic Radar", has realized the first retrospective which not only ensures an overview of all creative phases in Lynn Hershman Leeson’s oeuvre but also the most recent productions of this innovative artist.
&lt;ref name="The ZKM Museum of Contemporary Art"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zkm.de/en/event/2014/12/lynn-hershman-leeson-civic-radar|title=Civic Radar|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While encompassing a wide body of Hershman's work throughout the years, as an exhibition, "Civic Radar" highlights Hershman's interest in technology, looking closely at artificial intelligence and genetic modification.  In 2017, "Civic Radar," Hershman's retrospective from ZKM was hosted at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ybca.org/whats-on/civic-radar|title=YBCA: Civic Radar|website=www.ybca.org|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4508">A '''manufacturing supermarket''' (or market location) is, for a factory process, what a retail supermarket is for the customer. The customers draw products from the 'shelves' as needed and this can be detected by the supplier who then initiates a replenishment of that item. It was the observation that this 'way of working' could be transferred from retail to manufacturing that is one of the cornerstones of the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS).

== History ==

In the 1950s Toyota sent teams to the United States to learn how they achieved mass-production. However, the Toyota Delegation first got inspiration for their production system at an American Supermarket (a Piggly Wiggly, to be precise). They saw the virtue in the supermarket only reordering and restocking goods once they’d been bought by customers.

In a supermarket (like the TPS) customers (processes) buy what they need when they need it. Since the system is self-service the sales effort (materials management) is reduced. The shelves are refilled as products are sold (parts withdrawn) on the assumption that what has sold will sell again which makes it easy to see how much has been used and to avoid overstocking. The most important feature of a supermarket system is that stocking is triggered by actual demand. In the TPS this signal triggers the 'pull' system of production.&lt;ref&gt;A study of the Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, Production Press, 1989, p 90&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

Market locations are appropriate where there is a desire to communicate customer pull up the supply chain. The aim of the 'market' is to send single unit consumption signals back up the supply chain so that a demand leveling effect occurs. Just as in a supermarket it is possible for someone to decide to cater for a party of 300 from the supermarket so it is possible to decide to suddenly fill ten trucks and send massively distorting signals up those same pathways. Thus the 'market location' can be used as a sort of isolator between actual demand and how supply would like demand to be, an isolator between batch demand spikes and the up upstream supply process.&lt;ref&gt;The Gold Mine, F &amp; M Ballé, Lean Enterprise Institute, 2005, p190&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the market were positioned at the loading bay, then it will receive 'spikes' of demand whenever a truck comes in to be loaded. Since, in general, one knows in advance when trucks will arrive and what they will require to be loaded onto them, it is possible to spread that demand spike over a chosen period before the truck actually arrives. It is possible to do this by designating a location, say a marked floor area, to be the 'virtual' truck and moving items from the market to the 'virtual truck' smoothly over the chosen period prior to the load onto the actual truck commencing. Smoothly here means that for each item its 'loading' is evenly spread across the period. For regular shipments this period might start the moment the last shipment in that schedule departs the loading bay. This has four key impacts:

# ''Loading movements rise'', which is the reason often given for not doing this 'virtual' truck loading;
# ''Demand evenness ([[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]) increases'' which allows stock reductions and exposes new issues to be resolved;
# ''Any last minute searching for items to load is eliminated'' since before the real truck need to be loaded the 'virtual' truck will have completed its loading;
# ''Any potential shortages that may affect the shipment can be exposed earlier'' by the '[[stockout]]' in the market location. This is true because the 'virtual' truck loading sequence will be constructed to fit with the supply process tempo.

This logic can, obviously, be applied upstream of any batch process and not just deliveries to another plant. It is a workaround for the fact that the batch process hasn't been made to flow yet. It therefore has some costs but the benefits in terms of reducing the three wastes should outweigh these.

Toyota use this technique and demand it of their suppliers in order to generate focus on the supply issues it uncovers. They then demand the preparation of loads for more frequent 'virtual' trucks than will actually appear in order to raise this pressure (see [[Frequent deliveries]]).

At low stocking levels for some items the 'market location' can require [[Just in Sequence]] supply rather than [[Just-in-time (business)|Just in Time]].

The '''[[National Rugby League|NRL]] finals system''' is the finals series that is currently being used by the [[National Rugby League|National Rugby League competitions of Australia and New Zealand]] since 2012. The NRL finals system replaced the McIntyre system which was used from 1999 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrl.com/nrl-finals-system-changed/tabid/10874/newsid/65960/default.aspx NRL finals system changed], NRL.com official website, 22 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/nrl-premiership/nrl-quits-mcintyre-system-adopts-afl-style-finals/story-fn2mcuj6-1226278382721 NRL quits McIntyre system, adopts AFL-style finals], ''Fox Sports Australia'', 22 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar system was previously used by the [[Australian Rugby League]] in the 1995 and 1996 seasons, however there was no crossover in 1995, and in 1996 teams crossed over in Week 2, rather than Week 3. The system has also been adopted by the [[Victorian Football League]] and a slightly modified version adopted by [[Super league|Super League]]. The [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) also use this system and have done so since 2000.

The highest-ranked eight teams at the end of the regular season participate in a four-week tournament, with two teams eliminated in each of the first three weeks. The seventh team is eliminated (and the premiership awarded) in the Grand Final.

The system is designed to give the top four teams an easier road to the Grand Final than the second four teams. The top four needs to win only two finals to reach the Grand Final, while the second four needs to win three; and, two of the top four teams receive a bye in the second week of the playoff and then play at home in the third week, while the other two play at home in the second week.

&lt;/center&gt;

==Finals format==

===Week one===
* 1st Qualifying Final: 1st ranked team hosts 4th ranked team
* 2nd Qualifying Final: 2nd ranked team hosts 3rd ranked team
* 1st Elimination Final: 5th ranked team hosts 8th ranked team
* 2nd Elimination Final: 6th ranked team hosts 7th ranked team

The eight finalists are split into two groups for the opening week of the Finals Series.  The top four teams have the best chance of winning the premiership and play the two Qualifying Finals.  The winners get a bye through to Week Three of the tournament to play home Preliminary Finals, while the losers play home Semi-Finals in Week Two.  The bottom four teams play the two Elimination Finals, where the winners advance to Week Two away games and the losers' seasons are over.

===Week two===
* 1st Semi-final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"&gt;Under the NRL finals system, the term "semi-final" has different usage to that a traditional [[knock out tournament]]. The two games played immediately before the Grand Final, which would be known as semi-finals in a knock out tournament, are called "preliminary finals". The semi-finals refer to the two games preceding the preliminary finals. This is consistent with the terminology used by the league under the [[McIntyre System]] from 1931 until 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Loser of 1st QF hosts winner of 1st EF
* 2nd Semi-final: Loser of 2nd QF hosts winner of 2nd EF

===Week three===
* 1st Preliminary Final:&lt;ref name="semi-final" /&gt; Winner of 1st QF hosts winner of 2nd SF
* 2nd Preliminary Final: Winner of 2nd QF hosts winner of 1st SF

===Week four===
* Grand Final: Winner of 1st PF meets Winner of 2nd PF at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] on a Sunday night with the game starting at about 7.15pm.

==Venues==
The NRL Grand Final is held every year at [[ANZ Stadium|Stadium Australia]] in week four of the finals.

==Advantages for ladder positions==
Under this finals system, the final eight teams are broken up into four groups of two. Each group of two earns one extra benefit over the teams beneath it. These benefits are home ground finals and the ''double-chance'', whereby a first-week loss will not eliminate the team from the finals. Note that the "home" designations may be irrelevant for games played between teams from the same state - all finals games played between two Sydney based teams will be held at Allianz Stadium or ANZ Stadium, regardless of the "home" team's home ground.

===First and second===
First and Second receive the '''double-chance''', and will play their first '''two finals matches at home''': their qualifying final, and then either a semi-final if they lose their qualifying final or a preliminary final if they win their qualifying final. They need to win two finals to reach the Grand Final.

===Third and fourth===
Third and Fourth also receive the '''double-chance''', but receive only '''one finals match at home''': either a semi-final if they lose their qualifying final or a preliminary final if they win their qualifying final. They need to win two finals to reach the Grand Final.

===Fifth and sixth===
Fifth and Sixth receive '''one home final''': their elimination final. They need to win three finals to reach the Grand Final.

===Seventh and eighth===
Seventh and Eighth receive no home finals. They need to win three finals to reach the Grand Final.

==Drawn games==
Drawn games can not occur in the NRL finals system. In the event of tied scores at the end of the 80 minutes of a rugby league match, extra time and golden point will take place.

==Criticism==

The new finals system was introduced after the 2011 season, after debate had raged for several years before that.  In 2008 for the first time ever the 8th placed team (New Zealand Warriors) beat the 1st placed team (Melbourne Storm) in week one of the finals.  In 2009, the scenario occurred for the 2nd time ever when the Parramatta Eels defeated the St. George Illawarra Dragons.  In both case, these teams then went on to have home advantage in the second week of the finals, leading to criticism from fans and pundits that too much of an advantage was being given to lower placed teams.  However, under the current system the 7th and 8th placed teams can never have a home finals match - a move which seems designed to eliminate the possibility of a team making a late charge towards the Grand Final despite finishing relatively low in the regular season.  This has led to criticism that the current system has rendered having a top 8 pointless because some of the teams are there simply to make up numbers as it has been made far too difficult for them to progress very far into the finals series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/nrl-chief-david-gallop-says-the-mcintyre-finals-system-will-remain/story-fn2mcuj6-1225780895274?nk=9666cbe41d24fa3a32c585e600b754ba&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has also been noted that criticism of the previous McIntyre System has come primarily from coaches and players after their team has been eliminated from the finals by a lower ranked team.  Complaints about the system from teams that have won games they were expected to win seem far less prevalent. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/4120549/Cleary-slams-NRL-finals-system-as-Warriors-bounced-out&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/brisbane-captain-darren-lockyer-says-afl-finals-system-is-fairer-than-nrl-model/story-e6frfgbo-1225770369373?nk=9666cbe41d24fa3a32c585e600b754ba&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8139">'''Narcissistic elation''' or '''narcissistic coenaesthetic expansion''' were terms used by Hungarian psychoanalyst [[Béla Grunberger]] to highlight 'the narcissistic situation of the primal self in narcissistic union with the mother'.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Figlio, ''Psychoanalysis, Science and Masculinity'' (2001) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissistic elation has also been used more widely to describe a variety of conditions, including states of being in [[love]], of triumph,  and of obtaining self-understanding.

== Grunberger's definition==

The term was coined to describe the state of prenatal beatitude, which according to him characterizes the life of the fetus: a state of [[megalomania]]cal happiness amounting to a perfect homeostasis, devoid of needs or desires. The ideal here is bliss experienced in absolute withdrawal from the object and from the outside world. Narcissistic elation is at once the memory of this unique and privileged state of elation; a sense of well-being of completeness and omnipotence linked to that memory, and pride in having experienced this state, pride in its (illusory) oneness. Narcissistic elation is characteristic of an object relationship that is played out, in its negative version, as a state of splendid isolation, and, in its positive version, as a desperate quest for fusion with the other, for a mirror-image relationship. It involves a return to paradise lost and all that is attached to this idea: fusion, self-love, megalomania, omnipotence, immortality, and invulnerability. After birth, the infant continues to enjoy the protonarcissistic existence as before, and this is reinforced by the fact that people around it, in particular the mother, meet all its needs and wishes. This state of illusion is soon compromised, however, as inevitable frustrations begin to occur. The traces of this state of elation and megalomania, based on the notions of harmony and omnipotence, nevertheless provide a source of psychic energy that will remain active throughout life. The child, and later the adult, will seek to preserve and return to this narcissistic mode of being, notably through music, passionate love, or mystical ecstasy. Perhaps, after all, what fascinated Narcissus was the sight—beyond his own reflection—of the amniotic water, and the deep, regressive promise of happiness that it held out. Following an initial period of elation known as the "honeymoon", psychoanalytic treatment must succeed in bringing together the narcissistic elements of the self by integrating them into interpretations of reality: ego-libido and object-libido must arrive at a satisfactory compromise.

==Oceanic origins==

[[Freud]] had used the term [[oceanic feeling]] to describe 'an early phase of ego-feeling...the oceanic feeling, which might seek something like the restoration of limitless [[narcissism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Grunberger and [[André Green (psychoanalyst)|André Green]] have subsequently 'traced narcissism to pre-natal states of elation, making it biological and drive-driven'.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Kilbourne, ''Disappearing Persons'' (2002) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Building on 'the state of prenatal beatitude, which according to him characterizes the life of the fetus', Grunberger therefore considered that 'narcissistic elation is at once the memory of this unique and privileged state of elation; a sense of well-being of completeness and omnipotence linked to that memory, and pride in having experienced this state, pride in its (illusory) oneness'.

==Ego ideal==
{{Main|Ego ideal}}
Freud also explored how 'in cases of [[mania]] the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and ego ideal have fused together...in a mood of triumph and self-satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Grunberger considered such states as reaching back to the primal narcissistic elation, and as drawing on 'traces of this state of elation and megalomania, based on the notions of harmony and omnipotence'.

Building on his work, [[Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel]] claims that 'it is indeed therefore narcissistic elation, the meeting of ego and ideal, that dissolves the [[Id, ego and super-ego|superego]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, ''The Ego Ideal'' (1985) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; One may consider in general that 'the feeling of triumph...brings with it "oceanic" feelings, because it represents reunion with the omnipotent one'.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph R. Greenson, "On Gambling", in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toddling==
With respect to a slightly later phase of early development, [[Margaret Mahler]] 'describes the practising junior [[toddler|toddler's]] [[omnipotent]] exhilaration (excitement) and narcissistic elation (joy)'&lt;ref&gt;Allan N. Schore, ''Affect Regulation and the Origins of the Self'' (1999) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; at learning to walk—the 'tremendously exhilarating, truly dramatic effect that upright locomotion had'—noting however that 'it is precisely at the point where the child is at the peak of his delusion of omnipotence...that his narcissism is particularly vulnerable to deflation'.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret S. Mahler, ''The Psychological Birth of the Human Infant'' (London 1975) p. 74 and p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the toddler's new achievement, 'from dawn to dusk he marches around in an ecstatic, drunken dance...quite in love with himself for being so clever'.&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1996) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-understanding==

Narcissistic elation may subsequently be reactivated within a therapeutic context. [[Edmund Bergler]] wrote of 'the narcissistic elation that comes from self-understanding';&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Lindesmith, ''Addiction and Opiates'' (2008) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Herbert Rosenfeld]] described what he called the re-emergence of '"narcissistic omnipotent object relations"...in the clinical situation'.&lt;ref&gt;J. Grotstein, "Foreword", in [[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993) p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat similarly, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] spoke of 'the megalomaniac ebriety which...[i]s the index of the termination of the analysis in present practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997( p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love==

In later life, the adult may seek to 'return to this narcissistic mode of being, notably through music, passionate love, or mystical ecstasy'. For some, the whole 'purpose of love...[is] equal exchange in an atmosphere of shared narcissistic elation'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Starobinski, ''Blessings in Disguise'' (1993) p. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others may consider as ultimately futile this 'search for a pure narcissistic exaltation, the elation procured by [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the imaginary]] contemplation of the object';&lt;ref&gt;Chasseguet-Smirgal, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; and yet still recognise the power of 'the enchantment of love...as the exaltation of the other...this breathlessness which, with the other, has created the most false of demands, that of narcissistic satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1993) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

In ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', a 'cold intellectual arrogance and narcissistic elation' have been identified in 'the highly ambitious speculations attributed to [[Stephen Dedalus|Stephen]]—the central protagonist—with respect to aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;André Bleikasten, ''The Most Splendid Failure'' (1976) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4772">'''New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, Inc.''' ("New York Lawyers" or "NYLPI" [nil-pee]) is a [[non-profit]] [[civil rights]] law firm located in [[New York City]], specializing in the areas of [[disability rights]], access to [[health care]] and [[environmental justice]].

NYLPI was founded in 1976 by eleven attorneys and nine law firms to meet the legal needs of underserved, underrepresented New Yorkers and their communities. This arrangement ultimately evolved into NYLPI's [[pro bono]] clearinghouse, which now matches volunteer lawyers from prestigious law firms and corporate legal departments with community groups and nonprofit organizations in need of legal services.

NYLPI also has a number of in-house staff attorneys, [[social worker]]s and [[community organizer]]s working in the organization's three areas of specialization.  NYLPI's Disability Justice Program "protects and promotes the civil rights of people with disabilities," its  Environmental Justice Program "provides organizing and legal assistance to low-income neighborhoods and communities of color that bear an unfair burden of environmental threats," and its Health Justice Program "works to ensure access to quality health care for people in medically underserved communities or facing barriers due to [[limited English proficiency]], racial and ethnic discrimination, and disability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nylpi.org/ New York Lawyers for the Public Interest]&lt;/ref&gt;

NYLPI was once associated with the National Campaign to Restore Civil Rights (NCRCR), "a national collaboration of lawyers, academics, students, community activists, and concerned individuals who have joined together in response to recent federal court decisions that are eroding civil rights protections," but is no longer connected to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollbackcampaign.org/ National Campaign to Restore Civil Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
NYLPI's mission is to advance equality and civil rights, with a focus on health justice, disability justice, and environmental justice, through the power of community lawyering and partnerships with the private bar.

==History==
New York Lawyers for the Public Interest originated in proposals submitted to the [[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]] in 1973 by its Young Lawyers Committee and the Council of New York Law Associates. Both addressed the need for legal services to organizations serving the public interest.  A Subcommittee on Legal Services Programs, appointed by Orville Schell, Jr., President of the Association, and chaired by [[David Sive]], was charged with making appropriate recommendations, and resulting issues were resolved under the Presidency of [[Cyrus R. Vance]] in 1975. Vance served as the organization's first Chairman and was succeeded by Schell in 1977, when Vance became Secretary of State.

{{Cognitive}}
'''Numerical cognition''' is a subdiscipline of [[cognitive science]] that studies the cognitive, developmental and neural bases of [[number]]s and [[mathematics]]. As with many cognitive science endeavors, this is a highly interdisciplinary topic, and includes researchers in [[cognitive psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive linguistics]]. This discipline, although it may interact with questions in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], is primarily concerned with [[empirical]] questions.

Topics included in the domain of numerical cognition include:
*How do [[Number sense in animals|non-human animals process numerosity]]?
*How do infants acquire an understanding of numbers (and how much is inborn)?
*How do humans associate linguistic symbols with numerical quantities?
*How do these capacities underlie our ability to perform complex calculations?
*What are the neural bases of these abilities, both in humans and in non-humans?
*What metaphorical capacities and processes allow us to extend our numerical understanding into complex domains such as the concept of [[infinity]], the [[infinitesimal]] or the concept of the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] in calculus?

== Comparative studies ==
A variety of research has demonstrated that non-human animals, including rats, lions and various species of primates have an [[approximate number system|approximate sense of number]] (referred to as "[[Number sense in animals|numerosity]]") (for a review, see {{Harvnb|Dehaene|1997}}). For example, when a rat is trained to press a bar 8 or 16 times to receive a food reward, the number of bar presses will approximate a [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] or Normal distribution with peak around 8 or 16 bar presses. When rats are more hungry, their bar pressing behavior is more rapid, so by showing that the peak number of bar presses is the same for either well-fed or hungry rats, it is possible to disentangle time and number of bar presses. In addition, in a few species the [[parallel individuation system]] has been shown, for example in the case of [[guppy|guppies]] which successfully discriminated between 1 and 4 other individuals.&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, researchers have set up hidden speakers in the African savannah to test natural (untrained) behavior in lions {{Harv|McComb|Packer|Pusey|1994}}. These speakers can play a number of lion calls, from 1 to 5. If a single lioness hears, for example, three calls from unknown lions, she will leave, while if she is with four of her sisters, they will go and explore. This suggests that not only can lions tell when they are "outnumbered" but that they can do this on the basis of signals from different sensory modalities, suggesting that numerosity is a multisensory concept.

== Developmental studies ==
Developmental psychology studies have shown that human infants, like non-human animals, have an approximate sense of number. For example, in one study, infants were repeatedly presented with arrays of (in one block) 16 dots. Careful controls were in place to eliminate information from "non-numerical" parameters such as total surface area, luminance, circumference, and so on. After the infants had been presented with many displays containing 16 items, they [[Habituation|habituated]], or stopped looking as long at the display. Infants were then presented with a display containing 8 items, and they looked longer at the novel display.

Because of the numerous controls that were in place to rule out non-numerical factors, the experimenters infer that six-month-old infants are sensitive to differences between 8 and 16. Subsequent experiments, using similar methodologies showed that 6-month-old infants can discriminate numbers differing by a 2:1 ratio (8 vs. 16 or 16 vs. 32) but not by a 3:2 ratio (8 vs. 12 or 16 vs. 24). However, 10-month-old infants succeed both at the 2:1 and the 3:2 ratio, suggesting an increased sensitivity to numerosity differences with age (for a review of this literature see {{Harvnb|Feigenson|Dehaene|Spelke|2004}}).

In another series of studies, [[Karen Wynn]] showed that infants as young as five months are able to do very simple additions (e.g., 1 + 1 = 2) and subtractions (3 - 1 = 2). To demonstrate this, Wynn used a "violation of expectation" paradigm, in which infants were shown (for example) one Mickey Mouse doll going behind a screen, followed by another. If, when the screen was lowered, infants were presented with only one Mickey (the "impossible event") they looked longer than if they were shown two Mickeys (the "possible" event). Further studies by Karen Wynn and Koleen McCrink found that although infants' ability to compute exact outcomes only holds over small numbers, infants can compute approximate outcomes of larger addition and subtraction events (e.g., "5+5" and "10-5" events).

There is debate about how much these infant systems actually contain in terms of number concepts, harkening to the classic [[nature versus nurture]] debate.  {{Harvnb|Gelman|Gallistel|1978}} suggested that a child innately has the concept of natural number, and only has to map this onto the words used in her language. {{Harvnb|Carey | 2004}}, {{Harvnb|Carey|2009}}  disagreed, saying that these systems can only encode large numbers in an [[approximate number system|approximate way]], where language-based natural numbers can be exact. Without language, only numbers 1 to 4 are believed to have an exact representation, through the [[parallel individuation system]]. One promising approach is to see if cultures that lack number words can deal with natural numbers. The results so far are mixed (e.g., {{Harvnb|Pica|Lemer|Izard|Dehaene|2004}});  {{Harvnb|Butterworth|Reeve|2008}},  {{Harvnb|Butterworth|Reeve| Lloyd|2008}}.

== Neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies ==
Human neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that regions of the [[parietal lobe]], including the [[intraparietal sulcus]] (IPS) and the [[inferior parietal lobule]] (IPL) are activated when subjects are asked to perform calculation tasks. Based on both human [[neuroimaging]] and [[neuropsychology]], Stanislas Dehaene and colleagues have suggested that these two parietal structures play complementary roles. The IPS is thought to house the circuitry that is fundamentally involved in numerical estimation {{Harv|Piazza|Izard|Pinel|Le Bihan|2004}}, number comparison ({{Harvnb|Pinel|Dehaene|Riviere|Le Bihan|2001}}; {{Harvnb|Pinel|Piazza|Le Bihan|Dehaene|2004}}) and on-line calculation, or quantity processing (often tested with subtraction) while the IPL is thought to be involved in rote memorization, such as multiplication (see {{Harvnb|Dehaene|1997}}). Thus, a patient with a lesion to the IPL may be able to subtract, but not multiply, and vice versa for a patient with a lesion to the IPS. In addition to these parietal regions, regions of the [[frontal lobe]] are also active in calculation tasks. These activations overlap with regions involved in language processing such as [[Broca's area]] and regions involved in [[working memory]] and [[attention]].  Additionally, the inferotemporal cortex is implicated in processing the numerical shapes and symbols, necessary for calculations with Arabic digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piazza|first=Manuela|last2=Eger|first2=Evelyn|title=Neural foundations and functional specificity of number representations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.09.025|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=83|pages=257–273|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.09.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; More current research has highlighted the networks involved with multiplication and subtraction tasks. Multiplication is often learned through rote memorization and verbal repetitions, and neuroimaging studies &lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Xue"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Jamie I.D.|last2=Xue|first2=Qilin|title=Cognitive Arithmetic Across Cultures|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=130|issue=2|pages=299–315|doi=10.1037//0096-3445.130.2.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that multiplication uses a left lateralized network of the inferior frontal cortex and the superior-middle temporal gyri in addition to the IPL and IPS. Subtraction is taught more with quantity manipulation and strategy use, more reliant upon the right IPS and the posterior parietal lobule.&lt;ref&gt;Barrouillet, P., Mignon, M., &amp; Thevenot, C. (2008). Strategies in subtraction problem solving in children. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 99(4), 233-251.

Single-unit [[neurophysiology]] in monkeys has also found neurons in the frontal cortex and in the intraparietal sulcus that respond to numbers. Andreas Nieder ({{Harvnb|Nieder|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Nieder|Freedman|Miller|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Nieder|Miller|2004}}) trained monkeys to perform a "delayed match-to-sample" task. For example, a monkey might be presented with a field of four dots, and is required to keep that in memory after the display is taken away. Then, after a delay period of several seconds, a second display is presented. If the number on the second display match that from the first, the monkey has to release a lever. If it is different, the monkey has to hold the lever. Neural activity recorded during the delay period showed that neurons in the intraparietal sulcus and the frontal cortex had a "preferred numerosity", exactly as predicted by behavioral studies. That is, a certain number might fire strongly for four, but less strongly for three or five, and even less for two or six. Thus, we say that these neurons were "tuned" for specific quantities. Note that these neuronal responses followed [[Weber-Fechner law|Weber's law]], as has been demonstrated for other sensory dimensions, and consistent with the ratio dependence observed for non-human animals' and infants' numerical behavior {{Harv|Nieder|Miller|2003}}.

It is important to note that while primates have remarkably similar brains to humans, there are differences in function, ability, and sophistication. They make for good preliminary test subjects, but do not show small differences that are the result of different evolutionary tracks and environment. However, in the realm of number, they share many similarities. As identified in monkeys, neurons selectively tuned to number were identified in the bilateral intraparietal sulci and prefrontal cortex in humans. Piazza and colleagues&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piazza|first=Manuela|last2=Izard|first2=Véronique|last3=Pinel|first3=Philippe|last4=Bihan|first4=Denis Le|last5=Dehaene|first5=Stanislas|title=Tuning Curves for Approximate Numerosity in the Human Intraparietal Sulcus|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2004.10.014|journal=Neuron|volume=44|issue=3|pages=547–555|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated this using fMRI, presenting participants with sets of dots where they either had to make same-different judgments or larger-smaller judgments. The sets of dots consisted of base numbers 16 and 32 dots with ratios in 1.25, 1.5, and 2. Deviant numbers were included in some trials in larger or smaller amounts than the base numbers. Participants displayed similar activation patterns as Neider&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nieder|first=Andreas|last2=Miller|first2=Earl K.|title=Coding of Cognitive Magnitude|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(02)01144-3|journal=Neuron|volume=37|issue=1|pages=149–157|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)01144-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in the monkeys. The [[intraparietal sulcus]] and the [[prefrontal cortex]], also implicated in number, communicate in approximating number and it was found in both species that the parietal neurons of the IPS had short firing latencies, whereas the frontal neurons had longer firing latencies. This supports the notion that number is first processed in the IPS and, if needed, is then transferred to the associated frontal neurons in the [[prefrontal cortex]] for further numerations and applications. Humans displayed Gaussian curves in the tuning curves of approximate magnitude. This aligned with monkeys, displaying a similarly structured mechanism in both species with classic Gaussian curves relative to the increasingly deviant numbers with 16 and 32 as well as habituation. The results followed [[Weber's Law]], with accuracy decreasing as the ratio between numbers became smaller. This supports the findings made by Neider&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nieder|first=Andreas|last2=Miller|first2=Earl K.|date=2004-05-11|title=A parieto-frontal network for visual numerical information in the monkey|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/19/7457|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=101|issue=19|pages=7457–7462|doi=10.1073/pnas.0402239101|issn=0027-8424|pmid=15123797|pmc=409940}}&lt;/ref&gt; in macaque monkeys and shows definitive evidence for an [[approximate number system|approximate number logarithmic scale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berteletti|first=Ilaria|last2=Lucangeli|first2=Daniela|last3=Piazza|first3=Manuela|last4=Dehaene|first4=Stanislas|last5=Zorzi|first5=Marco|title=Numerical estimation in preschoolers.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/a0017887|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=545–551|doi=10.1037/a0017887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khanum|first=Saeeda|last2=Hanif|first2=Rubina|last3=Spelke|first3=Elizabeth S.|last4=Berteletti|first4=Ilaria|last5=Hyde|first5=Daniel C.|date=2016-10-20|title=Effects of Non-Symbolic Approximate Number Practice on Symbolic Numerical Abilities in Pakistani Children|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164436|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0164436|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0164436|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; in humans.

With an established mechanism for approximating non-symbolic number in both humans and primates, a necessary further investigation is needed to determine if this mechanism is innate and present in children, which would suggest an inborn ability to process numerical stimuli much like humans are born ready to process language. Cantlon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cantlon|first=Jessica F.|last2=Brannon|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Carter|first3=Elizabeth J.|last4=Pelphrey|first4=Kevin A.|date=2006-04-11|title=Functional Imaging of Numerical Processing in Adults and 4-y-Old Children|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040125|journal=PLOS Biology|language=en|volume=4|issue=5|pages=e125|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040125|issn=1545-7885}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colleagues set out to investigate this in 4 year old healthy, normally developing children in parallel with adults. A similar task to Piazza's&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was used in this experiment, without the judgment tasks. Dot arrays of varying size and number were used, with 16 and 32 as the base numerosities. in each block, 232 stimuli were presented with 20 deviant numerosities of a 2.0 ratio both larger and smaller. For example, out of the 232 trials, 16 dots were presented in varying size and distance but 10 of those trials had 8 dots, and 10 of those trials had 32 dots, making up the 20 deviant stimuli. The same applied to the blocks with 32 as the base numerosity. To ensure the adults and children were attending to the stimuli, they put 3 fixation points throughout the trial where the participant had to move a joystick to move forward. Their findings indicated that the adults in the experiment had significant activation of the IPS when viewing the deviant number stimuli, aligning with what was previously found in the aforementioned paragraph. In the 4 year olds, they found significant activation of the IPS to the deviant number stimuli, resembling the activation found in adults. There were some differences in the activations, with adults displaying more robust bilateral activation, where the 4 year olds primarily showed activation in their right IPS and activated 112 less voxels than the adults. This suggests that at age 4, children have an established mechanism of neurons in the IPS tuned for processing non-symbolic numerosities. Other studies have gone deeper into this mechanism in children and discovered that children do also represent approximate numbers on a [[logarithmic scale]], aligning with the claims made by Piazza in adults.

A study by Izard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Izard|first=Véronique|last2=Sann|first2=Coralie|last3=Spelke|first3=Elizabeth S.|last4=Streri|first4=Arlette|date=2009-06-23|title=Newborn infants perceive abstract numbers|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/25/10382|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=25|pages=10382–10385|doi=10.1073/pnas.0812142106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19520833}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colleagues investigated abstract number representations in infants using a different paradigm than the previous researchers because of the nature and developmental stage of the infants. For infants, they examined abstract number with both auditory and visual stimuli with a looking-time paradigm. The sets used were 4vs.12, 8vs.16, and 4vs.8. The auditory stimuli consisted of tones in different frequencies with a set number of tones, with some deviant trials where the tones were shorter but more numerous or longer and less numerous to account for duration and its potential confounds. After the auditory stimuli was presented with 2 minutes of familiarization, the visual stimuli was presented with a congruent or incongruent array of colorful dots with facial features. they remained on the screen until the infant looked away. They found that infants looked longer at the stimuli that matched the auditory tones, suggesting that the system for approximating non-symbolic number, even across modalities, is present in infancy. What is important to note across these three particular human studies on nonsymbolic numerosities is that it is present in infancy and develops over the lifetime. The honing of their approximation and number sense abilities as indicated by the improving Weber fractions across time, and usage of the left IPS to provide a wider berth for processing of computations and enumerations lend support for the claims that are made for a nonsymbolic number processing mechanism in human brains.

== Relations between number and other cognitive processes ==
There is evidence that numerical cognition is intimately related to other aspects of thought – particularly spatial cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hubbard | first=Edward M.|author2=Piazza, Manuela |author3=Pinel, Philippe |author4= Dehaene, Stanislas  | title=Interactions between number and space in parietal cortex | journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience | date=June 2005  | volume=6 | issue=1–2 | pages=435–448|doi=10.1038/nrn1684 | url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v6/n6/full/nrn1684.html | pmid=15928716}}&lt;/ref&gt; One line of evidence comes from studies performed on number-form [[Synaesthesia|synaesthetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Galton | first=Francis | title=Visualised Numerals | journal=Nature | date=25 March 1880 | volume=21 | pages=494–495|doi=10.1038/021494e0 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v21/n543/abs/021494e0.html | issue=543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals report that numbers are mentally represented with a particular spatial layout; others experience numbers as perceivable objects that can be visually manipulated to facilitate calculation. Behavioral studies further reinforce the connection between numerical and spatial cognition. For instance, participants respond quicker to larger numbers if they are responding on the right side of space, and quicker to smaller numbers when on the left—the so-called "Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes" or [[Spatial-numerical association of response codes|SNARC effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dehaene | first=Stanislas|author2=Bossini, Serge |author3=Giraux, Pascal  | title=The mental representation of parity and number magnitude | journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology | date=September 1993  | volume=122 | pages=371–396|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.122.3.371 | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/122/3/371/ | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect varies across culture and context,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fischer | first=Martin H.|author2=Mills, Richard A. |author3=Shaki, Samuel  | title=How to cook a SNARC: Number placement in text rapidly changes spatial–numerical associations | journal=Brain and Cognition | date=April 2010  | volume=72 | issue=3 | pages=333–336|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.10.010 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WBY-4XPBSNT-1&amp;_user=4429&amp;_coverDate=04%2F30%2F2010&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1750488780&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000059602&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=4429&amp;md5=2c807ea3dafb118b016973bfee5441f6&amp;searchtype=a|accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, and some research has even begun to question whether the SNARC reflects an inherent number-space association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Núñez | first=Rafael|author2=Doan, D. |author3=Nikoulina, A.  | title=Squeezing, striking, and vocalizing: Is number representation fundamentally spatial? | journal=Cognition | date=August 2011 | pmid=21640338|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2011.05.001 | volume=120 | issue=2 | pages=225–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead invoking strategic problem solving or a more general cognitive mechanism like [[conceptual metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Walsh | first=Vincent | title=A theory of magnitude: common cortical metrics of time, space and quantity | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | date=November 2003  | volume=7 | issue=11 | pages=483–488|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2003.09.002 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VH9-49JHRY2-1&amp;_user=9044837&amp;_coverDate=11%2F30%2F2003&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000059602&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=9044837&amp;md5=8621b8ecd2a24915cdcf9294cda7783c&amp;searchtype=a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nunez | first=Rafael | title=Numbers and Arithmetic: Neither Hardwired Nor Out There | journal=Biological Theory | year=2009 | volume=4 | issue = 1  | pages=68–83 | doi=10.1162/biot.2009.4.1.68 | url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/biot.2009.4.1.68|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, neuroimaging studies reveal that the association between number and space also shows up in brain activity.

Modification of the usual [[decimal representation]] was advocated by [[John Colson]]. The sense of [[complement (set theory)|complementation]], missing in the usual decimal system, is expressed by [[signed-digit representation]].

==Ethnolinguistic variance==

The numeracy of indigenous peoples is studied to identify universal aspects of numerical cognition in humans. Notable examples include the [[Pirahã people]] who have no words for specific numbers and the [[Munduruku people]] who only have number words up to five. Pirahã adults are unable to mark an exact number of tallies for a pile of nuts containing fewer than ten items. Anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] spent several decades studying the [[Yanomami]] in the field. He concluded that they have no need for counting in their everyday lives. Their hunters keep track of individual arrows with the same mental faculties that they use to recognize their family members. There are no known hunter-gatherer cultures that have a counting system in their language. The mental and lingual capabilities for numeracy are tied to the development of agriculture and with it large numbers of indistinguishable items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window Into Human Nature |first=Steven |last=Pinker |authorlink=Steven Pinker |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location= |year=2008 |isbn=0143114247 |pages= |page= |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCDX54DlYBYC&amp;q=counting+system}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RGBL I 1935 S 1145.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Title page of the German [[government gazette]] ''Reichsgesetzblatt'' issue proclaiming the laws, published on 16 September 1935 (RGB I No. 100)]]

The '''Nuremberg Laws''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Nürnberger Gesetze}}) were [[antisemitic]] and [[Racism|racial]] laws in [[Nazi Germany]]. They were enacted by the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] on 15&amp;nbsp;September 1935, at a special meeting convened during the annual [[Nuremberg Rally]] of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP). The two laws were the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour, which forbade marriages and [[extramarital intercourse]] between [[Jews]] and Germans  and the employment of German females under 45 in Jewish households; and the Reich Citizenship Law, which declared that only those of German or related blood were eligible to be Reich citizens; the remainder were classed as state subjects, without citizenship rights. A supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law officially came into force on that date. The laws were expanded on 26 November 1935 to include [[Romani people]]. This supplementary decree defined Romanis as "enemies of the race-based state", the same category as Jews.

Out of foreign policy concerns, prosecutions under the two laws did not commence until after the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin. After the Nazis [[Machtergreifung|seized power]] in 1933, they began to implement their policies, which included the formation of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' (people's community) based on race. [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of Nazi Germany (1933–1945)|Chancellor]] and [[Führer]] (leader) [[Adolf Hitler]] declared a [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|national boycott of Jewish businesses]] on 1 April 1933, and the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April, excluded [[Aryan race#Nazism|non-Aryans]] from the legal profession and civil service. Books considered un-German, including those by Jewish authors, were destroyed in a nationwide [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]] on 10 May. Jewish citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks. They were actively suppressed, stripped of their citizenship and civil rights, and eventually completely removed from German society.

The Nuremberg Laws had a crippling economic and social impact on the Jewish community. Persons convicted of violating the marriage laws were imprisoned, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores, many of which closed due to lack of customers. As Jews were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government-regulated professions such as medicine and education, many middle class business owners and professionals were forced to take menial employment. Emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country. By 1938 it was almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them. Mass deportation schemes such as the [[Madagascar Plan]] proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out, and starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.

==Background==
{{Main|Nazi eugenics|Nazism and race}}
The [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP; Nazi Party) was one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties active in Germany after the end of the First World War.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170–171}} The party platform included removal of the [[Weimar Republic]], rejection of the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], radical antisemitism, and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' (people's community) based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179–180}}

While imprisoned in 1924 after the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]], Hitler dictated ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' to his deputy, [[Rudolf Hess]].{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=121}} The book is an autobiography and exposition of Hitler's ideology in which he laid out his plans for transforming German society into one based on race. In it he outlined his belief in [[Jewish Bolshevism]], a conspiracy theory that posited the existence of an international Jewish conspiracy for world domination in which the Jews were the mortal enemy of the German people. Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his [[world view]] as expounded in ''Mein Kampf''.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=148–150}} The NSDAP advocated the concept of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' ("people's community") with the aim of uniting all Germans as national comrades, whilst excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or of a [[foreign races|foreign race]] (''Fremdvölkische'').{{sfn|Wildt|2012|pp=96–97}}

Discrimination against Jews intensified after the NSDAP seized power; following a month-long series of attacks by members of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; paramilitary wing of the NSDAP) on Jewish businesses, synagogues, and members of the legal profession, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|national boycott of Jewish businesses]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=203}} By 1933, many people who were not NSDAP members advocated segregating Jews from the rest of German society.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=539}} The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans to retire from the legal profession and civil service.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} In 1934, the NSDAP published a pamphlet titled ''"Warum Arierparagraph?"'' ("Why the Aryan Law?"), which summarised the perceived need for the law.{{sfn|Schulz|Frercks|1934}} As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life, members of the National Socialist Student League removed from libraries any books considered un-German, and a nationwide [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]] was held on 10 May.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=39}} Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=67–69}} Legislation passed in July 1933 stripped naturalised German Jews of their citizenship, creating a legal basis for recent immigrants (particularly Eastern European Jews) to be deported.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Many towns posted signs forbidding entry to Jews.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=233}} Throughout 1933 and 1934, Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=41}}

Other laws promulgated in this period included the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (passed on 14 July 1933), which called for the compulsory sterilisation of people with a range of hereditary, physical, and mental illnesses.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=507}} Under the Law against Dangerous Habitual Criminals (passed 24 November 1935), habitual criminals were forced to undergo sterilisation as well.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=511}} This law was also used to force the incarceration in prison or [[Nazi concentration camps]] of "social misfits" such as the chronically unemployed, prostitutes, beggars, alcoholics, homeless vagrants, and [[Romani people|Romani]] (referred to as "Gypsies").{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=49}}

===Reich Gypsy Law===
The Central Office for Combatting Gypsies was established in 1929.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|p=1070}} In December 1938 ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] issued an order for "combatting the Gypsy plague". Romanis were to be categorised in terms of their Roma ancestry as a racial characteristic, rather than their previous association as 'anti-social' elements of society.{{sfn|McGarry|2010|p=21}} This work was advanced by Dr Robert Ritter of the Racial Hygiene and Population unit of the Ministry of Health, who by 1942, had produced a scale of ZM+, ZM of the first and second degree, and ZM- to reflect an individual's decreasing level of Romani ancestry.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|pp=1070–1071}} This classification meant that one could be classified as Roma and subject to anti-Roma legislation on the basis of having two Roma great-great grandparents.{{sfn|Wolfe|2014|p=96}} Dr Zindel of the Ministry of the Interior prepared a draft of a Reich "Gypsy Law" intended to supplement and accompany the Nuremberg Laws. According to Zindel, the "Gypsy problem" could not be dealt with by forced resettlement or imprisonment within Germany. He recommended identification and registration of all Roma, followed by sterilisation and deportation. In 1938, public health authorities were ordered to register all Roma and Roma ''Mischlinge''.{{sfn|Grenville|2002|p=320}} Despite Himmler's interest in enacting such legislation, which he said would prevent "further intermingling of blood, and which regulates all the most pressing questions which go together with the existences of Gypsies in the living space of the German nation",{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=121}} the regime never promulgated the "Gypsy Law".{{sfn|USHMM, "Sinti and Roma"}} In December 1942, Himmler ordered that all Roma were to be sent to Nazi concentration camps.{{sfn|McGarry|2010|p=21}}

==="The Jewish problem"===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P049500, Berlin, Aufmarsch der SA in Spandau.jpg|thumb|The SA had nearly three million members at the start of 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=22}}]]
Disenchanted with the unfulfilled promise of the NSDAP to eliminate Jews from German society, SA members were eager to lash out against the Jewish minority as a way of expressing their frustrations. A [[Gestapo]] report from early 1935 stated that the rank and file of the NSDAP would set in motion a solution to the "[[Jewish problem]]&amp;nbsp;... from below that the government would then have to follow".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=340}} Assaults, vandalism, and [[boycotts]] against Jews, which the Nazi government had temporarily curbed in 1934, increased again in 1935 amidst a propaganda campaign authorised at the highest levels of government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=340}} Most non-party members ignored the boycotts and objected to the violence out of concern for their own safety.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=341}} The Israeli historian [[Otto Dov Kulka]] argues that there was a disparity between the views of the ''[[Alte Kämpfer]]'' (longtime party members) and the general public, but that even those Germans who were not politically active favoured bringing in tougher new antisemitic laws in 1935.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|pp=92–93}} The matter was raised to the forefront of the state agenda as a result of this antisemitic agitation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=342}}

The Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]] announced on 25 July that a law forbidding marriages between Jews and non-Jews would shortly be promulgated, and recommended that registrars should avoid issuing licenses for such marriages for the time being. The draft law also called for a ban on marriage for persons with hereditary illnesses.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=57–58}}

Dr. [[Hjalmar Schacht]], the Economics Minister and [[Reichsbank]] president, criticised the violent behaviour of the ''Alte Kämpfer'' and SA because of its negative impact on the economy.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=342}} The violence also had a negative impact on Germany's reputation in the international community.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=122}} For these reasons, Hitler ordered a stop to "individual actions" against German Jews on 8 August 1935, and the Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick threatened to take legal action against Party members who ignored the order.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=342}} From Hitler's perspective, it was imperative to quickly bring in new antisemitic laws to appease the radical elements in the NSDAP who persisted in attempting to remove the Jews from German society by violent means.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=122}} A conference of ministers was held on 20 August 1935 to discuss the question. Hitler argued against violent methods because of the damage being done to the economy, and insisted the matter must be settled through legislation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=343}} The focus of the new laws would be marriage laws to prevent "racial defilement", stripping Jews of their German citizenship, and laws to prevent Jews from participating freely in the economy.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=59}}

===Events at Nuremberg===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0312-505, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Grundstein Kongreßhalle.jpg|NSDAP dignitaries at the 1935 [[Nuremberg Rally]]|thumb|left]]

The seventh annual [[Nuremberg Rally|Nazi Party Rally]], held in Nuremberg from 10–16 September 1935, featured the only [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] session held outside Berlin during the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=45}} Hitler decided that the rally would be a good opportunity to introduce the long-awaited anti-Jewish laws.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=543}} In a speech on 12 September, leading Nazi physician [[Gerhard Wagner (Nazi physician)|Gerhard Wagner]] announced that the government would soon introduce a "law for the protection of German blood".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=344}} The next day, Hitler summoned the Reichstag to meet in session at Nuremberg on 15 September, the last day of the rally.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=543}} Franz Albrecht Medicus and [[Bernhard Lösener]] of the Interior Ministry were summoned to Nuremberg and directed to start preparing a draft of a law forbidding sexual relations or marriages between Jews and non-Jews. The two men arrived on 14 September.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=344–345}} That evening, Hitler ordered them to also have ready by morning a draft of the Reich citizenship law.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=59}} Hitler found the initial drafts of the Blood Law to be too lenient, so at around midnight Frick brought him four new drafts that differed mainly in the severity of the penalties they imposed. Hitler chose the most lenient version, but left vague the definition of who was a Jew.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=345–346}} Hitler stated at the rally that the laws were "an attempt at the legal settlement of a problem, which, if this proved a failure, would have to be entrusted by law to the National Socialist Party for a definitive solution".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=60}} Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] had the radio broadcast of the passing of the laws cut short, and ordered the German media to not mention them until a decision was made as to how they would be implemented.{{sfn|Mommsen|1989|p=225}}

The two Nuremberg Laws were unanimously passed by the Reichstag on 15 September 1935.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour prohibited marriages and [[extramarital intercourse]] between Jews and Germans, and forbade the employment of German females under 45 in Jewish households. The Reich Citizenship Law declared that only those of German or related blood were eligible to be Reich citizens; the remainder were classed as state subjects, without citizenship rights.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=345}} The wording in the Citizenship Law that a person must prove "by his conduct that he is willing and fit to faithfully serve the German people and Reich" meant that political opponents could also be stripped of their German citizenship.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} This law was effectively a means of stripping Jews, Roma, and other "undesirables" of their legal rights, and their citizenship.{{sfn|Wolfe|2014|p=94}}

Over the coming years, an additional 13 supplementary laws were promulgated that further marginalised the Jewish community in Germany.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=233}} For example, Jewish families were not permitted to submit claims for subsidies for large families and were forbidden to transact business with Aryans.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=84}}

===Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour===
Moved by the understanding that purity of German blood is the essential condition for the continued existence of the German people, and inspired by the inflexible determination to ensure the existence of the German nation for all time, the Reichstag has unanimously adopted the following law, which is promulgated herewith:

;Article 6
The Reich Minister of the Interior, in co-ordination with the Deputy of the Führer and the Reich Minister of Justice, will issue the legal and administrative regulations required to implement and complete this law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 7
The law takes effect on the day following promulgation, except for Article 3, which goes into force on 1 January 1936.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}

===Reich Citizenship Law===

The Reichstag has unanimously enacted the following law, which is promulgated herewith:

;Article 1
# A subject of the state is a person who enjoys the protection of the German Reich and who in consequence has specific obligations toward it.
# The status of subject of the state is acquired in accordance with the provisions of the Reich and the Reich Citizenship Law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 2
# A Reich citizen is a subject of the state who is of German or related blood, and proves by his conduct that he is willing and fit to faithfully serve the German people and Reich.
# Reich citizenship is acquired through the granting of a Reich citizenship certificate.
# The Reich citizen is the sole bearer of full political rights in accordance with the law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 3
The Reich Minister of the Interior, in co-ordination with the Deputy of the Führer, will issue the legal and administrative orders required to implement and complete this law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}

[[File:Nuremberg laws Racial Chart.jpg|left|thumb|1935 chart shows racial classifications under the Nuremberg Laws: German, ''[[Mischling]]e'', and Jew.]]

While both the Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons with three or more Jewish grandparents would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (''[[Mischling]]e'' of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as to the status of persons with two Jewish grandparents (''Mischlinge'' of the first degree).{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=49}} The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to ''Mischlinge'' of both the first and second degree.{{sfn|Mommsen|1989|p=224}} For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=347}} The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did not have the right to vote.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=50}} Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the [[Anschluss]].{{sfn|Milton|2001|p=216}} Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=50}} A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=50}}

While Frick's suggestion that a citizenship tribunal before which every German would have to prove that they were Aryan was not acted upon, proving one's racial heritage became a necessary part of daily life.{{sfn|Mommsen|1989|p=224}}{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=52}} Non-government employers were authorised to include in their statutes an [[Aryan paragraph]] excluding both ''Mischlinge'' and Jews from employment.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=547}} Proof of Aryan descent was achieved by obtaining an [[Aryan certificate]]. One form was to acquire an ''[[Ahnenpass]]'', which could be obtained by providing birth or baptismal certificates that all four grandparents were of Aryan descent.{{sfn|Ehrenreich|2007|p=68}} The ''Ahnenpass'' could also be acquired by citizens of other countries, as long as they were of "German or related blood".{{sfn|Scheil|2012}}

Under the ''Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour'' (15 September 1935), marriages were forbidden between Jews and Germans; between ''Mischlinge'' of the first degree and Germans; between Jews and ''Mischlinge'' of the second degree; and between two ''Mischlinge'' of the second degree. ''Mischlinge'' of the first degree were permitted to marry Jews, but they would henceforth be classed as Jewish themselves. All marriages undertaken between half-Jews and Germans required the approval of a Committee for the Protection of German Blood. Few such permissions were granted.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=547}} A supplementary decree issued on 26 November 1935 extended the law to "Gypsies, Negroes, and their bastards".{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=51}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99993, Jude mit Stern in Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Beginning in 1941, Jews were required by law to self-identify by wearing a [[yellow badge]] on their clothing.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=217}}]]

Persons suspected of having sexual relations with non-Aryans were charged with ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement) and tried in the regular courts. Evidence provided to the Gestapo for such cases was largely provided by ordinary citizens such as neighbours, co-workers, or other informants.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=551}} Persons accused of race defilement were publicly humiliated by being paraded through the streets with a placard around their necks detailing their crime.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=540}} Those convicted were typically sentenced to prison terms, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=551}} As the law did not permit capital punishment for racial defilement, special courts were convened to allow the death penalty for some cases.{{sfn|Majer|2003|pp=331–332}} From the end of 1935 through 1940, 1,911 people were convicted of ''Rassenschande''. Over time, the law was extended to include non-sexual forms of physical contact such as greeting someone with a kiss or an embrace.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=551}}

For the most part, Germans accepted the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, but also because to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=548}}{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=180}} Citizens were relieved that the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=172}} Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=548, 553}} Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors.{{sfn|Gellately|1991|p=105}} The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=51}} Concerned that international opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws, the Interior Ministry did not actively enforce them until after the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin that August.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=122}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=548}}

The Interior Ministry estimated there were 750,000 ''Mischlinge'' as of April 1935 (studies done after the war put the number of ''Mischlinge'' at around 200,000).{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=51}} As Jews became more and more excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=55}} Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually at prices far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=65–66}} Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=86}}

Although a stated goal of the Nazis was that all Jews should leave the country, emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=64, 66}} Anyone caught transferring their money overseas were sentenced to lengthy terms in prison as "economic saboteurs".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=66}} An exception was money sent to Palestine under the terms of the [[Haavara Agreement]], whereby Jews could transfer some of their assets and emigrate to that country. Around 52,000 Jews emigrated to Palestine under the terms of this agreement between 1933 and 1939.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=556–557}}

By the start of the Second World War in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=127}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=555}} By 1938 it was becoming almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country that would take them.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=67}} After the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–39 Arab revolt]], the British were disinclined to accept any more Jews into Palestine for fear it would further destabilise the region.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=57}} Nationalistic and [[xenophobic]] people in other countries pressured their governments not to accept waves of Jewish immigrants, especially poverty-stricken ones.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=560, 601}} The [[Madagascar Plan]], a proposed mass deportation of European Jews to Madagascar, proved to be impossible to carry out.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=162–164}} Starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|pp=159–160}} The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting [[Holocaust]] is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} Estimates of the death toll of Romanis in the [[Porajmos]] range from 150,000 to 1,500,000.{{sfn|Hancock|2012|p=381}}

An original typescript of the laws signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's [[Counterintelligence Corps]] in 1945. It ended up in the possession of General [[George S. Patton]], who kept it, in violation of orders that such finds should be turned over to the government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the [[Huntington Library]], where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the [[Skirball Cultural Center]], which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in Washington in August 2010.{{sfn|Allen|2010}}{{sfn|Bradsher|2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">The '''One Divides into Two''' controversy (一分为二) was an ideological debate about the nature of contradiction that took place in China in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marxistphilosophy.org/ChinTrans1221.htm|title=The "One Divides into Two" Controversy (一分为二), 1964-1980|first=Tom|last=Weston|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept originated in Lenin's ''[[Philosophical Notebooks]]''. The philosopher [[Yang Xianzhen]], originated the idea of "Two Unites into One", which he said was the primary law of [[dialectics]]. The Maoists interpreted the Aesopian meaning of this to be that capitalism could be united with [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. [[Ai Siqi]] wrote the original attack on Yang, and was joined by Mao himself. [[Wang Ruoshui]] also contributed to the attack.  After 1976, Yang was rehabilitated as well as the concept of two uniting into one.

This phrase is derived from the formulation given by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in his ''Philosophical Notebooks''; "The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts ... is the essence ... of dialectics."

[[Richard Baum]] has put the controversy in terms of modern [[game theory]] as a debate between [[zero sum]] and [[non-zero sum]] competition.

[[Alain Badiou]] during his Maoist phase would use the principle of One Divides into Two to criticize the philosophy of [[Gilles Deleuze]].

'''Internet identity''' ('''IID'''), also '''online identity''' or '''internet persona''', is a [[social identity]] that an Internet user establishes in online communities and websites. It can also be considered as an actively constructed presentation of oneself. Although some people choose to use their real names online, some Internet users prefer to be anonymous, identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of [[personally identifiable information]]. An online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online. Some can even be deceptive about their identity.

In some online contexts, including [[Internet forum]]s, [[online chat]]s, and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing games]] (MMORPGs), users can represent themselves visually by choosing an avatar, an icon-sized graphic image. Avatars are one way users express their online identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Adams |first=Suellen |year=2005 |conference=DiGRA: Changing Views - Worlds in Play |title=Information Behavior and the Formation and Maintenance of Peer Cultures in Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games: a Case Study of City of Heroes |publisher=Authors &amp; Digital Games research Association (DiGRA) |format=PDF |url=http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/06278.15067.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through interaction with other users, an established online identity acquires a [[reputation]], which enables other users to decide whether the identity is worthy of [[Trust (sociology)|trust]].&lt;ref name="Nabeth20060526"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabeth |first=Thierry |date=26 May 2006 |title=D2.2: Set of use cases and scenarios |journal=FIDIS Deliverables |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=74–91 |chapter=Understanding the Identity Concept in the Context of Digital Social Environments |publisher=FIDIS |format=PDF |url=http://www.fidis.net/fileadmin/fidis/deliverables/fidis-wp2-del2.2_Cases__stories_and_Scenario.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online identities are associated with users through [[authentication]], which typically requires [[Registered user|registration]] and [[Login|logging in]]. Some websites also use the user's [[IP address]] or [[tracking cookies]] to identify users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/115483/htg-explains-learn-how-websites-are-tracking-you-online/|title=The Many Ways Websites Track You Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the [[self]], and how this is influenced by emerging technologies, are a subject of research in fields such as [[education]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] is a notable example, referring to a concept of unwise and uninhibited behavior on the Internet, arising as a result of anonymity and audience gratification.&lt;ref name="Suler20040728"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suler |first=John |title=The Online Disinhibition Effect |journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior |year=2004 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=321–326 |doi=10.1089/1094931041291295 |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/1094931041291295|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online social identity==

===Identity expression and identity exposure===
{{See also|Online identity management|Impression management}}

The [[social web]], i.e. the usage of the web to support the social process, represents a space in which people have the possibility to [[online identity management|express]] and expose their identity&lt;ref name="PMID16784349"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marcus |first=Bernd |last2=Machilek |first2=Franz |last3=Schütz |first3=Astrid |title=Personality in cyberspace: Personal web sites as media for personality expressions and impressions |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2006 |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=1014–1031 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.6.1014 |pmid=16784349}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a social context.
For example, people define their identity explicitly by creating [[user profile]]s in [[social network services]] such as [[Facebook]] or [[LinkedIn]] and [[online dating service]]s.&lt;ref name="Siibak2007"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47502962_Casanova_s_of_the_Virtual_World._How_Boys_Present_Themselves_on_Dating_Websites |title=Casanovas of the Virtual World. How Boys Present Themselves on Dating Websites. |first=Andra |last=Siibak |date=September 2007 |conference=Young People at the Crossroads: 5th International Conference on Youth Research |location=Petrozavodsk, Republic of Karelia, Russian Federation |pages=83–91 |isbn=978-952-219-020-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By expressing opinions on [[blogs]] and other social media, they define more tacit [[Identity (social science)|identities]].

The disclosure of a person's identity may present certain issues&lt;ref name="Nabeth20060526"/&gt; related to [[privacy]]. Many people adopt strategies that help them control the disclosure of their personal information online.&lt;ref name="Tufekci2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tufekci |first=Zeynep |title=Can You See Me Now? Audience and Disclosure Regulation in Online Social Network Sites |journal=Bulletin of Science Technology &amp; Society |date=February 2008 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=20–36 |doi=10.1177/0270467607311484 |url=http://bst.sagepub.com/content/28/1/20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some strategies require users to invest considerable effort.

The emergence of the concept of online identity has raised many questions among academics. [[Social networking service]]s and online [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s have complicated the concept of identity. Academia has responded to these emerging trends by establishing domains of scholarly research such as [[technoself]] studies, which focuses on all aspects of human identity in technological societies.

Online activities may affect our offline personal identity, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Personal Identity Online.|last = Rodogno|first = R|date = 2012|journal = Philosophy &amp; Technology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concept of the mask===
Dorian Wiszniewski and [[Richard Coyne]] in their contribution to the book ''Building Virtual Communities'' explore online identity, with emphasis on the concept of "masking" identity.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} They point out that whenever an individual interacts in a social sphere they portray a mask of their identity. This is no different online and in fact becomes even more pronounced due to the decisions an online contributor must make concerning his or her online profile. He or she must answer specific questions about age, [[gender]], address, [[username]] and so forth. Furthermore, with the accrual of one's online activity, his or her mask is increasingly defined by his or her style of writing, vocabulary and topics.

The kind of mask one chooses reveals at least something of the subject behind the mask. One might call this the "[[metaphor]]" of the mask. The online mask does not reveal the actual identity of a person. It, however, does reveal an example of what lies behind the mask. For instance, if a person chooses to act like a [[Celebrity|rock star]] online, this metaphor reveals an interest in rock music. Even if a person chooses to hide behind a totally [[false identity]], this says something about the fear and lack of self-esteem behind the false mask.

Because of many emotional and psychological dynamics, people can be reluctant to interact online. By evoking a mask of identity a person can create a safety net. One of the great fears of online identity is having one's identity stolen or abused. This fear keeps people from sharing who they are. Some are so fearful of identity theft or abuse that they will not even reveal information already known about them in public listings. By making the mask available, people can interact with some degree of confidence without fear.

Wiszniewski and Coyne state "Education can be seen as the change process by which identity is realized, how one finds one's place. Education implicates the transformation of identity. Education, among other things, is a process of building up a sense of identity, generalized as a process of edification." Students interacting in an [[online community]] must reveal something about themselves and have others respond to this contribution. In this manner, the mask is constantly being formulated in dialogue with others and thereby students will gain a richer and deeper sense of who they are. There will be a process of edification that will help students come to understand their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiszniewski |first=Dorian |last2=Coyne |first2=Richard |title=Building Virtual Communities |edition=1st |date=November 2009 |origyear=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780511606373 |pages=191–214 |chapter=Mask and Identity: The Hermeneutics of Self-Construction in the Information Age |chapterurl=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511606373&amp;cid=CBO9780511606373A021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blended identity====

This mask perspective is likened to the concept of 'blended identity',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=Andrea J. |date=December 2009 |title=Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans |journal=Identity in the Information Society |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=7–21 |publisher=Springer |publication-date=2009 |doi=10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5 |format=pdf |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12394-009-0015-5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the offline-self informs the creation of a new online-self, which in turn informs the offline-self through further interaction with those the individual first met online.

==In different contexts==

===Blogging===
As [[blogs]] allow an individual to express his or her views in individual essays or as part of a wider discussion, it creates a public forum for expressing ideas. Bloggers often choose to use pseudonyms, whether in platforms such as [[WordPress]] or in interest-centered sites like [[Blogster]], to protect personal information and allow them more editorial freedom to express ideas that might be unpopular with their family, employers, etc. Use of a pseudonym (and a judicious approach to revealing personal information) can allow a person to protect their "real" identities, but still build a reputation online using the assumed name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dennen |first=Vanessa Paz |date=December 2009 |title=Constructing academic alter-egos: identity issues in a blog-based community |journal=Identity in the Information Society |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=23–38 |publisher=Springer |publication-date=2009 |doi=10.1007/s12394-009-0020-8 |format=pdf |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12394-009-0020-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human resources ===
Digital identity management is becoming something that individuals need to consider when applying for jobs of while working for a company. Social media has been a tool for human resources for years. A KPMG report on social media in human resources say that 76 percent of American companies used LinkedIn for recruiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kpmg.com/US/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/human-resources-and-social-media.pdf|title=Human Resources and Social Media|last=Isaacson|first=Karen|date=May 2012|website=www.kpmg.com|publisher=KPMG|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ease of search means that reputation management will become more vital especially in professional services such as lawyers, doctors and accountants.

===Social networks===
Online social networks like [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]] allow people to maintain an online identity with some overlap between online and real world context. These identities are often created to reflect a specific aspect or ideal version of themselves. Representations include pictures, communications with other 'friends' and membership in network groups. Privacy control settings on social networks are also part of social networking identity.&lt;ref name="Grohol20060404"/&gt;

Some users may use their online identity as an extension of their physical selves, and center their profiles around realistic details. These users value continuity in their identity, and would prefer being honest with the portrayal of themselves. However, there is also a group of social network users that would argue against using a real identity online. These users have experimented with online identity, and ultimately what they have found is that it is possible to create an alternate identity through the usage of such social networks. For example, a popular blogger on medium.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Kelcie/pseudonyms-and-true-names-the-sacred-power-of-identity-9ca17e0f89da|title=Pseudonyms and True Names: The Sacred Power of Identity|date=24 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes under the name of Kel Campbell – a name that was chosen by her, not given to her. She states that when she was verbally attacked online by another user, she was able to protect herself from the sting of the insult by taking it as Kel, rather than her true self. Kel became a shield of sorts, and acted as a mask that freed the real user beneath it.

Such are the benefits of forming an alternate identity in online spaces. The "I" becomes subject to the "Me", and individuals are given the power to shape themselves into whoever (or whatever) they desire to become. Stories of people learning about their "hidden extroversion" or "unknown creativity" or becoming "someone else" are still at large. Research from scientists such as Danah Boyd and Knut Lundby has even found that in some cultures, the ability to form an identity online is considered a sacred privilege. This is because having an online identity allows the user to accomplish things that otherwise are impossible to do in real life. These cultures believe that the self has become a subjective concept on the online spaces; by logging onto their profiles, users are essentially freed from the prison of a physical body and can "create a narrative of the self in virtual space that may be entirely new".

The possibilities are endless – which is a feasible explanation for the explosive popularity of social networking sites in the past decade. Users are captivated by the opportunity to express themselves in an endless number of ways. Perhaps social networks will always remain popular, as long as the incentive to join is always present.

===Online business===
As the development of social networks, there appears a new economic phenomenon: doing business via social networks. For example, there are many users of [[WeChat]] called wei-businessmen sell products on WeChat. Doing business via social networks is not that easy. The identities of users in social networks are not the same as that in real world. For the sake of security, people do not tend to trust someone in social networks, in particular when it is related with money. So for wei-businessmen, reputations are very important for wei-business. They need invest enormous efforts to gain reputations among the users of WeChat, then these wei-businessmen could probably sell something to users.

===Online learning===
{{Main article|E-learning}}

====Communication====
Online identity in classrooms forces people to reevaluate their concepts of classroom environments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} With the invention of online classes, classrooms have changed and no longer have the traditional face-to-face communications. These communications have been replaced by computer screen. Students are no longer defined by visual characteristics unless they make them known. There are pros and cons to each side. In a traditional classroom, students are able to visually connect with a teacher who was standing in the same room. During the class, if questions arise, clarification can be provided immediately. Students can create face-to-face connections with other students, and these connections can easily be extended beyond the classroom.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} For timid or socially awkward students, this ability to form and extend relationships through personal contact may hold little appeal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} For these students, the appeal may reside in online courses, where computer communications allow them a greater degree of separation and anonymity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

With the prevalence of remote Internet communications, students do not form preconceptions of their classmates based on the classmate's appearance or speech characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Rather, impressions are formed based only on the information presented by the classmate. Some students are more comfortable with this paradigm as it avoids the discomfort of public speaking. Students who do not feel comfortable stating their ideas in class can take time to sit down and think through exactly what they wish to say.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Communication via written media may lead students to take more time to think through their ideas since their words are in a more permanent setting (online) than most conversations carried on during class (Smith).

====Perception of professor====
Online learning situations also cause a shift in perception of the professor. Whereas anonymity may help some students achieve a greater level of comfort, professors must maintain an active identity with which students may interact. The students should feel that their professor is ready to help whenever they may need it. Although students and professors may not be able to meet in person, emails and correspondence between them should occur in a timely manner. Without this students tend to drop online classes since it seems that they are wandering through a course without anyone to guide them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chamberlin |first=W. Sean |date=December 2001 |title=Face-to-Face vs. Cyberspace: Finding the Middle Ground |journal=Campus Technology |url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2001/12/facetoface-vs-cyberspace-finding-the-middle-ground.aspx |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deanesmay.com/2006/01/30/online-education-is-not-a-fad/ |title=Online Education Is Not A Fad |last=Eteraz |first=Ali |date=30 January 2006 |website=Dean's World |publisher=Dean Esmay |accessdate=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Glenn Gordon |last2=Ferguson |first2=David |last3=Caris |first3=Mieke |year=2002 |title=Teaching over the Web versus in the classroom: differences in instructor experience |journal=International Journal of Instructional Media |volume=29 |issue=1 |page= |pages=61–67 |publisher= |format=PDF |accessdate=10 October 2013 |url=http://www.umsl.edu/technology/frc/pdfs/teaching_over_the_web_versus_in_the_classroom.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual world===
{{Main|Virtual world}}
In [[Virtual world]], the users create a personal avatar and communicate with others through the virtual identity. The virtual personal figure and voice may draw from the real figure or fantasy worlds. The virtual figure to some degree reflects the personal expectation, and users may play a totally different personality in virtual world than in reality.

===Internet forum===
{{Main|Internet forum}}
An [[Internet forum]], or message board, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages.
There are many types of Internet forums based on certain themes or groups. The properties of online identities also differ from different type of forums. For example, the users in a university BBS usually know some of the others in reality since the users can only be the students or professors in this university. However the freedom of expression is limited since some university BBSs are under control of the school administration and the identities are related to student IDs. On another hand, in some question-and-answer website like "ZhiHu" in China, is open to the public and users can create accounts only with e-mail address. But they can describe their specialties or personal experiences to show reliability in certain questions, and other users can also invite them to answer questions based on their profiles. The answers and profiles can be either real-name or anonymous.

==Benefits and concerns==

===Benefits===

A discussed positive aspect of [[virtual communities]] is that people can now present themselves without fear of persecution, whether it is personality traits, behaviors that they are curious about, or the announcement of a real world identity component that has never before been announced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

This freedom results in new opportunities for society as a whole, especially the ability for people to explore the roles of gender and sexuality in a manner that can be harmless, yet interesting and helpful to those undertaking the change. Online identity has given people the opportunity to feel comfortable in wide-ranging roles, some of which may be underlying aspects of the user's life that the user is unable to portray in the real world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Online identity has a beneficial effect for [[minority group]]s, including ethnic minority populations, people with disabilities, etc. Online identities may help remove prejudices created by stereotypes found in real life, and thus provide a greater sense of [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]].

A prime example of these opportunities is the establishment of many communities welcoming gay and lesbian teens who are dealing with their sexuality. These communities allow teens to share their experiences with one another and older gay and lesbian people, and may they provide a community that is both non-threatening and non-judgmental. In a review of such a community, Silberman quotes an information technology worker, Tom Reilly, as stating: "The wonderful thing about online services is that they are an intrinsically decentralized resource. Kids can challenge what adults have to say and make the news".&lt;ref name="Holeton1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holeton|first=Richard|title=Composing cyberspace: identity, community, and knowledge in the electronic age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jasQAQAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-029548-3|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; If teen organizers are successful anywhere, news of it is readily available. The Internet is arguably the most powerful tool that young people with alternative sexualities have ever had.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The online world provides users with a choice to determine which sex, sexuality preference and sexual characteristics they would like to embody. In each online encounter, a user essentially has the opportunity to interchange which identity they would like to portray.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As McRae argues in Surkan (2000), "The lack of physical presence and the infinite malleability of bodies complicates sexual interaction in a singular way: because the choice of gender is an "option" rather than a strictly defined biological characteristic, the entire concept of gender as a primary marker of identity becomes partially subverted."

Online identity can offer potential social benefits to those with physical and sensory disabilities. The flexibility of online media provides control over their disclosure of impairment, an opportunity not typically available in real world social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stendal|first1=Karen|title=How do People with Disability Use and Experience Virtual Worlds and ICT: A Literature Review|journal=Journal For Virtual Worlds Research|date=2012|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.4101/jvwr.v5i1.6173|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4101/jvwr.v5i1.6173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers highlight its value in improving inclusion. However, it is notable that the affordance of "normalization" offers the possibility of experiencing non-stigmatized identities while also offering the capacity to create harmful and dangerous outcomes, which may jeopardize participants' safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowker|first1=Natilene|last2=Tuffin|first2=Keith|title=Dicing with Deception: People with Disabilities' Strategies for Managing Safety and Identity Online|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=January 2003|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2003.tb00209.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns===
Primarily, concerns regarding virtual identity revolve around the areas of misrepresentation and the contrasting effects of on and offline existence. Sexuality and sexual behavior online provide some of the most controversial debate with many concerned about the predatory nature of some users. This is particularly in reference to concerns about [[child pornography]] and the ability of [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]] to obscure their identity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Finally, the concerns regarding the connection between on and offline lives are challenging the notions of what constitutes real experience. In reference to gender, sexuality and sexual behavior, the ability to play with these ideas has resulted in a questioning of how virtual experience may affect one's offline emotions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As McRae states, at its best, virtual sex not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body, and self that has become a comfortable truism in Western metaphysics. When projected into virtuality, mind, body and self all become consciously-manufactured constructs through which individuals interact with each other.&lt;ref name="McRae1997" /&gt;

====Reliability====

The identities that people define in the social web are not necessarily facets of their offline self. Studies have shown that people lie in online dating services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Robert |date=February 2007 |title=The Truth about Online Dating: The hype is huge, and the findings are somewhat disturbing--but the future of online dating looks good |journal=Scientific American Mind |format=PDF |url=http://drrobertepstein.com/pdf/Epstein-TheTruthAboutOnlineDating-2-07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Hancock |first=Jeffrey T. |last2=Toma |first2=Catalina |last3=Ellison |first3=Nicole |year=2007 |conference=CHI 2007 |contribution=The truth about lying in online dating profiles |title=Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |publisher=ACM |pages=449–452 |format=PDF |url=http://nguyendangbinh.org/Proceedings/CHI/2007/docs/p449.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of social network services such as Facebook, companies are even proposing to sell 'friends' as a way to increase a user's visibility, calling into question even more the reliability of a person's 'social identity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Learmonth |first=Michael |date=2 September 2009 |title=Want 5,000 More Facebook Friends? That'll Be $654.30 |journal=AdvertisingAge |location=New York |publisher=Crain Communications |url=http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=138770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gelder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Gelder|first1=Lindsy|title=Computerization and controversy|date=1995|isbn=0-12-415040-3|pages=533–546|edition=2nd|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=233415}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported a famous incident occurring on a computer conferencing system during the early 80s where a male psychiatrist posed as Julie, a female psychologist with multiple disabilities including deafness, blindness, and serious facial disfigurement. Julie endeared herself to the computer conferencing community, finding psychological and emotional support from many members. The psychiatrist's choice to present differently was sustained by drawing upon the unbearable stigma attached to Julie's multiple disabilities as justification for not meeting face-to-face. Lack of visual cues allowed the identity transformation to continue, with the psychiatrist also assuming the identity of Julie's husband, who adamantly refused to allow anyone to visit Julie when she claimed to be seriously ill. This example highlights the ease with which identity may be constructed, transformed, and sustained by the textual nature of online interaction and the visual anonymity it affords.

====Catfishing online====

[[Catfishing]] is a way for a user to create a fake online profile, sometimes with fake photos and information, in order to enter into a relationship, intimate or platonic, with another user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slade|first1=Alison F.|last2=Narro|first2=Amber J.|last3=Buchanan|first3=Burton P.|title=Reality Television: Oddities of Culture|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-8564-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catfishing became popular in mainstream culture through the MTV reality show ''[[Catfish: The TV Show|Catfish]]''.

==Identity management infrastructures==
A problem facing anyone who hopes to build a positive online reputation is that reputations are site-specific; for example, one's reputation on [[eBay]] cannot be transferred to [[Slashdot]].

Multiple proposals have been made{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} to build an [[identity management]] infrastructure into the Web [[Communications protocol|protocols]]. All of them require an effective [[public key infrastructure]] so that the identity of two separate manifestations of an online identity (say, one on [[Wikipedia]] and another on [[Twitter]]) are probably one and the same.

[[OpenID]], an open, decentralized standard for authenticating users is used for access control, allowing users to log on to different services with the same digital identity. These services must allow and implement OpenID.

===Reputation management===
{{Main article|Reputation management}}
Given the malleability of online identities, some economists have expressed surprise that flourishing trading sites (such as eBay) have developed on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} When two pseudonymous identities propose to enter into an online transaction, they are faced with the [[prisoner's dilemma]]: the deal can succeed only if the parties are willing to trust each other, but they have no rational basis for doing so. But successful Internet trading sites have developed [[reputation management]] systems, such as eBay's [[feedback]] system, which record transactions and provide the technical means by which users can rate each other's trustworthiness. However, users with malicious intent can still cause serious problems on such websites.&lt;ref name="Grohol20060404"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alistapart.com/articles/identitymatters |title=Anonymity and Online Community: Identity Matters |last=Grohol |first=John M. |date=4 April 2006 |website=A List Apart |publisher= |issn=1534-0295 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Falistapart.com%2Farticles%2Fidentitymatters&amp;date=2008-09-28 |archivedate=28 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online reputation is the perception that one generates on the Internet based on their [[digital footprint]]. Digital footprints accumulate through all of the content shared, feedback provided and information that created online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banger|first1=Marnie|title=Young ones: your online reputation is, like, forever|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/young-ones-your-online-reputation-is-like-forever-20130905-2t4md.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|agency=Fairfax Media|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that if someone has a bad online reputation, he can easily change his pseudonym, new accounts on sites such as eBay or Amazon are usually distrusted. If an individual or company wants to manage their online reputation, they will face many more difficulties. This is why a merchant on the web having a [[brick and mortar]] shop is usually more trusted.

===Relation to real-world social constraints===
Ultimately, online identity cannot be completely free from the social constraints that are imposed in the real world. As Westfall (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;160) discusses, "the idea of truly departing from social hierarchy and restriction does not occur on the Internet (as perhaps suggested by earlier research into the possibilities presented by the Internet) with identity construction still shaped by others. Westfall raises the important, yet rarely discussed, issue of the effects of literacy and communication skills of the online user." Indeed, these skills or the lack thereof have the capacity to shape one's online perception as they shape one's perception through a physical body in the "real world."

==Disembodiment and implications==

This issue of gender and sexual reassignment raises the notion of disembodiment and its associated implications. "Disembodiment" is the idea that once the user is online, the need for the body is no longer required, and the user can participate separately from it. This ultimately relates to a sense of detachment from the identity defined by the physical body. In cyberspace, many aspects of sexual identity become blurred and are only defined by the user. Questions of truth will therefore be raised, particularly in reference to online dating and [[virtual sex]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As McRae states, "Virtual sex allows for a certain freedom of expression, of physical presentation and of experimentation beyond one's own real-life limits".&lt;ref name="McRae1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=McRae |first=Shannon |editor-first=David |editor-last=Porter |title=Internet Culture |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=75 |chapter=Flesh Made Word: Sex, Text, and the Virtual Body |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its best, it not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body and self in a manner only possible through the construction of an online identity.

==Legal and security issues==

===Online identity and user's rights===
The future of online [[anonymity]] depends on how an identity management infrastructure is developed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Law enforcement officials often express their opposition to online anonymity and [[pseudonymity]], which they view as an open invitation to criminals who wish to disguise their identities.{{Original research inline|date=September 2010}} Therefore, they call for an identity management infrastructure that would irrevocably tie online identity to a person's [[natural person|legal identity]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}]; in most such proposals, the system would be developed in tandem with a secure national [[identity document]]. [[Eric Schmidt]], CEO of [[Google]], has stated that the [[Google+]] social network is intended to be exactly such an identity system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google+ Isn't Just A Social Network, It's An 'Identity Service' |first=Matt |last=Rosoff |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Google-Isn-t-Just-A-Social-Network-It-s-An-2329518.php |agency= |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Corp. |date=28 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy resulting from Google+'s policy of requiring users to sign in using legal names has been dubbed the "[[nymwars]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2011/08/12/google-nymwars-rage-on-while-pseudonymous-celebrity-users-mostly-immune.html |title=Google+ nymwars rage on, pseudonymous celebrity users are immune |last=Jardin |first=Xeni |date=12 August 2011 |publisher=Boing Boing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online civil rights advocates, in contrast, argue that there is no need for a privacy-invasive system because technological solutions, such as reputation management systems, are already sufficient and are expected to grow in their sophistication and utility.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Online predators===
{{Main article|Online predator}}
An online predator is an Internet user who exploits other users' vulnerability, often for sexual or financial purposes. It is relatively easy to create an online identity which is attractive to people that would not normally become involved with the predator, but fortunately there are a few means by which you can make sure that a person whom you haven't met is actually who they say they are. Many people will trust things such as the style in which someone writes, or the photographs someone has on their web page as a way to identify that person, but these can easily be forged. Long-term Internet relationships may sometimes be difficult to sufficiently understand knowing what someone's identity is actually like.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The most vulnerable age group to online predators is often considered to be young teenagers or older children.{{Original research inline|date=September 2010}} "Over time - perhaps weeks or even months - the stranger, having obtained as much personal information as possible, grooms the child, gaining his or her trust through compliments, positive statements, and other forms of flattery to build an emotional bond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pp_sp.html |title=Sexual Predators: Know the Enemy |year=2003 |website=NetSafeKids |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |quote=Over time—perhaps weeks or even months—the stranger, having obtained as much personal information as possible, grooms the child, gaining his or her trust through compliments, positive statements, and other forms of flattery to build an emotional bond. |accessdate=28 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims often do not suspect anything until it is too late, as the other party usually misleads them to believe that they are of similar age.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The show [[Dateline NBC|Dateline]] on NBC has, overall, conducted three investigations on online predators. They had adults, posing online as teenage juveniles, engage in sexually explicit conversations with other adults (the predators) and arrange to meet them in person. But instead of meeting a teenager, the unsuspecting adult was confronted by [[Chris Hansen]], an NBC News correspondent, arrested, and shown on nationwide television. ''Dateline'' held investigations in five different locations apprehending a total of 129 men in all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=To Catch a Predator III |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11152602/ |series=To Catch a Predator |last=Hansen |first=Chris |network=NBC |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal laws have been passed in the U.S. to assist the government when trying to catch online predators. Some of these include wiretapping, so online offenders can be caught in advance, before a child becomes a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pp_li_il.html |title=Internet Laws |year=2003 |website=NetSafeKids |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In California, where one ''Dateline'' investigation took place, it is a misdemeanor for someone to have sexually-tinged conversations with a child online. The men who came to the house were charged with a felony because their intent was obvious.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==The market==
An online identity that has acquired an excellent reputation is valuable for two reasons: first, one or more persons invested a great deal of time and effort to build the identity's reputation; and second, other users look to the identity's reputation as they try to decide whether it is sufficiently trustworthy. It is therefore unsurprising that online identities have been put up for sale at online auction sites. However, conflicts arise over the ownership of online identities. Recently, a user of a massively multiplayer online game called [[EverQuest]], which is owned by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment, Inc.]], attempted to sell his EverQuest identity on eBay. Sony objected, asserting that the character is Sony's [[intellectual property]], and demanded the removal of the auction; under the terms of the U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), eBay could have become a party to a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit if it failed to comply. Left unresolved is a fundamental question: Who owns an online identity created at a commercial Web site? Does an online identity belong to the person who created it, or to the company that owns the software used to create the identity?{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''Organizational behavior''' ('''OB''') or '''organisational behaviour''' is "the study of [[human behavior]] in organizational settings, the interface between human behavior and the organization, and the organization itself".&lt;ref name = "Moorhead"&gt;Moorhead, G., &amp; Griffin, R. W. (1995). ''Organizational behavior: Managing people and organizations'' (5th edition). Boston. Houghton Mifflin, (p.4)&lt;/ref&gt; OB research can be categorized{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} in at least three ways, including the study of:&lt;ref&gt; Management which is the process of stated Objectives, Planning, Organizing, Directing, Controlling, and Staffing to achieve stated (formalized) objectives.

==Overview==
[[Chester Barnard]] recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their organizational role than when acting separately from the organization.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938 /&gt; Organizational behavior researchers study the behavior of individuals primarily in their organizational roles. One of the main goals of organizational behavior is "to revitalize organizational theory and develop a better conceptualization of organizational life".&lt;ref&gt;Simms, L.M., Price, S.A., &amp; Ervin, N.E. (1994). ''The professional practice of nursing administration''. Albany, NY: Delmar Publishers. (p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to industrial and organizational psychology==

Miner (2006) mentioned that "there is a certain arbitrariness" in identifying a "point at which organizational behavior became established as a distinct discipline" (p.&amp;nbsp;56), suggesting that it could have emerged in the 1940s or 1950s.&lt;ref name = "Miner"&gt;Miner, J.B. (2006). ''Organizational behavior, Vol. 3: Historical origins, theoretical foundations, and the future''. Armonk, NY and London: M.E. Sharpe.&lt;/ref&gt; He also underlined the fact that the industrial psychology division of the American Psychological Association did not add "organizational" to its name until 1970, "long after organizational behavior had clearly come into existence" (p.&amp;nbsp;56), noting that a similar situation arose in sociology. Although there are similarities and differences between the two disciplines, there is still confusion around differentiating organizational behavior and organizational psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Jex, S. &amp; Britt, T. (2008). ''Organizational psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach. 2nd ed''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As a multi-disciplinary , organizational behavior has been influenced by developments in a number of related disciplines including: [[Sociology]], [[industrial/organizational psychology]], and [[economics]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] is a period from the 1760s where new technologies resulted in the adoption of new manufacturing techniques and increased mechanization. In his famous [[iron cage]] metaphor, [[Max Weber]] raised concerns over the reduction in religious and vocational work experiences. Weber claimed that the Industrial Revolution's focus on efficiency constrained the worker to a kind of "prison" and "stripped a worker of their individuality".&lt;ref&gt;Weber, M. (1993). ''The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism'' (T. Parsons, Trans.). London, England: Routledge. (Original work published 1904–1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The significant social and cultural changes caused by the Industrial Revolution also gave rise to new forms of organization. Weber analyzed one of these organizations and came to the conclusion that bureaucracy was "an organization that rested on [[rational-legal]] principles and maximized technical efficiency."&lt;ref name="Weber1947"&gt;[[Weber, Max]]. The Theory of Social and Economic Organization. Translated by A.M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons. London: Collier Macmillan Publishers, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of OB practitioners documented their ideas about management and organisation. The best known theories today originate from [[Henri Fayol]], [[Chester Barnard]], and [[Mary Parker Follet]]. All three of them drew from their experience to develop a model of effective organizational management, and each of their theories independently shared a focus on human behavior and motivation.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938&gt;{{cite book |title= The Functions of the Executive |last= Barnard |first= Chester I. |authorlink= Chester Barnard |year= 1938 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA |oclc= 555075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fayol1917 &gt;{{citation | last=Fayol | first=Henri | year=1917 | title=Administration industrielle et générale; prévoyance, organisation, commandement, coordination, controle | publisher =Paris, H.

Taylor advocated for maximizing task efficiency through the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"&gt;{{Citation | last = Taylor | first = Frederick Winslow | authorlink = Frederick Winslow Taylor | year = 1911 | title = The Principles of Scientific Management | publisher = Harper &amp; Brothers | location = New York, NY, USA and London, UK | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HoJMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;f=false | oclc = 233134 | doi =   | ref = harv | postscript =. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6435 Also available from Project Gutenberg].'' | lccn = 11010339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method was further refined by [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian]] and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]], who utilized [[time and motion study]] to further improve worker efficiency.&lt;ref name="price1989"&gt;Price, B 1989, ‘Frank and Lillian Gilbreth and the Manufacture and Marketing of Motion Study, 1908-1924’, Business and Economic History, vol. 18, no. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the idea of [[Fordism]] emerged. Named after automobile mogul [[Henry Ford]], the method relied on the standardization of production through the use of assembly lines. This allowed unskilled workers to produce complex products efficiently. Sorenson later clarified that Fordism developed independently of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, C. E. (1956). ''My forty years with Ford''. New York, NY: Collier Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Fordism can be explained as the application of bureaucratic and scientific management principles to whole manufacturing process. The success of the scientific method and Fordism resulted in the widespread adoption of these methods.

In the 1920s, the [[Hawthorne Works]] [[Western Electric]] factory commissioned the first of what was to become known as the [[Hawthorne Studies]]. These studies initially adhered to the traditional scientific method, but also investigated whether workers would be more productive with higher or lower lighting levels. The results showed that regardless of lighting levels, when workers were being studied, productivity increased, but when the studies ended, worker productivity would return to normal. In following experiments, [[Elton Mayo]] concluded that [[job performance]] and the so-called [[Hawthorne Effect]] was strongly correlated to social relationships and job content.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"&gt;Cullen, David O'Donald. ''A new way of statecraft: The career of Elton Mayo and the development of the social sciences in America, 1920–1940.'' ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; 1992; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Full Text.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Hawthorne Studies [[motivation]] became a focal point in the OB community. A range of theories emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and include theories from notable OB researchers such as: [[Frederick Herzberg]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[David McClelland]], [[Victor Vroom]], and [[Douglas McGregor]]. These theories underline employee motivation, [[work performance]], and [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name = "Miner"/&gt;

[[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]]'s ''[[Administrative Behavior]]'' introduced a number of important OB concepts, most notably decision-making. Simon, along with [[Chester Barnard]], argued that people make decisions differently inside an organization when compared to their decisions outside of an organization. While classical economic theories assume that people are rational decision-makers, Simon argued a contrary point. He argued that cognition is limited because of [[bounded rationality]] For example, decision-makers often employ [[satisficing]], the process of utilizing the first marginally acceptable solution rather than the most optimal solution.&lt;ref name = "Simon1997"&gt;[[Simon, Herbert A.]] (1997) ''Administrative Behavior: A Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organizations, 4th ed., The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his work on organizational decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Studies of decision-making lead to prize in economics|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1978/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=11 May 2014|date=16 October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, the field started to become more [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[resource dependence|resource dependent]]. This gave rise to [[contingency theory]], [[institutional theory]], and [[organizational ecology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Starting in the 1980s, cultural explanations of organizations and organizational change became areas of study, in concert with fields such as [[anthropology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]].

==Current state of the field==
Research in and the teaching of OB primarily takes place in university [[management]] departments in colleges of business. Sometimes OB topics are taught in [[industrial and organizational psychology]] graduate programs.

{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
There have been additional developments in OB research and practice. [[Anthropology]] has become increasingly influential, and led to the idea that one can understand firms as communities, by introducing concepts such as [[organizational culture]], organizational rituals, and symbolic acts.&lt;ref name="Moorhead"/&gt; [[Leadership studies]] have also become part of OB.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} OB researchers have shown increased interest in ethics and its importance in an organization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some OB researchers have become interested in the aesthetic sphere of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = S. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Finding form: Looking at the field of organizational aesthetics drawing on theories and methods from the humanities, including theater, literature, music, and art. | url = | journal = Journal of Management Studies | volume = 42 | issue = 6| pages = 1211–1231 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6486.2005.00539.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods used==
A variety of methods are used in organizational behavior, many of which are found in other social sciences.

===Quantitative methods===
{{Main article|Quantitative research}}
Statistical methods used in OB research commonly include [[correlation]], [[analysis of variance]], [[meta-analysis]], [[multilevel model]]ing, [[multiple regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[time series analysis]]&lt;ref name = "Brewerton"&gt;Brewerton, P.M., &amp; Millward, L.J.

===Computer simulation===
{{Main article|Computer simulation and organization studies}}

Computer simulation is a prominent method in organizational behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Lin, Carroll, &amp; Carley, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many uses for [[computer simulation]], most OB researchers have used computer simulation to understand how organizations or firms operate. More recently, however, researchers have also started to apply computer simulation to understand individual behavior at a micro-level, focusing on individual and interpersonal [[cognition]] and [[behavior]]&lt;ref name="Hughes et al (2012) JOOP"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = H.

===Qualitative methods===
{{Main article|Qualitative research}}
Qualitative research&lt;ref name = "Brewerton"/&gt; consists of a number of methods of inquiry that generally do not involve the quantification of variables. Qualitative methods can range from the [[content analysis]] of interviews or written material to written narratives of observations. Common methods include [[ethnography]], [[case study|case studies]], historical methods, and interviews.

==Topics==

=== Consulting ===
Consultants use principles developed in OB research to assess clients' organizational problems and provide high quality services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ob.blogsite.org/index.php/2018/02/06/how-to-work-with-a-demanding-client/|title=How to work with a demanding client – Organizational Behavior Guide for Consultants|date=2018-02-06|work=Organizational Behavior Guide for Consultants|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterproductive work behavior===
{{Main article|Counterproductive work behavior}}
Counterproductive work behavior is employee behavior that harms or intends to harm an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, P. E., &amp; Fox, S. (2005). The Stressor-Emotion Model of Counterproductive Work Behavior. In S. Fox, P. E. Spector (Eds.), ''Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets'' (pp. 151-174). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10893-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision-making===
{{Main article|Decision-making}}

Many OB researchers embrace the [[rational planning model]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Decision-making research often focuses on how decisions are ordinarily made (normative decision-making), how thinkers arrive at a particular judgement (descriptive decision-making), and how to improve this decision-making (prescriptive decision-making).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Employee mistreatment===

There are several types of mistreatment that employees endure in organizations including: Abusive supervision, bullying, incivility, and sexual harassment.

====Abusive supervision====
{{Main article|Abusive supervision}}

Abusive supervision is the extent to which a [[supervisor]] engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B. J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 | doi = 10.2307/1556375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bullying====
{{Main article|Workplace bullying}}
Although definitions of workplace bullying vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Keashly, L. (2005). Bullying at Work: A Perspective From Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (Eds.), Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets. (pp. 271-296). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a behavior to be termed bullying, the individual or individuals doing the harm have to possesses (either singly or jointly) more power than the victim.

====Incivility====
{{Main article|Workplace incivility}}

Workplace incivility consists of low-intensity discourteous and [[rude]] behavior and is characterized by an ambiguous intent to harm, and the violation of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] governing appropriate workplace behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L.

====Sexual harassment====
{{Main article|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, often creating an offensive workplace that interferes with job performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rospenda, K. M., &amp; Richman, J. A. (2005). Harassment and discrimination. In J. Barling, E. K. Kelloway &amp; M. R. Frone (Eds.), Handbook of work stress (pp. 149-188). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams===
{{Main article|Team}}

===Job-related attitudes and emotions===
Organizational behavior deals with employee attitudes and feelings, including [[job satisfaction]], [[organizational commitment]], and [[emotional labor]]. Job satisfaction reflects the feelings an employee has about his or her job or facets of the job, such as pay or supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, W. K. &amp; Gillespie, J. Z. (2007). Job satisfaction. In Rogelberg, S. G. (Ed.). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology Vol. 1 (pp. 406-413).

In Rogelberg, S. G. (Ed.). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology Vol. 2 (pp. 548-551). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional labor concerns the requirement that an employee display certain emotions, such smiling at customers, even when the employee does not feel the emotion he or she is required to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ashkanasy | first1 = N.

===Leadership===
{{Main article|Leadership}}
There have been a number of theories that concern leadership. Early theories focused on characteristics of leaders, while later theories focused on leader behavior, and conditions under which leaders can be effective. Among these approaches are [[contingency theory]], the [[consideration and initiating structure]] model, [[leader-member exchange theory|leader-member exchange or LMX theory]], [[path-goal theory]], and [[transformational leadership theory]].

Contingency theory indicates that good leadership depends on characteristics of the leader and the situation.&lt;ref name="Fielder1"&gt;Fiedler, F. E. (1978). The contingency model and the dynamics of the leadership process. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (pp. 59-112). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ohio State Leadership Studies identified dimensions of leadership known as consideration (showing concern and respect for subordinates) and initiating structure (assigning tasks and setting performance goals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleishman | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Harris | first2 = E.

R. | year = 1974 | title = Path-goal theory of leadership | url = | journal = Contemporary business | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 81–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformational leadership theory concerns the behaviors leaders engage in that inspire high levels of motivation and performance in followers. The idea of [[charismatic leadership]] is part of transformational leadership theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bass | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B.

===Managerial roles===

{{Main article|Mintzberg's managerial roles}}
In the late 1960s [[Henry Mintzberg]], a graduate student at MIT, carefully studied the activities of five executives. On the basis of his observations, Mintzberg arrived at three categories that subsume managerial roles: interpersonal roles, decisional roles, and informational roles.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, S. P. (2009). Organizational behaviour. Cape Town, Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
Baron and Greenberg (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Robert A., and Greenberg, Jerald. ''Behavior in organizations'' &amp;ndash; 9th edition. Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey: 2008. p.248&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that motivation involves "the set of processes that arouse, direct, and maintain human behavior toward attaining some goal." There are several different theories of motivation relevant to OB, including [[equity theory]],&lt;ref name="Adams1965"&gt;Adams, J. S. (1965). Inequity in social exchange. In L.

M. (1960). The human side of enterprise. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National culture===

National culture is thought to affect the behavior of individuals in organizations. This idea is exemplified by [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory]]. Hofstede surveyed a large number of cultures and identified six dimensions of national cultures that influence the behavior of individuals in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, Geert, Gert Jan Hofstede and Michael Minkov.Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions include power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs. femininity, long-term orientation vs. short term orientation, and indulgence vs. restraint.

===Organizational citizenship behavior===
{{Main article|Organizational citizenship behavior}}

Organizational citizenship behavior is behavior that goes beyond assigned tasks and contributes to the well-being of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Organ, D. W. (1988). Organizational citizenship behavior: The good soldier syndrome. Lexington, MA, England: Lexington Books/D C Heath and Com.f&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational culture===
{{Main article|Organizational culture}}

Organizational culture reflects the values and behaviors that are commonly observed in an organization. Investigators who pursue this line of research assume that organizations can be characterized by cultural dimensions such as beliefs, values, rituals, symbols, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Shein, Edgar (1992). Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have developed models for understanding an organization's culture or developed typologies of organizational culture. [[Edgar Schein]] developed a model for understanding organizational culture. He identified three levels of organizational culture: (a) artifacts and behaviors, (b) espoused values, and (c) shared basic assumptions. Specific cultures have been related to organizational performance&lt;ref&gt;Kotter, John and Heskett, James L. (1992) Corporate Culture and Performance, Free Press; {{ISBN|0-02-918467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Denison, Daniel R. (1990) Corporate culture and organizational effectiveness, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
{{Main article|Personality}}
Personality concerns consistent patterns of behavior, [[cognition]], and [[emotion]] in individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, W., Shoda, Y., &amp; Smith, R. E. (2004). ''Introduction to personality: Toward an integration''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; The study of personality in organizations has generally focused on the relation of specific traits to employee performance. There has been a particular focus on the [[Big Five personality traits]], which refers to five overarching personality traits.

===Occupational stress===
{{Main article|Occupational stress}}

There are number of ways to characterize occupational stress. One way of characterizing it is to term it an imbalance between job demands (aspects of the job that require mental or physical effort) and resources that help manage the demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demerouti | first1 = E. | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A.

===Work-family===
{{Main article|Work-family conflict}}
[[Chester Barnard]] recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their work role than when acting in roles outside their work role.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938 /&gt; Work-family conflict occurs when the demands of family and work roles are incompatible, and the demands of at least one role interfere with the discharge of the demands of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenhaus | first1 = J.

==Organization theory==
{{Main article|Organizational theory}}
Organization theory is concerned with explaining the workings of an organization as a whole or of many organizations. The focus of organizational theory is to understand the structure and processes of organizations and how organizations interact with each other and the larger society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Bureaucracy===

{{Main article|Bureaucracy}}

[[Max Weber]] argued that bureaucracy involved the application of [[rational-legal]] authority to the organization of work, making bureaucracy the most technically efficient form of organization.&lt;ref name="Weber1947"/&gt; Weber enumerated a number of principles of bureaucratic organization including: a formal organizational hierarchy, management by rules, organization by functional specialty, selecting people based on their skills and technical qualifications, an "up-focused" (to organization's board or shareholders) or "in-focused" (to the organization itself) mission, and a purposefully impersonal environment (e.g., applying the same rules and structures to all members of the organization). These rules reflect Weberian "ideal types," and how they are enacted in organizations varies according to local conditions. [[Charles Perrow]] extended Weber's work, arguing that all organizations can be understood in terms of bureaucracy and that organizational failures are more often a result of insufficient application of bureaucratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, C. (1986). ''Complex organizations: A critical essay'' (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theories of organization===

At least three theories are relevant here, [[theory of the firm]], [[transaction cost economics]], and [[agency theory]].

===Theories pertaining to organizational structures===

Theories pertaining to organizational structures and dynamics include [[complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[French and Raven's five bases of power]],&lt;ref&gt;French, J. R. P., Jr., &amp; Raven, B. (1959). The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright (Ed.), Studies in social power (pp. 150-167).

The systems framework is also fundamental to organizational theory. [[Organization]]s are complex, goal-oriented entities.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1978). ''The social psychology of organizations'' (2 ed.). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Bogdanov]], an early thinker in the field, developed his [[tectology]], a theory widely considered a precursor of [[Bertalanffy]]'s [[general systems theory]]. One of the aims of general systems theory was to model human organizations. [[Kurt Lewin]], a social psychologist, was influential in developing a systems perspective with regard to organizations. He coined the term "systems of ideology," partly based on his frustration with behaviorist psychology, which he believed to be an obstacle to sustainable work in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ash | first1 = M.G. | year = 1992 | title = Cultural contexts and scientific change in psychology: Kurt Lewin in Iowa | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 198–207 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.47.2.198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niklas Luhmann]], a sociologist, developed a sociological systems theory.

===Organizational ecology===

{{Main article|Organizational ecology}}
Organizational ecology models apply concepts from [[evolutionary theory]] to the study of populations of organisations, focusing on birth (founding), growth and change, and death (firm mortality). In this view, organizations are 'selected' based on their fit with their operating environment.

===Scientific management===
{{Main article|Scientific management}}

Scientific management refers to an approach to management based on principles of [[engineering]]. It focuses on incentives and other practices empirically shown to improve productivity.

{{confusing|date=June 2008}}
'''Participatory modeling''' is a purposeful learning process for action that engages the implicit and explicit knowledge of stakeholders to create formalized and shared representation(s) of reality. In this process, the participants co-formulate the problem and use modeling practices to aid in the description, solution, and decision-making actions of the group. Participatory modeling is often used in environmental and resource management contexts. It can be described as engaging non-scientists in the scientific process. The participants structure the problem, describe the system, create a [[computer model]] of the system, use the model to test policy interventions, and propose one or more solutions. Participatory modeling is often used in natural resources management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Natalie A.|last2=Perez|first2=Pascal|last3=Measham|first3=Thomas G.|last4=Kelly|first4=Gail J.|last5=d'Aquino|first5=Patrick|last6=Daniell|first6=Katherine A.|last7=Dray|first7=Anne|last8=Ferrand|first8=Nils|title=Evaluating Participatory Modeling: Developing a Framework for Cross-Case Analysis|journal=Environmental Management|date=22 October 2009|volume=44|issue=6|pages=1180–1195|doi=10.1007/s00267-009-9391-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as forests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=Guillermo A.|last2=Prabhu|first2=Ravi|title=Participatory modeling and analysis for sustainable forest management: Overview of soft system dynamics models and applications|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|date=November 2006|volume=9|issue=2|pages=179–196|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2005.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robles-Morua|first1=Agustin|last2=Halvorsen|first2=Kathleen E.|last3=Mayer|first3=Alex S.|last4=Vivoni|first4=Enrique R.|title=Exploring the application of participatory modeling approaches in the Sonora River Basin, Mexico|journal=Environmental Modelling &amp; Software|date=February 2014|volume=52|pages=273–282|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Eeten|first1=Michel J.

There are numerous benefits from this type of modeling, including a high degree of ownership and motivation towards change for the people involved in the modeling process. There are two approaches which provide highly different goals for the modeling; continuous modeling and conference modeling.

==Continuous modeling==
The focus here is on the [[end-user]] being the active modeler. It can be incorporated into an adaptable, context-sensitive, "intelligent" system, which is suited to the individual.  This combination is often referred to as "model generated workplace" or "model generated user environment".  The basic concept is that the end-user potentially has the greatest [[domain knowledge]] and thus the organization as a whole benefits by obtaining and [[externalization|externalize]] this knowledge.

==Conference modeling==
Conference modeling is an approach where the goal often is of a more social kind, such as motivation, and [[change management]]. The idea is to involve a group of diversified people from the domain in question. Then the modeling process is developed in group participation during a fixed period of time.

'''Positive liberty''' is the possession of the capacity to act upon one's free will, as opposed to [[negative liberty]], which is freedom from external restraint on one's actions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Berlin, Isaiah. ''Four Essays on Liberty''. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept of positive liberty may also include freedom from internal constraints.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, C. ''What's Wrong with Negative Liberty'', 1985. ''Law and Morality''. 3rd ed. Ed. David Dyzenhaus, Sophia Reibetanz Moreau and Arthur Ripstein. Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2008. 359–368. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of [[structure and agency]] are central to the concept of positive liberty because in order to be free, a person should be free from inhibitions of the social structure in carrying out their [[free will]].  Structurally, [[classism]], [[sexism]], [[ageism]], [[ableism]] and [[racism]] can inhibit a person's freedom. As positive liberty is primarily concerned with the possession of [[Agency (sociology)|sociological agency]], it is enhanced by the ability of citizens to participate in government and have their voices, interests, and concerns recognized and acted upon.

Although [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s essay "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]" (1958) is typically acknowledged as the first to explicitly draw the distinction between positive and negative liberty, [[Frankfurt School]] [[psychoanalyst]] and [[Marxist]] [[humanistic]] [[philosopher]] [[Erich Fromm]] drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' (1941), predating Berlin's essay by more than a decade.

== Overview ==
The word ''[[liberty]]'' can refer to many things, but Isaiah Berlin recognized two main types of liberty. Berlin described a statement such as "I am slave to no man" as one of negative liberty, that is, freedom from another individual's direct interference. He contrasted this with a Positive Freedom statement such as "I am my own master", which lays claim to a freedom to choose one's own pursuits in life.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] sees Negative Freedom as an "opportunity-concept": one possesses Negative Freedom if one is not enslaved by external forces, and has equal access to a society's resources (regardless of how one decides to spend their time). Positive Freedom, says Taylor, is an "exercise-concept": possessing it might mean that one is not ''internally'' constrained; one must be able to act according to their highest self – according to reason.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Suppose a rich and powerful actor is also a drug addict. This actor may possess a great deal of negative liberty, but very little Positive Liberty according to Taylor. By Taylor's definitions, Positive Freedom entails being in a mature state of decision making, free of internal or external restraints (e.g. weakness, fear, ignorance, etc.).&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

== History ==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s theory of freedom, according to which individual freedom is achieved through participation in the process whereby one's community exercises collective control over its own affairs in accordance with the "[[general will]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some interpret ''[[The Social Contract]]'' to suggest that Rousseau believed that liberty was the power of individual citizens to act in the government to bring about changes; this is essentially the power for [[self-governance]] and [[democracy]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Rousseau himself said, "the mere impulse to appetite is slavery, while obedience to law ''we prescribe ourselves'' is liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau as quoted by Replogle, Ron. ''Recovering the Social Contract''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (1989), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; For Rousseau, the passage from the state of nature to the civil state substitutes justice for instinct gives his actions the morality they had formerly lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rosen, Jonathan Wolff, Catriona McKinnon (eds.), ''Political Thought'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. F. W. Hegel]] wrote in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'' (in the part in which he introduced the concept of the [[sphere of abstract right]]) that "duty is not a restriction on freedom, but only on freedom in the abstract" and that "duty is the attainment of our essence, the winning of positive freedom.&lt;ref&gt;George Klosko, ''History of Political Theory: An Introduction: Volume II: Modern'' (2nd ed.), Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 465: "we should note that Hegel's realization of the distance between his own and the traditional liberal conception of freedom, which he calls "abstract freedom," is clear in his embrace of [[positive freedom]] [in [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prethica.htm#PR149 ''PR'' §149A]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
In a description of positive liberty from the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;Put in the simplest terms, one might say that a democratic society is a free society because it is a self-determined society, and that a member of that society is free to the extent that he or she participates in its democratic process. But there are also individualist applications of the concept of positive freedom. For example, it is sometimes said that a government should aim actively to create the conditions necessary for individuals to be self-sufficient or to achieve self-realization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=liberty-positive-negative |title=Positive and Negative Liberty |last=Carter |first=Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "Recovering the Social Contract", Ron Replogle made a metaphor that is helpful in understanding positive liberty. "Surely, it is no assault on my dignity as a person if you take my car keys, against my will, when I have had too much to drink. There is nothing paradoxical about making an agreement beforehand providing for paternalistic supervision in circumstances when our competence is open to doubt."&lt;ref&gt;Replogle, Ron. ''Recovering the Social Contract''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (1989). p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, positive liberty is the adherence to a set of rules agreed upon by all parties involved. Should the rules be altered, all parties involved must agree upon the changes. Therefore, positive liberty is a [[contractarian]] philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

However, [[Isaiah Berlin]] opposed any suggestion that paternalism and positive liberty could be equivalent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=170287 |title=Open Learning – OpenLearn  |publisher=Openlearn.open.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that positive liberty could only apply when the withdrawal of liberty from an individual was in pursuit of a choice that individual himself/herself made, not a general principle of society or any other person's opinion. In the case where a person removes a driver's car keys against their will because they have had too much to drink, this constitutes positive freedom only if the driver has made, of their own free will, an earlier decision not to drive drunk.  Thus, by removing the keys, the other person facilitates this decision and ensures that it will be upheld in the face of paradoxical behaviour (i.e., drinking) by the driver.  For the remover to remove the keys in the absence of such an expressed intent by the driver, because the ''remover'' feels that the driver ''ought not to'' drive drunk, is paternalism, and not positive freedom by Berlin's definition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity's evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms. This aspect of freedom, he argues, "is here used not in its positive sense of 'freedom to' but in its negative sense of 'freedom from', namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions."&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Fear of Freedom'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd., 1966), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; For Fromm, freedom from animal instinct implicitly implies that survival now hinges on the necessity of charting one's own course.  He relates this distinction to the biblical story of man's expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]:
{{quote|Acting against God's orders means freeing himself from coercion, emerging from the unconscious existence of prehuman life to the level of man.  Acting against the command of authority, committing a sin, is in its positive human aspect the first act of freedom. [...] he is ''free'' from the bondage of paradise, but he is not free ''to'' govern himself, to realize his individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Fear of Freedom'', pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Positive freedom, Fromm maintains, comes through the actualization of individuality in balance with the separation from the whole: a "solidarity with all men", united not by instinctual or predetermined ties, but on the basis of a freedom founded on reason.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Fear of Freedom'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9140">'''Possession is nine-tenths of the law''' is an [[idiom|expression]] meaning that ownership is easier to maintain if one has possession of something, or difficult to enforce if one does not. The expression is also stated as "possession is nine points of the law", which is credited as derived from the Scottish expression "possession is eleven points in the law, and they say there are but twelve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Albert M. Martin |year=1882 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDnnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hLm5QcF-yH&amp;sig=kOK8OdT0Uh5PxMxpCXXWqynOHy0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=He3-T9TIK4fO2AW4hJW0BA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Answers |journal=The Chautauquan |volume=3 |issue=October 1882 |pages= |publisher=Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the principle is an oversimplification, it can be restated as: "In a property dispute (whether real or personal), in the absence of clear and compelling testimony or documentation to the contrary, the person in actual, custodial possession of the property is presumed to be the rightful owner. The rightful owner shall have their possession returned to them; if taken or used. The shirt or blouse you are currently wearing is presumed to be yours, unless someone can prove that it is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.parlidebate.org/pdf/vol6no3.pdf|title=Government's defense of the Status Quo: Advocating a shift in applying presumption theory in intercollegiate parliamentary debate|author=S Rutledge|publisher=Parliamentary Debate|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The adage is not literally true, that by law the person in possession is presumed to have a nine times stronger claim than anyone else, but that "it places in a strong light the legal truth that every claimant must succeed by the strength of his own title, and not by the weakness of his antagonist's."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=3|publisher=Pace Y.B.

Under Roman law, it was an [[wikt:interdictum|interdictum]] ordering the parties to maintain possession of property until it was determined who owned the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/mcglr38&amp;section=52|volume=38|publisher=McGeorge L.

==In anarcho-capitalist theory==
[[Walter Block]] has stated, "Suppose that 100 slaves worked on the plantation, but only one heir of any of them, B, can now be found. Does B get the entire value of the landed estate (apart from the house), or only one percent of it. The answer is the latter. For possession is 9/10ths of the law. He who is the present land holder (W in our case) is always deemed to be the proper owner, unless evidence to the contrary can be adduced. But the claim of B, stemming from the work of his grandfather, B, can at most encompass what he, B, that is, contributed to the enhancement of the value of the property. The other ninety-nine percent of the value of this land will remain with W, until and unless other grandchildren of slaves come forth with proof of parentage."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Radical libertarianism: applying libertarian principles to dealing with the unjust government|author=Block, Walter|url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/28/rp_28_7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Rothbard]] noted that [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] "conclude that even though the property was originally stolen, that if  the victim or his heirs cannot be found, and if the current possessor was not the actual criminal who stole the property, then title to that property belongs properly, justly, and ethically to its current possessor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Liberty|url=http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/nine.asp|chapter=Property and Criminality|author=Rothbard, Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Multiple issues|{{globalize|date=November 2018}}{{one source|date=November 2018}}}}

A '''property qualification''' is a clause or rule by which those without property (land), or those without property of a set appraised value, or those without income of a set value, are not enfranchised to vote in elections, to stand for election, to hold office or from other activities. 

== History ==
The [[Eighteenth Century]] [[Militia (Great Britain)|Militia of England and Wales]] did not sell [[Officer (armed forces)|commissions]] in the way that the [[British Army]] did at the time, but instead restricted them property owners and those with income of a set minimum value. 

In jurisdictions where the political and economic spheres are dominated by one ethnic, religious or racial group, property qualifications have been used as a way to exclude members of other ethnic, religious or racial groups that may disproportionately lack the required resources. This was the case in [[Northern Ireland]], where a property requirement was used to exclude indigenous Irish Catholics from voting in elections for seats in the [[Stormont Parliament]] until 1969.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Ulster Unionist Party: Protest, Pragmatism and Pessimism'', by Graham Walker. Page 162. Manchester Studies in Modern History. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-6109-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1921 [[Partition of Ireland]], the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] had similarly barred most of the native Irish Catholics from voting for Irish seats in the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] once the last bar to Catholics voting in the United Kingdom had been lifted by the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]]. The property qualification remained in place for United Kingdom elections until the passage of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]].

Self-handicapping can be seen as a method of preserving self-esteem but it can also be used for [[self-enhancement]] and to [[impression management|manage the impressions]] of others.&lt;ref name=RhodewaltVohs2005&gt;[[Rhodewalt, F.]], &amp; Vohs, K. D. (2005). Defensive strategies, motivation, and the self. In A. Elliot &amp; C. Dweck (Eds.). ''Handbook of competence and motivation''(pp. 548-565). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conservation or augmentation of self-esteem is due to changes in [[attribution (psychology)|causal attributions]] or the attributions for success and failure that self-handicapping affords. There are two methods that people use to self-handicap: behavioral and claimed self-handicaps. People withdraw effort or create obstacles to successes so they can maintain public and private self-images of competence.

Sameer Babu M, and Selvamari S (2018) defines: Self-Handicapping is a process of employing unique verbal and/or non-verbal strategies of carelessness on, lethargy in, and withdrawal from the academic duties and responsibilities which leads to lower academic standards". Reference: Sameer Babu M, and Selvamari S (2018). In Selvamari. S. (2018) "Academic self-concept, self-handicapping, and mastery goal orientation as predictors of achievement in mathematics of secondary school students". Unpublished M Phil Dissertation, University of Kerala, India.

Self-handicapping is a widespread behavior amongst humans that has been observed in a variety of cultures and geographic areas. For instance, students frequently participate in self-handicapping behavior to avoid feeling bad about themselves if they do not perform well in class. Self-handicapping behavior has also been observed in the business world. The effects of self-handicapping can be both large and small and found in virtually any environment wherein people are expected to perform.

==Overview and relevance==
The first method people use to self-handicap is when they make a task harder for themselves in fear of not successfully completing that task, so that if they do in fact fail, they can simply place the blame on the obstacles rather than placing the blame on themselves. This is known to researchers as ''behavioral'' handicapping, in which the individual actually creates obstacles to performance.&lt;ref name=Leary1986&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leary | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Shepperd | first2 = J. A. | year = 1986 | title = Behavioral self-handicaps versus self-reported handicaps: A conceptual note | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 1265–1268 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of behavioral handicaps include alcohol consumption,&lt;ref name=Bordini1986&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bordini | first1 = E.J. | last2 = Tucker | first2 = J.A. | last3 = Vuchinich | first3 = R.E. | last4 = Rudd | first4 = E.J. | year = 1986 | title = Alcohol consumption as a self-handicapping strategy in women | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 346–349 | doi=10.1037/0021-843x.95.4.346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|citeseerx = 10.1.1.380.7268|title=Alcohol Consumption as a Self-Handicapping Strategy|first1=Jalie A. |last1=[[Jalie Tucker|Tucker]]|first2=Rudy E. |last2=Vuchinich|first3=Mark B. |last3=Sobell|date=1981|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=90|number=3|p=220–230 |doi=10.1037/0021-843x.90.3.220}}&lt;/ref&gt; the selection of unattainable goals,&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = J | year = 1985 | title = Unattainable goal choice as a self-handicapping strategy | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 140–152 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1985.tb02340.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refusal to practice a task or technique (especially in sports and the fine arts).&lt;ref name=HarrisSynder1986&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = R.N. | last2 = Snyder | first2 = C.R. | year = 1986 | title = The role of uncertain self-esteem in self-handicapping | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 451–458 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.2.451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second way that people self-handicap is by coming up with justifications for their potential failures, so that if they do not succeed in the task, they can point to their excuses as the reasons for their failures. This is known as ''claimed'' self-handicapping, in which the individual merely states that an obstacle to performance exists. Examples of claimed self-handicaps include declarations that one is experiencing physical symptoms.&lt;ref name=smithsynderperkins1983&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = T.W. | last2 = Snyder | first2 = C.R. | last3 = Perkins | first3 = S.C. | year = 1983 | title = The self-serving function of hypochondriacal complaints: Physical symptoms as self-handicapping strategies | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 787–797 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.4.787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-handicapping behavior allows individuals to externalize failures but internalize success, accepting credit for achievements but allowing excuses for failings. An example of self-handicapping is the student who spends the night before an important exam partying rather than studying. The student fears failing his exam and appearing incapable. In partying the night before the exam the student has engaged in self-defeating behaviour and increased the likelihood of poor exam performance. However, in the event of failure, the student can offer fatigue and a hangover, rather than lack of ability, as plausible explanations. Furthermore, should the student receive positive feedback about his exam, his achievement is enhanced by the fact that he succeeded, despite the handicap.

===Individual differences===
People differ in the extent to which they self-handicap&lt;ref name=Rhodewalt1990&gt;[[Rhodewalt, F.]] (1990) Self-handicappers: Individual differences in the preference for anticipatory self-protective acts. In R. Higgins, C. R. Snyder, &amp; S. Berglas. ''Self-handicapping: The paradox that isn't. '' New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and most research on individual differences has used the Self-Handicapping Scale (SHS).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The SHS was developed as a means of measuring individuals' tendency to employ excuses or create handicaps as a means to protect one's self-esteem. Research to date shows that SHS has adequate construct validity.&lt;ref name=Rhodewalt1990 /&gt; For example, individuals who score high on the SHS put in less effort and practice less when concerned about their ability to perform well in a given task.&lt;ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirt1991&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirt | first1 = E.

J. | year = 1986 | title = An analysis of the Self-Handicapping Scale | url = | journal = Basic and Applied Social Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 211–224 | doi=10.1207/s15324834basp0703_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RhodewaltHill1995&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Frederick Rhodewalt| last1 = Rhodewalt | first1 = F. | last2 = Hill | first2 = S.

A number of characteristics have been related to self-handicapping (e.g. [[hypochondriasis]])&lt;ref name=smithsynderperkins1983 /&gt; and research suggests that those more prone to self-handicapping may differ motivationally compared to those that do not rely on such defensive strategies. For example, fear of failure, a heightened sensitivity to shame and embarrassment upon failure,&lt;ref name=McGregorElliot2005&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGregor | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Elliot | first2 = A. J. | year = 2005 | title = The shame of failure: Examining the link between fear of failure and shame | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 218–231 | doi=10.1177/0146167204271420}}&lt;/ref&gt; motivates self-handicapping behavior.&lt;ref name=ChenChenLinKeeShui2009&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = L.

A student, for example, may approach course exams with the goal of not performing poorly as this would suggest a lack of ability. To avoid ability attributions and the shame of failure, the student fails to adequately prepare for an exam. While this may provide temporary relief, it renders one's ability conceptions more uncertain, resulting in further self-handicapping.&lt;ref name=RhodewaltVohs2005 /&gt;

===Gender differences===
While research suggests that claimed self-handicaps are used by men and women alike,&lt;ref name=Rhodewalt1990 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ArkinOleson1998&gt;Arkin, R. M., &amp; Oleson, K. C. (1998).

Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; several studies have reported significant differences. While research assessing differences in reported self-handicapping have revealed no gender differences&lt;ref name=RhodewaltHill1995 /&gt; or greater self-handicapping among females,&lt;ref name=FeickRhodewalt1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ElliotChurch2003 /&gt;
the vast majority of research suggests that males are more inclined to behaviourally self-handicap.&lt;ref name=JonesBerglas1978 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HarrisSynder1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirt1991 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodewalt | first1 = F. | last2 = Davison | first2 = J. | year = 1986 | title = Self-handicapping and subsequent performance: Role of outcome valence and attributional certainty | url = | journal = Basic and Applied Social Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 307–322 | doi=10.1207/s15324834basp0704_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences are further explained by the different value men and women ascribe to the concept of effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCrea | first1 = SM | last2 = Hirt | first2 = ER | last3 = Milner | first3 = BJ | year = 2008 | title = She works hard for the money: Valuing effort underlies gender differences in behavioral self-handicapping | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 292–311 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2007.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theoretical approaches==
The root of research on the act of self-handicapping can be traced back to Adler’s studies about self-esteem. In the late 1950s, Goffman and Heider published research concerning the manipulation of outward behavior for the purpose of impression management. It was not until 30 years later that self-handicapping behavior was attributed to internal factors. Until this point, self-handicapping only encompassed the usage of external factors, such as alcohol and drugs. Self-handicapping is usually studied in an experimental setting, but is sometimes studied in an observational environment.

Previous research has established that self-handicapping is motivated by uncertainty about one's ability&lt;ref name=JonesBerglas1978 /&gt; or, more generally, anticipated threats to [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=SynderSmith1982&gt;Snyder, C. R., &amp; Smith, T. W. (1982). Symptoms as self-handicapping strategies: The virtues of old wine in a new bottle. In G. Weary &amp; H. L. Mirels (Eds.), ''Integrations of clinical and social psychology'' (pp. 104-127). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-handicapping can be exacerbated by self-presentational concerns&lt;ref name=KolditzArkin1982 /&gt; but also occurs in situations where such concerns are at a minimum.&lt;ref name=JonesBerglas1978 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodewalt | first1 = F. | last2 = Fairfield | first2 = M. | year = 1991 | title = Claimed self-handicaps and the self-handicapper: On the relation of reductions in intended effort to performance | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 402–417 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(91)90030-t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major empirical findings==
Experiments on self-handicapping have depicted the reasons why people self-handicap and the effects that it has on those people. Self-handicapping has been observed in both laboratory and real world settings. Studying the psychological and physical effects of self-handicapping has allowed researchers to witness the dramatic effects that it has on attitude and performance.

Jones and Berglas gave people positive feedback following a problem-solving test, regardless of actual performance. Half the participants had been given fairly easy problems, while the others were given difficult problems. Participants were then given the choice between a "performance-enhancing drug" and a drug that would inhibit it. Those participants who received the difficult problems were more likely to choose the impairing drug, and participants who faced easy problems were more likely to choose the enhancing drug. It is argued that the participants presented with hard problems, believing that their success had been due to chance, chose the impairing drug because they were looking for an [[Attribution theory#Internal versus external|external attribution]] (what might be called an "excuse") for expected poor performance in the future, as opposed to an [[Attribution theory#Internal versus external|internal attribution]].&lt;ref name=JonesBerglas1978/&gt;

More recent research finds that, generally, people are willing to use handicaps to protect their [[self-esteem]] (e.g., discounting failings) but are more reluctant to employ them for [[self-enhancement]]. (e.g., to further credit their success).
Rhodewalt, Morf, Hazlett, and Fairfield (1991)&lt;ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991 /&gt; selected participants who scored high or low on the Self-Handicapping Scale (SHS) and who had high or low self-esteem.&lt;ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991 /&gt; They presented participants with a handicap and then with success or failure feedback and asked participants to make attributions for their performance.&lt;ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991 /&gt; The results showed that both self-protection and self-enhancement occurred, but only as a function of levels of self-esteem and the level of tendency to self-handicap.&lt;ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991 /&gt; Participants who were high self-handicappers, regardless of their level of self-esteem, used the handicap as a means of self-protection but only those participants with high self-esteem used the handicap to self-enhance.&lt;ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991 /&gt;

In a further study, Rhodewalt (1991) presented the handicap to only half of the participants and gave success and failure feedback. The results provided evidence for self-protection but not for self-enhancement.&lt;ref name=Rhodewaltetal1991&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodewalt | first1 = F. | last2 = Morf | first2 = C | last3 = Hazlett | first3 = S. | last4 = Fairfield | first4 = M. | year = 1991 | title = Self-handicapping: The role of discounting and augmentation in the preservation of self-esteem | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.61.1.122| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 121–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the failure feedback, handicap absent group, attributed their failures to their own lack of ability and reported lower self-esteem to the handicap-present, failure-feedback condition.&lt;ref name=Rhodewaltetal1991 /&gt; Furthermore, the handicap-present failure group reported levels of self-esteem equal to that of the successful group.&lt;ref name=Rhodewaltetal1991 /&gt; This evidence highlights the importance of self-handicaps in self-protection although it offers no support for the handicap acting to self-enhance.&lt;ref name=Rhodewaltetal1991 /&gt;

Another experiment, by Martin Seligman and colleagues, examined whether there was a correlation between explanatory styles and the performance of swimmers.&lt;ref name=Seligman1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seligman|first1=Martin E.P.|last2=Nolen-Hoeksema|first2=Susan|last3=Thornton|first3=Nort|last4=Thornton|first4=Karen Moe|title=Explanatory Style as a Mechanism of Disappointing Athletic Performance|journal=Psychological Science|volume=1|issue=2|year=1990|pages=143–146|issn=0956-7976|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1990.tb00084.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being given false bad times on their preliminary events, the swimmers who justified their poor performance to themselves in a pessimistic way did worse on subsequent performances. In contrast, the subsequent performances of those swimmers who had more optimistic attributions concerning their poor swimming times were not affected.&lt;ref name=Seligman1990 /&gt; Those who had positive attributions were more likely to succeed after given false times because they were self-handicapping. They attributed their failure to an external force rather than blaming themselves. Therefore, their self-esteem remained intact, which led to their success in subsequent events. This experiment demonstrates the positive effects that self-handicapping can have on an individual because when they attributed the failure to an external factor, they did not internalize the failure and let it psychologically affect them.

Previous research has looked at the consequences of self-handicapping and have suggested that self-handicapping leads to a more positive mood (at least in the short term)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCrea|first1=S. M.|last2=Hirt|first2=E.

(2001). Mood as a resource in processing self-relevant information. In J. P. Forgas (Ed.), Handbook of affect and social cognition.

Zuckerman and Tsai assessed self-handicapping, well-being, and coping among college students on two occasions over several months. Self-handicapping assessed on the first occasion predicted coping with problems by denial, blaming others and criticizing oneself as well as depression and somatic complaints. Depression and somatic complaints also predicted subsequent self-handicapping. Thus, the use of self-handicapping may lead to not only uncertainty as to one's ability but also ill-being, which in turn may lead to further reliance on self-handicapping.&lt;ref name=RhodewaltVohs2005 /&gt;

==Applications==
For the self-handicapping strategy to work the individual using it needs to be unaware its implementation. If this is not the case then the strategy won't have the protective effect on the person's self-esteem in the presence of a failure. If people believe that they are going to fail, they create obstacles and excuses to justify their failures. There are many real world applications for this concept. For example, if people predict they are going to perform poorly on tasks, they create obstacles, such as taking drugs and consuming alcohol, so that they feel that they have diverted the blame from themselves if they actually do fail. In addition, another way that people self-handicap is by creating already-made excuses just in case they fail. For example, if a student feels that he is going to perform badly on a test, then he might make up an excuse for his potential failure, such as telling his friends that he does not feel well the morning of the test.

===Occurrence in sports===
Previous research&lt;ref name=Ommundsen2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ommundsen | first1 = Y | year = 2001 | title = Self-handicapping strategies in physical education classes:The influence of implicit theories of the nature of ability and achievement goal orientations | url = | journal = Psychology of Sport and Exercise | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 139–156 | doi=10.1016/s1469-0292(00)00019-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that because in Physical Education (PE) students are required to overtly display their physical abilities and incompetence could be readily observed by others, PE is an ideal setting to observe self-handicapping.&lt;ref name=Chen2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = L. H. | last2 = Chen | first2 = M. Y. | last3 = Lin | first3 = M. S. | last4 = Kee | first4 = Y. H. | last5 = Kuo | first5 = C. F. | last6 = Shui | first6 = S.

Recent research has examined the relationship between behavioural and claimed self-handicaps and athletic performance&lt;ref&gt;Coudevylle, G., Martin Ginis, K., &amp; Famose, J-P. (in press). Determinants of self-handicapping strategies in sport and their effects on athletic performance. ''Social Behavior and Personality. International Journal (Toronto, Ont.)''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the effects self-handicapping has on anxiety and fear of failure before Athletic Performance.&lt;ref name=Chen2008 /&gt;

==Controversies==
One controversy was revealed in a study done at the University of Wyoming.&lt;ref name=PsychologyandPsychiatryJournal&gt;"Psychology &amp; Psychiatry Journal." (2011) Social Psychology; Study Data from University of Wyoming Update Knowledge of Social Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research indicated a negative correlation between self-handicapping behaviors and boosting one’s self-esteem; it was also shown that people who focus on the positive attributes of themselves are less likely to self-handicap. This study, however, demonstrates that this claim is only partially accurate because the reduction of self-handicapping is only apparent in an area unrelated to the present self-esteem risk. As a result, the attempt to protect self-esteem becomes a detriment to future success in that area.

The '''structure of observed learning outcomes''' ('''SOLO''') [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] is a model that describes levels of increasing complexity in student's understanding of subjects.&lt;ref name=Atherton&gt;ATHERTON, J. S. (2005) ''Learning and Teaching:  SOLO taxonomy''. [On-line] UK: Available:  [http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/solo.htm]  Accessed: 7 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by [[John B.

* '''Pre-structural''' – The task is not attacked appropriately; the student hasn’t really understood the point and uses too simple a way of going about it.
* '''Uni-structural''' – The student's response only focuses on one relevant aspect.
* '''Multi-structural''' – The student's response focuses on several relevant aspects but they are treated independently and additively. Assessment of this level is primarily quantitative.
* '''Relational''' – The different aspects have become integrated into a coherent whole. This level is what is normally meant by an adequate understanding of some topic.
* '''Extended abstract''' – The previous integrated whole may be conceptualised at a higher level of abstraction and generalised to a new topic or area.

In [[mathematics]], a '''subcategory''' of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' is a category ''S'' whose objects are objects in ''C'' and whose [[morphism]]s are morphisms in ''C'' with the same identities and composition of morphisms. Intuitively, a subcategory of ''C'' is a category obtained from ''C'' by "removing" some of its objects and arrows.

== Formal definition ==
Let ''C'' be a category. A '''subcategory''' ''S'' of ''C'' is given by
*a subcollection of objects of ''C'', denoted ob(''S''),
*a subcollection of morphisms of ''C'', denoted hom(''S'').
such that
*for every ''X'' in ob(''S''), the identity morphism id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is in hom(''S''),
*for every morphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in hom(''S''), both the source ''X'' and the target ''Y'' are in ob(''S''),
*for every pair of morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' in hom(''S'') the composite ''f'' o ''g'' is in hom(''S'') whenever it is defined.

These conditions ensure that ''S'' is a category in its own right: the collection of objects is ob(''S''), the collection of morphisms is hom(''S''), and the identities and composition are as in ''C''. There is an obvious [[Full and faithful functors|faithful functor]] ''I'' : ''S'' → ''C'', called the '''inclusion functor''' which takes objects and morphisms to themselves.

Let ''S'' be a subcategory of a category ''C''. We say that ''S'' is a '''full subcategory of''' ''C'' if for each pair of objects ''X'' and ''Y'' of ''S''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{S}(X,Y)=\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(X,Y).&lt;/math&gt;
A full subcategory is one that includes ''all'' morphisms between objects of ''S''. For any collection of objects ''A'' in ''C'', there is a unique full subcategory of ''C'' whose objects are those in ''A''.

== Examples ==
* The category of [[Finite set|finite sets]] forms a full subcategory of the [[category of sets]].
* The category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are [[Bijection|bijections]] forms a non-full subcategory of the category of sets.
* The [[category of abelian groups]] forms a full subcategory of the [[category of groups]].
* The category of [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] (whose morphisms are [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]]-preserving ring homomorphisms) forms a non-full subcategory of the category of [[Rng_(algebra)|rngs]].

== Embeddings ==
Given a subcategory ''S'' of ''C'' the inclusion [[functor]] ''I'' : ''S'' → ''C'' is both a [[faithful functor|faithful]] functor and [[Injective function|injective]] on objects. It is [[full functor|full]] if and only if ''S'' is a full subcategory.

Some authors define an '''embedding''' to be a [[full and faithful functor]]. Such a functor is necessarily injective on objects up-to-isomorphism. For instance, the [[Yoneda embedding]] is an embedding in this sense.

Some authors define an '''embedding''' to be a full and faithful functor that is injective on objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jaap van Oosten|title=Basic category theory|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~ooste110/syllabi/catsmoeder.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors define a functor to be an '''embedding''' if it is
faithful and
injective on objects.
Equivalently, ''F'' is an embedding if it is injective on morphisms. A functor ''F'' is then called a '''full embedding''' if it is a full functor and an embedding.

With the definitions of the previous paragraph, for any (full) embedding ''F'' : ''B'' → ''C'' the image of ''F'' is a (full) subcategory ''S'' of ''C'' and ''F'' induces an [[isomorphism of categories]] between ''B'' and ''S''. If ''F'' is not injective on objects, the image of ''F'' is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to ''B''.

In some categories, one can also speak of morphisms of the category being [[embedding#Category theory|embeddings]].

== Types of subcategories ==
A subcategory ''S'' of ''C'' is said to be '''[[isomorphism-closed subcategory|isomorphism-closed]]''' or '''replete''' if every [[isomorphism]] ''k'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in ''C'' such that ''Y'' is in ''S'' also belongs to ''S''. An isomorphism-closed full subcategory is said to be '''strictly full'''.

A subcategory of ''C'' is '''wide''' or '''lluf''' (a term first posed by [[Peter Freyd]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Freyd|first= Peter|authorlink=Peter J. Freyd  |year= 1991|month= |pages=95–104 |chapter= Algebraically complete categories|series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics |volume= 1488|publisher=Springer|title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Category Theory, Como, Italy (CT 1990)|doi=10.1007/BFb0084215}}&lt;/ref&gt;) if it contains all the objects of ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=wide+subcategory|title=Wide subcategory}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide subcategory is typically not full: the only wide full subcategory of a category is that category itself.

A '''Serre subcategory''' is a non-empty full subcategory ''S'' of an [[abelian category]] ''C'' such that for all short [[exact sequence]]s

:&lt;math&gt;0\to M'\to M\to M''\to 0&lt;/math&gt;

in ''C'', ''M'' belongs to ''S'' if and only if both &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;M''&lt;/math&gt; do. This notion arises from [[Localization of a category#Serre's C-theory|Serre's C-theory]].

As a [[metaphor]], a '''touchstone''' refers to any physical or intellectual measure by which the validity or merit of a concept can be tested. It is similar in use to an [[acid test (gold)|acid test]], [[litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] in politics, or, from a negative perspective, a [[shibboleth]] where the criterion is considered by some to be out-of-date.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}
The word was introduced into literary criticism by Matthew Arnold in "the Study of Poetry" (1880) to denote short but distinctive passages, selected from the writings of the greatest poets, which he used to determine the relative value of passages or poems which are compared to them. Arnold proposed this method of evaluation as a corrective for what he called the "fallacious" estimates of poems according to their "historic" importance in the development of literature, or else according to their "personal" appeal to an individual critic.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, M.H; Glossary of Literary Terms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
{{Main|Touchstone (assaying tool)}}
A touchstone is a small tablet of dark stone such as [[fieldstone]], [[slate]], or [[lydite]], used for [[Metallurgical assay|assay]]ing [[precious metal]] [[alloy]]s. It has a finely grained surface on which soft [[metal]]s leave a visible trace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/203901|title=Touchstone|work=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
An example in literature is the character of [[Touchstone (As You Like It)|Touchstone]] in Shakespeare's ''[[As You Like It]]'', described as "a [[wise fool]] who acts as a kind of guide or point of reference throughout the play, putting everyone, including himself, to the comic test".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/ayli/36173 John Palmer]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Dante's "In la sua volontade è nostra pace" ("In his will is our peace"; Paradiso, III.85)&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, M.H. Glossary of Literary Terms&lt;/ref&gt;

A touchstone can be a short passage from recognized masters' works used in assaying the relative merit of poetry and literature. This sense was coined by Matthew Arnold in his essay "The Study of Poetry", where he gives Hamlet's dying words to Horatio as an example of a touchstone.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Matthew. "The Study of Poetry." Essays: English and American. Ed. Charles W. Eliot. 1909–14. Published April 11, 2001 by Bartleby.com [http://www.bartleby.com/28/5.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In German politics==
In [[Germany]], various [[interest group]]s sometimes send questionnaires to the campaigning political parties before federal parliament elections. These questionnaires, consisting of political survey questions the interest groups are interested in, are often called "electoral touchstones" (''German:'' [[:de:Wahlprüfstein|Wahlprüfsteine]]). Those answers of a political party which might support or threaten the political goals of an interest group are finally published by the group in order to influence the voting behavior of potential voters being in favor of the political views of the interest group.

{{Taoism}}
{{Chinese folk religion}}
In [[Chinese philosophy]], '''yin and yang''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ɪ|n}} and {{IPAc-en||j|ɑː|ŋ|,_|j|æ|ŋ}}; {{lang-zh|{{linktext|陰|陽}}}} ''yīnyáng'', lit. "dark-bright", "negative-positive") describes how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Feuchtwang|first=Stephan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-85881-6|location=New York|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology. In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as [[qi]]. It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of Yin and Yang has formed many things &lt;ref&gt;Feuchtwang, Sephan. “Chinese Religions.” Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third ed., Routledge, 2016, pp. 150-151. &lt;/ref&gt;. Included among these forms are humans. Many tangible [[Dualistic cosmology|dualities]] (such as [[light and dark]], fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical [[Chinese science]] and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of [[traditional Chinese medicine]],&lt;ref name=Porkert1974&gt;{{cite book|author=Porkert|title=The Theoretical Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=MIT Press|year=1974|isbn=0-262-16058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a central principle of different forms of [[Chinese martial arts]] and exercise, such as [[baguazhang]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|taijiquan]] (t'ai chi), and [[qigong]] (Chi Kung), as well as appearing in the pages of the ''[[I Ching]]''.

The notion of a duality can be found in many areas, such as [[Duality (CoPs)|Communities of Practice]], but in this context yin and yang are better viewed as parts of an oneness that is expressed in the [[Tao]]. The term "dualistic-monism" or [[dialectical monism]] has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful [[paradox]] of simultaneous unity and duality. Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary (rather than opposing) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Georges Ohsawa]]|year=1976|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oQqDZnm43mkC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=The Unique Principle|isbn=978-0-918860-17-0|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light).  Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation. The yin yang (i.e. [[taijitu]] symbol) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section.

In [[Taoism|Taoist]] metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, along with other dichotomous moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; so, the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole. In the ethics of [[Confucianism]] on the other hand, most notably in the philosophy of [[Dong Zhongshu]] ({{circa}} 2nd century BC), a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor Latener|first=Rodney Leon|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Confucianism|volume=2|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2005|page=869|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8239-4079-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic aspects==
These [[Chinese language|Chinese]] terms ''yin'' 陰 or 阴 "shady side" and ''yang'' 陽 or 阳 "sunny side" are linguistically analyzable in terms of [[Chinese characters]], [[pronunciations]] and [[etymology]], [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]], [[topography]], and [[loanword]]s.

===Characters===
The [[Traditional Chinese characters]] {{linktext|陰}}  and {{linktext|陽}} for the words ''yīn'' and ''yáng'' are both classified as [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical- esphonetic characters]], combining the semantically significant [[Radical 170|"mound; hill" radical]] {{linktext|阝}} or {{linktext|阜}} with the phonetic indicators ''ying'' {{linktext|侌}} and ''yang'' {{linktext|昜}}. The first phonetic ''yīn'' {{linktext|侌|}} "cloudy" ideographically combines ''jīn'' {{linktext|今|}} "now; present" and ''yún'' {{linktext|云|}} "cloud", denoting the "今 presence of 云 clouds".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Karlgren]], ''Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese'', Paul Geunthner, 1923, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The second phonetic ''yáng'' {{linktext|昜|}} "bright" originally pictured {{linktext|日}} the "sun" with {{linktext|勿|}} "rays coming down".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wenlin]]'', version 4.1.1, 2012, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; This phonetic is expanded with the [[Radical 72|"sun" radical]] into ''yáng'' 暘 "rising sun; sunshine". The "mound; hill" radical 阝full forms semantically specify ''yīn'' 陰 "shady/dark side of a hill" and ''yáng'' 陽 "sunny/light side of a hill".

The [[Simplified Chinese characters]] {{linktext|阴}} and {{linktext|阳}} for ''yīn'' and ''yáng'' combine the same "hill" radical 阝 with the non-phonetic ''yuè'' {{linktext|月}} "moon" and ''rì'' {{linktext|日}} "sun", graphically denoting "shady side of a hill" and "sunny side of a hill". Compare the [[Classical Chinese]] names (which contain ''tài'' {{linktext|太}} "great") for these two heavenly bodies: ''Tàiyīn'' {{linktext|太陰}} "moon" and ''Tàiyáng'' {{linktext|太陽}} "sun".

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation of 陰 or 阴 is usually level first [[Four tones|tone]] ''yīn'' "shady; cloudy" or sometimes falling fourth tone ''yìn'' "to shelter; shade", and 陽 or 阳 "sunny" is always pronounced with rising second tone ''yáng''.

Sinologists and historical linguists have reconstructed [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciations from data in the (7th century CE) ''[[Qieyun]]'' [[rhyme dictionary]] and later [[rhyme tables]], which was subsequently used to reconstruct [[Old Chinese phonology]] from rhymes in the (11th-7th centuries BCE) ''[[Shijing]]'' and phonological components of Chinese characters. [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese]] have illuminated the etymology of modern Chinese words.

Compare these Middle Chinese and Old Chinese (with asterisk) reconstructions of ''yīn'' 陰 and ''yáng'' 陽:
* ''ˑiəm'' &lt; *''ˑiəm'' and ''iang'' &lt; *''diang'' ([[Bernhard Karlgren]])&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Karlgren, ''Grammata Serica Recensa'', Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1957, 173, 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
* *''ʔjəm'' and *''raŋ'' ([[Li Fang-Kuei]])&lt;ref&gt;Li, Fang-Kuei, "Studies on Archaic Chinese", translated by Gilbert L. Mattos, ''Monumenta Serica'' 31, 1974:219–287.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''ʔ(r)jum'' and *''ljang'' ([[William H. Baxter]]),&lt;ref&gt;William H. Baxter, ''A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology'', Mouton de Gruyter ,1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ʔjəm'' &lt; *''ʔəm'' and ''jiaŋ'' &lt; *''laŋ'' (Axel Schuessler)&lt;ref&gt;Schuessler, Axel, ''ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese'', [[University of Hawaii Press]], 2007, 558, 572.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''im'' &lt; *''qrum'' and ''yang'' &lt; *''laŋ'' ([[William H. Baxter]] and [[Laurent Sagart]])&lt;ref&gt;Baxter &amp; Sagart (2014), pp. 326-378.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuessler gives probable [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] etymologies for both Chinese words.

''Yin'' &lt; *''ʔəm'' compares with [[Burmese language|Burmese]] ''ʔum&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;'' "overcast; cloudy", [[Adi language|Adi]] ''muk-jum'' "shade", and [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]] ''so'yǔm'' "shade"; and is probably cognate with Chinese ''àn'' &lt; *''ʔə̂mʔ'' {{linktext|黯}} "dim; gloomy" and ''qīn'' &lt; *''khəm'' {{linktext|衾}} "blanket"

''Yang'' &lt; *''laŋ'' compares with Lepcha ''a-lóŋ'' "reflecting light", Burmese ''laŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;'' "be bright" and ''ə-laŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;'' "light"; and is perhaps cognate with Chinese ''chāng'' &lt; *''k-hlaŋ'' {{linktext|昌}} "prosperous; bright"; ''bǐng'' &lt; *''braŋʔ'' {{linktext|炳}} "bright"; ''liàng'' &lt; ''*raŋh'' {{linktext|亮}} "(pale) light"; ''lǎng'' &lt; ''raŋʔ'' {{linktext|朗}} "brilliant light"; ''míng'' &lt; ''mraŋ'' {{linktext|明}} "bright, become light, enlighten". Schuessler surmises that those items either are [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area|areal]] words (cf. [[Tai languages|Tai]] ''plaŋ&lt;sup&gt;A1&lt;/sup&gt;'' "bright") or belong to an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] word family (cf. Proto-[[Vietic languages|Viet-Muong]]  ''hlaŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;''); owing to "the different OC initial consonant which seems to have no recognizable OC morphological function"&lt;ref&gt;Schuessler, Axel, ''ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese'', [[University of Hawaii Press]], 2007, 356.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Meanings===
''Yin'' and ''yang'' are semantically complex words. 

A reliable [[Chinese dictionary#Chinese-English dictionaries|Chinese-English dictionary]] gives the following translation equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;[[John DeFrancis]], ed., ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'', University of Hawaii Press, 2003, 1147, 1108.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Yin''' 陰 or 阴 [[Noun]] ① [philosophy] negative/passive/female principle in nature ② Surname [[Bound morpheme]] ① the moon ② shaded orientation ③ covert; concealed; hidden ④ ⑦ negative ⑧ north side of a hill ⑨ south bank of a river ⑩ reverse side of a stele ⑪in intaglio [[Stative verb]] ① overcast &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Yang''' 陽 or 阳 [[Bound morpheme]] ① [Chinese philosophy] positive/active/male principle in nature ②the sun ④ in relief ⑤ open; overt ⑥ belonging to this world ⑦ [linguistics] masculine ⑧ south side of a hill ⑨ north bank of a river &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''yin-yang'' 陰陽 or 阴阳 means "yin and yang; opposites; ancient Chinese astronomy; occult arts; astrologer; geomancer; etc.".

The [[Sinology|sinologist]] [[Rolf Stein]] etymologically translates Chinese ''yin'' 陰 "shady side (of a mountain)" and ''yang'' 陽 "sunny side (of a mountain)" with the uncommon English geographic terms ''[[wikt:ubac|ubac]]'' "shady side of a mountain" and ''[[wikt:adret|adret]]'' "sunny side of a mountain" (which are of [[List of English words of French origin|French origin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Stein (2010), ''Rolf Stein's Tibetica Antiqua: With Additional Materials'', Brill, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;...

===Toponymy===
Many Chinese place names or [[toponyms]] contain the word ''yang'' "sunny side" and a few contain ''yin'' "shady side". In [[China]], as elsewhere in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], sunlight comes predominantly from the south, and thus the south face of a mountain or the north bank of a river will receive more direct sunlight than the opposite side.

''Yang'' refers to the "south side of a hill" in [[Hengyang]] 衡陽, which is south of [[Mount Heng (Hunan)|Mount Heng]] 衡山 in [[Hunan]] province, and to the "north bank of a river" in [[Luoyang]] 洛陽, which is located north of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] 洛河 in [[Henan]].
 
Similarly, ''yin'' refers to "north side of a hill" in [[Huayin]] 華陰, which is north of [[Mount Hua]] 華山 in [[Shaanxi]] province.

In [[Japan]], the characters are used in western [[Honshu]] to delineate the north-side [[San'in region]] 山陰 from the south-side [[San'yō region]] 山陽, separated by the [[Chūgoku Mountains|Chugoku mountain range]] 中国山地.

===Loanwords===
English ''[[wikt:yin|yin]]'', ''[[wikt:yang|yang]]'', and ''[[wikt:yin-yang|yin-yang]]'' are familiar [[loanwords]] of [[List of English words of Chinese origin|Chinese origin]].

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''yin''' (jɪn) Also '''Yin''', '''Yn'''. [Chinese ''yīn'' shade, feminine; the moon.] 
'''a.''' In Chinese philosophy, the feminine or negative principle (characterized by dark, wetness, cold, passivity, disintegration, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also ''attrib''. or as ''adj''., and ''transf''. Cf. '''yang'''. 
'''b.''' ''Comb''., as '''yin-yang''', the combination or fusion of the two cosmic forces; freq. attrib., esp. as '''yin-yang symbol''', a circle divided by an S-shaped line into a dark and a light segment, representing respectively ''yin'' and ''yang'', each containing a 'seed' of the other. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''yang''' (jæŋ) Also '''Yang'''. [Chinese ''yáng'' yang, sun, positive, male genitals.] 
'''a.''' In Chinese philosophy, the masculine or positive principle (characterized by light, warmth, dryness, activity, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also ''attrib.'' or as ''adj.'' Cf. '''yin'''.
'''b.''' ''Comb.'': '''yang-yin''' = ''yin-yang'' s.v. '''yin b.'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the earliest recorded "yin and yang" usages, the ''OED'' cites 1671 for ''yin'' and ''yang'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnoldus Montanus]], ''Atlas Chinensis: Being a relation of remarkable passages in two embassies from the East-India Company of the United Provinces to the Vice-Roy Singlamong, General Taising Lipovi, and Konchi, Emperor, Thomas Johnson'', tr. by J. Ogilby, 1671, 549: "The Chineses by these Strokes ‥ declare ‥ how much each Form or Sign receives from the two fore-mention'd Beginnings of Yn or Yang."&lt;/ref&gt; 1850 for ''yin-yang'',&lt;ref&gt;[[William Jones Boone (son)|William Jones Boone]], "Defense of an Essay on the proper renderings of the words Elohim and θεός into the Chinese Language," ''Chinese Repository'' XIX, 1850, 375: "... when in the Yih King (or Book of Diagrams) we read of the Great Extreme, it means that the Great Extreme is in the midst of the active-passive primordial substance (Yin-yáng); and that it is not exterior to, or separate from the Yin-yáng."&lt;/ref&gt; and 1959 for ''yang-yin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Jung]], "Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self", in ''The Collected Works of C. G. Jung'', tr. by R. F. C. Hull, Volume 9, Part 2, p. 58" "[The vision of "Ascension of Isaiah"] might easily be a description of a genuine yang-yin relationship, a picture that comes closer to the actual truth than the ''privatio boni''. Moreover, it does not damage monotheism in any way, since it unites the opposites just and yang and yin are united in Tao (which the Jesuits quite logically translated as "God")."&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, ''yang-yin'' (like ''ying-yang'') occasionally occurs as a mistake or typographical error for the Chinese loanword ''yin-yang''— yet they are not equivalents. Chinese does have some ''yangyin'' [[collocation]]s, such as 洋銀 (lit. "foreign silver") "silver coin/dollar", but not even the most comprehensive dictionaries (e.g., the ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'') enter ''yangyin'' *陽陰. While ''yang'' and ''yin'' can occur together in context,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' says" "Now, the lumber is not so important as the forest; the forest is not so important as the rain; the rain is not so important as yin and yang; yin and yang are not so important as harmony; and harmony is not so important as the Way. (12, 材不及林，林不及雨，雨不及陰陽，陰陽不及和，和不及道; tr. Major et al. 2010, 442).&lt;/ref&gt; ''yangyin'' is not synonymous with ''yinyang''. The linguistic term "[[Siamese twins (linguistics)|irreversible binomial]]" refers to a collocation of two words A-B that cannot be idiomatically reversed as B-A, for example, English ''cat and mouse'' (not *''mouse and cat'') and ''friend or foe'' (not *''foe or friend''). Similarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A word is dominant or privileged over B, for example, ''tiandi'' 天地 "heaven and earth" and ''nannü'' 男女 "men and women". ''Yinyang'' meaning "dark and light; female and male; moon and sun", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why ''yinyang'' violates this pattern, including "linguistic convenience" (it is easier to say ''yinyang'' than ''yangyin''), the idea that "proto-Chinese society was matriarchal", or perhaps, since ''yinyang'' first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was "purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Ames, "''Yin'' and ''Yang''", in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy'', ed. by Antonio S. Cua, Routledge, 2002, 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Needham discusses Yin and Yang together with [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] as part of the [[School of Naturalists]]. He says that it would be proper to begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: "lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; [[Cambridge University Press]]; 1956&lt;/ref&gt; He then discusses [[Zou Yan]] (鄒衍; 305 – 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes "There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; Cambridge University Press; 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese gender roles ===

In spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being "necessary", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/gender-c/]&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly under [[Confucianism]], yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to "yin" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.

The notion of yin and yang has led to the persecution and extinction of Asian sun goddess cults outside of Korea and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques H. Kamstra, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8sgUAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Yin%20yang&amp;f=false Encounter Or Syncretism: The Initial Growth of Japanese Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2018}}

==Nature==
In [[Daoism|Daoist]] philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the [[Tao Te Ching]] at chapter 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Charles|title=Daode Jing|url=http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html#div-43|accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness ([[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [[Wiktionary:quiescence|quiescence]] is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.

It is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [[non-wellfounded mereology|mutual whole]] (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is{{cn|date=June 2012}} to postulate the notion of a race with only men or only women; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, men and women together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.&lt;ref&gt;Robin R. Wang {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/yinyang/|title=Yinyang (Yin-yang)|work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky{{mdash}}an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.

Certain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:&lt;ref&gt;[[Nyoiti Sakurazawa]] &amp; [[William Dufty]] (1965) ''You Are All Sanpaku'', page 33&lt;/ref&gt;
*The bigger the front, the bigger the back.
*Illness is the doorway to health.
*Tragedy turns to comedy.
*Disasters turn out to be blessings.

==Symbolism and importance==
Yin is the black side with the white dot in it, and yang is the white side with the black dot in it. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the "sunny place' or "south slope") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.

Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, [[femininity]], and night time.

Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, [[masculinity]] and daytime.&lt;ref&gt;Osgood, Charles E. "From Yang and Yin to and or but." Language 49.2 (1973): 380–412 . [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The yin-yang symbol, having no "officially standardized" rendition, has been the basis of much artistic variation, most of it "frivolous" (that is, "merely" artistic, with no philosophical/mystical meaning, e.g., tattoos). {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Yin and yang also applies to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Li CL. A brief outline of Chinese medical history with particular reference to acupuncture. Perspect Biol Med. 1974 Autumn;18(1):132-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  If yin and yang become unbalanced, one of the qualities is considered deficient or has [[Emptiness|vacuity]].

===''I Ching''===
In the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000–750 BC),&lt;ref&gt;
The text of the ''I Ching'' has its origins in a [[Western Zhou]] divination text called the ''Changes of Zhou'' (周易 ''Zhōu yì'').  Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Nylan, Michael (2001), ''The Five "Confucian" Classics'' (2001), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (&lt;span style="font-size: 24px"&gt;⚋&lt;/span&gt;) and yang is solid (&lt;span style="font-size: 24px"&gt;⚊&lt;/span&gt;). These are then combined into [[ba gua|trigrams]], which are more yang (''e.g.'' ☱) or more yin (''e.g.'' ☵) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (''e.g.'', ☰ is heavily yang, while ☷ is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (''e.g.'' &lt;span style="font-size: 20px"&gt;䷕&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-size: 20px"&gt;䷟&lt;/span&gt;). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.

===Taijitu===
{{Main|Taijitu}}

The principle of yin and yang is represented in Taoism by the Taijitu (literally "Diagram of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Supreme Ultimate]]"). The term is commonly used to mean the simple "divided circle" form, but may refer to any of several schematic diagrams representing these principles, such as the [[swastika]], common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures, such as in [[Celtic art]] and [[Notitia Dignitatum#Depictions|Roman shield markings]].&lt;ref name="Giovanni Monastra (2000)"&gt;Giovanni Monastra: "[http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html#t24 The "Yin–Yang" among the Insignia of the Roman Empire?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925054740/http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html |date=2011-09-25 }}," "Sophia," Vol. 6, No. 2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Late Roman Shield Patterns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/luke/ueda-sarson/MagisterPeditum.html|title=Late Roman Shield Patterns - Magister Peditum|work=www.ne.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helmut Nickel (1992), 146, 5"&gt;Helmut Nickel: "The Dragon and the Pearl," ''Metropolitan Museum Journal,'' Vol. 26 (1991), p. 146, Fn. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taijiquan===
{{main|T'ai chi ch'uan}}
Taijiquan (Chinese: 太极拳), a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and an animal body. [[Wu Jianquan]], a famous [[Chinese martial arts]] teacher, described Taijiquan as follows:

{{quotation|Various people have offered different explanations for the name ''Taijiquan''. Some have said: – 'In terms of [[meditation|self-cultivation]], one must train from a state of movement towards a state of stillness. ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' comes about through the balance of ''yin'' and ''yang''. In terms of the art of attack and defense then, in the context of the [[I Ching|changes]] of full and empty, one is constantly internally latent, to not outwardly expressive, as if the ''yin'' and ''yang'' of ''Taiji'' have not yet divided apart.' Others say: 'Every movement of ''Taijiquan'' is based on circles, just like the shape of a ''Taijitu''. Therefore, it is called ''Taijiquan''.|Wu Jianquan|The International Magazine of T’ai Chi Ch’uan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woolidge|first=Doug|title=T’AI CHI The International Magazine of T’ai Chi Ch’uan Vol. 21 No. 3|publisher=Wayfarer Publications|date=June 1997|issn=0730-1049}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Ātman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|t|m|ə|n}}), '''attā''' or '''attan''' in Buddhism is the concept of self, and is found in Buddhist literature's discussion of the concept of non-self (''[[Anatta]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most Buddhist traditions and texts reject the premise of a permanent, unchanging ''atman'' (self, soul).&lt;ref&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept.

==Etymology==
Cognates ({{lang-sa|आत्मन्}}) ''ātman'', ([[Pāli]]) ''atta'', [[Old English]] ''æthm'', [[German language|German]] ''Atem'', and Greek ''atmo''-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/atman |title=atman: definition, usage and pronunciation - YourDictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111041610/http://www.yourdictionary.com/atman |archive-date=2007-11-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; derive from the [[Indo-European root]] *ēt-men (breath).

''Ātman'' and ''atta'' refer to a person's "true self", a person's permanent self, absolute within, the "thinker of thoughts, feeler of sensations" separate from and beyond the changing phenomenal world.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Ātman'' is synonymous with ''Tuma'', ''Atuma'' and ''Attan'' in early Buddhist literature, state Rhys David and William Stede, all in the sense of "self, soul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|pages=22-23, 305, 503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Atman'' and ''Atta'' are related, in Buddhist canons, to terms such as ''Niratta'' (Nir+attan, soulless) and ''Attaniya'' (belonging to the soul, having a soul, of the nature of soul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|pages=23, 284 (Jiva), 369, 503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Buddhism==
"Atman" in early [[Buddhism]] appears as "all ''dhammas'' are not-Self (an-atta)", where ''atta'' (''atman'') refers to a metaphysical Self, states Peter Harvey, that is a "permanent, substantial, autonomous self or I".{{sfn|Harvey|1995b|p=17}} This concept refers to the pre-Buddhist [[Upanishads]] of [[Hinduism]], where a person is viewed as having a lower self (impermanent body, personality) and a Higher or Greater Self (real permanent Self, soul, atman, atta).{{sfn|Harvey|1995b|pp=17-19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Johnston|title=The Mukhya Upanishads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZUBBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA706|year=2014|publisher=Kshetra Books (Reprint), Original: OUP (1931) |isbn=978-1-4959-4653-0|pages=706–717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''[a]''' {{cite book|author=Michael Daniels|editor=Harris L.

The Buddha argued that no permanent, unchanging "self" can be found.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=68}}{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=52}} In Buddha's view, states Wayman, "''eso me atta'', or this is my self, is to be in the grip of wrong view".{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=531}} All conditioned phenomena are subject to change, and therefore can't be taken to be an unchanging "self".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=52}} Instead, the Buddha explains the perceived continuity of the human personality by describing it as composed of [[five skandhas]], without a permanent entity (Self, soul).{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=69-72}}{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|Ehrhard|Diener|2008|p=27}}

==Pudgalavada==
Of the early Indian Buddhist schools, only the [[Pudgalavada]]-school diverged from this basic teaching. The Pudgalavādins asserted that, while there is no [[Atman (Hinduism)|ātman]], there is a pudgala or "person", which is neither the same as nor different from the [[skandhas]].{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|Ehrhard|Diener|2008|p=27}}

==Buddha-nature==
{{Main|Buddha-nature}}

''Buddha-nature'' is a central notion of east-Asian (Chinese) [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahayana]] thought.{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998|p=83}} It refers to several related terms,{{refn|group=note|Buddha-dhatu, mind, ''Tathagatagarbha'', Dharma-dhatu, suchness (tathata).{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998|p=84}}}} most notably ''Tathāgatagarbha'' and ''Buddha-dhātu''.{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit; Jp. ''Busshō'', "Buddha-nature".}} ''Tathāgatagarbha'' means "the womb of the thus-gone" (c.f. enlightened one), while ''Buddha-dhātu'' literally means "Buddha-realm" or "Buddha-substrate".{{refn|group=note|Kevin Trainor: "a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas."&lt;ref name="Kevin Trainor 2004, p. 207"&gt;Kevin Trainor, ''Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;}} Several key texts refer to the ''tathāgatagarbha'' or ''Buddha-dhātu'' as "atman", self or essence, though those texts also contain warnings against a literal interpretation. Several scholars have noted similarities between [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|''tathāgatagarbha'' texts]] and the substantial monism found in the atman/Brahman tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Hubbard, ''Absolute Delusion, Perfect Buddhahood'', University of Hawai’i Press, Honolulu, 2001, pp. 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine, at its earliest, probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=104}}

=== Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra ===
In contrast to the madhyamika-tradition, the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' uses "positive language" to denote [[Two truths doctrine|"absolute reality"]]. According to Paul Williams, the ''[[Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' teaches an underlying essence, "Self", or "atman".{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=98-99}} This "true Self" is the Buddha-nature (''Tathagatagarbha''), which is present in all sentient beings, and realized by the awakened ones. Most scholars consider the ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine in ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' asserting an 'essential nature' in every living being is equivalent to 'Self',{{refn|group=note|Wayman and Wayman have disagreed with this view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=107}}}} and it contradicts the Anatta doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=104-105, 108}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–102}}, '''Quote:''' "Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on ''anatta''. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sallie B. King, the ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' does not represent a major innovation.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} Its most important innovation is the linking of the term ''buddhadhatu'' with ''tathagatagarbha''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} According to King, the sutra is rather unsystematic,{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} which made it "a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text".{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} The sutra speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} One of those statements is:
{{quote|Even though he has said that all phenomena [dharmas] are devoid of the Self, it is not that they are completely/ truly devoid of the Self. What is this Self ? Any phenomenon [dharma] that is true [satya], real [tattva], eternal [nitya], sovereign/ autonomous/ self-governing [aisvarya], and whose ground/ foundation is unchanging [asraya-aviparinama], is termed ’the Self ’ [atman].{{sfn|Yamamoto|Page|2007|p=32}}}}

In the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' the Buddha also speaks of the "affirmative attributes" of nirvana, "the Eternal, Bliss, the Self and the Pure."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Kosho Yamamoto, ''Mahayanism: A Critical Exposition of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra'', Karinbunko, Ube City, Japan, 1975, pp. 141, 142&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' explains:
{{quote|The Self ’ signifies the Buddha; ’the Eternal’ signifies the Dharmakaya; ’Bliss’ signifies Nirvana, and ’the Pure’ signifies Dharma.{{sfn|Yamamoto|Page|2007|p=29}}}}

Edward Conze connotatively links the term ''tathagata'' itself (the designation which the Buddha applied to himself) with the notion of a real, true self:
{{quote|Just as ''tathata'' designates true reality in general, so the word which developed into ''Tathagata'' designated the true self, the true reality within man.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Conze, ''The Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines'', Sri Satguru Publications, Delhi, 1994, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is possible, states Johannes Bronkhorst, that "original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul [Ātman, Attan]", even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied it existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AZbZDP8MRJoC|year=1993|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1114-0 |pages=99 with footnote 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, adds Bronkhorst, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst25/&gt; This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as "the principal means to achieving liberation".&lt;ref name=bronkhorst25&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Self" as a teaching method===
According to Paul Wiliams, the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' uses the term "Self" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics. He quotes from the sutra:{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=100}}
{{quote|The Buddha-nature is in fact not the self. For the sake of [guiding] sentient beings, I describe it as the self.&lt;ref name="Youru Wang 2003, page 58"&gt;Youru Wang, ''Linguistic Strategies in Daoist Zhuangzi and Chan Buddhism: The Other Way of Speaking.'' Routledge, 2003, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the later ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Lankāvatāra Sūtra]]'' it is said that the ''tathāgatagarbha'' might be mistaken for a self, which it is not.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ratnagotravibhāga ===
The ''[[Ratnagotravibhāga (text)|Ratnagotravibhāga]]'' (also known as ''Uttaratantra''), another text composed in the first half of 1st millennium CE and translated into Chinese in 511 CE, points out that the teaching of the ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine is intended to win sentient beings over to abandoning "self-love" (''atma-sneha'') – considered to be one of the defects by Buddhism.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=109-112}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Christopher Bartley|title= An Introduction to Indian Philosophy: Hindu and Buddhist Ideas from Original Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c3D5CQAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic|isbn= 978-1-4725-2437-9|pages= 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 6th-century Chinese ''Tathagatagarbha'' translation states that "Buddha has ''shiwo'' (True Self) which is beyond being and nonbeing".{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=102}} However, the ''Ratnagotravibhāga'' asserts that the "Self" implied in ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine is actually "not-Self".{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=112}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. K. Hookham|title=The Buddha Within: Tathagatagarbha Doctrine According to the Shentong Interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqLa4xWot-YC&amp;pg=PA96|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0357-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current disputes ==
The dispute about "self" and "not-self" doctrines has continued throughout the history of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkXJVKnjw3kC|title=Nibbāna as True Reality beyond the Debate|author=Potprecha Cholvijarn|publisher=Wat Luang Phor Sodh|isbn=978-974-350-263-7|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Thai Theravada Buddhism, for example, states [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]], some modern-era Buddhist scholars have claimed that "nirvana is indeed the true Self", while other Thai Buddhists disagree.{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=125–7}}

For instance, the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of ''anatta'' (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the "true self" or ''[[Dharmakaya|dhammakaya]]''.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=100–5, 110}} The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is [[Atman (Buddhism)|atta]], or true self, was criticized as heretical in Buddhism in 1994 by [[Prayudh Payutto|Ven. Payutto]], a well-known scholar monk, who stated that 'Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self".{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=51}}{{Sfn|Williams|2008|p=127-128}} The abbot of one major temple in the Dhammakaya Movement, Luang Por Sermchai of [[Dhammakaya Movement#Wat Luang Phor Sodh Dhammakayaram|Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram]], argues that it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute non-self, rather than Buddhist meditation practitioners. He points to the experiences of prominent forest hermit monks to support the notion of a "true self".{{Sfn|Williams|2008|p=127-128}} Similar interpretations on the "true self" were put forth earlier by the 12th [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]] in 1939. According to Williams, the Supreme Patriarch's interpretation echoes the ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tathāgatagarbha]]'' sutras.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}}

Several notable teachers of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] have also described ideas in contrast to absolute non-self. [[Ajahn Maha Bua]], a well known meditation master, described the [[Citta|citta (mind)]] as being an indestructible reality that does not fall under ''anattā.''&lt;ref&gt;pp. 101–103 Maha Boowa, Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: the Path to Arahantship&amp;nbsp;– A Compilation of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa’s Dhamma Talks about His Path of Practice, translated by Bhikkhu Silaratano, 2005, http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327073822/http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }} (consulted 16 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that not-self is merely a perception that is used to pry one away from infatuation with the concept of a self, and that once this infatuation is gone the idea of not-self must be dropped as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=UWE STOES|title=Thanassaro Bhikkhu|date=2015-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S40nS_0R9Y&amp;t=4545s|accessdate=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; American monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] of the Thai Forest Tradition describes the Buddha's statements on non-self as a path to awakening rather than a universal truth.&lt;ref name="Selves"&gt;"Selves &amp; Not-self: The Buddhist Teaching on Anatta", by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 30 November 2013, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204143026/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html |date=2013-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanissaro Bhikkhu states that the Buddha intentionally set the question of whether or not there is a self aside as a useless question, and that clinging to the idea that there is no self at all would actually ''prevent'' enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/there-no-self/|title="There is no self."|last=Bhikkhu|first=Thanissaro|work=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819114904/https://tricycle.org/magazine/there-no-self/|archive-date=2018-08-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars Alexander Wynne and Rupert Gethin also take a similar position as Thanissaro Bhikkhu, arguing that the Buddha's description of non-self in the five aggregates does not necessarily mean there is no self, stating that the five aggregates are not descriptions of a human being but phenomena for one to observe. Wynne argues that the Buddha's statements on anattā are a "not-self" teaching rather than a "no-self" teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynne|first=Alexander|date=2009|title=Early Evidence for the ‘no self’ doctrine?|url=http://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/awynne2009atijbs.pdf|journal=Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies|volume=|pages=63–64|access-date=2017-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602145336/http://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/awynne2009atijbs.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanissaro Bhikkhu points to the Ananda Sutta, where the Buddha [[The unanswered questions|stays silent]] when asked whether there is a 'self' or not,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.010.than.html|title=Ananda Sutta: To Ananda|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510092025/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.010.than.html|archive-date=2017-05-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a major cause of the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.intro.than.html|title=Introduction to the Avyakata Samyutta: (Undeclared-connected)|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508212946/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.intro.than.html|archive-date=2017-05-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, this dispute on the nature of teachings about 'self' and 'non-self' in Buddhism has led to arrest warrants, attacks and threats.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=51–2}}
