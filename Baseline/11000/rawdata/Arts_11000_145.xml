'''Adriaen van de Velde''' (bapt. 30 November 1636, [[Amsterdam]]{{snd}}bur. 21 January 1672, Amsterdam), was a Dutch animal and [[Landscape art|landscape painter]], son of [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and brother of [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]], the marine painter.

==Life==
Adriaen did not want to become a marine painter so he was trained in the studio of [[Jan Wynants]], the landscape painter. There he made the acquaintance of [[Philip Wouwerman]], who is believed to have aided him in his studies of animals, and to have exercised a powerful and beneficial influence upon his art. Having made exceptionally rapid progress, he was soon employed by his master to introduce figures into his landscape compositions, and he rendered a similar service to [[Meindert Hobbema|Hobbema]], [[Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael|Ruisdael]], [[Adriaen Hendriksz Verboom|Verboom]] and other contemporary artists.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
According to Houbraken, he died while in collaboration with [[Jan van der Heyden]] and [[Frederik de Moucheron]], painting animals on their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Link language|nl}}&lt;!--Middle Dutch--&gt; [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0348.htm Adriaan vanden Velde biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Adriaen van de Velde - Agony in the Garden - WGA24475.jpg|thumb|268px|left|Agony in the Garden]]
His favourite subjects were scenes of open pasture land, with sheep, cattle and goats, which he executed with dexterity, with much precision of touch and truth of draughtsmanship, and with clear silvery colouring. He painted a few small winter scenes with skaters, and several religious subjects, such as the ''Descent from the Cross'', for a [[Roman Catholic]] [[schuilkerk|hidden church]] in Amsterdam{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and ''The Migration of Jacob'' (1663, [[Wallace Collection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=64955 | title =Adriaen van de Velde (1636 - 1672), ''The Migration of Jacob'' | last = | first = | date =9 October 2016 | website =Wallace Collection | publisher = | access-date =9 October 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In addition to his paintings, of which nearly two hundred have been catalogued, he executed about twenty [[etching]]s, several of which appear from their dates to have been done in his fourteenth year. They are distinguished by directness of method and by delicacy and certainty of touch. Van de Velde lived in [[Kalverstraat]], near the [[Regulierspoort]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was signed to [[El-P]]'s [[Definitive Jux]] label until it went on hiatus in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/37778-definitive-jux-goes-on-hiatus/|title=Definitive Jux Goes "On Hiatus"|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=February 3, 2010|website=pitchfork.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; betterPropaganda ranked him at number 19 at the ''Top 100 Artists of the Decade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://betterpropaganda.com/content.aspx?id=990|title=Top 100 Artists of the Decade|last=Taylor-Parker|first=Phillip|date=|work=|publisher=''betterPropaganda''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106084109/http://betterpropaganda.com/content.aspx?id=990|archive-date=January 6, 2010|via=|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the groups [[The Weathermen (hip hop group)|The Weathermen]], [[Hail Mary Mallon]] (with [[Rob Sonic]] &amp; DJ Big Wiz), [[The Uncluded]] (with [[Kimya Dawson]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and Two of Every Animal (with [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhymesayers.com/hailmarymallon|title=Hail Mary Mallon|last=|first=|date=|website=rhymesayers.com|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his name, he said: "I acquired the name Aesop from a movie I had acted in with some friends. It was my character's name and it sort of stuck. The rock part came later just from throwing it in rhymes."&lt;ref name="mvremix1"&gt;[http://www.mvremix.com/urban/interviews/aesoprock.shtml Aesop Rock Interview with MVRemix Urban | US and Canadian Underground Hip Hop and Soul&amp;nbsp;– exclusive interviews, reviews, articles].

==Early life and education==

===Early and personal life===
Bavitz was born at Syosset Hospital in [[Syosset, New York]] and raised in [[Northport, New York|Northport]], [[Long Island]], New York to his father Paul and mother Jameija.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Aesop Rock&amp;nbsp;– One of Four (Thank You) | work = | publisher= SongMeanings.com| url = http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858559450/ | accessdate = December 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian has two brothers: Christopher T. Bavitz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10055/Bavitz|title=Christopher T. Bavitz {{!}} Harvard Law School|last=School|first=Harvard Law|website=hls.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1973), a clinical professor at [[Harvard Law School]] and director of Cyberlaw Clinic at the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]], and Graham J. Bavitz (born 1978). Ian, along with his siblings, was raised [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] but later on in his life became agnostic.&lt;ref name="MVRemix"&gt;{{cite news | last =Doe| first =John| title = Aesop Rock: Laundry Days | work =Unknown | publisher= MVRemix.com| url = http://www.mvremix.com/urban/interviews/aesop_rock_06.shtml | accessdate = February 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bavitz attended [[Northport High School]] in 1990 and graduated in 1994. He married Allyson Baker, guitarist and vocalist of rock band [[Dirty Ghosts]] in 2005. They resided in San Francisco but have since divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stickymagazine.com/features/interviews/736-dirty-ghosts |title=Talking Dirty: An Interview with Allyson Baker of Dirty Ghosts |author=Chad Hutchings |work=googleusercontent.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114185010/http://stickymagazine.com/features/interviews/736-dirty-ghosts |archivedate=November 14, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has [[tattoos]] on each forearm. His left arm reads "Must Not Sleep..." and the right says "...Must Warn Others." These are inspired by childhood antics where he and his friends would act as robots arms outstretched quoting the line which has its origins in the 1956 film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''. Aesop Rock has used these quotes as lyrics in the chorus of his song "Commencement at the Obedience Academy": "Must not sleep; must warn others / Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers." He also used them in his song "Antisocial," in the line "Must not sleep; must warn others / I'll tourniquet your turbulence then trample on your stutters."

===1994–1998: College===
After graduating from high school, Bavitz attended [[Boston University]] in [[Massachusetts]] where he studied [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name=firsttime&gt;{{cite web|date=May 27, 2015|title=My First Time: Aesop Rock Remembers 1996|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2015/05/my-first-time-aesop-rock-remembers-1996/|publisher=Pigeons &amp; Planes|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acquired his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|bachelor's]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110117211713/http://www-test.bu.edu/alumni/informed/famous/arts/ Retrieved February 24, 2011]. Test.bu.edu. Retrieved on November 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He met his future collaborator, [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]], in 1994 during the latter's only year at the school. After hearing Aesop Rock freestyle, Blockhead decided to forgo his own dreams of rapping in favor of focusing on production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/blockhead/id5609495|title=iTunes - Music - Blockhead|work=apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockhead was involved with a crew in New York called The Overground that included [[Dub-L]].&lt;ref name="Splendid Zine Interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Walt |title=Love / Hate: Aesop Rock |work=Online Magazine |publisher=Splendid |url=http://www.splendidezine.com/features/aesop/ |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213203756/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/aesop/ |archivedate=December 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his early adulthood, Aesop Rock held various odd jobs including positions answering phones for clothing catalogs, packaging artwork in [[art gallery]] storerooms and working for one-hour [[Photographic processing|photo developers]].&lt;ref name=firsttime /&gt;

==Musical career==

===1985–2001: New York City underground music scene===
As a youth, Bavitz and his family would usually [[Commuting|commute]] to New York City. This had a great impact on him and the way he viewed the [[hip hop culture]]. Bavitz began rapping in the early 1990s. He cites [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Boogie Down Productions|BDP]], [[KMD]], and [[Run DMC]] as early influences.&lt;ref name="mvremix1"/&gt; Bavitz also listened to rock acts such as [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Fugazi]], and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]; he was introduced to these groups by his older brother Chris.&lt;ref name="The Metabunker"&gt;{{cite web|title={{sic|Sie|ze|hide=y}} the Moment! Interview&amp;nbsp;– Part II |url=http://www.metabunker.dk/?p=300 |publisher=The Metabunker |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205231218/http://www.metabunker.dk/?p=300 |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bavitz started to play instruments such as the piano and bass at an early age. He then eventually acquired a [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title={{sic|Sie|ze|hide=y}} the Moment! Interview |url=http://www.metabunker.dk/?p=295 |publisher=The Metabunker |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131162331/http://www.metabunker.dk/?p=295 |archivedate=January 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While attending college, Bavitz initially recorded and released two self-financed efforts, ''[[Music for Earthworms]]'' (1997), a full-length featuring [[underground hip hop|underground]] artist [[Percee P]] on two tracks. Bavitz also released a music video to "Abandon All Hope", which was one of the tracks on the CD. The album sold over 300 copies,&lt;ref name="The Metabunker"/&gt; largely from a grassroots internet-based promotion at his website AesopRock.com and then-popular web portal, MP3.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ootbot.com/archives/aesoprock/wormyhole/ AesopRock.com]. Retrieved on January 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; With the money he made from his previous release, he then released his ''[[Appleseed (EP)|Appleseed]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1999 which received critical acclaim in the underground hip-hop circuit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} His early records were mostly produced by a long-time friend [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]], and underground producer [[Dub-L]].

After his breakthrough success in the underground hip hop and indie rap community, he was eventually noticed by the [[Mush (record label)|Mush]] label and obtained his first [[record deal]] in 1999, just a year after he graduated from college. Aesop released his first major album, ''[[Float (Aesop Rock album)|Float]]'' (2000), with guest appearances from [[Vast Aire]], [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]], and [[Dose One]]. Production was split between [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]] and Aesop himself, with one track by Omega One. During this time, Aesop worked at a photography [[Contemporary art gallery|gallery]].&lt;ref name="AesopRockInterview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaplunk |first=Sumo |title=AES Interview |work=U.K. Hip-Hop |publisher=UKHH |url=http://www.mushrecords.com/articles/AesopRockUKHipHopProfile1.htm |date=August 15, 2000 |accessdate=December 21, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001 tragedy struck when Bavitz had a [[nervous breakdown]]. The song "One of Four" on his ''Daylight'' EP documents his struggles.&lt;ref name="mrcomplex"&gt;{{cite news | last =Werde| first =Bill| title = Mr. Complex | work =[[Urb Magazine|URB]] | publisher= URB| url = http://www.mushrecords.com/articles/AesopRockUrbMrComplex.html | accessdate = May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001–2004: ''Labor Days'', ''Daylight'' EP, ''Bazooka Tooth''===
Shortly after releasing ''Float'', Aesop Rock signed to [[Manhattan]]-based label [[Definitive Jux]] (commonly shortened to Def Jux), where he released ''[[Labor Days]]'' (2001), an album dedicated to the discussion of labor in American society and the concept of [[wage slavery|"wage slaves"]]. This album was most well known for its single "Daylight".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Because of its popularity, ''[[Daylight (Aesop Rock album)|Daylight]]'' was re-released in 2002 as a seven-track EP, including an "alternative" new version of the song "Night Light", whose paraphrased lyrics simultaneously refer back to, and stand in stark opposition to, the original's. The song "Labor" (from ''Labor Days'') was featured in ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4]]''; it also was the first album in his catalog to break through the ''Billboard'' charts, peaking at number 15 at the [[Billboard Top Independent Albums#Top Independent Albums|United States Independent Charts]].
[[Image:Aesop Rock live.jpg|220px|thumb|Aesop Rock performing live]]

''Labor Days'' was followed by ''[[Bazooka Tooth]]'' in 2003. For the first time, production was mostly handled by Rock himself, with three tracks from longtime collaborator [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]] and one from close friend and Definitive Jux label CEO El-P. Guest appearances include [[Party Fun Action Committee]], El-P, and [[Mr. Lif]] (all Definitive Jux labelmates) and [[Camp Lo]]. With this release Aesop hit a higher level of recognition, releasing "No Jumper Cables" as a single and music video, then another single, "Freeze", shortly after. A remix of "No Jumper Cables" was featured on ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground 2]]'', furthering Aesop's recognition. In 2004, he released ''[[Build Your Own Bazooka Tooth]]'' and created a contest in which you had to create a remix of an Aesop Rock song using the cappellas and instrumentals.

===2005–2007: ''Fast Cars'' EP, ''None Shall Pass'', Nike+iPod ===
In February 2005, Aesop Rock released a new EP, ''[[Fast Cars, Danger, Fire and Knives]]''. The first pressing of the EP included an 88-page booklet with lyrics from every release from ''Float'' until this EP (the lyric booklet is titled ''The Living Human Curiosity Sideshow''); later pressings of the album come without the booklet, but with an additional bonus track, "Facemelter". In addition, a limited number of albums were available direct from Def Jux with Aesop Rock's [[graffiti]] tag on them. In response to demands from his fans, Rock did less production on the EP: three songs are produced by Blockhead, three produced by Aesop, and one by [[Rob Sonic]]. During this time he was asked to join [[The Weathermen (hip-hop group)|The Weathermen]] to replace [[Vast Aire]].

Aesop Rock was commissioned to create a 45-minute instrumental track for the [[Nike+iPod]] running system, entitled ''All Day''. It was released in February 2007. Distributed via the [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]] and featuring his wife Allyson Baker on guitar and [[turntablism|scratches]] from DJ Big Wiz, Aesop has described the release as "something that evolved enough that the sound was constantly fresh and attractive, as though the runner were moving through a set of differing cities or landscapes."&lt;ref name="Podophile"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://podophile.com/2007/02/11/nike-aesop-rock-new-original-run-mix-this-tuesday/ | title = Nike+ Aesop Rock: New "Original Run" Mix This Tuesday | publisher = Podophile.com | date = February 11, 2007 | accessdate = March 21, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070312162411/http://podophile.com/2007/02/11/nike-aesop-rock-new-original-run-mix-this-tuesday/| archivedate= March 12, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''All Day'' was followed in August of the same year by Bavitz's fifth full-length album, ''[[None Shall Pass]]'' released in 2007. The album also contained original artwork by [[Jeremy Fish]]. About Jeremy Fish, Aesop Rock said: "Man that guy is my hero. We have a friend in common who hit me up a while back saying that this guy Jeremy Fish had an opportunity to pitch a cartoon to Disney and wanted me to be involved in the music side. I flipped out cuz I was also a fan of his, and owned some of his work." Aesop Rock also teamed up with Jeremy Fish again in a project called Ghosts of the Barbary Coast. Aesop Rock made a song called "Tomorrow Morning", to go along with a slideshow of drawings that Jeremy Fish drew. This was displayed in San Francisco, but was also made available for download online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fecalface.com/SF/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=213&amp;Itemid=100 Aesop Rock Interview].

===2007–2011: Hiatus===
In February 2010, El-P announced that the label would be put "on hiatus," aside from selling its catalog and merchandise. During this time Bavitz was absent in terms of making any new albums or EPs, albeit being featured on other artist records and producing.

===2008–2013: Rhymesayers, HMM, Kimya Dawson, ''Skelethon''===
In 2009, Bavitz produced [[Felt (hip hop)|Felt's]] third album, ''[[Felt 3: A Tribute to Rosie Perez]]''.

April 20, 2011: it was announced that [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]] would release [[Hail Mary Mallon]]'s debut album ''Are You Going To Eat That?''. A music video for their first single off the album ''Smock'' was announced that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

November 2011: Bavitz announced via [[Reddit]] that he is working on his next solo album, and has a majority of it complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I am Aesop Rock, [Ask Me Anything]|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/m3133/iama_aesop_rock_ama/c2xoq0s?context=3|publisher=Reddit|accessdate= November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 2011: Aesop Rock was first reported to be working on an album with [[anti-folk]] singer [[Kimya Dawson]], famous for being one half of the group [[The Moldy Peaches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=@AesopRockWins|url=https://twitter.com/AesopRockWins/status/114265888332595203|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[working title]] for the project is called ''Hokey Fright''.

January 17, 2012: it was reported that Aesop Rock finished recording his upcoming solo album ''[[Skelethon]]'', and it was scheduled to be released July 10, 2012 through Rhymesayers Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aesop Rock Preps New LP|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/news/45139-aesop-rock-preps-new-lp-skelethon/|publisher=Pitchfork|accessdate= January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Aesop Rock scored his first film soundtrack for [[Bushwick (film)|Bushwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aesop-rock-bushwick-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/|title=Aesop Rock: Bushwick (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaborative album with electronic musician [[Tobacco (musician)|Tobacco]] entitled ''Malibu Ken'' is scheduled to be released in January 2019.

==Lyrics==
Bavitz's lyrics are generally seen as being both complex and abstract while others dismiss them as [[verbosity|verbose]]. His frequent use of [[homonym]]s exacerbates this. Critics state that the use of words can be so detailed that it becomes difficult to determine their originally intended meaning.&lt;ref name="louispattison"&gt;{{cite news | last =Pattison | first =Louis | title = Aesop Rock's well-chosen words paint dense, fascinating pictures | work =[[BBC]] | publisher= BBC | date =August 1, 2007 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/wvxm/ | accessdate = October 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics are sometimes inspired by events which have occurred in Bavitz's personal life and are thus naturally prone to subjective interpretation by outsiders.&lt;ref name="kimedward"&gt;{{cite news

Questioned about his lyrical style in an interview, Bavitz responded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It’s probably because it’s not the most accessible music in the world. It may pose a slight challenge to the listener beyond your average pop song. I'm no genius by a long shot, but these songs are not nonsensical, that's pretty preposterous. I'd have to be a genius to pull this many nonsensical records over people's eyes. It's not exactly fast food but when people pretend I'm just spewing non-sequiturs and gibberish I can’t help but think they simply haven’t listened and are regurgitating some rumor they’ve heard about me. Even if it's not laid out in perfect sentences—is any rap?—you’d have to be an idiot to not at least grasp a few things from these songs. Or have had no interest in pulling anything from them in the first place."&lt;ref name="guernicaarticle"&gt;{{cite news |last=DiPalo |first=Joseph |title=Graffiti or Vermeer |work=[[Guernica Magazine|Guernica]] |publisher=Guernica |date=September 2007 |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/397/graffiti_or_vermeer/ |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205045610/http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/397/graffiti_or_vermeer/ |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2002 on the song "One of Four" (a hidden track on the ''[[Daylight (Aesop Rock album)|Daylight]]'' EP) Aesop Rock explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But I can tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it / so take this how you want but know I mean it."&lt;br /&gt;
— Aesop Rock, "One of Four" ''[[Daylight (Aesop Rock album)|Daylight]]'' EP (2002)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 2014, a study by Matt Daniels found that Aesop Rock's vocabulary in his music surpassed 85 other major hip-hop and rap artists, as well as Shakespeare's works and Herman Melville's Moby Dick, being named the largest vocabulary in Hip Hop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poly-graph.co/vocabulary.html|title=Rappers, sorted by the size of their vocabulary|last=Daniels|first=Matt|date=|website=|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An updated, to-scale view of this study was subsequently done by Mike Pultz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop (Adjusted)|url=http://mikepultz.com/number-of-unique-words-used-within-artists-first-35000-lyrics-adjusted/|publisher=Mike Pultz|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build up his vocabulary, he reads a lot of news and science articles and writes down all the words he finds interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simmons|first1=Jon|title=Interview: Aesop Rock|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-aesop-rock/|website=Sound of Boston|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angela de la Cruz''' (born 1965) is a Spanish artist.  She was nominated for the [[Turner Prize]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/supermarket-singer-on-the-turner-prize-shortlist-1961813.html "Supermarket singer on the Turner Prize Shortlist", The Independent, 4 May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/may/04/turner-prize-shortlist-2010 Turner prize 2010: a shortlist that is half-baked], The Guardian, 4 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/7675996/Supermarket-singer-on-Turner-Prize-shortlist.html "Supermarket singer on Turner Prize shortlist", The Telegraph, 4 May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
De la Cruz was born in [[A Coruña]].  She studied philosophy at the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]], before moving to [[London]] in 1987, where she studied art at the [[Chelsea College of Art]], [[Goldsmiths College]] and [[Slade School of Art]] ([[University College, London]]).  She lives and works in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lissongallery.com/#/artists/angela-de-la-cruz/cv/ CV] from [[Lisson Gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annaschwartzgallery.com/sitebuilder/works/artists/3/de_la_cruz,_angela_cv_2009.pdf CV] from Anna Schwartz Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 she suffered from  a [[brain haemorrhage]] and felt in a [[coma]].&lt;ref name="death"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/apr/05/angela-de-la-cruz Angela de la Cruz's brush with death, The Guardian, 5 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Angelita was born in 2006. De la Cruz is now a [[wheelchair user]] and continues working with assistants through a delegated work, although this method of practice was used by her before the stroke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/a_life_in_the_day/article1356644.ece A Life in the Day. Angela de la Cruz. Sunday Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
While studying at the Slade School of Art ([[University College London]]), she removed the [[stretcher bar|stretcher]] of a painted [[canvas]]. De la Cruz was inspired by the resulting saggy painting, and she has become best known for paintings which are deliberately broken or distorted.  In her words:  "One day I took the cross bar out and the painting bent. From that moment on, I looked at the painting as an object."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camdenartscentre.org/exhibitions/?id=100800 Angela de la Cruz - After, Camden Arts Centre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410235448/http://www.camdenartscentre.org/exhibitions/?id=100800 |date=April 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her work, treating paintings as a three-dimensional object rather than a two-dimensional representation, follows a tradition that includes the [[spatialism]] of [[Lucio Fontana]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/angela-de-la-cruz-after-camden-arts-centre-london-1941110.html Angela de la Cruz: After, Camden Arts Centre, London, The Independent, 11 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 1995 work "Ashamed" is a small straw-yellow painting, broken in half, which is exhibited wedged into a corner between two gallery walls.  The similar 1996 work "Homeless", a much larger canvas of similar pale yellow hue, has its frame broken in two and folded, and is exhibited lurking in a corner, standing on the gallery floor.  [[Waldemar Januszczak]] has described both as "urine coloured".&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article7097467.ece Angela De La Cruz peels back perception, The Times, 18 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; "Self" (1997) comprises two brown paintings: one draped over a chair facing another hung conventionally on the wall.  "Ready to Wear" (1997–2003) is series of red canvases, part-ripped from its frame, as if the painting were getting dressed.  "Nothing" (1998–2005) is a series of black canvases, crumpled into a heap and abandoned on the gallery floor, resembling a discarded black plastic bag.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;  Some works since 2000 have incorporated objects, such as chairs, tables or wardrobes, sometimes adorned with broken canvases.  Her "Clutter" series (2003-5) bring together collections of waste art materials.  Her "Deflated" paintings (2009-) hang forlornly from a hook, with no frame.  "Flat" (2009) comprises a plastic and metal chair which has collapsed onto the floor.&lt;ref name="camden"&gt;[http://www.camdenartscentre.org/file-uploads/File/50-de-la-cruz-final-proof-220310.pdf File Note #50 - Angela de la Cruz - After, Camden Arts Centre, April–May 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205203520/http://www.camdenartscentre.org/file-uploads/File/50-de-la-cruz-final-proof-220310.pdf |date=December 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was commissioned to paint "Larger Than Life" in 1998 for the ballroom at the [[Royal Festival Hall]].&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

She exhibited at [[Manifesta|Manifesta 5]] at [[San Sebastián]] in 2004.  Her first solo exhibition in the UK, entitled "After", was held at [[Camden Arts Centre]] in April and May 2010.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2010/apr/06/angela-de-la-cruz-art?picture=361180877 Angela de la Cruz's deadly art goes on show, The Guardian] - works from "After"&lt;/ref&gt;  She was nominated for the [[Turner Prize]] for this show in 2010.

In recent years de la Cruz has also used aluminium as a base material for her work. The metal is welded into shape, then crushed, beaten and distorted.

[[Image:Star Wars in Tunisia.jpg|thumb|200px|''Star Wars'' filming location in Tunisia]]
'''Architecture in ''Star Wars''''' includes the cities, buildings, ships, and other structures of the fictional ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] as described and depicted in books, movies, comics, and cartoons. ''[[Architects Journal]]'' ranked the top 10, including the [[Death Star]] and the [[Jedi Temple]].&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;James Pallister [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=5203477 Top 10: The Architecture of Star Wars (pt II)]
15 June 2009 Architects Journal (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the urban and natural environments pictured in ''Star Wars'', Mark Lamster wrote that the cities are places of danger and corruption, while the forces of good find sanctuary in the natural world.&lt;ref name="ambivalent"&gt;Mark Lamster "Evil foes build ever-more-elaborate urban monstrosities- machines not for living but killing, and killing on a grand scale" [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC&amp;pg=PA234 Architecture and film] Star Wars and the City page 6&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes the "retro-[[futurist]]" cities in the series as being in between those extremes and places  of "great beauty but dubious moral character." He attributes the ambivalence towards urbanity to series creator [[George Lucas]]' own feelings about cities and urban environments.&lt;ref name="ambivalent"/&gt;
 
The settings of the movie have generally been praised, but one author took exception to the "anachronistic period architecture and statuary" of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'', saying it improperly associated [[third world]] buildings with conceptions of innocence and the primitive in a way that was discriminatory and demeaning.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;

==Planet settings==
[[Luke Skywalker]] is first seen in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' living with his adoptive parents in a "complex of caves and domed structures" on [[Tatooine]], filmed in the [[Tunisia]]n desert town of [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]].&lt;ref name="hives"&gt;Mark Lamster [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=star+wars+architecture#v=onepage&amp;q=star%20wars%20architecture&amp;f=false Architecture and film] Wretched Hives: George Lucas and the Ambivalent Architecture of Star Wars page 234&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the first movie was shot in the [[Guatemala]]n [[rain forest]] where a celebration with rebel allies takes place in a caved area (a scene said to be borrowed from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s 1935 [[Nazi]] [[propaganda film]] ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;). The exotic locales provide scenery that is unfamiliar to "all but a few experts in non-western architecture", providing the films with fantastic settings that could still be believable.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;

==Urban planning==
Three architecture and planning students noted that the "latest" (1999) ''Star Wars'' movie ''(The Phantom Menace)'' offered "a variety of urban development options" in a ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' story headlined "How would you like to live on a Star Wars' world?"&lt;ref name="cosmic"&gt;Roger M. Showley "The latest "Star Wars" movie offers a variety of urban development options according to three architecture and planning students who previewed the film; from left, [Tim Belzman], San Diego State University; Bruce Fallown, Newschool of Architecture; and [David Sin], Woodbury University School of Architecture." [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/74622433.html?dids=74622433:74622433&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+30%2C+1999&amp;author=Roger+M.+Showley&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=Cosmic+communities+%7C+How+would+you+like+to+live+on+a+%60Star+Wars'+world%3F&amp;pqatl=google Cosmic communities]; How would you like to live on a `Star Wars' world? May 30, 1999 page H.1 San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; The article included illustrations of [[Coruscant]] ("completely covered by development" and "surrounded by mile-high skyscrapers"), including views from the [[Jedi]] Council building, and the city of ''Theed'' (inspired by [[Palace of Caserta|an 18th-century palace]] near [[Naples|Naples, Italy]]).&lt;ref name="cosmic"/&gt; On Coruscant, "development extends miles below the surface of the city and up into the clouds."&lt;ref name="cosmic"/&gt;

The "urban future" has also been depicted in ''[[Blade Runner]]'' where "the setting is a grimy, crime-ridden [[Los Angeles]] in the 21st century".&lt;ref name="cosmic"/&gt; The architecture of ''Star Wars'' may also have been influenced by [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt; The designs continued Lucas' work from his first feature film, ''[[THX 1138]]'', which featured a [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], [[George Orwell|Orwellian]] "subteranean world of black-and-white spaces" where the population is subdued with drugs and kept under constant surveillance.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;

===Jedi Temple===
''[[Architects' Journal]]'' rated the '''Jedi Temple''' (located in the capital planet of ''[[Coruscant]]'') third on its top-ten architecture of ''Star Wars'' list behind the second [[Death Star]] and [[Jabba the Hutt’s palace]] on [[Tatooine]], and ahead of Coruscant, capital city of the Old Republic.&lt;ref name="architecture" /&gt; The temple is described in the article as adapting "the robust typology of Mayan temples, with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength" and said to be a [[ziggurat]] that "is built above a Force-nexus and has ample room for training facilities, accommodation and the Jedi Archive."&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; The temple has five towers, the tallest is Tranquillity Spire, that are stylistically similar to the [[minaret]]s surrounding the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'' listed it as the one hundredth greatest thing about ''Star Wars'' in its one hundredth issue special.

==Ships==
The [[battle cruiser]]s featured in ''Star Wars'' have been described as examples of "[[Suprematist]] architecture".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ings [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17022875.500-falling-star.html Falling star] 21 April 2001 ''New Scientist''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real world buildings that mirror ''Star Wars''==
The [[San Francisco Federal Building]] designed by [[Thom Mayne]] has been compared to the [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawa]] [[Sandcrawler]] featured in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Glenn [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2007/04/architecture_im.html Architecture imitates art?] April 25, 2007 Boston Globe&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ING House|ING headquarters]] building (in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]) has been described as looking like something out of ''Star Wars'' that could "move forward on its legs".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jodidio [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5V7tVWdJsC&amp;pg=RA1-PT341&amp;dq=star+wars+architecture#v=onepage&amp;q=star%20wars%20architecture&amp;f=false Architecture now! ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, the [[Trinity College, Dublin]], [[Trinity College Library|Long Room]] Library is thought to be the basis for the [[Jedi]] Academy Library in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/ten/2002/1111/starwars.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231081314/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2002/1111/starwars.html |date=December 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiseek.com/ireland/news/2002/000238.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102090635/http://www.archiseek.com/ireland/news/2002/000238.htm |date=January 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brand Standard Identification Number (BSIN)''' is a 6-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://product.okfn.org/brand/ OKFN Brand Repository Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origins of BSIN come from the worldwide product repository of [[OKFN]]: To integrate a product, a brand must be assigned.
The [[OKFN]] project "Open Product Data" uses BSIN codes in its product repository.&lt;ref&gt;http://product-open-data.com&lt;/ref&gt;
Each brand of the [[OKFN]] brand repository is given a unique BSIN.
The first version of the brand repository has been launched on the 20th of December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://product.okfn.org/2013/12/20/brand-standard-identifier-number-bsin-open-product-data-working-group-launches-a-brand-repository/ Launch announcement ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The BSIN code is composed if 6 alphanumeric characters. letters are uppercase and '0' and 'O' are excluded to avoid confusions.
When a BSIN code is created, it can physically be destroyed or replaced. When it is deleted, its status becomes "deleted" and the reason of the deletion is always provided.
The objective is to ensure users of the reliability and the stability of the BSIN.

There are two types of brands: 
* manufacturer brand
* retailer brand

== Roadmap ==

The concept of "owner" will be used to gather brands belonging to big manufacturers such as Unilever, Pesico,... 
The second objective is to avoid confusion between the brand and the company belonging the brand. For example, The Coca-Cola company (owner) belongs Cola-Cola (brand), coca zero (brand),...

[[File:Josaphat.jpg|thumb|300px|A Christian depiction of Josaphat, 12th Century manuscript]]

'''Barlaam and Josaphat''' ({{lang-la|Barlamus et Iosaphatus}}) are legendary Christian martyrs and saints. Their life story may have been based on the life of the [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;John Walbridge ''The Wisdom of the Mystic East: Suhrawardī and Platonic Orientalism'' Page 129  – 2001 "The form Būdhīsaf is the original, as shown by Sogdian form Pwtysfi and the early New Persian form Bwdysf. ... On the Christian versions see A. S. Geden, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v. "Josaphat, Barlaam and," and M. P. Alfaric, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; It tells how an Indian king persecuted the Christian Church in his realm. When astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, the king imprisoned the young prince Josaphat, who nevertheless met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. After much tribulation the young prince's father accepted the Christian faith, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.&lt;ref name="catholic-forum.com"&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden329.htm The Golden Legend: The Story of Barlaam and Josaphat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216150745/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden329.htm |date=16 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale derives from a second to fourth century [[Sanskrit]] [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] text, via a [[Manichaean]] version, then the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Kitab Bilawhar wa-Yudasaf'' (Book of Bilawhar and Yudasaf), current in [[Baghdad]] in the eighth century, from where it entered into Middle Eastern Christian circles before appearing in European versions. The two were entered in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] calendar with a feast-day on [[August 26 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|26 August]],&lt;ref name=SYNAXARISTES&gt;Great [[Synaxarium|Synaxaristes]] {{gr icon}}: ''[http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/466/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Ὅσιος Ἰωάσαφ γιὸς τοῦ βασιλιὰ τῆς Ἰνδίας Ἄβενιρ].'' 26 Αυγούστου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Roman Martyrology]] in the Western Church as "Barlaam and Josaphat" on the date of 27 November.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1900"&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur Anthony |last=Macdonnel |authorlink=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |title=A History of Sanskrit Literature |year=1900 |pages=420 |publisher=D.

==Background: the Buddha==
[[File:Battistero di parma, portale sud 03 leggenda di barlaam.JPG|thumb|Depiction of Barlaam and Josaphat at the [[Baptistery of Parma]], Italy]]
The story of '''Barlaam and Josaphat''' or '''Joasaph''' is a [[Christianity|Christianized]] and later version of the story of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], who became the [[buddhahood|Buddha]].&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Barlaam and Josaphat}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages the two were treated as Christian saints, being entered in the [[Greek Orthodox]] calendar on [[August 26 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|26 August]],&lt;ref name="SYNAXARISTES"/&gt; and in the [[Roman Martyrology]] in the Western Church as "Barlaam and Josaphat" on the date of 27 November.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1900"/&gt; In the Slavic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, these two are commemorated on [[November 19 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|19 November]]  (corresponding to 2 December on the Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref name=PRAVOSLAVIE&gt;''[http://days.pravoslavie.ru/en/Days/20121119.htm November 19/December 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301081443/http://days.pravoslavie.ru/en/Days/20121119.htm |date=1 March 2014 }}.'' Orthodox Calendar (Pravoslavie.ru).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCA&gt;''[http://oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=103329 Venerable Joasaph the Prince of India].'' OCA – Feasts and Saints.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Christianized adaptation was the [[Georgian language|Georgian]] epic ''Balavariani'' dating back to the 10th century. A Georgian monk, [[Euthymius of Athos]], translated the story into [[Greek language|Greek]], some time before he was killed while visiting [[Constantinople]] in 1028 {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. There the Greek adaptation was translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] in 1048 and soon became well known in Western Europe as ''Barlaam and Josaphat''.&lt;ref&gt;William Cantwell Smith, "Towards a World Theology" (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek legend of "Barlaam and Ioasaph" is sometimes attributed to the 7th century [[John of Damascus]], but Conybeare argued it was transcribed by the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] monk [[Euthymius of Athos|Euthymius]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Conybeare, "The Barlaam and Josaphat Legend in the Ancient Georgian and Armenian Literatures" (Gorgias Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Barlaam and Josaphat was popular in the [[Middle Ages]], appearing in such works as the ''[[Golden Legend]]'', and a scene there involving three caskets eventually appeared, via [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s English translation of a Latin version, in [[Shakespeare]]'s "[[The Merchant of Venice]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sangharakshita, "From Genesis to the Diamond Sutra – A Western Buddhist's Encounters with Christianity" (Windhorse Publications, 2005), p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Middle High German]] versions were produced: one, the "Laubacher ''Barlaam''", by Bishop [[Otto II of Freising]] and another, ''Barlaam und Josaphat'', a [[Chivalric romance|romance]] in verse, by [[Rudolf von Ems]]. The latter was described as "perhaps the flower of religious literary creativity in the German Middle Ages" by [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Die Blüte der heiligen Dichtkunst im deutschen Mittelalter ist vielleicht »Barlaam und Josaphat«...''  See Heinrich Heine, [http://www.heinrich-heine.net/schule/schuled1.htm Die romantische Schule (Erstes Buch)]  at heinrich-heine.net. {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Josaphat was re-told as an exploration of [[free will]] and the seeking of inner peace through [[meditation]] in the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==The legend==
According to the legend, King Abenner or Avenier in India persecuted the Christian Church in his realm, [[St. Thomas Christians|founded by]] the [[Apostle Thomas]]. When astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, Abenner had the young prince Josaphat isolated from external contact. Despite the imprisonment, Josaphat met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. Josaphat kept his faith even in the face of his father's anger and persuasion. Eventually Abenner converted, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.&lt;ref name="catholic-forum.com"/&gt;

==Name==
Ioasaph (Georgian ''Iodasaph'', Arabic ''Yūdhasaf'' or ''Būdhasaf'') is derived from the Sanskrit ''[[Bodhisattva]]''.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1900"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Trainor (ed), "Buddhism" (Duncan Baird Publishers, 2001), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit word was changed to ''Bodisav'' in Persian texts in the 6th or 7th century, then to ''Budhasaf'' or ''Yudasaf'' in an 8th-century Arabic document (possibly Arabic initial "b" ﺑ changed to  "y" ﻳ by [[Arabic alphabet|duplication of a dot]] in handwriting).&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Choisnel Les Parthes et la Route de la soie 2004 Page 202 "Le nom de Josaphat dérive, tout comme son associé Barlaam dans la légende, du mot Bodhisattva. Le terme Bodhisattva passa d'abord en pehlevi, puis en arabe, où il devint Budasaf. Étant donné qu'en arabe le "b" et le "y" ne different que ..."&lt;/ref&gt; This became ''Iodasaph'' in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the 10th century, and that name was adapted as ''Ioasaph'' in Greece in the 11th century, and then was assimilated to ''[[Jehoshaphat|Iosaphat/Josaphat]]'' in Latin.&lt;ref name="D.M. Lang 1957"&gt;D.M. Lang, The Life of the Blessed Iodasaph: A New Oriental Christian Version of the Barlaam and Ioasaph Romance (Jerusalem, Greek Patriarchal Library: Georgian MS 140), BSOAS 20.1/3 (1957):&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feast day==
Although Barlaam and Josaphat were never formally [[canonized]], they were included in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology (feast day 27 November)&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Choisnel Les Parthes et la Route de la soie 2004 – Page 202 "Dans l'Église grecque orthodoxe, Saint Josaphat a été fêté le 26 août et, dans l'Église romaine, le 27 novembre a été la ... D. M. Lang, auteur du chapitre « Iran, Armenia and Georgia » dans la Cambridge History of Iran, estime pour sa part ..."&lt;/ref&gt; — though not in the [[Roman Missal]] — and in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] liturgical calendar (26 August in Greek tradition etc.&lt;ref name="SYNAXARISTES"/&gt; / 19 November in Russian tradition).&lt;ref name="PRAVOSLAVIE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCA"/&gt;

==Texts==
[[File:Barlaam and Josaphat. English lives of Buddha.djvu|page=9|thumb|180px|A page from the 1896 edition by Joseph Jacobs at the University of Toronto (Click on image to read the book)]]
There are a large number of different books in various languages, all dealing with the lives of Saints Barlaam and Josaphat in [[India]]. In this hagiographic tradition, the life and teachings of Josaphat have many parallels with those of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. "But not till the mid-nineteenth century was it recognised that, in Josaphat, the Buddha had been venerated as a Christian saint for about a thousand years."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674990388 Barlaam and Ioasaph, John Damascene, Loeb Classical Library 34, Introduction by David M. Lang ]&lt;/ref&gt; The authorship of the work is disputed. The origins of the story seem to be a Central Asian manuscript written in the [[Manichaean]] tradition. This book was translated into [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Arabic]].

===Greek manuscripts===
The best-known version in Europe comes from a separate, but not wholly independent, source, written in [[Greek language|Greek]], and, although anonymous, attributed to a monk named John. It was only considerably later that the tradition arose that this was [[John of Damascus]], but most scholars no longer accept this attribution. Instead much evidence points to [[Euthymius of Athos]], a Georgian who died in 1028.&lt;ref name=loeb&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674990388 Barlaam and Ioasaph, John Damascene], Loeb Classical Library 34, at LOEB CLASSICAL LIBRARY&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern edition of the Greek text, from the 160 surviving variant manuscripts (2006), with introduction (German, 2009) is published as Volume 6 of the works of John the Damascene by the monks of the [[Abbey of Scheyern]], edited by Robert Volk. It was included in the edition due to the traditional ascription, but marked "spuria" as the translator is the Georgian monk [[Euthymius the Hagiorite]] (ca. 955–1028) at [[Mount Athos]] and not John the Damascene of the [[monastery of Saint Sabas]] in the [[Judaean Desert]]. The 2009 introduction includes an overview&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-06-04.html Pieter W. van der Horst, Utrecht – Review of 2006/2009 Robert Volk edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===English manuscripts===
Among the manuscripts in English, two of the most important are the [[British Museum]] ''MS Egerton 876'' (the basis for Ikegami's book) and  ''MS Peterhouse 257'' (the basis for Hirsh's book) at the [[University of Cambridge]].
The book contains a tale similar to The Three Caskets found in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and later in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.&lt;ref name=loeb/&gt;

The '''Cairn of Barnenez''' (also: '''Barnenez Tumulus''', '''Barnenez Mound''' etc.; in [[Breton language|Breton]] ''Karn Barnenez''; in [[French language|French]]: ''Cairn de Barnenez'' or ''Tumulus de Barnenez'') is a [[Neolithic]] monument located near [[Plouezoc'h]], on the Kernéléhen peninsula in northern [[Finistère]], [[Brittany]] ([[France]]). It dates to the early [[Neolithic]], about 4800 BC; it is considered one of the earliest [[megaliths|megalithic monuments]] in [[Europe]], as well as one of the [[Oldest buildings in the world#By age|oldest man-made structures in the world]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/The-worlds-10-oldest-ruins/ruinsu-barnenez-c1/|title=The world's 10 oldest ruins|accessdate=2016-06-29 |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
along with the [[Tumulus of Bougon]] and [[Locmariaquer megaliths]], also located in Great West France. It is also remarkable for the presence of [[megalithic art]].

==History==
[[File:Detail Tumulus Barnenez.jpg|thumb|One of the chambers, exposed by 20th century quarrying.]]
[[File:Barnenez cairn.jpg|thumb|Artistic reconstruction of the cairn c. 4000 BC.]]

===Dates===
[[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]] dates indicate that the first phase of the monument was erected between 4850 and 4250 BC, and the second phase between 4450 and 4000 BC.

===Secondary use===
Pottery found in and around the monument indicates that it underwent a period of reuse in the [[Bronze Age]], in the 3rd millennium BC.

===Recognition as an ancient monument===
The cairn was first mapped in 1807, in the context of the [[Napoleon]]ic [[cadaster]]. Its first scientific recognition took place in the context of an academic congress in Morlaix in 1850, when it was classified as a [[tumulus]].

===Quarry damage===
Privately owned until the 1950s, the cairn was used as a [[quarry]] for paving stones. This activity, which threatened to destroy the monument, was only halted after the discovery of several of its chambers in the 1950s. The local community then took control of the site.

===Restoration and excavation===
The cairn was restored between 1954 and 1968. At the same time, vegetation was removed from the mound and systematic [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] took place in and around the monument.

==The monument==
[[File:Barnenez entrance.jpg|thumb|right|One of the passages.]]

===The mound===
[[File:Cairn de Barnenez.JPG|thumb|The Cairn of Barnenez]]
Today, the Barnenez cairn is 72 m long, up to 25 m wide and over 8 m high. It is built of 13,000 to 14,000 tons of stone. It contains 11 chambers entered by separate passages. The mound has steep facades and a [[stepped profile]]. Several internal walls either represent earlier facades or served the stability of the structure. The cairn consists of relatively small blocks of stone, with only the chambers being truly megalithic in character.
The monument overlooks the Bay of [[Morlaix]], probably a fertile coastal plain at the time of its erection.
[[File:Barnenez plan.JPG|thumb|left|275px|Simplified plan. Cairn 1 marked in yellow, Cairn 2 in green.]]

===Construction phases===
The monument is the result of at least two phases of building.

====Cairn 1, before 4500 BC====
In a first phase, a slightly trapezoidal mound of 32 m by 9 to 13 m was erected. It contained 5 chambers and was surrounded by a double kerb. The first phase favoured the use of [[dolerite]].

====Cairn 2, c. 4200 – c. 3900 BC====
In a second phase, an extension with six further chambers was added in the west. At the same time, Cairn 1 was enveloped in a wider and taller structure; its passages had to be extended. More [[granite]] was used in this phase.

===The chambers===

The 11 chambers of the Barnenez cairn are of the type known as ''[[Dolmen]] à couloir'' in French archaeological terminology. The term translates roughly as "[[passage grave]]". They are built of large slabs of [[slate]] and [[granite]]. Originally, all the chambers were entirely enclosed by the mound. The fact that several of them are partially exposed now is the result of modern quarrying.

Each of the 11 chambers is reached from the southeast via a long narrow passage (7–12 m long). They are arranged parallel to each other. Shapes and construction techniques differ slightly.
 
In nine cases, narrow passages lead to [[corbelling|corbelled]] chambers. Normally, the corbel vault rests on orthostats, in one chamber it actually sits on the ground, forming a true ''[[Beehive tomb|tholos]]''. The passages have slab-built or [[dry stone wall]]s and are covered with slabs. One of the chambers has a dry-stone vaulted ante-chamber.

[[File:Barnenez symbols.png|thumb|right|Examples of the carved symbols.]]

=== Logistics ===
One cubic metre of the Barnenez cairn contains 1,500&amp;nbsp;kg of stone. It is estimated that the quarrying, fashioning, transport and construction of such an amount represents about four work days for a single worker (assuming a 10-hour day). The original monument, Cairn 1, had a volume of about 2,000 cubic metres; it is built of 1,000 tons of granite and 3,000 tons of dolerite. It would thus have required 15,000 to 20,000 working days; in other words, it would have taken 200 workers three months to erect Cairn 1 alone. In its final form, the Barnenez mound is nearly three times as big as the first phase.

[[File:Dolmengöttin von Barnenez.jpg|thumb|left|Reproduction of the "Dolmen Goddess" of Barnenez.]]

===Engraved symbols===
Engraved symbols occur in several of the chambers and passages. They depict bows, axes, wave symbols or snakes and a repeated U-shaped sign. One of the carved slabs is in secondary use was originally part of a different structure, an interesting parallel to the situation in several other such monuments, including [[Gavrinis]]. 
The symbols on the engraved blocks resemble those found in other megalithic monuments in Brittany; in broader terms they belong to the cultural phenomenon described as [[megalithic art]]. One of the recurring symbols is sometimes interpreted as an [[anthropomorphic]] depiction (the so-called "Dolmen Goddess").

===Finds===

====Material from the original period of use====
Only Cairn 2, namely chambers A, C and D, contained [[Neolithic]] finds at the time of excavation. They included pottery, polished stone axes (of [[dolerite]]), [[flint]] blades and arrowheads.

====Bronze Age pottery====
Pottery shards found outside the monument indicate that it was reused in the [[Bronze Age]] (3rd millennium BC). A copper dagger and a barbed arrowhead are of [[Chalcolithic]] date.

==Comparable monuments==
Similar, possibly contemporary, monuments are known at 22 other locations in France and on [[Jersey]]. Breton examples are Larcuste-Colpo, Le Bono, Petit Mont, Ty-Floc´h, [[Gavrinis]], Île Carn, Ploudalmézeau and Guennoc (I´ile Gaignoc – sometimes spelt Guénioc) off the shore at [[Landéda]]. Those located on islands are generally better preserved. Chamber 3 B at Guennoc contains a small [[standing stone]] near the entrance.

==Exhibition==
An exhibition in the modern entrance building explains the results of scientific excavation and displays some objects from the site.

'''Brigie de Courcy''' is an Irish television producer.

Graduating from [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) with a PhD in [[Drama]], she began working for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] (RTÉ) as an assistant script editor on the Irish soap ''[[Fair City]]'' in 2000. After a promotion to Script Editor and successful stints as Story Editor and Story Producer on ''[[Emmerdale]]'', she transferred to the [[BBC]]. She worked as Series Story Producer on ''[[EastEnders]]'' under [[Kate Harwood]]. 

This period, from 2005 to 2006, represented a return to form for the show. Criticism had been intense, with particular ire directed at "the quality of its storylines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/12048 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509131624/http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/12048 |archivedate=2006-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general recovery under Harwood, and the improvement in storylines under de Courcy, culminated in a [[National Television Awards|National Television Award]] for most popular series, as well as ''[[EastEnders]]'''s first [[BAFTA]] nomination since 2002 and first victory since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088512/ |title=Awards Section|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harwood went on to become Head of Series and Serials at the BBC in October 2006, while de Courcy left shortly after for a spell in senior BBC management.

In 2008, she returned to Irish television and was appointed Executive Producer of ''[[Fair City]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.ie/star/fair-city-faced-axe-after-a-season-53261/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006104057/http://www.thestar.ie/star/fair-city-faced-axe-after-a-season-53261/ |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; During her reign, the soap has received critical acclaim for its more credible, sophisticated and psychological stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/alls-fair-in-love-and-war-26550149.html |title=All's Fair in love and war |website=Independent.ie |date=2009-07-11 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently she has become Script Producer of the new animated show on RTÉ called ''[[Ballybraddan]]'' which is about [[hurling]] and was brought in to celebrate 125 years of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metroeireann.com/article/all-in-good-time%2C2120 |title=All in good time |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233337/http://metroeireann.com/article/all-in-good-time%2C2120 |archivedate=2014-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is distinguished from the [[fresco-secco]] (or ''a secco'') and [[finto fresco]] techniques, in which paints are applied to dried plaster.

==Description==
The buon fresco technique consists of painting with pigment ground in [[water]] on a thin layer of wet, fresh, [[Mortar (masonry)#Lime mortar|lime mortar]] or [[plaster]], for which the Italian word is , [[intonaco]]. Because of the chemical makeup of the plaster, a [[Binder (material)|binder]] is not required.

After a number of hours the plaster reacts with the air in a process called [[carbonatation]]. This chemical reaction fixes the pigment particles at the plaster's surface in a protective crystalline mesh known as the lime crust.&lt;ref&gt;Fresco Painting: The Dichotomy of Rigorous Craft and Artistic Expression, Tessa Lindsey&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of '''Buon fresco''' is its durability.  In ''[[fresco-secco]]'', by contrast, the color does not become part of the wall and tends to flake off over time.  The chief disadvantage of '''Buon fresco''' is that it must be done quickly without mistakes.

The painter plasters and paints only as much as can be completed in a day, which explains the Italian term for each of these sections, ''[[giornata]]'', or a day's work.  The size of a [[giornata]] varies according to the complexity of the painting within it.  A face, for instance, might take an entire day, whereas large areas of sky can be painted quite rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Frescoes dating from the 17th century BC using this technique have been found n the excavations of [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island of [[Santorini]] in [[Greece]], changing our beliefs about art in prehistoric times.

One of the first painters in the post-classical period to use this technique was the Isaac Master in the Upper [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in [[Assisi]].

In medieval and Renaissance Italy, a wall to be frescoed was first prepared with a rough, thick undercoat of plaster known as the arriccio.  When this was dry, assistants copied the master painter's composition onto it with reddish-brown pigment or charcoal.  The artist made any necessary adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India]] is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse nations in the world, with some of the most deeply religious societies and cultures. Religion plays a central and definitive role in the life of many of its people. Although India is a secular [[Hinduism|Hindu-majority]] country, it has a [[Islam in India|large Muslim]] population. Except for [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Nagaland]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Lakshadweep]], Hindus form the predominant population in all [[States and union territories of India|29 states]] and [[States and union territories of India|7 union territories]]. Muslims are present throughout India, with large populations in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Kerala]], [[Telangana]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]]; while only [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Lakshadweep]] have majority Muslim populations. [[Sikh]]s and [[Christian]]s are other significant minorities of India.

According to the 2011 census, 79.8% of the [[Demographics of India|population of India]] practice [[Hinduism]]. [[Islam]] (14.2%), [[Christianity]] (2.3%), [[Sikhism]] (1.7%), [[Buddhism]] (0.7%) and [[Jainism]] (0.4%) are the other major religions followed by the people of India.&lt;ref name=indiareligion2011&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/india-has-79-8-percent-hindus-14-2-percent-muslims-2011-census-data-on-religion-2407708.html| title= India has 79.8% Hindus, 14.2% Muslims, says 2011 census data on religion | publisher=First Post| date= August 26, 2015 | accessdate= 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Tribal religions of India|tribal religions]], such as [[Sarnaism]], are found in India, though these have been affected by major religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity.&lt;ref name=fcrel/&gt; Jainism, [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are also influential but their numbers are smaller.&lt;ref name=fcrel/&gt; [[Atheism]] and [[agnostics]] also have visible influence in India, along with a self-ascribed tolerance to other faiths.&lt;ref name=fcrel&gt;{{cite book | last=Clothey | first=Fred | title=Religion in India : a historical introduction | publisher=Routledge | location=London New York | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-415-94024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Centre, India will have world's largest populations of Hindus and Muslims by 2050. India is expected to have about 311 million Muslims making up around 19–20% of the population and yet about 1.3 billion Hindus are projected to live in India comprising around 76% of the population.

Indian philosophy comprises the philosophical traditions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. There are six schools of orthodox [[Hindu philosophy]]—[[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Vedanta]]—and four [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] schools—[[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Ājīvika]] and [[Cārvāka]] – last two are also schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of this method of classification, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: {{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are other methods of classification; Vidyarania for instance identifies sixteen schools of Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the [[Shaivism|Śaiva]] and [[Raseśvara]] traditions.&lt;ref name="cowell"&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[medieval India]] (ca.1000–1500), schools of Indian philosophical thought have been classified by the Brahmanical tradition{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}&lt;ref name="Chatterjee and Datta, p. 5"&gt;Chatterjee and Datta, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; as either orthodox or non-orthodox – [[Āstika and nāstika|āstika or nāstika]] – depending on whether they regard the [[Vedas]] as an infallible source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="World Religions p. 259"/&gt;

The main schools of Indian philosophy were formalised chiefly between 1000 BCE to the early centuries of the [[Common Era]]. According to philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], the earliest of these, which date back to the composition of the [[Upanishads]] in the [[Vedic period#Later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)|later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)]], constitute "the earliest philosophical compositions of the world."&lt;ref&gt;p 22, ''The Principal Upanisads'', Harper Collins, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Competition and integration between the various schools was intense during their formative years, especially between 800 BCE and 200 CE. Some schools like Jainism, Buddhism, Śaiva and [[Advaita Vedanta]] survived, but others, like [[Samkhya]] and [[Ājīvika]], did not; they were either assimilated or became extinct. Subsequent centuries produced commentaries and reformulations continuing up to as late as the 20th century. Authors who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophies include [[Shrimad Rajchandra]], [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Ram Mohan Roy]], and [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]].{{Sfn|Clarke|2006|p=209}}

For generations, India has a prevailing tradition of the joint family system. It is when extended members of a family – parents, children, the children's spouses and their offspring, etc. – live together. Usually, the oldest male member is the head in the joint Indian family system. He mostly makes all important decisions and rules, and other family members are likely to abide by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Families |url=http://www.factsaboutindia.org/indian-families.html |publisher=Facts About India |accessdate=11 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730125635/http://www.factsaboutindia.org/indian-families.html |archivedate=30 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1966 study, Orenstein and Micklin analysed India's population data and family structure. Their studies suggest that Indian household sizes had remained similar over the 1911 to 1951 period. There after, with urbanisation and economic development, India has witnessed a break up of traditional joint family into more nuclear-like families.&lt;ref name=rs1&gt;{{cite book |title=Dynamics of Change in the Modern Hindu Family |year=1993 |publisher=South Asia Books |author=Raghuvir Sinha |isbn=978-81-7022-448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Hindu Joint Family: The Norms and the Numbers |author1=Henry Orenstein |author2=Michael Micklin |journal=Pacific Affairs |volume=39 |issue=3/4 |quote=Autumn, 1966 |jstor=2754275 |pages=314–325 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sinha, in his book, after summarising the numerous sociological studies done on Indian family, notes that over the last 60 years, the cultural trend in most parts of India has been an accelerated change from joint family to nuclear families, much like population trends in other parts of the world. The traditionally large joint family in India, in the 1990s, accounted for a small percent of Indian households, and on average had lower per capita household income. He finds that joint family still persists in some areas and in certain conditions, in part due cultural traditions and in part due to practical factors.&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt;
Youth in lower socio-economic classes are more inclined to spend time with their families than their peers due to differing ideologies in rural and urban parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Verma |first1=Suman |last2=Saraswathi |first2=T.S. |title=Adolescence in India|year=2002|publisher=Rawat Publications|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of education and growth of economics, the traditional joint-family system is breaking down rapidly across India and attitudes towards working women have changed.

Arranged marriages have long been the norm in Indian society. Even today, the majority of Indians have their marriages planned by their parents and other respected family-members. In the past, the age of marriage was young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heitzman|first=James|title=India: A Country Study.|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/|publisher=US Library of Congress|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average age of marriage for women in India has increased to 21 years, according to 2011 Census of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mospi.nic.in/mospi_new/upload/women_men_2012_31oct12.pdf Women and men in India 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012024158/http://mospi.nic.in/mospi_new/upload/women_men_2012_31oct12.pdf |date=12 October 2013 }} CSO/Census of India 2011, Government of India, pp xxi&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, about 7% of women got married before the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;K.

In most of the marriages the bride's family provide a dowry to the bridegroom. Traditionally, the dowry was considered a woman's share of the family wealth, since a daughter had no legal claim on her natal family's real estate. It also typically included portable valuables such as jewellery and household goods that a bride could control throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heitzman|first=James|title=India: A Country Study|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/86.htm|publisher=US Library of Congress|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, in most families the inheritance of family estates passed down the male line.

There is a dearth of scientific surveys or studies on Indian marriages where the perspectives of both husbands and wives were solicited in-depth. Sample surveys suggest the issues with marriages in India are similar to trends observed elsewhere in the world. The divorce rates are rising in India. Urban divorce rates are much higher. Women initiate about 80 percent of divorces in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sangeeta Pisharoty|title=Marriages are in trouble|publisher=The Hindu newspaper|date=15 May 2010|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/magazine/article429761.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies suggest that Indian culture is trending away from traditional arranged marriages. [[Banerjee]] et al. surveyed 41,554 households across 33 [[States and territories of India|states and union territories in India]] in 2005.

===Wedding rituals===
[[File:Hindu marriage ceremony offering.jpg|thumb|A Hindu wedding ritual in progress. The bride and the groom are seated together, receiving instructions from the priest. The sacred square fire container (''[[yajna]] kund'') is behind the priest.]]
Weddings are festive occasions in India with extensive decorations, colors, music, dance, costumes and rituals that depend on the religion of the bride and the groom, as well as their preferences.&lt;ref name=ft2008&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7498e59c-2233-11dd-a50a-000077b07658.html#axzz2aqrbE3eF Sari nights and henna parties], Amy Yee, The Financial Times, May 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The nation celebrates about 10 million weddings per year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57376057/indias-love-affair-with-gold/ India's love affair with gold], CBS News, February 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; of which over 80% are [[Hindu wedding]]s.

The rituals and process of a Hindu wedding vary depending on region of India, local adaptations, resources of the family and preferences of the bride and the groom. Nevertheless, there are a few [[Hindu wedding#Main rituals|key rituals]] common in [[Hindu wedding]]s – ''Kanyadaan'', ''Panigrahana'', and ''Saptapadi''; these are respectively, gifting away of daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hand near the fire to signify impending union, and taking seven steps before fire with each step including a set of mutual vows. After the seventh step and vows of ''[[Hindu wedding#Saptapadi - Short Form|Saptapadi]]'', the couple is legally husband and wife.&lt;ref name=jgl2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Dharmasastra, Vaman Kane (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prabhu2011&gt;P.H.

Certain festivals in India are celebrated by multiple religions. Notable examples include [[Diwali]], which is celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains across the country and [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], [[Krishna Janmashtami]], [[Ambedkar Jayanti]] celebrated by Buddhists and Hindus. Sikh festivals, such as [[Guru Nanak Jayanti]], [[Baisakhi]] are celebrated with full fanfare by Sikhs and Hindus of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Delhi]] where the two communities together form an overwhelming majority of the population. Adding colours to the culture of India, the [[Dree Festival]] is one of the tribal festivals of India celebrated by the Apatanis of the Ziro valley of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], which is the easternmost state of India. [[Nowruz]] is the most important festival among the Parsi community of India.

[[Islam in India]] is the second largest religion with over 172 million Muslims, according to India's 2011 census.&lt;ref name=indiareligion2011/&gt; The Islamic festivals which are observed and are declared public holiday in India are; [[Eid ul Fitr]], [[Eid ul Adha]]-(Bakri Eid), [[Milad un Nabi]], [[Mourning of Muharram|Muharram]] and [[Shab-e-Barat]].&lt;ref name=ph10&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Government Holidays|publisher=Government of India|year=2010|url=http://india.gov.in/govt/pdf/govt_holiday_list_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Indian states have declared regional holidays for the particular regional popular festivals; such as [[Arba'een]], [[Jumu'ah-tul-Wida]] and [[Shab-e-Qadar]].

Christianity is India's third largest religion. With over 23 million Christians, of which 17 million are Roman Catholics, India is home to many Christian festivals. The country celebrates [[Christmas]] and [[Good Friday]] as public holidays.&lt;ref name=ph10/&gt;

Regional and community fairs are also common festival in India. For example, Pushkar fair of Rajasthan is one of the world's largest markets of cattle and livestock.

==Greetings==
[[File:An Oberoi Hotel employee doing Namaste, New Delhi.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pressing hands together with a smile to greet [[Namaste]] – a common cultural practice in [[India]].]]

Indian greetings are based on [[Añjali Mudrā]], including [[Pranāma]] and [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]].

Greetings include ''Namaste (Hindi and Sanskrit)'', ''[[Namaskar]] (Hindi)'', Juhar/Namaskar in [[Odia language|Odia]], ''[[Namaskar]] ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]),'' ''Namaskara ''([[Kannada]]), ''Namaskaram'' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]), ''Vanakkam'' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]), ''Nomoshkaar'' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]), ''Nomoskar'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]), ''Aadab'' ([[Urdu]]), and ''Sat Shri Akal'' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]). All these are common spoken greetings or salutations when people meet, and are forms of farewell when they depart. Namaskar is considered slightly more formal than Namaste but both express deep respect. Namaskar is commonly used in India and [[Nepal]] by [[Hindus]], Jains and Buddhists, and many continue to use this outside the [[Indian subcontinent]]. In Indian and Nepali culture, the word is spoken at the beginning of written or verbal communication. However, the same hands folded gesture may be made wordlessly or said without the folded hand gesture. The word is derived from ''[[Sanskrit]]'' (namah): to [[bowing (social)|bow]], reverential [[salutation (greeting)|salutation]], and [[respect]], and (te): "to you". Taken literally, it means "I bow to you".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=namaste&amp;searchmode=none Namaste] Douglas Harper, Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism it means "I bow to the divine in you."&lt;ref&gt;Ying, Y. W., Coombs, M., &amp; Lee, P. A. (1999), Family intergenerational relationship of Asian American adolescents, Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 5(4), pp 350–363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J. D. (2007), The Boundaries of Faith: A Journey in India, Homily Service, 41(2), pp 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; In most Indian families, younger men and women are taught to seek the blessing of their elders by reverentially bowing to their elders. This custom is known as [[Pranāma]].

Other greetings include ''Jai Jagannath'' (used in [[Odia language|Odia]]) ''Ami Aschi'' (used in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]), ''Jai Shri Krishna'' (in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and the [[Braj Bhasha]] and [[Rajasthani languages|Rajasthani]] dialects of [[Hindi]]), ''Ram Ram/(Jai) Sita Ram ji'' ([[Awadhi]] and [[Bhojpuri]] dialects of [[Hindi]] and other [[Bihari languages|Bihari dialects]]), and ''[[Sat Sri Akaal|Sat Sri Akal]]'' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]; used by followers of [[Sikhism]]), ''[[As-salamu alaykum]]'' ([[Urdu]]; used by follower of [[Islam]]), ''[[Jai Jinendra]]'' (a common greeting used by followers of [[Jainism]]), ''[[Jai Bhim]]'' (used by followers of [[Ambedkarism]]), ''Namo Buddha'' (used by followers of [[Buddhism]]), ''Allah Abho'' (used by followers of [[Bahá'í]]), ''[[Shalom aleichem]]'' (used by followers of [[Judaism]]), ''Hamazor Hama Ashobed'' (used by followers of [[Zoroastrianism]]), ''Sahebji'' ([[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]; used by the [[Parsi]] people), ''Dorood'' ([[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Gujarati language|Guarati]]; used by the [[Irani (India)|Irani]] people), ''[[Om Namah Shivaya]]/Jai Bholenath'' (used in [[Dogri language|Dogri]] and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], also used in the city of [[Varanasi]]), ''Jai Ambe Maa/Jai Mata di'' (used in [[Eastern India]]), ''Jai Ganapati Bapa'' (used in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Konkani language|Konkani]]), and etc.

These traditional forms of greeting may be absent in the world of business and in India's urban environment, where a handshake is a common form of greeting.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Messner, W. (2013).

The varied and rich [[wildlife of India]] has had a profound impact on the region's popular culture. Common name for wilderness in India is [[Jungle]] which was adopted by the British [[colonialists]] to the English language. The word has been also made famous in ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' by [[Rudyard Kipling]]. India's wildlife has been the subject of numerous other tales and fables such as the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' and the ''[[Jataka tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectrumcommodities.com/education/commodity/statistics/cattle.html Symbolism in Indian culture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509171551/http://www.spectrumcommodities.com/education/commodity/statistics/cattle.html |date=9 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hinduism, the cow is regarded as a symbol of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence), [[mother goddess]] and bringer of good fortune and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=South Asian folklore |author1=Peter J.

This is why beef remains a taboo food in mainstream Hindu and Jain society.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Marshall [https://books.google.com/books?id=p5SRPcoelt4C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=cow+symbolism+hindu+culture&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a Nature's web: rethinking our place on earth] M.E. Sharpe, 1996 {{ISBN|1-56324-864-6}} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2012, cow remains a divisive and controversial topic in India. Several states of India have passed laws to protect cows, while many states have no restrictions on the production and consumption of beef. Some groups oppose the butchering of cows, while other secular groups argue that what kind of meat one eats ought to be a matter of personal choice in a democracy. [[Madhya Pradesh]] enacted a law in January 2012, namely the Gau-Vansh Vadh Pratishedh (Sanshodhan) Act, which makes cow slaughter a serious offence. Gujarat, a western state of India, has the Animal Preservation Act, enacted in October 2011, that prohibits killing of cows along with buying, selling and transport of beef. In contrast, Odisha, Assam and Andhra Pradesh allow butchering of cattle with a fit-for-slaughter certificate. In the states of West Bengal and Kerala, consumption of beef is not deemed an offence. Contrary to stereotypes, a sizeable number of Hindus eat beef, and many argue that their scriptures, such as Vedic and Upanishadic texts do not prohibit its consumption. In southern Indian state Kerala, for instance, beef accounts for nearly half of all meat consumed by all communities, including Hindus. Sociologists theorise that the widespread consumption of cow meat in India is because it is a far cheaper source of animal protein for the poor than mutton or chicken, which retail at double the price. For these reasons, India's beef consumption post-independence in 1947 has witnessed a much faster growth than any other kind of meat; currently, India is one of the five largest producer and consumer of cattle livestock meat in the world. A beef ban has been made in Maharashtra and other states as of 2015. While states such as Madhya Pradesh are passing local laws to prevent cruelty to cows, other Indians are arguing "If the real objective is to prevent cruelty to animals, then why single out the cow when hundreds of other animals are maltreated?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indians split over cow ban|publisher=Asia Times| date=6 January 2012| url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NA06Df05.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cow slaughter ban: Using sensitivities to politically polarising ends works against democracy|date=10 January 2012|newspaper=The Economic Times|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/editorial/cow-slaughter-ban-using-sensitivities-to-politically-polarising-ends-works-against-democracy/articleshow/11430557.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Livestock and poultry: world markets and trade|date=October 2011|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/livestock_poultry.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian food is as diverse as India. Indian cuisines use numerous ingredients, deploy a wide range of food preparation styles, cooking techniques and culinary presentation. From salads to sauces, from vegetarian to meat, from spices to sensuous, from breads to desserts, Indian cuisine is invariably complex. Harold McGee, a favourite of many Michelin-starred chefs, writes "for sheer inventiveness with milk itself as the primary ingredient, no country on earth can match India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On food and cooking|author=Harold McGee |isbn= 978-0-684-80001-1 |year=2004 |publisher=Scribner |url=http://www.curiouscook.com/site/on-food-and-cooking.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sanjeev Kapoor]], a member of Singapore Airlines' International Culinary Panel, Indian food has long been an expression of world cuisine. Kapoor claims, "if you looked back in India's history and study the food that our ancestors ate, you will notice how much attention was paid to the planning and cooking of a meal. Great thought was given to the texture and taste of each dish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Spice|year=2009|publisher=Indian Cuisine|pages=59–62|url=http://www.orissany.com/priority-mag-spore-air.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such historical record is {{IAST|Mānasollāsa}}, ({{lang-sa|मानसोल्लास}}, The Delight of Mind), written in the 12th century.

India is known for its love of food and spices. Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting the local produce, cultural diversity, and [[Demographics of India|varied demographics]] of the country. Generally, Indian cuisine can be split into five categories – [[North Indian cuisine|northern]], [[South Indian cuisine|southern]], eastern, western, and northeastern. The diversity of Indian cuisine is characterised by the differing use of many [[list of Indian spices|spices]] and herbs, a wide assortment of recipes and cooking techniques. Though a significant portion of Indian food is [[vegetarian]], many Indian dishes also include meats like [[chicken]], [[mutton]], [[beef]] (both cow and buffalo), [[pork]] and fish, egg and other seafood. Fish-based cuisines are common in eastern states of India, particularly [[West Bengal]] and the western state of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Chitrita|title=Bengali Cooking: Seasons and Festivals|year=1997|publisher=Serif|isbn=978-1-897959-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chum chums.jpg|thumb|Some Indian confectionery [[Sweets of the Indian subcontinent|desserts]] from hundreds of varieties. In certain parts of India, these are called ''mithai'' or sweets. Sugar and desserts have a long history in India: by about 500 BCE, people in India had developed the technology to produce sugar crystals. In the local language, these crystals were called ''khanda'' (खण्ड), which is the source of the word ''candy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sugar: A Bitterweet History|publisher=Penguin|year=2010|author=Elizabeth Abbot|isbn=978-1-590-20297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Despite this diversity, some unifying threads emerge. Varied uses of spices are an integral part of certain food preparations and are used to enhance the flavour of a dish and create unique flavours and aromas. Cuisine across India has also been influenced by various cultural groups that entered India throughout history, such as the [[Central Asia]]ns, [[Arabs]], [[Mughals]], and [[Colonialism in India|European colonists]]. Sweets are also very popular among Indians, particularly in [[West Bengal|Bengal]] where both [[Bengali Hindus]] and [[Bengali Muslims]] distribute sweets to mark joyous occasions.

Indian cuisine is one of the most popular cuisines across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19130531_ITM|title=Indian food now attracts wider market. | work=Asia Africa Intelligence Wire | date=16 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most Indian restaurants outside India, the menu does not do justice to the enormous variety of Indian cuisine available – the most common cuisine served on the menu would be [[Punjabi cuisine]] ([[chicken tikka masala]] is a very popular dish in the United Kingdom). There do exist some restaurants serving cuisines from other regions of India, although these are few and far between. Historically, Indian spices and herbs were one of the most sought after trade commodities. The [[spice trade]] between India and Europe led to the rise and dominance of Arab traders to such an extent that European explorers, such as [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Christopher Columbus]], set out to find new trade routes with India leading to the ''[[Age of Discovery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Spice_Trade.html|title=The History of the Spice Trade in India|author=Louise Marie M.

==Clothing==
{{Main|Clothing in India}}
Traditional clothing in India greatly varies across different parts of the country and is influenced by local culture, geography, climate and rural/urban settings. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as [[sari]] and ''mekhela sador'' for women and [[dhoti]] or [[lungi]] or panche (in Kannada) for men. Stitched clothes are also popular such as [[churidar]] or ''salwar-kameez'' for women, with ''dupatta'' (long scarf) thrown over shoulder completing the outfit. Salwar is often loose fitting, while churidar is a tighter cut.&lt;ref name=mc1/&gt; The [[dastar]], a headgear worn by [[Sikh]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s is common in [[Punjab]].

Indian women perfect their sense of charm and fashion with makeup and ornaments. Bindi, mehendi, earrings, bangles and other jewelry are common. On special occasions, such as marriage ceremonies and festivals, women may wear cheerful colours with various ornaments made with gold, silver or other regional stones and gems. [[Bindi (decoration)|Bindi]] is often an essential part of a Hindu woman's make up. Worn on their forehead, some consider the ''bindi'' as an auspicious mark. Traditionally, the red bindi was worn only by married Hindu women, and coloured bindi was worn by single women, but now all colours and glitter has become a part of women's fashion. Some women wear [[sindoor]] – a traditional red or orange-red powder (vermilion) in the parting of their hair (locally called ''mang''). Sindoor is the traditional mark of a married woman for Hindus. Single Hindu women do not wear ''sindoor''; neither do over 1 million Indian women from religions other than Hindu and agnostics/atheists who may be married.&lt;ref name=mc1&gt;{{cite book |last = Chary |first = Manish |title = India: Nation on the Move |publisher = iUniverse|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vjI6IZt8tuwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn = 978-1-4401-1635-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The make up and clothing styles differ regionally between the Hindu groups, and also by climate or religion, with Christians preferring Western and Muslim preferring the Arabic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Tarlo |first = Emma|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8wyM5heEc9gC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title = Clothing matters: dress and identity in India |publisher = C.

The [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] [[Sanskrit]] is one of the oldest attestations of any [[Indo-Aryan languages]], and one of the earliest attested members of the [[Indo-European languages]]. The discovery of Sanskrit by early European explorers of India led to the development of comparative Philology. The scholars of the 18th century were struck by the far reaching similarity of Sanskrit, both in grammar and vocabulary, to the classical languages of Europe. Intensive scientific studies that followed have established that Sanskrit and many Indian derivative languages belong to the family which includes English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Celtic, Greek, Baltic, Armenian, Persian, Tocharian and other Indo-European languages.&lt;ref name=burrow1&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit Language|author=Thomas Burrow|year=2001|isbn=978-81-208-1767-8|publisher=Motilal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of language within India may be distinguished over three periods: old, middle and modern Indo-Aryan. The classical form of old Indo-Aryan was ''sanskrit'' meaning polished, cultivated and correct, in distinction to ''Prakrit'' – the practical language of the migrating masses evolving without concern to proper pronunciation or grammar, the structure of language changing as those masses mingled, settled new lands and adopted words from people of other native languages. ''Prakrita'' became middle Indo-Aryan leading to ''Pali'' (the language of early Buddhists and Ashoka era in 200–300 BCE), ''Prakrit'' (the language of Jain philosophers) and ''Apabhramsa'' (the language blend at the final stage of middle Indo-Aryan). It is ''Apabhramsa'', scholars claim,&lt;ref name=burrow1/&gt; that flowered into Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi and many other languages now in use in India's north, east and west. All of these Indian languages have roots and structure similar to Sanskrit, to each other and to other Indo-European languages. Thus we have in India three thousand years of continuous linguistic history recorded and preserved in literary documents. This enables scholars to follow language evolution and observe how, by changes hardly noticeable from generation to generation, an original language alters into descendant languages that are now barely recognisable as the same.&lt;ref name=burrow1/&gt;

Sanskrit has had a profound impact on the languages and literature of India. [[Hindi]], India's most spoken language, is a "Sanskritised register" of the [[Khariboli dialect]]. In addition, all modern Indo-Aryan languages, [[Munda languages]] and [[Dravidian languages]], have borrowed many words either directly from Sanskrit (''[[tatsama]]'' words), or indirectly via middle Indo-Aryan languages (''[[tadbhava]]'' words).&lt;ref name = Staal&gt;{{Harvnb|Stall|1963|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words originating in Sanskrit are estimated to constitute roughly fifty percent of the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages,&lt;ref name=Chatterji&gt;{{Harvnb|Chatterji|1942}}, cited in {{Harvnb|Stall|1963|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the literary forms of (Dravidian) [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].

===Epics===
The [[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]] and the [[Ramayana|Rāmāyaṇa]] are the oldest preserved and well-known epics of India. Versions have been adopted as the epics of Southeast Asian countries like Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books (''{{IAST|kāṇḍas}}'') and 500 [[canto]]s (''{{IAST|sargas}}''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutt|2004}}, p.198&lt;/ref&gt; and tells the story of Rama (an incarnation or [[Avatar]] of the Hindu preserver-god [[Vishnu]]), whose wife [[Sita]] is abducted by the [[Rakshasa|demon]] king of [[Lanka]], [[Ravana]]. This epic played a pivotal role in establishing the role of [[dharma|dhárma]] as a principal ideal guiding force for Hindu way of life.&lt;ref name = Brockington&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockington|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest parts of the Mahabharata text date to 400 BC&lt;ref name=Brockington_1&gt;Brockington (1998, p. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; and is estimated to have reached its final form by the early [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] (c. 4th century AD).&lt;ref&gt;Van Buitenen; The Mahabharata – 1; The Book of the Beginning.

Some of the [[Indian folk dance|folk dances]] include the ''[[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]]'' of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]; the ''[[bihu]]'' of [[Assam]]; the zeliang of [[Nagaland]]; the [[Jhumair]], [[Domkach]], [[Chhau dance|chhau]] of [[Jharkhand]]; the [[Ghumura Dance]], [[Gotipua]], [[Mahari dance]] and [[Dalkhai]] of [[Odisha]]; the qauwwalis, birhas and charkulas of [[Uttar Pradesh]]; the jat-jatin, nat-natin and saturi of [[Bihar]]; the ''[[ghoomar]]'' of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]]; the ''[[dandiya]]'' and ''[[garba (dance)|garba]]'' of [[Gujarat]]; the kolattam of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]; the ''[[yakshagana]]'' of [[Karnataka]]; ''[[lavani]]'' of [[Maharashtra]]; ''[[Dekhnni]]'' of [[Goa]]. Recent developments include adoption of international dance forms particularly in the urban centres of India, and the extension of Indian classical dance arts by the Kerala Christian community, to tell stories from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India – Kalai Kaviri and Christu Dance Centre |year=2010 |publisher=International Christian Dance Fellowship |url=http://www.icdf.com/redeeming-our-culture-pg3.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116063520/http://www.icdf.com/redeeming-our-culture-pg3.php |archivedate=16 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Indian drama and theatre has a long history alongside its music and dance. [[Kālidāsa|Kalidasa]]'s plays like [[Shakuntala]] and [[Meghadoot]]a are some of the older dramas, following those of Bhasa. [[Kutiyattam]] of Kerala, is the only surviving specimen of the ancient Sanskrit theatre, thought to have originated around the beginning of the [[Common Era]], and is officially recognised by [[UNESCO]] as a [[Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. It strictly follows the [[Natya Shastra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Music is an integral part of India's culture. [[Natya Shastra|Natyasastra]], a 2000-year-old Sanskrit text, describes five systems of taxonomy to classify musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classification of musical instruments (South Asia : The Indian Subcontinent – Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 5) |editor=Alison Arnold|year=1999|page=319|publisher=Routledge; Har/Com edition|isbn=978-0-8240-4946-1|author=Reis Flora |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=musical%20instrument%20discovered%20india&amp;pg=PA319#v=onepage&amp;q=musical%20instrument%20discovered%20india&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these ancient Indian systems classifies musical instruments into four groups according to four primary sources of vibration: strings, membranes, cymbals, and air. According to Reis Flora, this is similar to the Western theory of organology. Archeologists have also reported the discovery of a 3000-year-old, 20-key, carefully shaped polished basalt lithophone in the [[Sankarjang|highlands of Odisha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=P.

[[File:Jodhpur RIFF.jpg|left|thumb|Group of Dharohar [[Indian folk music|folk music]]ians performing in [[Mehrangarh Fort]], [[Jodhpur]], India.]]
The oldest preserved examples of Indian music are the melodies of the ''[[Samaveda]]'' (1000 BC) that are still sung in certain Vedic [[Shrauta|Śrauta]] sacrifices; this is the earliest account of Indian musical hymns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Emmie te Nijenhuis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NrgfAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=Indian music, Part 2, Volume 6 | publisher=BRILL | isbn=978-90-04-03978-0 | year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed a tonal structure consisting of seven notes, which were named, in descending order, as ''Krusht'', ''Pratham'', ''Dwitiya'', ''Tritiya'', ''Chaturth'', ''Mandra'' and ''Atiswār''. These refer to the notes of a flute, which was the only fixed frequency instrument. The Samaveda, and other [[Hindu]] texts, heavily influenced [[Indian classical music|India's classical music]] tradition, which is known today in two distinct styles: [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani music]]. Both the Carnatic music and Hindustani music systems are based on the melodic base (known as [[raga|Rāga]]), sung to a rhythmic cycle (known as [[Tala (music)|Tāla]]); these principles were refined in the [[Natyashastra|nātyaśāstra]] (200 BC) and the [[dattilam]] (300 AD).&lt;ref&gt;A Study of Dattilam: A Treatise on the Sacred Music of Ancient India, 1978, p. 283, Mukunda Lāṭha, Dattila&lt;/ref&gt;

The current music of India includes multiple varieties of religious, classical, [[folk music|folk]], filmi, rock and pop music and dance. The appeal of traditional classical music and dance is on the rapid decline, especially among the younger generation.

Prominent contemporary Indian musical forms included [[filmi]] and [[Indipop]]. Filmi refers to the wide range of music written and performed for mainstream [[Indian cinema]], primarily [[Bollywood]], and accounts for more than 70 percent of all music sales in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8405891.stm | work=BBC News | title=Plans to start India music awards | date=10 December 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indipop is one of the most popular contemporary styles of Indian music which is either a fusion of [[Indian folk music|Indian folk]], classical or [[Sufi music]] with Western musical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Cave paintings from [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Bagh Caves|Bagh]], [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and [[Sittanavasal]] and temple paintings testify to a love of naturalism. Most early and medieval art in India is Hindu, Buddhist or Jain. A freshly made coloured floor design ([[Rangoli]]) is still a common sight outside the doorstep of many (mostly South Indian) Indian homes. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] is one of the classical painters from medieval India.

[[Pattachitra]], [[Madhubani painting]], [[Mysore painting]], [[Rajput painting]], [[Tanjore painting]] and [[Mughal painting]] are some notable Genres of Indian Art; while [[Nandalal Bose]], [[M. F. Husain]], [[S. H. Raza]], [[Geeta Vadhera]], [[Jamini Roy]] and B. Venkatappa&lt;ref name="venka"&gt;Kamath (2003), p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; are some modern painters. Among the present day artists, Atul Dodiya, Bose Krishnamacnahri, [[Devajyoti Ray]] and Shibu Natesan represent a new era of Indian art where global art shows direct amalgamation with Indian classical styles. These recent artists have acquired international recognition. [[Jehangir Art Gallery]] in [[Mumbai]], [[Mysore Palace]] has on display a few good Indian paintings.

===Sculpture===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first [[sculptures]] in India date back to the [[Indus Valley civilisation]], where stone and bronze figures have been discovered. Later, as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism developed further, India produced some extremely intricate [[bronze]]s as well as temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] were not constructed by using blocks but carved out of solid rock.

Sculptures produced in the northwest, in [[stucco]], [[schist]], or [[clay]], display a very strong blend of Indian and Classical [[Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]] influence. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] evolved almost simultaneously. During the [[Gupta period]] (4th to 6th centuries) sculpture reached a very high standard in execution and delicacy in modeling. These styles and others elsewhere in India evolved leading to classical Indian art that contributed to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Southeast Central and East Asia.

Indian architecture encompasses a multitude of expressions over space and time, constantly absorbing new ideas. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. Some of its earliest production are found in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] (2600–1900 BC) which is characterised by well-planned cities and houses. [[Religion]] and kingship do not seem to have played an important role in the planning and layout of these towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5892/|title=Dholavira: A Harappan City - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] empires and their successors, several Buddhist architectural complexes, such as the caves of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and the monumental [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa]] were built. Later on, South India produced several Hindu temples like [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]], [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], [[Thanjavur]] built by Raja Raja Chola, the [[Sun Temple]], [[Konark]], [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple]] at [[Srirangam]], and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] [[stupa]] (Chinna Lanja dibba and Vikramarka kota dibba) at [[Bhattiprolu]]. [[Rajput kingdoms]] oversaw the construction of [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho Temple Complex]], [[Chittor Fort]] and [[Chaturbhuj Temple (Orchha)|Chaturbhuj Temple]], etc. during their reign. [[Angkor Wat]], Borobudur and other [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] temples indicate strong Indian influence on South East Asian architecture, as they are built in styles almost identical to traditional Indian religious buildings.

The traditional system of [[Vaastu Shastra]] serves as India's version of [[Feng Shui]], influencing town planning, architecture, and ergonomics. It is unclear which system is older, but they contain certain similarities. Feng Shui is more commonly used throughout the world. Though Vastu is conceptually similar to Feng Shui in that it also tries to harmonise the flow of energy, (also called life-force or [[Prana]] in Sanskrit and [[Qi|Chi]]/[[Qi|Ki]] in Chinese/Japanese), through the house, it differs in the details, such as the exact directions in which various objects, rooms, materials, etc. are to be placed.

With the advent of Islamic influence from the west, Indian architecture was adapted to allow the traditions of the new religion, creating the [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]] style of architecture. The [[Qutb Minar complex|Qutb complex]], a group of monuments constructed by successive sultanas of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] is one of the earliest examples.  [[Fatehpur Sikri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/255|title=Fatehpur Sikri|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Taj Mahal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/252|title=Taj Mahal|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Gol Gumbaz]], [[Red Fort of Delhi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/231|title=Red Fort Complex|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charminar]] are creations of this era, and are often used as the stereotypical symbols of India.

The colonial rule of the British Empire saw the development of [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, and mixing of several other styles, such as European Gothic. The [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]] and the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] are notable examples.

Indian architecture has influenced eastern and southeastern Asia, due to the spread of Buddhism. A number of Indian architectural features such as the temple mound or [[stupa]], temple spire or [[shikhara]], temple tower or [[pagoda]] and temple gate or [[torana]], have become famous symbols of Asian culture, used extensively in [[East Asia]] and [[South East Asia]]. The central spire is also sometimes called a [[Gopuram|vimanam]]. The southern temple gate, or [[gopuram]] is noted for its intricacy and majesty.

Contemporary [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]] is more cosmopolitan. Cities are extremely compact and densely populated. Mumbai's [[Nariman Point]] is famous for its [[Art Deco]] buildings. Recent creations such as the [[Lotus Temple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5921/|title=Bahá'í House of Worship at New Delhi - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Golden Pagoda, Namsai|Golden Pagoda]] and [[Akshardham (Delhi)|Akshardham]], and the various modern urban developments of India like [[Bhubaneswar]] and [[Chandigarh]], are notable.

One of the best known forms of ancient Indian martial arts is the ''[[Kalarippayattu]]'' from [[Kerala]]. This ancient fighting style originated in southern India in the 12th century BCE and is regarded as one of the oldest surviving martial arts.&lt;ref name="Zarilli1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zarrilli |first=Phillip B. |title=When the Body Becomes All Eyes: Paradigms, Discourses and Practices of Power in Kalarippayattu, a South Indian Martial Art |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-563940-7 |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this form martial arts, various stages of physical training include [[ayurveda|ayurvedic]] massage with [[sesame oil]] to impart suppleness to the body (''uzichil''); a series of sharp body movements so as to gain control over various parts of the body (''miapayattu''); and, complex sword fighting techniques (''paliyankam'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ww-qCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=paliyankam#v=onepage&amp;q=paliyankam&amp;f=false|title=Know Your India: "Turn a New Page to Write Nationalism"|publisher= Vij Books India Pvt Ltd.|author= Dr Ahmad Sayeed|isbn=9789384318680|date=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Silambam]], which was developed around 200 AD, traces its roots to the [[Sangam period]] in southern India.&lt;ref name=Raj&gt;{{cite book |last=Raj|first=J.

A [[bamboo]] staff is used as the main weapon.&lt;ref name=Raj/&gt; The ancient Tamil [[Sangam literature]] mentions that between 400 BCE and 600 CE, soldiers from southern India received special martial arts training which revolved primarily around the use of [[spear]] (''vel''), [[sword]] (''val'') and [[shield]] (''kedaham'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Among eastern states, ''[[Paika akhada]]'' is a martial art found in [[Odisha]]. Paika akhada, or paika akhara, roughly translates as "warrior gymnasium" or "warrior school".&lt;ref name="iakoweb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paika Akhada|url=http://www.iakoweb.com/pakhada.html|publisher=Indian Association of Kickboxing Organisations|accessdate=9 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712234507/http://www.iakoweb.com/pakhada.html|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times, these were training schools of the peasant militia. Today's paika akhada teach physical exercises and martial arts in addition to the paika dance, a performance art with rhythmic movements and weapons being hit in time to the drum. It incorporates acrobatic maneuvres and use of the [[khanda (sword)|khanda (straight sword)]], [[pata (sword)|patta (guantlet-sword)]], sticks, and other weapons.

In northern India, the ''[[musti yuddha]]'' evolved in 1100 AD and focussed on mental, physical and spiritual training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The ''Dhanur Veda'' was first described in the 5th-century BCE [[Vishnu Purana|Viṣṇu Purāṇa]]&lt;ref name="Zarilli1998"/&gt; and is also mentioned in both of the major ancient Indian epics, the ''Rāmāyaṇa'' and ''Mahābhārata''. A distinctive factor of Indian martial arts is the heavy emphasis laid on meditation (''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyāna]]'') as a tool to remove fear, doubt and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Indian martial arts techniques have had a profound impact on other martial arts styles across Asia. The 3rd-century BCE ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' taught how to meditate single-mindedly on points located inside one's body, which was later used in [[martial arts]], while various [[mudra]] finger movements were taught in [[Yogacara]] Buddhism. These elements of [[yoga]], as well as finger movements in the ''nata'' dances, were later incorporated into various martial arts.&lt;ref name=Svinth&gt;J. R. Svinth (2002).

Indian television started off in 1959 in New Delhi with tests for educational telecasts.&lt;ref name=tvhistory&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.indiantelevision.com/indianbrodcast/history/historyoftele.htm| title =A Snapshot of Indian Television History| publisher =Indian Television Dot Com Pvt Ltd| accessdate = 1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= INDIA |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|year=2002|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=india}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian small screen programming started off in the mid-1970s. At that time there was only one national channel [[Doordarshan]], which was government owned. 1982 saw revolution in TV programming in India, with the New Delhi Asian games, India saw the colour version of TV, that year. The [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharat]] were some among the popular television series produced. By the late 1980s more and more people started to own television sets. Though there was a single channel, television programming had reached saturation. Hence the government opened up another channel which had part national programming and part regional. This channel was known as DD 2 later DD Metro. Both channels were broadcast terrestrially.

In 1991, the government liberated its markets, opening them up to [[cable television]]. Since then, there has been a spurt in the number of channels available. Today, Indian small screen is a huge industry by itself, and has thousands of programmes in all the states of India. The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind some even attaining national fame for themselves. TV soaps are extremely popular with housewives as well as working women. Some lesser known actors have found success in [[Bollywood]]. Indian TV now has many of the same channels as Western TV, including stations such as [[Cartoon Network]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[HBO]], [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], and [[MTV India]].

''[[Bollywood]]'' is the informal name given to the popular [[Mumbai]]-based [[film|film industry]] in India. Bollywood and the other major cinematic hubs (in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali Cinema]], [[Oriya film industry]], Assamese, Kannada, [[Malayalam Cinema|Malayalam]], Marathi, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Punjabi and Telugu) constitute the broader [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry]], whose output is considered to be the largest in the world in terms of number of films produced and number of tickets sold.

India has produced many cinema-makers like [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Mrinal Sen]], [[J. C. Daniel]], [[Kasinathuni Viswanath]], [[Ram Gopal Varma]], [[Bapu (film director)|Bapu]], [[Ritwik Ghatak]], [[Guru Dutt]],[[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]], [[Shaji N. Karun]], [[Girish Kasaravalli]], [[Shekhar Kapoor]], [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]], [[Nagraj Manjule]], [[Shyam Benegal]], [[Shankar Nag]], [[Girish Karnad]], [[G. V. Iyer]], [[Mani Ratnam]], and [[K. Balachander]] (see also: [[List of Indian film directors|Indian film directors]]). With the opening up of the economy in recent years and consequent exposure to world cinema, audience tastes have been changing. In addition, multiplexes have mushroomed in most cities, changing the revenue patterns.

==Perceptions of Indian culture==
{{Main|Stereotypes of South Asians}}
[[File:Cropped Tripuri.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Children prepare for a traditional dance in [[Tripura]]. The Tripuris, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.]]
India's diversity has inspired many writers to pen their perceptions of the country's culture. These writings paint a complex and often conflicting picture of the culture of India. India is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. The concept of "Indian culture" is a very complex and complicated matter. Indian citizens are divided into various ethnic, religious, caste, linguistic and regional groups, making the realities of "Indianness" extremely complicated. This is why the conception of Indian identity poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what concisely the expression "Indian" means. However, despite this vast and heterogeneous composition, the creation of some sort of typical or shared Indian culture results from some inherent internal forces (such as a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, flexible federal structure, secular educational policy, etc.) and from certain historical events (such as Indian Independence Movement, Partition, wars against Pakistan, etc.)

According to industry consultant Eugene M. Makar, for example, traditional Indian culture is defined by a relatively strict social hierarchy. He also mentions that from an early age, children are reminded of their roles and places in society.&lt;ref name="makar"&gt;{{cite book|title=An American's Guide to Doing Business in India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0QB43fNiTKkC&amp;printsec=frontcover|author=Eugene M. Makar|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59869-211-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reinforced, Makar notes, by the way many believe gods and spirits have an integral and functional role in determining their life. Several differences such as religion divide the culture. However, a far more powerful division is [[Caste system in India|the traditional Hindu bifurcation into non-polluting and polluting occupations]]. Strict social taboos have governed these groups for thousands of years, claims Makar. In recent years, particularly in cities, some of these lines have blurred and sometimes even disappeared. He writes important family relations extend as far as 1 [[gotra]], the mainly patrilinear lineage or clan assigned to a Hindu at birth. In rural areas &amp; sometimes in urban areas as well, it is common that three or four generations of the family live under the same roof. The [[patriarch]] often resolves family issues.&lt;ref name="makar"/&gt;

Others have a different perception of Indian culture. According to an interview with [[C. K. Prahalad|C.K. Prahalad]] by [[Des Dearlove]], author of many best selling business books, modern India is a country of very diverse cultures with many languages, religions and traditions. Children begin by coping and learning to accept and assimilate in this diversity. Prahalad – who was born in India and grew up there – claimed, in the interview, that Indians, like everyone else in the world, want to be treated as unique, as individuals, want to express themselves and seek innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the verge of something extraordinary|author=Des Dearlove|author-link=Des Dearlove| journal=Business Strategy Review|date=Spring 2009|pages=17–20|url=http://bsr.london.edu/lbs-article/109/index.html|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another report, Nancy Lockwood of [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, writes that in the past two decades or so, social change in India is in dramatic contrast to the expectations from traditional Indian culture. These changes have led to Indian families giving education opportunities to girls, accepting women working outside home, pursuing a career, and opening the possibility for women to attain managerial roles in corporate India. Lockwood claims that change is slow, yet the scale of cultural change can be sensed from the fact that of India's 397 million workers, 124 million are now women. The issues in India with women empowerment are similar to those elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amartya Sen]], the India born Nobel Laureate in Economics, the culture of modern India is a complex blend of its historical traditions, influences from the effects of colonialism over centuries and current Western culture – both collaterally and dialectically. Sen observes that external images of India in the West often tend to emphasise the difference – real or imagined – between India and the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity|author=Amartya Sen|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-312-42602-6|url=https://www.amazon.com/Argumentative-Indian-Writings-History-Identity/dp/tags-on-product/031242602X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a considerable inclination in the Western countries to distance and highlight the differences in Indian culture from the mainstream of Western traditions, rather than discover and show similarities. Western writers and media usually misses, in important ways, crucial aspects of Indian culture and traditions. The deep-seated heterogeneity of Indian traditions, in different parts of India, is neglected in these homogenised description of India. The perceptions of Indian culture, by those who weren't born and raised in India, tend to be one of at least three categories, writes Sen:
* Exoticist approach: it concentrates on the wondrous aspects of the culture of India. The focus of this approach of understanding Indian culture is to present the different, the strange and as Hegel put it, "a country that has existed for millennia in the imaginations of the Europeans."
* Magisterial approach: it assumes a sense of superiority and guardianship necessary to deal with India, a country that James Mill's imperialist history thought of as grotesquely primitive culture. While great many British observers did not agree with such views of India, and some non-British ones did, it is an approach that contributes to some confusion about the culture of India.
* Curatorial approach: it attempts to observe, classify and record the diversity of Indian culture in different parts of India. The curators do not look only for the strange, are not weighed by political priorities, and tend to be more free from stereotypes. The curatorial approach, nevertheless, have an inclination to see Indian culture as more special and extraordinarily interesting than it actually may be.

The curatorial approach, one inspired by systematic curiosity for the cultural diversity of India within India, is mostly absent.

[[Susan Bayly]], in her book, observes that there is considerable dispute in India and Orientalist scholars on perceived Indian culture. She acknowledges that many dispute claims of pervasiveness of caste and strict social hierarchy in modern India. Bayly notes that much of the Indian subcontinent was populated by people for whom the formal distinctions of caste and strict social hierarchies were of only limited importance in their lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|author=Susan Bayly|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9780521264341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rosser, an American sociologist, Americans of South Asian origins feel the Western perception of the culture of India has numerous stereotypes. Rosser notes that the discourse in much of the United States about the culture of India is rarely devoted to independent India. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture, but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its pathetic attempts to modernise or develop are to be winked at and patronised.&lt;ref name=rosser1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Stereotypes in Schooling: Negative Pressures in the American Educational System on Hindu Identity Formation |journal=Teaching South Asia, A Journal of Pedagogy |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2001 |pages=23–76 |url=http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094030/http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |archivedate= 8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosser conducted numerous interviews and summarised the comments. The study reports a stark contrast between Western perceptions of the culture of India, versus the direct experience of the interviewed people. For example:

{{quotation|The presentation of South Asians is a standard pedagogic approach which runs quickly from the "Cradle of Civilisation"—contrasting the Indus Valley with Egypt and Mesopotamia—on past the Aryans, who were somehow our ancestors— to the poverty stricken, superstitious, polytheistic, caste ridden Hindu way of life&amp;nbsp;... and then somehow magically culminates with a eulogy of Mahatma Gandhi. A typical textbook trope presents the standard Ancient India Meets the Age of Expansion Approach with a colour photo of the Taj Mahal. There may be a side bar on ahimsa or a chart of connecting circles graphically explaining samsara and reincarnation, or illustrations of the four stages of life or the Four Noble Truths. Amid the dearth of real information there may be found an entire page dedicated to a deity such as Indra or Varuna, who admittedly are rather obscure vis-à-vis the beliefs of most modern Hindus.|A South Asian in America&lt;ref name=rosser1/&gt;}}

The '''Euthanasia Coaster''' is an art concept for a [[steel roller coaster]] designed to kill its passengers.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/human-plus-science-gallery | title=The Future of the Human Species Explored | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=WIRED Science | date=6 April 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2011 | author=Solon, Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it was designed and made into a [[scale model]] by Julijonas Urbonas, a [[PhD candidate]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] in [[London]]. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives "with elegance and euphoria".&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5793305/the-euthanasia-coaster-the-last-roller-coaster-youll-ever-ride | title=The Euthanasia Coaster, the Last Roller Coaster You'll Ever Ride | publisher=Gawker Media | date=18 April 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2011 | author=Lamar, Cyriaqe}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for practical applications of his design, Urbonas mentioned "[[euthanasia]]" or "[[execution]]".&lt;ref name="urbonas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://julijonasurbonas.lt/euthanasia-coaster/ | title=Euthanasia Coaster | date=2 October 2010 | accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Allen, who served as president of the [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company]], inspired Urbonas with his description of the "ultimate" roller coaster as one that "sends out 24 people and they all come back dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.designtaxi.com/news/34579/A-Rollercoaster-Designed-to-Kill-Humanely/?page=4 | title=A Rollercoaster Designed to Kill Humanely | publisher=Halls Create Arts Pte Ltd. | work= [[DesignTaxi]] | date=20 April 2011 | accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The concept design of the layout begins with a steep-angled [[lift hill|lift]] to the {{convert|510|m|ft|adj=on}} (0.317 mile) top, which would take two minutes for the 24-passenger [[train (roller coaster)|train]] to reach. Any passengers that wished to get off could then do so. &lt;ref name=wired/&gt; From there, a {{convert|500|m|ft|adj=on}} drop would take the train to {{convert|180|km/h|mi/h}}, close to its [[terminal velocity]], before flattening out and speeding into the first of its seven slightly [[clothoid]] [[Roller coaster inversions|inversions]].&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt; Each inversion would have a smaller [[diameter]] than the one before in order to maintain the lethal 10 [[g-force|g]] to passengers while the train loses speed. After a sharp right-hand turn the train would enter a straight, where unloading of corpses and loading of new passengers could take place.&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Urbonas and Euthanasia Coaster.jpg|thumb|Julijonas Urbonas and Euthanasia Coaster at HUMAN+ display at the [[Science Gallery]] in [[Dublin]].]]
The Euthanasia Coaster would kill its passengers through prolonged [[cerebral hypoxia]], or insufficient supply of [[oxygen]] to the brain.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The ride's seven inversions would inflict 10 g on its passengers for 60 seconds – causing g-force related symptoms starting with [[greyout (medical)|gray out]] through [[tunnel vision]] to [[syncope (medicine)|black out]] and eventually [[g-LOC]] (g-force induced [[loss of consciousness]]).&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt; Subsequent inversions would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of particularly robust passengers.&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt;

Urbonas's concept drew media attention when shown as part of the HUMAN+ display at the [[Science Gallery]] in [[Dublin]] from April through June 2011.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The display, designated as its 2011 '[[Flagship#Flagship as metaphor|flagship exhibition]]' by the Science Gallery,&lt;ref name="sciencegallery"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/humanplus/ | title=HUMAN+ The Future of Our Species | publisher=Trinity College Dublin | date=1 February 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to show the future of humans and technology.&lt;ref name="culturelab"&gt;{{cite web

[[Lavie Tidhar]]'s short story ''Vladimir Chong Chooses to Die'' incorporates Urbonas's Euthanasia Coaster into the ending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrevu.com/php/Review-id.php?id=15551] Analog Science Fiction and Fact –September 2014 – Vol. CXXXIV No. 9 &lt;/ref&gt;

Glenn Paton’s short film ''H Positive'' explores the motivations of a wealthy man who, upon discovering that he is dying, commissions an architect to build a Euthanasia Coaster identical to Urbonas's design.  Although Urbonas is not mentioned during the film, the end credits affirm that the film was based on Urbonas's project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/dark-short-film-shows-off-theoretical-suicide-roller-coaster/|title=Dark Short Film Shows Off Theoretical Suicide Roller Coaster|publisher=[[Nerdist Industries]]|last=Hart|first=Matthew|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''exemplum''' (Latin for "example", pl. '''exempla''',  ''exempli gratia'' = "for example", abbr.: ''e.g.'') is a moral [[anecdote]], brief or extended, real or fictitious, used to illustrate a point. The word is also used to express an action performed by another and used as an example or model.

==Exemplary literature==

This [[genre]] sprang from the above, in classical, medieval and Renaissance literature, consisting of lives of famous figures, and using these (by emphasizing good or bad character traits) to make a moral point.

Collections of Exempla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicolas |last=Louis |title=L’exemplum en pratiques : production, diffusion et usages des recueils d’exempla latins aux XIIIe-XVe siècles |volume=2 |publisher=Namur-Paris |year=2013 |hdl=2078.2/133816 |url=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00860685/file/Nicolas_LOUIS_-_thA_se_-_enquete_annexe.pdf |format=PDF |pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped [[Middle Ages|medieval]] preachers to adorn their [[sermon]]s, to emphasize moral conclusions or illustrate a point of doctrine. The subject matter could be taken from [[fable]]s, [[Folklore|folktale]]s, [[legend]]s, real history, or natural history. [[Jacques de Vitry]]'s book of exempla, c. 1200, [[Nicholas Bozon]]'s ''Les contes moralisés'' (after 1320), and [[Odo of Cheriton]]'s ''Parabolae'' (after 1225) were famous medieval collections aimed particularly at preachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PscUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |chapter=Introduction |page=5-6 |title=The Dialogues of Creatures Moralysed: A Critical Edition |editor-first=Gregory C. |editor-last=Kratzmann |editor2-first=Elizabeth |editor2-last=Gee |publisher=[[Brill (publisher)|Brill]] Archive |date=1 January 1988 |isbn=9789004085152}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale]]'' became a vivid satire on this genre. There were also notable lay writers of moral tales, such as the 13th century [[Der Stricker]] and the 14th century [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena]] ([[Tales of Count Lucanor]]).
Examples dealing with historical figures include:

*[[Suetonius]]'s ''De vita Caesarum'' or ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]''
*[[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]''
*[[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]''
*[[Petrarch]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)|De viris illustribus]]''
*[[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''
*[[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[On Famous Women]]'' and ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium|On the Fates of Illustrious Men]]''
*[[Christine de Pizan]]'s ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]''.
*''[[Mirror for Magistrates]]'' by various Tudor authors

==Three examples of exempla==

''The Norton Anthology of Western Literature'' includes three exempla (singular, ''exemplum''), stories that illustrate a general principle or underscore a moral lesson: "The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man" and "The King's Tailor's Apprentice" (both from ''The Scholar's Guide'') and "The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck." 

==="The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man"===

In "The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man," told by the father, the three traveling companions of the tale's title are on a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. Near their destination, their provisions are nearly depleted, and the two city dwellers attempt to cheat the country man by telling him that whoever of them dreams the most extraordinary dream shall get the last of their bread.

As the city dwellers sleep, the country man, alert to their intended deception, eats the half-baked bread before retiring.

The city dwellers relate their made-up dreams. One says he was taken to [[heaven]] and led before God by angels. The other says that angels escorted him to [[hell]]. 

The country man says he dreamed the same things that his companions dreamed and, believing them to be forever lost, one to heaven and the other to hell, ate the bread.

The son tells his father the moral of the story: "As it says in the [[proverb]], ‘He who wanted all, lost all.’" He says that the two city dwellers got their just comeuppance. The story says that he wishes they’d been whipped, as the antagonist in another story he has heard, was beaten for his chicanery. His comment is a transition to the next tale, causing the father to ask his son to tell him this story. Thus, the roles of the father and his son are reversed, as the father, who was the storyteller, becomes the listener, and the son, who was his father's audience, becomes the narrator.

==="The King And His Wife"===

The son's story recounts the story of a king's tailor's assistant, a youth by the name of Nedui.

One day while he is away, his master gives the other apprentices bread and [[honey]], but does not save any for Nedui, telling them that Nedui "would not eat honey even if he were here." Upon learning that he has been left out, Nedui avenges himself upon his master by telling the [[eunuch]] whom the king has set over the apprentices as their supervisor that the tailor is subject to seizures of madness, during which he becomes violent and dangerous. In fact, Nedui claims, he has killed those who have happened to be near him when he is in the grip of such a fit. To protect himself, Nedui says, he binds and beats the tailor when such a fit comes over him. He also tells the eunuch what to look for: "When you see him looking all around and feeling the floor with his hands and getting up from his seat and picking up the chair on which he is seated, then you will know that he is mad, and if you do not protect yourself and your servants, he will beat you on the head with a [[Club (weapon)|club]]."

The next day, Nedui hides the tailor's shears, and, when the master, hunting for them,  behaves as Nedui mentioned to the eunuch, the eunuch orders his servants to bind the tailor and beats him himself with a club. His servants also beat him until he is unconscious and "half dead."

When he regains consciousness, the tailor asks the eunuch what [[crime]] he has committed to have deserved such a beating, and the eunuch tells him what Nedui told him about the tailor's seizures. "Friend, when have you ever seen me crazy?" the master asks his apprentice, to which question he receives, from Nedui, the rejoinder: "When have you ever seen me refuse to eat honey?"

The father tells the son the [[moral]] of the story: "The tailor deserved his punishment because if he had kept the precept of Moses, to love his brother as himself, this would not have happened to him."

By having the listener tell the narrator the moral of the story, the storyteller shows that the narrative has successfully served its purpose as an exemplum, as the listener, hearing the story, shows that he is able to ascertain the moral that the tale is intended to express.

==="The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck"===

The third exemplum, "The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck," is a prose, rather than a poetic, narrative. Like a mini-sermon, it preaches against wrong conduct—in this case, sacrilegious behavior. This tale has an identifiable author, Robert Mannyng, who set down the story in the early fourteenth century. ''The Norton Anthology'''s version is translated from [[Middle English]] by Lee Patterson.

To bolster his listener's belief that "most of" his tale is "the [[gospel]] truth," the narrator names the culprits and their victims and cites [[Pope Leo IX|Pope Leo]] as one who knows (and wrote a version of) the narrative and points out that the story is "known in the court at Rome" and has appeared widely in many chronicles, including those "beyond the sea." However, after the telling of the tale, the storyteller admits that some doubt its veracity.

The story starts by identifying several activities that are not allowed in [[Church (building)|church]] or in the [[churchyard]]: "carols, [[wrestling]], or summer games." In addition, "interludes or singing, beating the [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]] [a small drum], or piping. . . . while the [[priest]] is conducting [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]" are "forbidden" and sacrilegious, and "good priests" will not tolerate them.

It is also improper to dance in church, as the story that the narrator is about to tell demonstrates.

When "twelve fools" in Colbeck (or, as the editors’ note explains, "[[Kolbigk]], in [[Saxony]], an area in eastern Germany, just north of the present-day Czech border) decided, one [[Christmas Eve]], to make "a [[Carol (music)|carol]]--madly, as a kind of challenge," and persisted in singing and dancing in the churchyard while the priest was trying to conduct Mass, despite his entreaties to them to stop, the priest calls upon God to [[curse]] them.

The singers’ carol contains three lines, the last of which appears to become the basis of their curse, as they are unable to leave the churchyard or to quit singing or dancing for a year after God curses them for their sacrilegious behavior:

:By the leafy wood rode Bovoline,
:With him he led the fair Mersewine.
:Why are we waiting? Why don’t we go?

As a result of the curse, the dancers cannot stop singing and dancing; neither can they let go of one another's hands.

The priest, too late, sends his son, Ayone, to rescue his daughter, Ave, who is one of the "twelve fools" involved in the dancing. However, due to the curse, when Ayone takes his sister's arm to separate her from the other carolers, it detaches from her body. Miraculously, her wound does not bleed, nor does she die from it.

Ayone takes the arm to his father. The priest tries, three times unsuccessfully, to bury the limb, but the grave casts it back, so the priest displays it inside the church. Everyone, including the [[emperor]], comes to see the cursed dancers, who, despite no rest, food, drink, or sleep, dance non-stop, night and day, regardless of the temperature or the weather. Several times, the emperor orders a covering to be built to protect the dancers from storms, but it is reduced to rubble overnight each time it is built or rebuilt.

After the year has ended, the curse is lifted, and the dancers fall down upon the ground, as if dead.  Three days later, they arise—except for Ave, who has died. Soon after, the priest also dies. The emperor installs the container in the church as a receptacle for the dead girl's arm, and it becomes a holy [[relic]] commemorating the [[miracle]] of the curse.

The other dancers cannot get together again, ever, and must skip, instead of walking, wherever they go. Living mementoes of God's curse against sacrilegious behavior, they bear permanent physical changes to their clothing and their bodies: "Their clothes didn’t rot nor their nails grow; their hair didn’t lengthen nor their [[complexion]] change. Nor did they ever have relief..."

Although some believe and others doubt the authenticity of the tale he's told, the narrator says he recounted the story so that his listeners, taking heed, may be "afraid to carol in a church or churchyard, especially against the priest's will," as "jangling is a form of [[sacrilege]]."

[[File:Lustra (private print) - Ezra Pound - Frontispiece.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of Ezra H. Pound|Ezra Pound photographed in 1913 by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]]]

'''Ezra Weston Loomis Pound''' (30 October 1885&amp;nbsp;– 1 November 1972) was an [[expatriate]] American poet and critic, and a major figure in the early [[modernist poetry]] movement. His contribution to poetry began with his development of [[Imagism]], a movement derived from classical [[Chinese poetry|Chinese]] and [[Japanese poetry|Japanese]] poetry, stressing clarity, precision and economy of language. His works include ''[[Ripostes]]'' (1912), ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1917–1969).

Pound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].{{efn|[[Ernest Hemingway]] wrote in 1925: "[W]e have Pound the major poet devoting, say, one fifth of his time to poetry. With the rest of his time he tries to advance the fortunes, both material and artistic, of his friends. He defends them when they are attacked, he gets them into magazines and out of jail. He loans them money. He sells their pictures. He arranges concerts for them. He writes articles about them. He introduces them to wealthy women. He gets publishers to take their books. He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying and he witnesses their wills. He advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide. And in the end a few of them refrain from knifing him at the first opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway, "Homage to Ezra", ''This Quarter'', 1, Spring 1925, 221–225, in Hemingway (2006), 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;}} Angered by the carnage of [[World War I]], Pound lost faith in [[Great Britain]] and blamed the war on [[usury]] and international capitalism. He moved to Italy in 1924 and throughout the 1930s and 1940s embraced [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|fascism]], expressed support for [[Adolf Hitler]], and wrote for publications owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]]. During [[World War II]], he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Jews]], as a result of which he was arrested in 1945 by American forces in Italy on charges of [[treason]]. He spent months in detention in a U.S. military camp in [[Pisa]], including three weeks in a {{convert|6|by|6|ft|m|adj=on}} outdoor steel cage, which he said triggered a mental breakdown: "when the raft broke and the waters went over me". The following year he was deemed unfit to stand trial, and incarcerated in [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|St. Elizabeths]] psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pisan Cantos'' (80.665–67), Sieburth (2003), xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound began work on sections of ''The Cantos'' while in custody in Italy. These parts were published as ''[[The Cantos#LXXIV–LXXXIV (The Pisan Cantos)|The Pisan Cantos]]'' (1948), for which he was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize]] in 1949 by the [[Library of Congress]], leading to enormous controversy. Largely due to a campaign by his fellow writers, he was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958 and returned to live in Italy until his death. His political views ensure that his work remains as controversial now as it was during his lifetime; in 1933 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called him "a cat that walks by himself, tenaciously unhousebroken and very unsafe for children". Hemingway wrote: "The best of Pound's writing—and it is in the ''Cantos''—will last as long as there is any literature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,745380,00.html "Books: Unpegged Pound"], ''Time'', 20 March 1933; Hemingway (2006), 25, from ''The Cantos of Ezra Pound: Some Testimonies by Ernest Hemingway, Ford Madox Ford, T. S. Eliot, Hugh Walpole, Archibald McLeish, James Joyce, and Others'', Farrar &amp; Rinehart, March 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life (1885–1908)==

===Background===
{{see also|Homer Pound House}}
[[File:Thaddeus C. Pound - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[Thaddeus C. Pound|Thaddeus Pound]], Pound's grandfather, in the late 1880s]]
Pound was born in a small, two-story house in [[Hailey, Idaho|Hailey]], [[Idaho Territory]], the only child of Homer Loomis Pound (1858–1942) and Isabel Weston (1860–1948). His father had worked in Hailey since 1883 as registrar of the [[General Land Office]].&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 4; Ridler, Keith. [http://seattletimes.com/html/travel/2004430400_tridahopoet25.html "Poet's Idaho home is reborn"], Associated Press, 25 May 2008; for Idaho Territory, see Wilson (2014), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both parents' ancestors had emigrated from England in the 17th century. On his mother's side, Pound was descended from [[William Wadsworth (patriarch)|William Wadsworth]] (1594–1675), a [[Puritanism|Puritan]] who emigrated to Boston on the ''[[English ship Lion (1557)|Lion]]'' in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Wadsworths married into the Westons of New York. Harding Weston and Mary Parker were the parents of Isabel Weston, Ezra's mother.&lt;ref name=Moodyxiii/&gt; Harding apparently spent most of his life without work, with his brother, Ezra Weston, and his brother's wife, Frances, looking after Mary and Isabel's needs.&lt;ref name ="Cockram238"/&gt;

On his father's side, the immigrant ancestor was John Pound, a [[Quaker]], who arrived from England around 1650. Ezra's grandfather, [[Thaddeus C. Pound|Thaddeus Coleman Pound]] (1832–1914), was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman from northwest [[Wisconsin]] who had made and lost a fortune in the lumber business. Thaddeus's son Homer, Pound's father, worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business until Thaddeus secured him the appointment as registrar of the Hailey land office. Homer and Isabel married the following year and Homer built a [[Homer Pound House|house in Hailey]].&lt;ref name=Moodyxiii&gt;Moody (2007), xiii–13&lt;/ref&gt; Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887, when he was 18 months old.&lt;ref name ="Cockram238"&gt;Cockram (2005), 238&lt;/ref&gt; Homer followed them, and in 1889 he found a job as an [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] at the [[Philadelphia Mint]]. The family moved to [[Jenkintown, Pennsylvania]], and in 1893 bought a six-bedroom house in [[Wyncote, Pennsylvania|Wyncote]].&lt;ref name=Moodyxiii/&gt;

===Education===
[[File:EzraPound&amp;IsabelPound1898.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=photograph|Pound, in his Cheltenham Military Academy uniform, with his mother in 1898]]
Pound's education began in a series of [[dame school]]s, some of them run by Quakers: Miss Elliott's school in Jenkintown in 1892, the Heathcock family's Chelten Hills School in Wyncote in 1893, and the Florence Ridpath school from 1894, also in Wyncote.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), xiii&lt;/ref&gt; His first publication was on 7 November 1896 in the ''Jenkintown Times-Chronicle'' ("by E. L. Pound, Wyncote, aged 11 years"), a [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]] about [[William Jennings Bryan]], who had just lost the [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 presidential election]]: "There was a young man from the West, / He did what he could for what he thought best; / But election came round, / He found himself drowned, / And the papers will tell you the rest."&lt;ref&gt;Rachewiltz, Moody and Moody (2011), x&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1897 and 1900 Pound attended Cheltenham Military Academy, sometimes as a boarder, where he specialized in Latin. The boys wore [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-style uniforms and besides Latin were taught English, history, arithmetic, marksmanship, military drilling and the importance of submitting to authority. Pound made his first trip overseas in mid-1898 when he was 13, a three-month tour of Europe with his mother and Frances Weston (Aunt Frank), who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- reference for previous two sentences --&gt; After the academy he may have attended Cheltenham Township High School for one year, and in 1901, aged 15, he was admitted to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s College of Liberal Arts.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 14; for Cheltenham Township High School, see McDonald (2005), 91, and Stock (1970), 11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hdpoet.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[H.D.]], c. 1921. She followed Pound to London and became involved in developing [[Imagism]].]]
Pound met Hilda Doolittle (later known as the poet [[H.D.]]) at Pennsylvania in 1901, and she became his first serious romance.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2004), 18; Barnstone (1998), 202&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 she followed Pound to London and became involved in developing the Imagism movement. Between 1905 and 1907 Pound wrote a number of poems for her, 25 of which he hand-bound and called ''Hilda's Book'',&lt;ref&gt;Doolittle (1979), 67–68; ''Hilda's Book'' is in the [[Houghton Library]] at Harvard; see [https://web.archive.org/web/20040607154442/http://loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=201&amp;section=notes "Poems and Translations"], Library of America.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1908 he asked her father, the astronomy professor Charles Doolittle, for permission to marry her, but Doolittle dismissed Pound as a nomad.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2004), 31&lt;/ref&gt; Pound was seeing two other women at the same time—Viola Baxter and Mary Moore—later dedicating a book of poetry, ''Personae'' (1909), to the latter. He asked Moore to marry him too, but she turned him down.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 24–28; for dedication of ''Personae'', see Nadel (1999), xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents and Frances Weston took Pound on another three-month European tour in 1902, after which he transferred, in 1903, to [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in Clinton, New York, possibly because of poor grades. Signed up for the Latin–Scientific course, he studied the [[Provençal dialect]] with William Pierce Shephard and [[Old English]] with Joseph D. Ibbotson; with Shephard he read [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and from this began the idea for a long poem in three parts—of emotion, instruction and contemplation—planting the seeds for ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 18–25&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in 1913, in "How I Began":

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;I resolved that at thirty I would know more about poetry than any man living&amp;nbsp;... that I would know what was accounted poetry everywhere, what part of poetry was 'indestructible', what part could ''not be lost'' by translation and—scarcely less important—what effects were obtainable in ''one'' language only and were utterly incapable of being translated.{{pb}}In this search I learned more or less of nine foreign languages, I read Oriental stuff in translations, I fought every University regulation and every professor who tried to make me learn anything except this, or who bothered me with "requirements for degrees".&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1964), 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pound graduated from Hamilton College with a BPhil in 1905, then studied [[Romance languages]] under Hugo A. Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), where he obtained an MA in early 1906 and registered to write a PhD thesis on the jesters in [[Lope de Vega]]'s plays. A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees and gave him a travel grant of $500, which he used to return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 19, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Pound spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace. There, on 31 May 1906, he happened to be standing outside when the attempted assassination of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso]] took place, and Pound subsequently left the country for fear he would be identified with the anarchists. After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris, attending lectures at the [[Sorbonne]], followed by a week in London.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

In July he returned to the United States, where in September his first essay, "Raphaelite Latin", was published in ''Book News Monthly''. He took courses in the English department at Penn in 1907, where he fell out with several lecturers; during lectures on Shakespeare by [[Felix Emanuel Schelling|Felix Schelling]], the department head, he would wind an enormous tin watch very slowly while Schelling spoke. His fellowship was not renewed. Schelling told him that he was wasting everyone's time, and Pound left without finishing his doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
From late 1907 Pound taught Romance languages at [[Wabash College]] in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], a conservative town that he called "the [[Inferno (Dante)#Sixth Circle (Heresy)|sixth circle of hell]]". The equally conservative college dismissed him after he deliberately provoked the college authorities. Smoking was forbidden, but he would smoke [[cigarillo]]s in his office down the corridor from the president's. He annoyed his landlords by entertaining friends, including women, and was forced out of one house after "[t]wo stewdents found me sharing my meagre repast with the lady–gent impersonator in my privut apartments", he told a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

He was asked to leave the college in 1908 after offering a stranded chorus girl tea and his bed for the night when she was caught in a snowstorm. When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, his insistence that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief. Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 60–62; Wilhelm (1985), 177; Carpenter (1988), 80; Nadel (2004), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==London (1908–1920)==

===Introduction to the literary scene===
Pound arrived in [[Gibraltar]] on 23 March 1908, where for a few weeks he earned $15 a day working as a guide to American tourists. By the end of April he was in [[Venice]], living over a bakery near the San Vio bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 62, 63; for the bakery, Tytell (1987), 35&lt;/ref&gt; In July he self-published his first book of poetry, ''[[A Lume Spento]]'' (''With Tapers Quenched''). The  ''London Evening Standard'' called it "wild and haunting stuff, absolutely poetic, original, imaginative, passionate, and spiritual".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1917), 5&lt;/ref&gt; The title was from the third canto of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Purgatorio]]'', which alluded to the death of [[Manfred, King of Sicily]]. The book was dedicated to his friend, the Philadelphia artist [[William Brooke Smith]], who had recently died of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinnes (1980), xi; for information about Brooke Smith, see Carpenter (1988), 91, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:48 Langham Street, London W1.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|upright|48 Langham Street, London W1]]
In August Pound moved to London, where he lived almost continuously for the next 12 years; he told his university friend [[William Carlos Williams]]: "London, deah old Lundon, is the place for poesy." English poets such as [[Maurice Hewlett]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]] had made a particular kind of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] verse—stirring, pompous and propagandistic—popular with the public. According to modernist scholar James Knapp, Pound rejected the idea of poetry as "versified moral essay"; he wanted to focus on the individual experience, the concrete rather than the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp (1979), 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in the city with just ₤3, he moved into lodgings at 48 Langham Street, near [[Great Titchfield Street]], a penny bus ride from the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; The house sat across an alley from the Yorkshire Grey pub, which made an appearance in the ''Pisan Cantos'', "concerning the landlady's ''doings'' / with a lodger unnamed / az waz near Gt Titchfield St. next door to the pub".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 4; Pound (2003), 80, lines 334–336; also see Campbell, James. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/poetry3 "Home from home"], ''The Guardian'', 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound persuaded the bookseller [[Charles Elkin Mathews|Elkin Mathews]] to display ''A Lume Spento'', and by October 1908 he was being discussed by the literati. In December he published a second collection, ''A Quinzaine for This Yule'', and after the death of a lecturer at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] he managed to acquire a position lecturing in the evenings, from January to February 1909, on "The Development of Literature in Southern Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 5–11&lt;/ref&gt; He would spend his mornings in the [[British Museum Reading Room]], then lunch at the Vienna Café on [[Oxford Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ford Madox Ford]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;Ezra&amp;nbsp;... would approach with the step of a dancer, making passes with a cane at an imaginary opponent. He would wear trousers made of green billiard cloth, a pink coat, a blue shirt, a tie hand-painted by a Japanese friend, an immense sombrero, a flaming beard cut to a point, and a single, large blue earring.&lt;ref&gt;Ford 1999, 277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hemingway described Pound as "tall&amp;nbsp;... [with] a patchy red beard, fine eyes, strange haircuts and&amp;nbsp;... very shy": "But he has the temperament of a ''[[Spanish Fighting Bull|toro di lidia]]'' from the breeding establishments of [[Miura bull|Don Eduardo Miura]]. No one ever presents a cape, or shakes a [[muleta]] at him without getting a charge."&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (2006), 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting Dorothy Shakespear, ''Personae''===
At a literary [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] in January 1909, Pound met the novelist [[Olivia Shakespear]] and her daughter [[Dorothy Shakespear|Dorothy]], who became his wife in 1914. Through Olivia Shakespear he was introduced to her former lover [[W. B. Yeats]], in Pound's view the greatest living poet. Pound had sent Yeats a copy of ''A Lume Spento'' the previous year, before he left for Venice, and Yeats had apparently found it charming. The men became close friends, although Yeats was older by 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DorothyPound.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph|upright|Pound met [[Dorothy Shakespear]] in 1909, and they were married in 1914.]]
Pound was also introduced to sculptor [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], painter [[Wyndham Lewis]] and to the cream of London's literary circle, including the poet [[T. E. Hulme]]. The American heiress Margaret Lanier Cravens (1881–1912) became a patron; after knowing him a short time she offered a large annual sum to allow him to focus on his work. Cravens killed herself in 1912, after the pianist [[Walter Morse Rummel|Walter Rummel]], long the object of her affection, married someone else. She may also have been discouraged by Pound's engagement to Dorothy.&lt;ref&gt;For the money from Cravens, see Moody (2007), 124–125; for the speculation that they were lovers, see Carpenter (1988), 155; Dennis (1999), 264; Pound, Omar (1988), 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1909 the ''Personae'' collection became the first of Pound's works to have any commercial success. It was favorably reviewed; one review said it was "full of human passion and natural magic".&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 91; Elek, Jon. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=2841 "Personae"], ''The Literary Encyclopedia'', 8 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rupert Brooke]] was unimpressed, complaining that Pound had fallen under the influence of [[Walt Whitman]], writing in "unmetrical sprawling lengths".&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 93&lt;/ref&gt; In September a further 27 poems appeared as ''Exultations''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Peter. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5224 "Exultations"], ''The Literary Encyclopedia'', 20 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time Pound moved into new rooms at Church Walk, off [[Kensington High Street]], where he lived most of the time until 1914.&lt;ref name="Moody 2007, 180"&gt;Moody (2007), 180&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1910 Pound returned to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided with the publication of his first book of literary criticism'', [[The Spirit of Romance]]'', based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 70, 81–89&lt;/ref&gt; His essays on the United States were written during this period, compiled as ''Patria Mia'' and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 62–65&lt;/ref&gt; He found the [[New York Public Library]], then being built, especially offensive and, according to [[Paul L. Montgomery]], visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;Montgomery, Paul L. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB091EF83A591A7493C0A9178AD95F468785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22A%20Man%20of%20Contradictions%22%20Ezra%20Pound&amp;st=cse "Ezra Pound: A Man of Contradictions"], ''The New York Times'', 2 November 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound persuaded his parents to finance his passage back to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 59–62&lt;/ref&gt; It was nearly 30 years before he visited the United States again. On 22 February 1911 he sailed from New York on the [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|R.M.S. ''Mauretania'']], arriving in Southampton six days later.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 95&lt;/ref&gt; After a few days in London he went to Paris, where he worked on a new collection of poetry, ''Canzoni'' (1911), panned by the ''Westminster Gazette'' as a "medley of pretension". When he returned to London in August 1911, [[Alfred Richard Orage|A. R. Orage]], editor of the socialist journal ''[[The New Age]],'' hired him to write a weekly column, giving him a steady income.&lt;ref&gt;Elek, Jon. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=6100 "Canzoni"], ''The Literary Encyclopedia'', 8 March 2005. Orage was referred to in ''The Cantos'' ([[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|Possum]] refers to T. S. Eliot): "But the lot of 'em, / Yeats, Possum and Wyndham / had no ground beneath 'em. / Orage had." See Wilhelm (2008), 83, citing Canto 98/685.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagism===
{{further|Des Imagistes}}
[[File:Home of Ezra Pound, London.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|10 Church Walk, [[Kensington]]]]
Hilda Doolittle arrived in London from Philadelphia in May 1911 with the poet Frances Gregg and Gregg's mother; when they returned in September, Doolittle decided to stay on. Pound introduced her to his friends, including the poet [[Richard Aldington]], whom she would marry in 1913. Before that the three of them lived in Church Walk, Kensington—Pound at no. 10, Doolittle at no. 6, and Aldington at no. 8—and worked daily in the British Museum Reading Room.&lt;ref name="Moody 2007, 180"/&gt;

At the museum Pound met regularly with the curator and poet [[Laurence Binyon]], who introduced him to the East Asian artistic and literary concepts that inspired the imagery and technique of his later poetry. The museum's visitors' books show that Pound was often found during 1912 and 1913 in the Print Room examining Japanese [[ukiyo-e]], some inscribed with [[Waka (poetry)|Japanese ''waka'' verse]], a genre of poetry whose economy and strict conventions likely contributed to Imagist techniques of composition.&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith (2011), 103–164; also see Arrowsmith (2011), 27–42, 118, and Dennis (2000), 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Arrowsmith lecture"&gt;Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard (March 2012). [http://vimeo.com/arrowsmith/cosmopolitanism-and-modernism "Cosmopolitanism and Modernism"] (video of a lecture discussing the importance of Japanese culture to Pound's early poetry), [[London University School of Advanced Study]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was working at the time on the poems that became ''Ripostes'' (1912), trying to move away from his earlier work; he wrote that the "stilted language" of ''Canzoni'' had reduced Ford Madox Ford to rolling on the floor with laughter.&lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (1961), 112.&lt;/ref&gt; He realized with his translation work that the problem lay not in his knowledge of the other languages, but in his use of English:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;What obfuscated me was not the Italian but the crust of dead English, the sediment present in my own available vocabulary&amp;nbsp;... You can't go round this sort of thing. It takes six or eight years to get educated in one's art, and another ten to get rid of that education.

Neither can anyone learn English, one can only learn a series of Englishes. Rossetti made his own language. I hadn't in 1910 made a language, I don't mean a language to use, but even a language to think in.&lt;ref&gt;Venuti (1979), 88; Knapp (1979), 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While living at Church Walk in 1912, Pound, Aldington and Doolittle started working on ideas about language. While in the British Museum tearoom one afternoon, they decided to begin a 'movement' in poetry, called Imagism. ''Imagisme'', Pound would write in ''Riposte'', is "concerned solely with ''language'' and ''presentation''".&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 180, 222&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was clarity: a fight against abstraction, romanticism, rhetoric, inversion of word order, and over-use of adjectives. They agreed on three principles:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;1. Direct treatment of the "thing" whether subjective or objective.&lt;br /&gt;
2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.&lt;br /&gt;
3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome.&lt;ref name=Pound1918&gt;Pound, Ezra. "A Retrospect", in T. S. Eliot. (1968). ''Literary Essays of Ezra Pound''. New York: New Directions Publishing (first published 1918), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uOQMlH_zYNAC&amp;pg=PA3 3–5].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Superfluous words, particularly adjectives, should be avoided, as well as expressions like "dim lands of peace", which Pound thought dulled the image by mixing the abstract with the concrete. He wrote that the natural object was always the "adequate symbol". Poets should "go in fear of abstractions", and should not re-tell in mediocre verse what has already been told in good prose.&lt;ref name=Pound1918/&gt;

A typical example is Pound's "[[In a Station of the Metro]]" (1913), inspired by an experience on the [[Paris Métro|Paris Underground]], about which he wrote, "I got out of a train at, I think, [[Concorde (Paris Métro)|La Concorde]], and in the jostle I saw a beautiful face, and then, turning suddenly, another and another, and then a beautiful child's face, and then another beautiful face. All that day I tried to find words for what this made me feel." He worked on the poem for a year, reducing it to its essence in the style of a Japanese [[haiku]].&lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (1969), 34; for its description as ''the'' classic Imagist poem, see Witemeyer (1999), 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other modernist artists of the period, Pound was inspired by Japanese art, but the aim was to re-make—or as Pound said, "make it new"—and blend cultural styles, instead of copying directly or slavishly. He may have been inspired by a [[Suzuki Harunobu]] print he almost certainly saw in the British Library (Richard Aldington mentions the specific prints he matched to verse), and probably attempted to write haiku-like verse during this period.&lt;ref name ="Arrowsmith lecture"/&gt;

===''Ripostes'' and translations===
''[[Ripostes]]'', published in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. [[Michael J. Alexander|Michael Alexander]] describes the poems as showing a greater concentration of meaning and economy of rhythm than his earlier work.&lt;ref name=Alexander1979p62&gt;Alexander (1979), 62&lt;/ref&gt; It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward [[Imagism]]; his first use of the word ''Imagiste'' appears in his prefatory note to the volume.&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Ezra, ''Ripostes'', Stephen Swift &amp; Co Ltd, London, 1912; Pound (1918), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uOQMlH_zYNAC&amp;pg=PA4 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For submission and publication dates, see Pound, Ezra. ''Poems and translations'', Library of America, (2003), 1239&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century [[Old English literature|Old English]] poem ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]'', although not a literal translation.&lt;ref&gt;For the original text of ''The Seafarer'', see [http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=text&amp;id=Sfr "The Seafarer"], Anglo-Saxons.net; for Pound's interpretation, see Pound, Ezra.

Alexander writes that in some circles, Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to ''The Seafarer'' was a rehearsal for the negative response to ''Homage to Sextus Propertius'' in 1919.&lt;ref name=Alexander1979p62/&gt; His translation from the Italian of ''Sonnets and ballate of [[Guido Cavalcanti]]'' was also published in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2010), xv&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ezra Pound - Cathay Title Page 1915.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=book cover|In 1913 Pound was given [[Ernest Fenollosa]]'s unpublished notes, which led to ''[[Cathay (poetry collection)|Cathay]]'' (1915).]]

Pound was fascinated by the translations of [[Japanese poetry]] and [[Noh]] plays which he discovered in the papers of [[Ernest Fenollosa]], an American professor who had taught in Japan. Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, Mary McNeil Fenollosa, decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work; she was looking for someone who cared about poetry rather than philology.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 239&lt;/ref&gt; Pound edited and published Fenellosa's ''The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry: A Critical Edition'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The title page of the collection ''[[Cathay (poetry collection)|Cathay]]'' (1915), refers to the poet "Rihaku", the pronunciation in Japanese of the [[Tang dynasty]] Chinese poet, [[Li Bai]], whose poems were much beloved in China and Japan for their technical mastery and much translated in the West because of their seeming simplicity. Alexander thinks this is the most attractive  of Pound's work.&lt;ref name=Alexander95&gt;Alexander (1979), 95&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese critic [[Wai-lim Yip]] writes of it: "One can easily excommunicate Pound from the Forbidden City of Chinese studies, but it seems clear that in his dealings with ''Cathay,'' even when he is given only the barest details, he is able to get into the central concerns of the original author by what we may perhaps call a kind of clairvoyance."&lt;ref&gt;Yip, Wai-lim.  ''Ezra Pound's Cathay''. Princeton University Press, 1969, cited in Alexander (1979), 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound could not understand Chinese himself, yet some critics see his translations of Chinese poetry as among the best (others complain of their mistakes).&lt;ref name=Alexander95/&gt; ''Cathay'' was the first of many translations Pound would make from the Chinese. Pound often followed the translations made by [[Herbert Giles]] in his ''[[History of Chinese Literature]] '' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Orientalism, Modernism, and the American Poem | first = Robert |last = Kern | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-521-49613-1 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=uWeRGJW5sNwC&amp;pg=PA185 | pp= [https://books.google.com/books?id=kxK2RkkL_asC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Giles&amp;f=false 186–189]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used Fenollosa's work as a starting point for what he called the [[ideogrammic method]], which proceeded on Fenollosa's entirely mistaken but fruitful idea that each character represented an image or pictograph, based on sight rather than sound.&lt;ref&gt;"The Fenollosa Papers" in Stock (1965), 177–179&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Graves]] recalled "I once asked Arthur Waley how much Chinese Pound knew; Waley shook his head despondently."&lt;ref&gt;Graves, from "These Be Your Gods, O Israel" (138–139)&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Yao, scholar of American and Asian literature, sees ''Cathay'' as a "major feat"; a work where Pound shows that translation is possible without a thorough knowledge of the source language. Yao does not view Pound's lack of Chinese as an obstacle, and states that the poet's trawl through centuries of scholarly interpretations resulted in a genuine understanding of the original poem.&lt;ref&gt;Yao (2010), 36–39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage, ''Blast''===
[[File:William Butler Yeats 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[W. B. Yeats]] invited Pound to spend the winter of 1913–1914 with him in Sussex.]]

In August 1912 [[Harriet Monroe]] hired Pound as a regular contributor to ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]''. He submitted his own poems, as well as poems by [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], Yeats, H.D. and Aldington, and collected material for a 64-page anthology, ''Des Imagistes'' (1914). The Imagist movement began to attract attention from critics.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 143–147; Tytell (1987), 97&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1913 Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, rented Stone Cottage in [[Coleman's Hatch]], Sussex, and invited Pound to accompany him as his secretary. They stayed there for 10 weeks, reading and writing, walking in the woods and fencing. It was the first of three winters they spent together at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Pound married on 20 April 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 240; Longenbach (1988); Longenbach, James. [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/10/books/the-odd-couple-pound-and-yeats-together.html "The Odd Couple: Pound and Yeats Together"], ''The New York Times'', 10 January 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage had proceeded despite opposition from her parents, who worried about Pound's meager income, earned from contributions to literary magazines and probably less than £300 a year. Dorothy's annual income was £50, aided by £150 from her family. Her parents eventually consented, perhaps out of fear that she was getting older with no other suitor in sight. Pound's concession to marry in church helped convince them. Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, with the newly wed Hilda (H.D.) and Richard Aldington living next door.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 246–249&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound wrote for Wyndham Lewis' literary magazine ''[[Blast (magazine)|Blast]],'' although only two issues were published. An advertisement in ''The Egoist'' promised it would cover "Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art". Pound took the opportunity to extend the definition of Imagisme to art, naming it [[Vorticism]]: "The image is a radiant node or cluster; it is&amp;nbsp;... a ''vortex'', from which, and through which, and into which, ideas are constantly rushing."&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 230, 256&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to the magazine, the poet [[Lascelles Abercrombie]] called for the rejection of Imagism and a return to the traditionalism of [[William Wordsworth]]; Pound challenged him to a duel on the basis that "Stupidity carried beyond a certain point becomes a public menace".&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 159&lt;/ref&gt; Abercrombie suggested their choice of weapon be unsold copies of their own books.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, James. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/poetry3 "Home from home"], ''The Guardian'', 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of ''Blast'' was celebrated at a dinner attended by New England poet [[Amy Lowell]], then in London to meet the Imagists. But Hilda and Richard were already moving away from Pound's understanding of the movement, as he aligned more with Wyndham Lewis's ideas. When Lowell agreed to finance an anthology of Imagist poets, Pound's work was not included. Upset at Lowell, he began to call ''Imagisme'' "Amygism", and in July 1914 he declared the movement dead and asked that the group not continue to call themselves Imagists. They dissented, not believing that the movement was Pound's invention, and Lowell eventually Anglicized the term.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 222–225&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I, disillusionment===
{{further|Lost Generation}}
[[File:T. S. Eliot by Lady Ottoline Morrell, 1923.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=photograph|[[T.S. Eliot]] in 1923. Pound persuaded ''Poetry'' to publish Eliot's "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]".]]
Between 1914 and 1916 Pound assisted in the serialisation of James Joyce's ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' in ''The Egoist'', then helped to have it published in book form. In 1915 he persuaded ''Poetry'' to publish [[T. S. Eliot]]'s "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]". Eliot had sent "Prufrock" to almost every editor in England, but was rejected. He eventually sent it to Pound, who instantly saw it as a work of genius and submitted it to ''Poetry''.&lt;ref name=Aiken&gt;Aiken (1965), 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; "[Eliot] has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN", Pound wrote to Monroe in October 1914. "The rest of the promising young have done one or the other but never both. Most of the swine have done neither."&lt;ref&gt;Mertens, Richard. [http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0108/features/letter.html "Letter by letter"], ''University of Chicago Magazine'', April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication in 1915 of ''Cathay'', Pound mentioned he was working on a long poem, casting about for the correct form. He told a friend in August: "It is a huge, I was going to say, gamble, but shan't", and in September described it as a "cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore". About a year later, in January 1917, he had the first three trial cantos, distilled to one, published as Canto I in ''Poetry''.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; He was now a regular contributor to three literary magazines. From 1917 he wrote music reviews for ''The New Age'' under the pen name William Atheling, and weekly pieces for ''The Egoist'' and ''[[The Little Review]]''; many of the latter were directed against provincialism and ignorance. The volume of writing exhausted him. He feared he was wasting his time writing outside poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 330, 334&lt;/ref&gt; exclaiming that he "''must'' stop writing so much prose".&lt;ref name="m342"&gt;Moody (2007), 342&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound 01 (brightened).jpg|thumb|upright|Pound commissioned this sculpture from [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] in 1913.]]
Pound was deeply affected by the war. He was devastated when Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, from whom he had commissioned a sculpture of himself two years earlier, was killed in the trenches in 1915. He published ''Gaudier-Brzeska: A Memoir'' the following year, in reaction to what he saw as an unnecessary loss.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 174, 180–182&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1917 his depression worsened. He blamed American provincialism for the seizure of the October issue of ''The Little Review''.  The [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]] applied the [[Comstock Laws]] against an article Lewis wrote, describing it as lewd and indecent. Around the same time, Hulme was killed by shell-fire in Flanders, and Yeats married [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]].&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 334–335&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, after a bout of illness which was presumably the [[Spanish influenza]], Pound decided to stop writing for ''The Little Review'', mostly because of the volume of work. He asked the publisher for a raise to hire 23-year-old [[Iseult Gonne]] as a typist, causing rumors that Pound was having an affair with her, but he was turned down.&lt;ref name="m342" /&gt;

In 1919 he published a collection of his essays for ''The Little Review'' as ''Instigations'', and in the March 1919 issue ''Poetry,'' he published ''Poems from the Propertius Series'', which appeared to be a translation of the Latin Poet [[Sextus Propertius]]. When he included this in his next poetry collection in 1921, he had renamed it ''Homage to Sextus Propertius'' in response to criticism of his translation skills. "Propertius" is not a strict translation; biographer David Moody describes it as "the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence". Harriet Monroe, editor of ''Poetry'', published a letter from a professor of Latin, [[William Gardner Hale|W. G. Hale]], saying that Pound was "incredibly ignorant" of the language, and alluded to "about three-score errors" in ''Homage''. Monroe did not publish Pound's response, which began "Cat-piss and porcupines!!" and continued, "The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Fitzgerald]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar]] is a translation". Moore interpreted Pound's silence after that as his resignation as foreign editor.&lt;ref&gt;Kenner (1971), 286&lt;/ref&gt;

His poem ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' consists of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Ezra. [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/23538/pg23538.html "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley"], Project Gutenberg, 18 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Published in June 1920, it marked his farewell to London. He was disgusted by the massive loss of life during the war and was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word ''usury'' appears in his work for the first time. The critic [[F. R. Leavis]] saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2005), 149; Leavis (1932), 134, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war had shattered Pound's belief in modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own future as a poet. He had only the ''New Age'' to write for; his relationship with ''Poetry'' was finished, ''The Egoist'' was quickly running out of money because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's ''Ulysses'', and the funds for ''The Little Review'' had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over and resolved to move to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 394–396&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Age'' published Pound's ''Axiomata'' in January 1921, a statement of his views on consciousness and the universe: "the intimate essence of the universe is ''not'' of the same nature as our own consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (1969), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YN_FZn452n4C&amp;pg=PA25 25]; Orage (1921), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOkS64ayYvgC&amp;pg=PA201 201]&lt;/ref&gt; Orage wrote in the same issue:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.&amp;nbsp;... [He] has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon more than one of the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture, and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus&amp;nbsp;... With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends&amp;nbsp;... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual&amp;nbsp;... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.&lt;ref&gt;Orage (1921), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOkS64ayYvgC&amp;pg=PA199 199–200]; Stock (1970), 235; Moody (2007), 410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Paris (1921–1924)==

[[File:Olga Rudge advertisement.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|Pound met [[Olga Rudge]] in 1922.]]
The Pounds settled in Paris in January 1921, and several months later moved into an inexpensive apartment at 70 ''bis'' [[:fr:Rue Notre Dame des Champs|Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Pound became friendly with [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Fernand Léger]] and others of the [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movements, as well as [[Basil Bunting]], Ernest Hemingway and his wife, [[Hadley Richardson]].&lt;ref name="Meyers 1985 70 74"&gt;Meyers (1985), 70–74&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of his time building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for the bookstore [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], and in 1921 the volume ''Poems 1918–1921'' was published. In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of ''[[The Waste Land]]'', then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who [[Blue pencil (editing)|blue-inked]] the manuscript with comments like "make up yr. mind&amp;nbsp;..." and "georgian".&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein (1999), 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot wrote: "I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius."&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

In 1924 Pound secured funding for Ford Madox Ford's ''[[The Transatlantic Review]]'' from American attorney [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]]. The ''Review'' published works by Pound, Hemingway and [[Gertrude Stein]], as well as extracts from Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', before the money ran out in 1925. It also published several Pound music reviews, later collected into ''Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony''.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 430–431, 448&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway asked Pound to blue-ink his short stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong relationship of mutual respect and friendship, living on the same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. "They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work", writes Hemingway biographer [[Jeffrey Meyers]], with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told [[Sherwood Anderson]], "[Ezra] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish".&lt;ref name="Meyers 1985 70 74"/&gt;

Pound was 36 when he met the 26-year-old American violinist [[Olga Rudge]] in Paris in late 1922, beginning a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer [[John Tytell]] believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had turned a blind eye to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress [[Natalie Barney]] in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]]. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy [[Youngstown, Ohio]], steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the [[Rive Droite|Right Bank]], socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 180; Wilhelm (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UpmBwzOT7hwC&amp;pg=PA251 251]&lt;/ref&gt; They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with [[George Antheil]] to apply the concept of [[Vorticism]] to music, and managed to write two operas, including ''Le Testament de Villon''. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.&lt;ref&gt;For his operas, see Kenner (1973), 390; for his pieces for violin, see Stock (1970), 252–256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy (1924–1945)==

===Children===
[[File:Barche-Rapallo.JPG|left|thumb|alt=photograph|The Pounds moved to [[Rapallo]] in 1924.&lt;ref name=Tytell191/&gt;]]

The Pounds were unhappy in Paris; Dorothy complained about the winters and Ezra's health was poor. At one dinner, a guest randomly tried to stab him; to Pound  this underlined that their time in France was over.&lt;ref name=Tytell191/&gt; Hemingway saw how Pound "indulged in a small nervous breakdown", leading to two days in an American hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (1981), 127&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to move to a quieter place, choosing [[Rapallo]], Italy, a town of 15,000. "Italy is my place for starting things", he told a friend.&lt;ref name=Tytell191&gt;Tytell (1987), 191–193&lt;/ref&gt; During this period they lived on Dorothy's income, supplemented by dividends from stock she had invested in.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Olga Rudge, pregnant with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had little interest in raising a child, but may have felt that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, [[Mary de Rachewiltz|Mary]]. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 198&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pound told Dorothy about the birth, she separated from him for much of that year and the next.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&amp;pg=PA13 13–15]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1925, she left on an extended trip to Egypt. She was pregnant by her return in March.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 450–451&lt;/ref&gt; In June she and Pound left Rapallo for Paris for the premiere of ''[[Le Testament de Villon]]'', without mentioning the pregnancy to his friends or parents. In September, Hemingway drove Dorothy to the [[American Hospital of Paris]] for the birth of a son, [[Omar Pound]]. In a letter to his parents in October, Pound wrote, "next generation (male) arrived. Both D &amp; it appear to be doing well".&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 452–453&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had bought her a house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had a single pair of shoes, and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;For the house in Venice, see Tytell (1987), 198, and Mamoli Zorzi (2007), 15, 23; for Mary's memoir, see de Rachewiltz (1971), 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 the literary magazine ''This Quarter'' dedicated its first issue to Pound, including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce. Pound published ''Cantos XVII–XIX'' in the winter editions. In March 1927 he launched his own literary magazine, ''The Exile'', but only four issues were published. It did well in the first year, with contributions from Hemingway, [[E. E. Cummings]], Basil Bunting, Yeats, William Carlos Williams and [[Robert McAlmon]];  some of the poorest work in the magazine were Pound's rambling editorials on [[Confucianism]] and or in praise of Lenin, according to biographer J. J. Wilhelm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&amp;pg=PA22 Wilhelm (1994), 22–24]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work on Fenollosa's manuscripts, and in 1928 won ''[[The Dial]]'''s poetry award for his translation of the [[Confucian classic]] ''[[Great Learning]]'' (''Dà Xué'', transliterated as ''Ta Hio'').&lt;ref name=Nadelxxii&gt;Nadel (1999), xxi–xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; That year his parents Homer and Isabel visited him in Rapallo, seeing him for the first time since 1914. By then Homer had retired, so they decided to move to Rapallo themselves. They took a small house, Villa Raggio, on a hill above the town.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound began work on ''[[The Cantos]]'' in earnest after relocating to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to ''paradiso terrestre''. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922.&lt;ref name=Terrellvii&gt;Terrell (1980), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8uEqOrAnat0C&amp;pg=PR7 vii]&lt;/ref&gt; The first three appear in ''Poetry'' in June–August 1917. The ''Malatesta Cantos'' appeared in ''[[The Criterion]]'' in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in ''The Transatlantic Review'' in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of ''A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book''.&lt;ref&gt;Bush (1976), xiii–xv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turn to fascism, World War II===
Pound came to believe that the cause of World War I was finance capitalism, which he called "[[usury]]", that the solution lay in [[C. H. Douglas]]'s idea of [[social credit]], and that [[fascism]] was the vehicle for reform. He had met Douglas in the ''New Age'' offices and had been impressed by his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Preda (2005), 90&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a series of lectures on economics, and made contact&lt;!--vague--&gt; with politicians in the United States to discuss education, interstate commerce and international affairs. Although Hemingway advised against it, on 30 January 1933 Pound met [[Benito Mussolini]]. Olga Rudge played for Mussolini and told him about Pound, who had earlier sent him a copy of ''Cantos XXX''. During the meeting Pound tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas, but Mussolini brushed them aside, though he called the ''Cantos'' "''divertente''" (entertaining). The meeting was recorded in ''Canto XLI'': "'Ma questo' /  said the boss, 'è divertente.'" Pound said he had "never met anyone who seemed to ''get'' my ideas so quickly as the boss".&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 228–232&lt;/ref&gt;

When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to organize the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar for the first time in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C., where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 250–253&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1939 he received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College, and a week later returned to Italy from the States and began writing [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] material for Italian newspapers. He wrote to [[James Laughlin]] that Roosevelt represented Jewry, and signed the letter with "[[Heil Hitler]]". He started writing for ''Action'', a newspaper owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], arguing that the [[Third Reich]] was the "natural civilizer of Russia".&lt;ref name=Tytell254&gt;Tytell (1987), 254&lt;/ref&gt; After war broke out in September that year, he began a furious letter-writing campaign to the politicians he had petitioned six months earlier, arguing that the war was the result of an international banking conspiracy and that the United States should keep out of it.&lt;ref name=Tytell253&gt;Tytell (1987), 253–265&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytell writes that, by the 1940s, no American or English poet had been so active politically since [[William Blake]]. Pound wrote over a thousand letters a year during the 1930s and presented his ideas in hundreds of articles, as well as in ''The Cantos''. His greatest fear was an economic structure dependent on the armaments industry, where the profit motive would govern war and peace. He read [[George Santayana]] and ''The Law of Civilization and Decay'' by [[Brooks Adams]], finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant. He wrote in ''[[The Japan Times]]'' that "Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a 'country run by Jews,'" and told Sir Oswald Mosley's newspaper that the English were a slave race governed since Waterloo by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].&lt;ref name=Tytell253/&gt;

Pound broadcast over Rome Radio, although the Italian government was at first reluctant, concerned that he might be a double agent. He told a friend: "It took me, I think it was, ''two'' years, insistence and wrangling etc., to ''get hold'' of their microphone."&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 260&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded over a hundred broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940 he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a "rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar", that throughout the "disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage". The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped—his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo—and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 264–266&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadcasts were monitored by the United States [[Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service]] listening station at [[Princeton University]], and in July 1943 Pound was indicted ''in absentia'' for treason. He answered the charge by writing a letter to Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]], which Tytell describes as "long, reasoned, and temperate", defending his right to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 268–270&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to broadcast and write under pseudonyms until April 1945, shortly before his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Gill (2005), 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

The war years threw Pound's domestic arrangements into disarray. Olga lost possession of her house in Venice and took a small house with Mary above Rapallo at Sant' Ambrogio.&lt;ref&gt;Gery (2010), 222&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 Pound and Dorothy were evicted from their apartment in Rapallo. His mother's apartment was too small, and the couple moved in with Olga. Mary, then 19 and finished with convent school, was quickly sent back to Gais in Switzerland, leaving Pound, as she would later write, "pent up with two women who loved him, whom he loved, and who coldly hated each other."&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound was in Rome early in September when [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]]. He borrowed a pair of hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked the rest of the way; he apparently traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.{{efn|Stock (1970): "In a letter written in October 1966 Mrs Pound recalled the period in these words: 'E.P. was in Rome when it was taken and he walked out (in a pair of Degli Uberti's heavy boots, many years later restored to owner) along the only road going north not infested by troops—spent a night in the open and with some peasants—got to a junction where there was a train going north with a herd of the dismantled Italian army ...' In an article published in 1966 his daughter said that during the long journey he slept in farms, in dormitories, and in the open, receiving food from kindly women on the way. Altogether Pound travelled more than 450 miles, arriving at Gais, his daughter said, 'one late afternoon, exhausted, his feet all blisters'."&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 401; also see Tytell (1987), 264–273&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He returned home to Rapallo, where on 3 May 1945, four days after Mussolini was shot, armed [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] arrived at the house to find Pound alone. He stuffed a copy of Confucius and a Chinese dictionary in his pocket before he was taken to their headquarters in [[Chiavari]]. He was released shortly afterwards, then with Olga gave himself up to an American military post in the nearby town of [[Lavagna]].&lt;ref name = Sieburthix/&gt;

[[File:Toilet paper, Pisan Cantos.JPG|upright|left|thumb|alt=photograph|Sheet of toilet paper showing start of Canto LXXXIV, c. May 1945, suggesting Pound began it in the steel cage&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TubCKx3F6UQC&amp;pg=PR36 xxxvi]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Pound was transferred to U.S. [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|Counter Intelligence Corps]] headquarters in Genoa, where he was interrogated by Frank L. Amprin, an FBI agent assigned by [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. Pound asked to send a cable to [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] to offer to help negotiate peace with Japan. He also asked to be allowed a final broadcast, a script called "Ashes of Europe Calling", in which he recommended peace with Japan, American management of Italy, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, and leniency toward Germany. His requests were denied and the script was forwarded to Hoover.&lt;ref name = Sieburthix&gt;Sieburth (2003), ix–xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May, the day Germany surrendered, Pound told an American reporter, Ed Johnston, that Hitler was "a Jeanne d'Arc, a saint", and that Mussolini was an "imperfect character who lost his head".&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth Stock (1970), 408; Sieburth (2003b), xi&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May he was transferred to the United States Army Disciplinary Training Center north of Pisa, where he was placed in one of the camp's "death cells", a series of six-by-six-foot outdoor steel cages lit up at night by floodlights; engineers reinforced his cage with heavier steel for fear the fascists would try to break him out.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 408&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound spent three weeks in isolation in the heat, sleeping on the concrete, denied exercise and communication, except for conversations with the chaplain. After two and a half weeks he began to break down under the strain. [[Richard Sieburth]] wrote that Pound recorded it in ''Canto LXXX'', where [[Odysseus]] is saved from drowning by [[Leucothea]]: "hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me." Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week. On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists, one of whom found symptoms of a mental breakdown, after which he was transferred to his own tent and allowed reading material. He began to write, drafting what became known as ''[[The Cantos#LXXIV–LXXXIV (The Pisan Cantos)|The Pisan Cantos]]''.&lt;ref name = Sieburthix/&gt; The existence of a few sheets of toilet paper showing the beginning of ''Canto LXXIV'' suggests he started it while in the cage.&lt;ref name = "Kimpel470-474"/&gt;

===St Elizabeths Hospital===
{{further|Visits to St. Elizabeths}}
[[File:Center building at Saint Elizabeths, National Photo Company, circa 1909-1932.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|[[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] (photographed c.&amp;nbsp;1909–1932)]]

On 15 November 1945 Pound was transferred to the United States. An escorting officer's impression was that "he is an intellectual 'crackpot' who imagined that he could correct all the economic ills of the world and who resented the fact that ordinary mortals were not sufficiently intelligent to understand his aims and motives".&lt;ref name = "Kimpel470-474"&gt;Kimpel (1981), 470–474&lt;/ref&gt; He was arraigned in Washington, D.C., on the 25th of that month on charges of treason. The charges included broadcasting for the enemy, attempting to persuade American citizens to undermine government support of the war, and strengthening morale in Italy against the United States.&lt;ref name=Tytell289/&gt;

He was admitted to [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]], and in June the following year Dorothy was declared his legal guardian. He was held for a time in the hospital's prison ward—Howard's Hall, known as the "hell-hole", a building without windows—in a room with a thick steel door and nine peepholes to allow the psychiatrists to observe him as they tried to agree on a diagnosis. Visitors were admitted for only 15 minutes at a time, while patients wandered around screaming and frothing at the mouth.&lt;ref name=Tytell289/&gt;

Pound's lawyer, [[Julien Cornell]], whose efforts to have him declared insane are credited with having saved him from life imprisonment, requested his release at a bail hearing in January 1947.&lt;ref&gt;For Cornell's efforts, see [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/obituaries/julien-cornell-83-the-defense-lawyer-in-ezra-pound-case.html "Julien Cornell, 83, The Defense Lawyer In Ezra Pound Case"], ''The New York Times'', 7 December 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital's superintendent, [[Winfred Overholser]], agreed instead to move him to the more pleasant surroundings of Chestnut Ward, close to Overholser's private quarters, which is where he spent the next 12 years.&lt;ref name=Tytell289/&gt; The historian [[Stanley Kutler]] was given access in the 1980s to military intelligence and other government documents about Pound, including his hospital records, and wrote that the psychiatrists believed Pound had a [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic personality]], but they considered him sane. Kutler believes that Overholser protected Pound from the criminal justice system because he was fascinated by him.&lt;ref&gt;Mitgang, Herbert. "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9A02E0DC1139F932A05753C1A967948260 Researchers dispute Ezra Pound's 'insanity']",  ''The New York Times'', 31 October 1981; also see Kutler, Stanley I. (1983). ''American Inquisition: Justice and Injustice in the Cold War''. Hill &amp; Wang.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytell writes that Pound was in his element in Chestnut Ward. He was at last provided for, and was allowed to read, write and receive visitors, including Dorothy for several hours a day. He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, and turned it into his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' and ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', and continued work on ''The Cantos''. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release. She wrote to a friend: "E.P. has—as he had before—bats in the belfry but it strikes me that he has fewer not more than before his incarceration."&lt;ref name=Tytell289&gt;Tytell (1987), 289–297, 304–305&lt;/ref&gt;

James Laughlin had "Cantos LXXIV–LXXXIV" ready for publication in 1946 under the title ''The Pisan Cantos'', and gave Pound an advance copy, but he held back, waiting for an appropriate time to publish. A group of Pound's friends—Eliot, Cummings, [[W. H. Auden]], Allen Tate, and Julien Cornell—met Laughlin to discuss how to get him released. They planned to have Pound awarded the first [[Bollingen Prize]], a new national poetry award by the Library of Congress, with $1,000 prize money donated by the [[Mellon family]].&lt;ref name=Tytell302/&gt;

The awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the Library of Congress, including several of Pound's supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, Amy Lowell, [[Katherine Anne Porter]] and [[Theodore Spencer]].{{efn|The Associated Press reported the list of judges as Conrad Aiken, W. H. Auden, Louise Bogan, Katherine Garrison Chapin, T. S. Eliot, Paul Green, Robert Lowell, Katherine Anne Porter, Karl Shapiro, Allen Tate, Willard Thorp and Robert Penn Warren. Also on the list were Leonie Adams, the Library of Congress's poetry consultant, and Theodore Spencer, who died on 18 January 1949, just before the award was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/02/20/84196391.pdf "Pound, in Mental Clinic, Wins Prize for Poetry Penned in Treason Cell"], Associated Press, 19 February 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The idea was that the Justice Department would be placed in an untenable position if Pound won a major award and was not released.&lt;ref name=Tytell302/&gt; Laughlin published ''The Pisan Cantos'' on 30 July 1948, and the following year the prize went to Pound.{{efn|"At their [the committee's first] meeting [in November 1948], and to no one's great surprise, given [Allen] Tate's behind-the-scenes maneuverings and the intimidating presence of recent Nobel Laureate T. S.

Pound responded to the award with "No comment from the bughouse."&lt;ref name=Tytell302&gt;Tytell (1987), 293, 302–303; Tytell cites MacLeish, Archibald. ''Riders on the Earth'', Houghton Mifflin, 1978, 120; Winnick, R. H. (ed.) ''Letters of Archibald MacLeish, 1907 to 1982''. Houghton Mifflin, 1983, and in particular a letter from MacLeish to Milton Eisenhower, which is in the Library of Congress. For more details of who supported and opposed, see McGuire (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

There was uproar. The ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' quoted critics who said "poetry [cannot] convert words into maggots that eat at human dignity and still be good poetry". [[Robert Hillyer]], a Pulitzer Prize winner and president of the Poetry Society of America, attacked the committee in ''The Saturday Review of Literature'', telling journalists that he "never saw anything to admire in Pound, not one line".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4eQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=imoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1394,1049824&amp;hl=en "Canto Controversy"] ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 22 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillyer, Robert.

Javits]] demanded an investigation into the awards committee. It was the last time the prize was administered by the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name=Tytell302/&gt;

===Views and relationships===
Although Pound repudiated his antisemitism in public, he maintained his views in private. He refused to talk to psychiatrists with Jewish-sounding names, dismissed people he disliked as "Jews", and urged visitors to read the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1903), a forgery claiming to represent a Jewish plan for world domination.&lt;ref name=Tytell289/&gt; He struck up a friendship with the conspiracy theorist and antisemite [[Eustace Mullins]], believed to be associated with the Aryan League of America, and author of the 1961 biography ''This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound''.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm286"&gt;Wilhelm (1994), 286, 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more damaging was his friendship with [[John Kasper]], a far-right activist and [[Ku Klux Klan]] member. Kasper had come to admire Pound during literature classes at university, and after he wrote to Pound in 1950 the two had become friends. Kasper opened a bookstore in [[Greenwich Village]] in 1953 called "Make it New", reflecting his commitment to Pound's ideas; the store specialized in far-right material, including Nazi literature, and Pound's poetry and translations were displayed on the window front.&lt;ref name=Hickman127&gt;Hickman (2005), 127&lt;/ref&gt; Kasper and another follower of Pound's, David Horton, set up a publishing imprint, Square Dollar Series, which Pound used as a vehicle for his tracts about economic reform.&lt;ref name=Tytell306&gt;Tytell (1987), 306–308&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm writes that there were a lot of conventional people visiting Pound too, such as the classicist J.P. Sullivan and the writer [[Guy Davenport]], but it was the association with Mullins and Kasper that stood out and delayed his release from St Elizabeths.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm286/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tytell306/&gt;

===Release===
Pound's friends continued to try to get him out. Shortly after Hemingway won the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954, he told ''Time'' magazine that "this would be a good year to release poets".&lt;ref name = "Stock437"&gt;Stock (1970), 437&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Archibald MacLeish]] asked Hemingway in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound's behalf. Hemingway believed Pound was unable to abstain from awkward political statements or from friendships with people like Kasper, but he signed a letter of support anyway and pledged $1,500 to be given to Pound when he was released.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2000), 303&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the ''Paris Review'' in early 1958, Hemingway said that Kasper should be jailed and Pound  released.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway, Ernest. [http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway "The Art of Fiction"], ''Paris Review'', No. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Kasper was eventually jailed, for inciting a riot in connection with the [[Hattie Cotton School]] in Nashville, targeted because a black girl had registered as a student. He was also questioned relating to the bombing of the school.&lt;ref&gt;"Police Firmness in Nashville", ''Life'' magazine, 23 September 1957, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PD8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 34]; Tytell (1987), 308; Webb (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-dDQ6ZWRTzYC&amp;pg=PA88 88–89]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several publications began campaigning for Pound's release in 1957. ''Le Figaro'' published an appeal entitled "The Lunatic at St Elizabeths". ''The New Republic'', ''Esquire'' and ''The Nation'' followed suit; ''The Nation'' argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man, but had rights. In 1958 MacLeish hired [[Thurman Arnold]], a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment. Overholser, the hospital's superintendent, supported the application with an affidavit saying Pound was permanently and incurably insane, and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose.&lt;ref name=LewisNYT&gt;Lewis, Anthony. [https://www.nytimes.com/1958/04/15/archives/u-s-asked-to-end-pound-indictment-court-told-poets-insanity-is.html "U.S. asked to end Pound indictment"], ''The New York Times'', 14 April 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was heard on 18 April 1958 by the judge who had committed Pound to St Elizabeths. The Department of Justice did not oppose the motion, and Pound was free.&lt;ref name=Tytell325&gt;Tytell (1987), 325–326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thurman |last= Arnold |title= Fair Fights and Foul: A Dissenting Lawyer's Life |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc. |year=1965|place=New York|pages=236–242 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy (1958–1972)==
Pound arrived in Naples in July 1958, where he was photographed giving a [[Roman salute#Italy|fascist salute]] to the waiting press. When asked when he had been released from the mental hospital, he replied: "I never was. When I left the hospital I was still in America, and all America is an insane asylum."&lt;ref name="NYT58"&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0E12FF3C5F117B93C2A8178CD85F4C8585F9 "Pound, in Italy, Gives Fascist Salute; Calls United States an 'Insane Asylum'"], ''The New York Times'', 10 July 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Dorothy went to live with Mary at [[Schloss Brunnenburg]], near [[Merano]] in the Province of [[South Tyrol]], where he met his grandson, Walter, and his granddaughter, Patrizia, for the first time, then returned to Rapallo, where Olga Rudge was waiting to join them.&lt;ref name=Tytell328/&gt;

They were accompanied by a teacher Pound had met in hospital, Marcella Spann, 40 years his junior, ostensibly acting as his secretary and collecting poems for an anthology. The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; ''Canto CXIII'': alluded to it: "Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell." Pound was in love with Spann, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in ''Canto CXIII'': "The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill." Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to the United States.&lt;ref name=Tytell328&gt;Tytell (1987), 328–332; for the reference to "Canto 113", see Sieburth (2003), xl&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1959, Pound was mired in depression. He saw his work as worthless and ''The Cantos'' botched. In a 1960 interview given in Rome to [[Donald Hall]] for ''Paris Review'', he said: "You—find me—in fragments." Hall wrote that he seemed in an "abject despair, [[Acedia|accidie]], meaninglessness, [[Aboulia|abulia]], waste". He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then suddenly sagging, and at one point seemed about to collapse. Hall said it was clear that he "doubted the value of everything he had done in his life".&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 347; Hall, Donald. [http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4598/the-art-of-poetry-no-5-ezra-pound "Ezra Pound, The Art of Poetry No. 5"], ''The Paris Review'', 28, Summer–Fall 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those close to him thought he was suffering from dementia, and in mid-1960, Mary placed him in a clinic near Merano when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: "I spoil everything I touch. I have always blundered&amp;nbsp;... All my life I believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning."&lt;ref name=Tytell333&gt;Tytell (1987), 333–336&lt;/ref&gt;

William Carlos Williams died in 1963, followed by Eliot in 1965. Pound went to Eliot's funeral in London and on to Dublin to visit Yeats's widow. Two years later he went to New York where he attended the opening of an exhibition featuring his blue-inked version of Eliot's ''The Waste Land''.&lt;ref name = "Nadel18"&gt;Nadel (2007), 18&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to Hamilton College where he received a standing ovation.&lt;ref name=Tytell337/&gt;

Shortly before his death in 1972 it was proposed that he be awarded the [[Emerson-Thoreau Medal]] of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, but after a storm of protest the academy's council opposed it by 13 to 9. The sociologist [[Daniel Bell]], who was on the committee, argued that it was important to distinguish between those who explore hate and those who approve it. Two weeks before he died, Pound read for a gathering of friends at a café: "re ''usury''/ I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is ''avarice''."&lt;ref name=Tytell337&gt;Tytell (1987), 337–339&lt;/ref&gt;

On his 87th birthday, 30 October 1972, he was too weak to leave his bedroom. The next night he was admitted to the Civil Hospital of Venice, where he died in his sleep of an [[intestinal blockage]] on 1 November, with Olga at his side. Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, [[Isola di San Michele]], where he was buried near [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 339; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/11/02/79477128.pdf "Ezra Pound Dies in Venice at Age of 87"], ''The New York Times'', 2 November 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.&lt;ref name = "Nadel18"/&gt;

==Style==
Critics generally agree that Pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist, particularly in his early work, such as "The River Merchant's Wife".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor (1963), 7, 19&lt;/ref&gt; According to Witmeyer a modern style is evident as early as ''Ripostes'', and Nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began ''The Cantos'', writing that Pound wanted his poetry to represent an "objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own" without use of symbolism or romanticism.&lt;ref name=Nadel19991&gt;Nadel (1999), 1–6; Witmeyer (1999), 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on literature from a variety of disciplines, Pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions, yet led the reader to an intended conclusion, believing the "thoughtful man" would apply a sense of organization and uncover the underlying symbolism and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Coats (2009), 87–89&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring Victorian and Edwardian grammar and structure, he created a unique form of speech, employing odd and strange words, jargon, avoiding verbs, and using rhetorical devices such as [[parataxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Stark (2001) 10–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound's relationship to music is essential to his poetry. Although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as "raucous, nasal, scratchy", Michael Ingam writes that Pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound, an "ear" for words, imbuing his poetry with [[Ezra Pound's Three Kinds of Poetry|melopoeia]].&lt;ref name = "Ingham236"/&gt; His study of troubadour poetry—words written to be sung (''motz et son'')—led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly.&lt;ref name = "Ingham236"&gt;Ingham (1999), 236–237&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that rhythm is "the hardest quality of a man's style to counterfeit".&lt;ref&gt;Pound (1968), 103&lt;/ref&gt; Ingham compares the form of ''The Cantos'' to a [[fugue]]; without adhering strictly to the traditions of the form, nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously. He goes on to write that Pound's use of [[counterpoint]] is integral to the structure and cohesion of ''The Cantos'', which show multi-voiced counterpoint and, with the juxtaposition of images, non-linear themes. The pieces are presented in fragments "which taken together, can be seen to unfold in time as music does".&lt;ref&gt;Ingham (1999), 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagism and Vorticism===
[[File:EzraPound Ripostes.png|thumb|upright|alt=cover|[[Dorothy Shakespear]] designed the Vorticism-inspired [[cover art]] for Pound's 1915 ''Ripostes''.]]

Opinion varies about the nature of Pound's writing style. Nadel writes that imagism was to change Pound's poetry.&lt;ref name=Nadel19991/&gt; Like Wyndham Lewis, Pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in Edwardian writing, saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that the poet should always use the "exact" word, stripping the writing down to the "barest essence".&lt;ref&gt;Oliver (2011), 87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nadel, "Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction&amp;nbsp;... replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics."&lt;ref name=Nadel19991/&gt; Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate "all but the hardest kernel" from a poem, such as in the two-line poem "In a Station of the Metro".&lt;ref name = "Albright60"/&gt; However, Pound learned that Imagism did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic, so he turned to the more dynamic structure of Vorticism for ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref name = "Albright60"&gt;Albright (1999), 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translations===
Pound's translations represent a substantial part of his work. He began his career with translations of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ballads and ended with translations of Egyptian poetry. Yao says the body of translations by modernist poets in general, much of which Pound started, consists of some the most "significant modernist achievements in English".&lt;ref&gt;Yao (2010), 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Pound was the first English language poet since [[John Dryden]], some three centuries earlier, to give primacy to translations in English literature. The fullness of the achievement for the modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism, multilingualism, and, perhaps of greater importance, they treated translations not in a strict sense of the word but instead saw a translation as the creation of an original work.&lt;ref&gt;Yao (2010), 33–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael J. Alexander|Michael Alexander]] writes that, as a translator, Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Du Fu]], and brought [[Occitan language|Provençal]] and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1997), 23–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pound's Fenollosa translations, unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry, which tended to work with strict [[metre (poetry)|metrical]] and [[stanza]]ic patterns, Pound created [[free verse]] translations. Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy.&lt;ref name=Xie1999/&gt;  [[Hugh Kenner]] contends that ''Cathay'' should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems. The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to "rethink the nature of an English poem". These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West.&lt;ref name=Kenner199&gt;Kenner (1971), 199&lt;/ref&gt; Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound's use of language in his translation of "The Seafarer" is deliberate, in that he avoids merely "trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language".&lt;ref name=Xie1999&gt;Xie (1999), 204–212&lt;/ref&gt;

Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and
We set up mast and sail on that swart ship,
Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also
Heavy with weeping, and winds from sternward
Bore us out onward with bellying canvas,
Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.
Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,
Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea til day's end.&lt;/poem&gt;
 |source=— Canto I (1917)}}
''The Cantos'' is difficult to decipher. In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, [[Elegy|elegies]], essays and memoirs.&lt;ref name= "Nadel1-6"&gt;Nadel (1999), 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of the 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century [[comparative literature]]. Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing "themes and history" from [[Homer]] to [[Ovid]] and [[Dante]], from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], and many others. The work presents a multitude of protagonists as "travellers between nations". The nature of ''The Cantos'', she says, is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against "a Poundian standard" of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley (2010), 662&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound layered ideas, cultures and historical periods, writing in as many as 15 different languages, using modern [[vernacular]], Classical languages and Chinese ideograms.&lt;ref&gt;Xie (1999), 217&lt;/ref&gt; Ira Nadel says ''The Cantos'' is an [[Epic poetry|epic]], that is "a poem including history", and that the "historical figures lend referentiality to the text". It functions as a contemporary memoir, in which "personal history [and] lyrical retrospection mingle"—most clearly represented in the ''Pisan Cantos''.&lt;ref name ="Nadel1-6"/&gt; Michael Ingham sees in ''The Cantos'' an American tradition of experimental literature, writing about it,  "These works include everything but the kitchen sink, and then add the kitchen sink".&lt;ref&gt;Ingham (1999), 240&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s William O'Connor described ''The Cantos'' as filled with "cryptic and gnomic utterances, dirty jokes, obscenities of various sorts".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor (1963), 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allen Tate]] believes the poem is not about anything and is without beginning, middle or end. He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and "at the mercy of random flights of 'angelic insight,' an [[Icarians|Icarian]] self-indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated".&lt;ref&gt;Tate (1965), 87&lt;/ref&gt; This perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (1999), 8&lt;/ref&gt; Pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure, and regretted that he could not "make it cohere".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls (1999), 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary criticism and economic theory===
Pound's literary criticism and essays are, according to [[Massimo Bacigalupo]], a "form of intellectual journal". In early works, such as ''The Spirit of Romance'' and "I Gather the Limbs of Osiris", Pound paid attention to medieval [[troubadour]] poets—[[Arnaut Daniel]] and [[François Villon]]. The former piece was to "remain one of Pound's principal sourcebooks for his poetry"; in the latter he introduces the concept of "luminous details".&lt;ref&gt;Bacigalupo (1999), 188–191&lt;/ref&gt; The [[leitmotif]]s in Pound's literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events, which, he believed, through the use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth; and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Bacigalupo (1999), 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound wrote intensively about economic theory with the ''ABC of Economics'' and ''Jefferson and/or Mussolini'', published in the mid-1930s right after he was introduced to Mussolini. These were followed by ''The Guide to Kulchur'', covering 2500 years of history, which [[Tim Redman]] describes as the "most complete synthesis of Pound's political and economic thought".&lt;ref&gt;Redman (1999), 258&lt;/ref&gt; Pound thought writing the cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics, and he wove his economic theories throughout; neither can be understood without the other.&lt;ref&gt;Redman (1999), 255–260&lt;/ref&gt; In these pamphlets and in ''[[The ABC of Reading]]'', he sought to emphasize the value of art and to "aestheticize the political", written forcefully, according to Nadel, and in a "determined voice".&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (1999), 10&lt;/ref&gt; In form his criticism and essays are direct, repetitive and reductionist, his rhetoric minimalist, filled with "strident impatience", according to Pound scholar Jason Coats, and frequently failing to make a coherent claim. He rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own, although not very successfully, in Coats's view.&lt;ref&gt;Bacigalupo (1999), 203; Coats (2009), 80, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
In 1922, the literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] reviewed Pound's latest published volume of poetry, ''Poems 1918–21'', and took the opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of Pound as poet. In his essay on Pound, titled "Ezra Pound's Patchwork", Wilson wrote:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;Ezra Pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It is true that he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.&amp;nbsp;... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Wilson1922&gt;Wilson, Edmund (2007). "Ezra Pound's Patchwork", ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s &amp; 30s''. Library of America, 44, 45; the essay was first published on 19 April 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Wilson, the lines in Pound's poems stood isolated, with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that "do not hang together". Citing Pound's first seven cantos, Wilson dubbed the writing "unsatisfactory". He found ''The Cantos'' disjointed and its contents reflecting a too-obvious reliance on the literary works of other authors, and an awkward use of Latin and Chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of Pound's own life.&lt;ref name=Wilson1922/&gt;

The rise of [[New Criticism]] during the 1950s, in which author is separated from text, secured Pound's poetic reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley (2010), 651&lt;/ref&gt; Nadel writes that the publication of T.S. Eliot's ''Literary Essays'' in 1954 "initiated the recuperation of Ezra Pound". Eliot's essays coincided with the work of [[Hugh Kenner]], who visited Pound extensively at St. Elizabeths.&lt;ref name= "Nadel12"&gt;Nadel (1999), 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound, adding that there is also no one to appeal more through "sheer beauty of language".&lt;ref&gt;Kenner (1983), 16&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Donald Davie]], Kenner brought a new appreciation to Pound's work in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1997), 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Gallup's Pound bibliography was published in 1963 and Kenner's ''[[The Pound Era]]'' in 1971.&lt;ref name= "Nadel12"/&gt; In the 1970s a literary journal dedicated to Pound studies (''Paideuma'') was established, and Ronald Bush published the first dedicated critical study of ''The Cantos'', to be followed by a number of research editions of ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref name= "Nadel12"/&gt;

Following Mullins' biography, described by Nadel as "partisan" and "melodramatic", was Noel Stock's factual 1970 ''Life of Ezra Pound'', although the material included was subject to Dorothy's approval. The 1980s saw three significant biographies: [[John Tytell]]'s "neutral" account in 1987, followed by Wilhelm's multi-volume biography. [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s sprawling narrative, a "complete life", built on what Stock began; unlike Stock, Carpenter had the benefit of working without intervention from Pound's relatives. In 2007 David Moody published the first of his multi-volume biography, combining narrative with literary criticism, the first work to link the two.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2010b), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Mary de Rachewiltz released the first dual-language edition of ''The Cantos'', including "Canto LXXII" and "Canto LXXIII".&lt;ref name= "Nadel13"/&gt; These cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines, and are characterized by 21st-century literary scholars as no more than war-time propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2012), 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 a complete facsimile edition of Pound's prose and poetry was published, now considered a "fundamental research tool", according to Nadel.&lt;ref name= "Nadel13"&gt;Nadel (1999), 13&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship in the 1990s turned toward in-depth investigations of his antisemitism and Rome years. Tim Redman writes about Pound's fascism and his relationship with Mussolini, and Leon Surrette about Pound's economic theories, especially during the Italian period, investigating how Pound the poet became Pound the fascist.&lt;ref&gt;Coats (2009), 81&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Surrette wrote about the state of Pound criticism, that "the effort to uncover coherence in a&amp;nbsp;... crazy quilt of verse styles, critical principles, crankish economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive the genesis and development of any of these components". He emphasized that Pound's "economic and political opinions have not been properly dated, nor has the suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated".&lt;ref&gt;Surrette (1999) 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadel's 2010 ''Pound in Context'' is a contextual literary approach to Pound scholarship. Pound's life, "the social, political, historical, and literary developments of his period", is fully investigated, which, according to Nadel is "the grid for reading Pound's poetry".&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2010a), 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Matthew Feldman wrote that the more than 1,500 documents in the "Pound files" held by the FBI have been ignored by scholars, and almost certainly contain evidence that "Pound was politically cannier, was more bureaucratically involved with Italian Fascism, and was more involved with Mussolini's regime than has been posited".&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2012), 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Pound helped advance the careers of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century. In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway and [[Conrad Aiken]], he befriended and helped [[Marianne Moore]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Basil Bunting]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], [[George Oppen]] and [[Charles Olson]].&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein (1999), 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Witemeyer argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th-century English-language poetry because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him.&lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (1999), 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote in ''Poetry'': "All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant. Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch. The point is, he will be mentioned."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1917), 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Pound strongly influenced  the two significant modernising poets in the [[Irish Language]] in the mid-twentieth century, [[Seán Ó Ríordáin]] and [[Máirtín Ó Direáin]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (1978), 205&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

The outrage after Pound's wartime collaboration with Mussolini's regime was so deep that the imagined method of his execution dominated the discussion. [[Arthur Miller]] considered him worse than Hitler: "In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra&amp;nbsp;... he knew all America's weaknesses and he played them as expertly as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] ever did." The response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists, and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re-evaluation. [[Macha Rosenthal]] wrote that it was "as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest" in Ezra Pound.&lt;ref&gt;For Arthur Miller's quote, see Torrey (1984), 200. For Rosenthal, see her ''A Primer of Ezra Pound''. Macmillan, 1960, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound's antisemitism has soured evaluation of his poetry. Pound scholar Wendy Stallard Flory writes that separating the poetry from the antisemitism is perceived as apologetic. She believes the positioning of Pound as "National Monster" and "designated fascist intellectual" made him a stand-in for the silent majority in Germany, occupied France and Belgium, as well as Britain and the United States, who, she argues, made the [[Holocaust]] possible by aiding or standing by.&lt;ref&gt;Flory (1999), 285–286, 294–300&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his life, Pound analyzed what he judged to be his own failings as a writer attributable to his adherence to ideological fallacies.&lt;ref name ="Carpenter898ff"/&gt; [[Allen Ginsberg]] states that, in a private conversation in 1967, Pound told the young poet, "my poems don't make sense." He went on to say that he "was not a lunatic, but a moron", and to characterize his writing as "stupid and ignorant", "a mess". Ginsberg reassured Pound that he "had shown us the way", but Pound refused to be mollified:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;'Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions—the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things,' [he] replied. Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-semitism.'&lt;ref name ="Carpenter898ff"&gt;Carpenter (1988), 898–899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Battle of Gettysburg''''', also known as the '''Gettysburg Cyclorama''', is a [[cyclorama]] painting by the French artist [[Paul Philippoteaux]] depicting [[Pickett's Charge]], the climactic [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] attack on the [[Union Army|Union]] forces during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] on July 3, 1863.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt;

== Description ==
The painting is the work of French artist Paul Dominique Philippoteaux. It depicts Pickett's Charge, the failed infantry assault that was the climax of the Battle of Gettysburg. The painting is a ''cyclorama'', a type of 360° cylindrical painting. The intended effect is to immerse the viewer in the scene being depicted, often with the addition of foreground models and life-sized replicas to enhance the illusion. Among the sites documented in the painting are [[Cemetery Ridge]], the Angle, and the "[[High-water mark of the Confederacy]]".&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite web |last=Heiser |first=John |title=The Gettysburg Cyclorama |work=[[Gettysburg National Military Park]] |publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/gett/historyculture/gettysburg-cyclorama.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed original painting was {{convert|22|ft|m}} high and {{convert|279|ft|m}} in circumference.&lt;ref name=nando/&gt; The version that hangs in Gettysburg, a recent (2005) restoration of the version created for Boston, is {{convert|42|ft|m}} high and {{convert|377|ft|m}} in circumference.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt;

Philippoteaux became interested in cycloramas and, in collaboration with his father, created ''The Defence of the Fort d'Issy'' in 1871. Other successful works included ''Taking of Plevna'' (Turko-Russian War), the ''Passage of the Balkans'', ''The Belgian Revolution of 1830'', ''Attack in the Park'', ''The Battle of Kars'', ''The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir'', and the ''Derniere Sortie''.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Dean S. |title=The Gettysburg Cyclorama: A Portrayal of the High Tide of the Confederacy |publisher=Thomas Publications |year=1989 |location=Gettysburg, Pennsylvania |pages=17–19 |isbn=0-939631-14-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned by a group of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] investors in 1879 to create the Gettysburg Cyclorama. He spent several weeks in April 1882 at the site of the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] to sketch and photograph the scene, and extensively researched the battle and its events over several months. He erected a wooden platform along present-day Hancock Avenue and drew a circle around it, eighty feet in diameter, driving stakes into the ground to divide it into ten sections. Local photographer William H. Tipton took three photographs of each section, focusing in turn on the foreground, the land behind it, and the horizon. The photos, pasted together, formed the basis of the composition.&lt;ref name=Appelbaum&gt;{{cite news|last=Appelbaum|first=Yoni|title=The Half-Life of Illusion: On the Brief and Glorious Heyday of the Cyclorama|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/the-half-life-of-illusion-on-the-brief-and-glorious-heyday-of-the-cyclorama/252747/|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philippoteaux also interviewed several survivors of the battle, including Union generals [[Winfield S.

Philippoteaux enlisted a team of five assistants, including his father until his death, to create the final work.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; It took over a year and a half to complete.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; The finished painting was nearly 100 yards long and weighed six tons.&lt;ref name="nando"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jarvis |first=Craig |title=Triangle trio buys massive painting |work=[[The News &amp; Observer]] (Raleigh, NC) |publisher=The News and Observer Publishing Company |date=May 2, 2007 |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/569912.html |accessdate=2007-05-03|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003227/http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/569912.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; When completed for display, the full work included not just the painting, but numerous artifacts and sculptures, including stone walls, trees, and fences.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; The effect of the painting has been likened to the nineteenth century equivalent of an [[IMAX]] theater.&lt;ref name="nando"/&gt;

== Chicago version ==
In 1879, the National Panorama Company, led by Charles Louis Willoughby and supported by Marshall Field, Judge Treat, Jefferson Printing Company and an assortment of other capitalists commissioned the artist Paul Dominique Philippoteaux to begin works on a cyclorama of the Battle of Gettysburg.  Preparation began in 1880 and by 1883 the National Panorama Company had taken possession of the monumental cyclorama painting which became known as the Gettysburg Cyclorama, Chicago version (so-named for the city in which it was first exhibited).

The work opened to the public in Chicago on October 22, 1883, to critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; General [[John Gibbon]], one of the commanders of the Union forces who repelled Pickett's Charge, was among the veterans of the battle who gave it favorable reviews.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; So realistic was the painting that many veterans of the war were reported to have wept upon seeing it.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum-Great"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/02/the-great-illusion-of-gettysburg/238870/|title=The Great Illusion of Gettysburg|last=Appelbaum|first=Yoni|date=5 February 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corwin (later Chief Staff Artist for the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois) and, Salvador Mege (the French cyclorama artist).

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Although the presence of the painting at a "Dallas Exposition" was set out in correspondence, there doesn't appear to be any evidence of an exposition in Dallas in that year.

In 1964 Joseph Wallace King, the North Carolina artist, approached E. W. McConnell to enquire after the whereabouts of the Chicago version, which he later purchased.  It was later donated to Wake Forest University, North Carolina, who sold it to three North Carolina businessmen in 2007 for an undisclosed sum.

== Boston version ==

The Chicago exhibition was sufficiently successful to prompt businessman Charles L. Willoughby to commission a second version, which opened in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on December 22, 1884. From its opening until 1892, approximately 200,000 people viewed the painting.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; The Boston version was housed in a specially designed building, the [[Cyclorama Building]], on [[Tremont Street]],&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite news|title=Work in Progress|last=Morton|first=Margaret|date=July 2007|work=Civil War Times|pages=28–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the site of popular public lectures on the battle.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Two additional copies of the cyclorama were made: the third was first exhibited in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, beginning in February 1886 and a fourth debuted in Brooklyn, New York, in October 1886.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;[[File:Tremont Street Exhibition-Gettysburg.PNG|thumb|right|Ticket to the Boston exhibition of the Gettysburg Cyclorama.]]

Many reviewers and visitors agreed with the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser]]'' that "it is impossible to tell where reality ends and the painting begins." One veteran, pointing at the painting, said to his friend: "You see that puff of smoke? Just wait a moment till that clears away, and I'll show you just where I stood." In New York, police responding to a report of a nighttime burglary and disoriented by the illusion twice seized dummies representing dead soldiers, convinced that they were live burglars.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Appelbaum-Great" /&gt;

In 1891, the Boston cyclorama, housed in the [[Cyclorama Building]], was exchanged temporarily with the cyclorama ''Crucifixion of Christ''&lt;ref&gt;Also one of Philippoteaux's works, ''Crucifixion'' is now on display at [[Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, Quebec]].&lt;/ref&gt; in Philadelphia. When it returned in 1892, it was stored in a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} crate behind the exhibition hall, where it was subjected to damage from weather, vandals removing boards from the crate, and two fires. It was eventually purchased in its deteriorated state by Albert J. Hahne of [[Newark, New Jersey]], in 1910. Hahne displayed sections of the cyclorama in his department store in Newark beginning in 1911, and sections were also shown in government buildings in [[New York City]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] In the Baltimore exhibition, [[George E. Pickett]]'s widow, "Sallie" Pickett, lectured on her husband's experiences and found herself very moved by the experience.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

[[File:Gettysburg cyclorama.jpg|thumb|right|Interior view of the Gettysburg Cyclorama in the former, Neutra building location]]

On September 3, 1912, ground was broken for a new cyclorama building on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg, on Cemetery Hill (on the site of the present day [[Holiday Inn]]), near the entrance to the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers' National Cemetery]]. It opened to the public in 1913, in time for the 50th anniversary of the battle, once again displayed as a full circular painting, rather than in sections. The unheated, leaky brick building took a further toll on the condition of the painting. The Boston cyclorama was purchased by the [[National Park Service]] in 1942, and moved to a site on Ziegler's Grove near the new Visitor's Center in 1961, after a second round of restoration.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;

The exhibition remained open to the public until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing, slightly flared out at the bottom. In the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored.&lt;ref name="Morton"/&gt;

The painting restoration was accompanied by the construction of a facility to house the painting, the new Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center on Hunt Avenue, located away from any areas in which fighting occurred in 1863. The restored Cyclorama exhibition was reopened to the public in September 2008. The proposed demolition of the [[Richard Neutra's Cyclorama Building|old Cyclorama building]] in Ziegler's Grove was a source of some controversy among history and architecture buffs, with some opposing the destruction of the [[modernism|modernist]] structure designed by architect [[Richard Neutra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Latest: Recent Past Preservation Network Sues National Park Service to Prevent Demolition of Historic Building at Gettysburg |work=CYCLORAMA: Richard Neutra's 1961 Lincoln Memorial at Gettysburg |publisher=Mission66.com |url=http://www.mission66.com/cyclorama/ |accessdate=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, it was razed in early 2013, and the site restored to its wartime appearance.&lt;ref&gt;"Gettysburg National Military Park's Old Cyclorama Building Is No More," National Parks Traveler http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2013/04/gettysburg-national-military-parks-old-cyclorama-building-no-more23011&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Benedict "Buck-eye" ==
A buck-eye cyclorama is a term used to describe a cyclorama painting of the same or roughly the same dimensions as an original which is a very slavish copy.  Often these were created cheaply by painters of little skill and, almost always, with sub-standard materials.  Several buck-eye cycloramas were exhibited in the United States during the time when cyclorama paintings were popular attractions including several copies of the Gettysburg Cyclorama.  Once an individual had seen a particular cyclorama it was unlikely that they would purchase a ticket to revisit it, so these low-quality copies could be exhibited with a very low risk that a ticket holder would request a refund, as they would likely never have seen the original.  Tickets could be sold at the same price as the admission to see an original and the exhibitor of a buck-eye could visit the original themselves, obtain copies of all of the pamphlets and promotional materials and have them cheaply copied for sale alongside the attraction.  In fact, copy houses were formed in order to meet the demand for such paintings, one being the Milwaukee Panorama Painters.

In 1885 the Milwaukee Panorama Painters were commissioned by Mr. Myron Herrick (at that time a banker, who later twice served as the U.S. Ambassador to France) to create a copy of the Gettysburg Cyclorama, which was later purchased by E. W. McConnell (the "Cyclorama King") and exhibited by McConnell at: the Cotton States Exposition, Atlanta, Georgia in 1895; the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, Nashville, Tennessee in 1897; before moving to Louisville, Kentucky; and finally, to Nashville, Tennessee in 1898 before it was placed in storage in that city.  During the time of McConnell's ownership, McConnell sold a share of the painting to a Mr. Benedict who, in turn, sold a share of his share to a Mr. Graves.

In 1920, more than 20 years after the buck-eye had been placed into storage, Benedict informed McConnell that a flood had ruined the buck-eye painting, but failed to inform Graves.  Graves was not available to be consulted when questions from his family arose regarding the whereabouts of the buck-eye (in 1957) and the beneficiaries of Graves' Estate later made the assumption that the painting purchased by Mr. Joseph Wallace King (the Chicago Version) in 1964 was this 'missing' buck-eye painting.  The estate then launched a legal action against King, claiming that a share of the painting King had purchased was theirs. This case was settled in arbitration by the comparison of photographs of the buck-eye with the painting King had purchased and the matters were resolved in King's favour, as the buck-eye was obviously of inferior quality to the Chicago Version which King had in his possession.

In 1957 the Milwaukee County Historical Society contacted the firm of lawyers who had been acting for McConnell and asked if they could purchase the painting and were informed that it had been destroyed.

'''Grey''' ([[British English]]) or '''gray''' ([[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|see spelling differences]]) is an intermediate color  between [[black]] and [[white]].

In Europe and the United States, surveys show that grey is the color most commonly associated with neutrality, conformity, boredom, uncertainty, old age, indifference, and modesty.

==Etymology==
''Grey'' comes from the Middle English ''grai'' or ''grei'', from the Anglo-Saxon ''graeg'', and is related to the Dutch ''grauw'' and ''grijs'' and German ''grau''.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use of ''grey'' as a color name in the [[English language]] was in AD 700.&lt;ref name="Paul Page 196"/&gt;

==In history and art==

===Antiquity through the Middle Ages===
In antiquity and the Middle Ages, grey was the color of undyed wool, and thus was the color most commonly worn by peasants and the poor. It was also the color worn by monks of the [[Franciscan order]], [[Cistercian Order]] and the Capucine Order as a symbol of their vows of humility and poverty. Franciscan monks in England and Scotland were commonly known as the [[grey friars]], and that name is now attached to many places in Great Britain.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Renaissance and the Baroque===
During the Renaissance and the Baroque, grey began to play an important role in fashion and art. Black became the most popular color of the nobility, particularly in Italy, France, and Spain, and grey and white were harmonious with it.

Grey was also frequently used for the drawing of oil paintings, a technique called ''[[grisaille]]''. The painting would first be composed in grey and white, and then the colors, made with thin transparent glazes, would be added on top. The grisaille beneath would provide the shading, visible through the layers of color. Sometimes the grisaille was simply left uncovered, giving the appearance of carved stone.

Grey was a particularly good background color for gold and for skin tones. It became the most common background for the portraits of [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]] and for many of the paintings of [[El Greco]], who used it to highlight the faces and costumes of the central figures. The palette of Rembrandt was composed almost entirely of somber colors. He composed his warm greys out of black pigments made from charcoal or burnt animal bones, mixed with lead white or a white made of lime, which he warmed with a little [[red lake]] color from [[cochineal]] or [[Rose madder|madder]]. In one painting, the portrait of Margaretha de Geer (1661), one part of a grey wall in the background is painted with a layer of dark brown over a layer of orange, red, and yellow earths, mixed with ivory black and some [[lead white]]. Over this he put an additional layer of glaze made of mixture of [[blue smalt]], [[red ochre]], and [[yellow lake]]. Using these ingredients and many others, he made greys which had, according to art historian Philip Ball, "an incredible subtlety of pigmentation."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball (2001), ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Coulour'', pp. 214–215 (French translation).&lt;/ref&gt; The warm, dark and rich greys and browns served to emphasize the golden light on the faces in the paintings.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===
Grey became a highly fashionable color in the 18th century, both for women's dresses and for men's waistcoats and coats. It looked particularly luminous coloring the silk and satin fabrics worn by the nobility and wealthy.

Women's fashion in the 19th century was dominated by Paris, while men's fashion was set by London. The grey business suit appeared in the mid-19th century in London; light grey in summer, dark grey in winter; replacing the more colorful palette of men's clothing early in the century.

The clothing of women working in the factories and workshops of Paris in the 19th century was usually grey. This gave them the name of ''grisettes''. "''Gris''" or grey also meant drunk, and the name "''grisette''" was also given to the lower class of Parisian prostitutes.

Grey also became a common color for military uniforms; in an age of rifles with longer range, soldiers in grey were less visible as targets than those in blue or red. Grey was the color of the uniforms of the [[Confederate Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], and of the [[Prussian Army]] during the [[Franco-German War]] of 1870.

Several artists  of the mid-19th century used different tones of grey to create memorable paintings; [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] used tones of green-grey and blue grey to give harmony to his landscapes, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] created a special grey for the background of the portrait of his mother, and for his own self-portrait.

Whistler's arrangement of different tones of grey had an effect on the world of music, on the French composer [[Claude Debussy]]. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist [[Eugène Ysaÿe]] describing his ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' as "an experiment in the different combinations that can be obtained from one color – what a study in grey would be in painting."&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, Stanley. 2001.

===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===
In the late 1930s,  grey became a symbol of industrialization and war. It was the dominant color of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s celebrated painting about the horrors of the [[Spanish Civil War]], ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, (2012), ''Color in Art'', pg. 310&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the grey business suit became a metaphor for uniformity of thought, popularized in such books as ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' (1955), which became a successful film in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', pg. 236-237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storm clouds===
[[File:Storm Clouds towards Clare island - geograph.org.uk - 1032378.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Storm clouds towards [[Clare Island]], [[Ireland]].]]
The whiteness or darkness of clouds is a function of their depth. Small, fluffy white clouds in summer look white because the sunlight is being scattered by the tiny water droplets they contain, and that white light comes to the viewer's eye. However, as clouds become larger and thicker, the white light cannot penetrate through the cloud, and is reflected off the top. Clouds look darkest grey during thunderstorms, when they can be as much as 20,000 to 30,000 feet high.

Stratiform clouds are a layer of clouds that covers the entire sky, and which have a depth of between a few hundred to a few thousand feet thick. The thicker the clouds, the darker they appear from below, because little of the sunlight is able to pass through. From above, in an airplane, the same clouds look perfectly white, but from the ground the sky looks gloomy and grey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchfrontiers.uark.edu/6430.php Research Frontiers Site of the University of Arkansas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220083530/http://researchfrontiers.uark.edu/6430.php |date=2012-12-20 }} (retrieved December 17, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The greying of hair===
The color of a person's hair is created by the pigment [[melanin]], found in the core of each hair. Melanin is also responsible for the color of the skin and of the eyes. There are only two types of pigment: dark ([[eumelanin]]) or light ([[phaeomelanin]]). Combined in various combinations, these pigments create all natural hair colors.

Melanin itself is the product of a specialized cell, the [[melanocyte]], which is found in each [[hair follicle]], from which the hair grows. As hair grows, the melanocyte injects melanin into the hair cells, which contain the protein [[keratin]] and which makes up our hair, skin, and nails. As long as the melanocytes continue injecting melanin into the hair cells, the hair retains its original color. At a certain age, however, which varies from person to person, the amount of melanin injected is reduced and eventually stops. The hair, without pigment, turns grey and eventually white. The reason for this decline of production of melanocytes is uncertain. In the February 2005 issue of ''Science'', a team of Harvard scientists suggested that the cause was the failure of the melanocyte stem cells to maintain the production of the essential pigments, due to age or genetic factors, after a certain period of time. For some people, the breakdown comes in their twenties; for others, many years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/grayhair.html Library of Congress Science Reference Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102152657/http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/grayhair.html |date=2013-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the site of the magazine ''Scientific American'', "Generally speaking, among Caucasians 50 percent are 50 percent grey by age 50."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-does-hair-turn-gray ''Scientific American'', "Why does hair turn gray?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114132915/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-does-hair-turn-gray |date=2013-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult male [[gorilla]]s also develop silver hair but only on their backs, see [[gorilla#Physical characteristics|Physical characteristics of gorillas]].

===Optics===
Over the centuries, artists have traditionally created grey by mixing black and white in various proportions. They added a little red to make a warmer grey, or a little blue for a cooler grey. Artists could also make a grey by mixing two [[complementary colors]], such as [[orange (colour)|orange]] and [[blue]].

Today the grey on televisions, computer displays and telephones is usually created using the [[RGB color model]]. 
Red, green, and blue light combined at full intensity on the black screen makes white;  by lowering the intensity, it is possible to create different shades of grey.

In printing, grey is usually obtained with the [[CMYK color model]], using [[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]] and [[black]]. Grey is produced  either by using black and white, or by combining equal amounts of cyan, magenta and yellow.  Most greys have a cool or warm cast to them, as the [[human eye]] can detect even a minute amount of color saturation. [[Yellow]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]], and [[red]] create a "warm grey". [[Green]], [[blue]], and [[Violet (color)|violet]] create a "cool grey".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmos.washington.edu/gcg/SV.man/sv.743colpal.html Color Palette]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uykwS2R7?url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/gcg/SV.man/sv.743colpal.html |date=December 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When no color is added, the color is "neutral grey", "achromatic grey" or simply "grey". Images consisting wholly of black, white and greys are called [[monochrome]], [[black-and-white]] or [[greyscale]].

===Web colors===
There are several tones of grey available for use with [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) as named colors, while 254 true greys are available by specification of a [[hex triplet]] for the RGB value. All are spelled ''gray'', using the spelling ''grey'' can cause errors. This spelling was inherited from the [[X11 colour names|X11 color list]]. [[Internet Explorer]]'s [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident browser engine]] does not recognize ''grey'' and renders it green. Another anomaly is that ''gray'' is in fact much darker than the X11 color marked ''darkgray''; this is because of a conflict with the original HTML gray and the X11 gray, which is closer to HTML's ''silver''. The three ''slategray'' colors are not themselves on the greyscale, but are slightly [[saturation (colour theory)|saturated]] towards [[cyan]] (green + blue). Since there are an even (256, including black and white) number of [[Saturation (colour theory)|unsaturated]] tones of grey, there are two grey tones straddling the [[midpoint]] in the 8-bit greyscale. The color name ''gray'' has been assigned the lighter of the two shades (128, also known as #808080), due to rounding up.

===Pigments===
Until the 19th century, artists traditionally created grey by simply combining black and white. [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]], for instance, usually used [[lead white]] and either [[carbon black]] or  [[ivory black]], along with touches of either blues or reds to cool or warm the grey.

In the early 19th century, a new grey, [[Payne's grey]], appeared on the market. Payne's grey is a dark [[Variations of gray#Blue-gray|blue-grey]], a mixture of [[ultramarine]] and [[black]] or of ultramarine and [[Sienna]]. It is named after [[William Payne (painter)|William Payne]], a British artist who painted [[watercolor]]s in the late 18th century. The first recorded use of ''Payne’s grey'' as a color name in [[English language|English]] was in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 201; Colour Sample of Payne’s Grey: Page 117 Plate 47 Color Sample A9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal color===
Grey is a very common color for animals, birds and fish, ranging in size from whales to mice. It provides a natural camouflage and allows them to blend with their surroundings.

===Grey matter of the brain===
The substance that composes the [[brain]] is sometimes referred to as [[grey matter]], or "the little grey cells", so the color grey is associated with things [[intellectual]]. However, the living human brain is actually [[pink]] in color; it only turns grey when dead.

===Nanotechnology and ''grey goo''===
[[Grey goo]] is a hypothetical [[End of civilization|end-of-the-world]] scenario, also known as [[ecophagy]]: out-of-control [[self replication|self-replicating]] [[nanobots]] consume all living matter on [[Earth]] while building more of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm| date=June 9, 2004| title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective| publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology| accessdate=2006-06-17| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906221148/http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm| archivedate=September 6, 2014| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grey noise===
In sound engineering, [[grey noise]] is [[random noise]] subjected to a [[psychoacoustic]] [[equal loudness curve]], such as an ''inverted'' [[A-weighting]] curve, over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies.

==In culture ==

===Religion===
In the [[Christian]] [[religion]], grey is the color of ashes, and so a [[Bible|biblical]] symbol of [[mourning]] and [[repentance]], described as [[mortification of the flesh|sackcloth and ashes]]. It can be used during [[Lent]] or on special days of [[fasting]] and [[prayer]]. As the color of humility and modesty, grey is worn by monks of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]], [[Franciscan order]] and [[Cistercian order]].&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', pg. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Grey cassocks are worn by clergy of the [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church]].

Buddhist monks and priests in Japan and Korea will often wear a sleeved grey, brown, or black outer robe.

[[Taoist]] priests in China also often wear grey.

===Politics===
Grey is rarely used as a color by political parties, largely because of its common association with conformity, boredom and indecision. An example of a political party using grey as a color are the German [[The Greys – Grey Panthers|Grey Panthers]].

The term "grey power" or "the grey vote" is sometimes used to describe the influence of older voters as a voting bloc. In the United States, older people are more likely to vote, and usually vote to protect certain social benefits, such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalgazette.com/lifestyle/columnists/bonus_years/the-bonus-years-the-grey-vote-may-take-the-cake/article_511751fe-be95-5844-b631-c5d7aa00f9ca.html The Bonus Years: The 'grey vote' may take the cake on Tuesday] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118184656/http://www.capitalgazette.com/lifestyle/columnists/bonus_years/the-bonus-years-the-grey-vote-may-take-the-cake/article_511751fe-be95-5844-b631-c5d7aa00f9ca.html |date=2013-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/grey-vote.html Grey vote] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030005726/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/grey-vote.html |date=2012-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Greys'' is a term sometimes used pejoratively by [[environmentalist]]s in the [[green movement]] to describe those who oppose environmental measures and supposedly prefer the grey of concrete and cement.

===Military===
During the [[American Civil War]], the soldiers of the [[Confederate Army]] wore grey uniforms. At the beginning of the war, The armies of the North and of the South had very similar uniforms; some Confederate units wore blue, and some Union units wore grey. There naturally was confusion, and sometimes soldiers fired by mistake at soldiers of their own army. On June 6, 1861, the Confederate government issued regulations standardizing the army uniform and establishing [[cadet grey]] as the uniform color. This was (and still is) the color of the uniform of cadets at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, and cadets at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], which produced many officers for the Confederacy.

The new uniforms were designed by [[Nicola Marschall]], a German-American artist, who also designed the original [[Confederate flag]]. He closely followed the design of contemporary French and Austrian military uniforms.&lt;ref name="ADAH"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nicola Marschall: Artist of the Deep South |url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/marschall/NM_dsth.html |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |accessdate=26 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823034204/http://www.archives.state.al.us/marschall/NM_dsth.html |archivedate=23 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey was not chosen for its camouflage value; this was not appreciated for several more decades; but because the South did not have a major dye industry and grey dyes were inexpensive and easy to manufacture. While some units had uniforms colored with good-quality dyes, which were a solid bluish-grey, others had uniforms colored with vegetable dyes made from [[sumac]] or [[logwood]], which quickly faded in sunshine to the yellowish color of  [[butternut squash]].

In the last twelve months of the war, the South was able to import uniforms made with good-quality blue-grey dye from Ireland, made especially for the Confederacy by a firm in [[Limerick]],  but by that time the war was on its way to being lost.

The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] wore grey uniforms from 1907 until 1945, during both the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]]. The color chosen was a grey-green called [[feldgrau|field grey]] ({{Lang-de|links=no|feldgrau}}). It was chosen because it was less visible at a distance than the previous German uniforms, which were [[Prussian blue]]. It was one of the first uniform colors to be chosen for its [[camouflage]] value, important in the new age of smokeless powder and more accurate rifles and machine guns. It gave the Germans a distinct advantage at the beginning of the First World War, when the French soldiers were dressed in blue jackets and red trousers. The [[Finnish Army]] also began using grey uniforms on the German model.

During World War II, most German soldiers wore the traditional field grey. The soldiers of the [[Afrika Korps]] of General [[Erwin Rommel]] wore a lighter grey uniform more suitable for the desert.

Some of the more recent uniforms of the [[German Army]] and [[East German Army]] were field grey, as were some uniforms of the [[Swedish army]]. The formal dress (M/83) of the [[Finnish Army]] is grey. The [[Army of Chile]] wears field grey today.

===The grey suit===
During the 19th century, women's fashions were largely dictated by Paris, while London set fashions for men. The intent of a business suit was above all to show seriousness, and to show one's position in business and society. Over the course of the century, bright colors disappeared from men's fashion, and were largely replaced by a black or dark charcoal grey [[frock coat]] in winter, and lighter greys in summer. In the early 20th century, the frock coat was gradually replaced by the [[lounge suit]], a less formal version of evening dress, which was also usually black or charcoal grey. In the 1930s the English suit style was called the [[drape suit]], with wide shoulders and a nipped waist, usually dark or light grey. After World War II, the style changed to a slimmer fit called the continental cut, but the color remained grey.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques'', pg. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the 20th century, men's fashions in suits were determined as much by Hollywood as by London tailors. The 1950s and 1960s were the age of glory for the grey suit;  they were worn by movie stars, such as [[Cary Grant]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], and by President [[John F. Kennedy]], who wore a two-button grey suit.  In 1965, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] was the first U.S. president to be inaugurated wearing an Oxford grey business suit; his predecessors had worn a formal cutaway coat with striped trousers for their inaugurations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/inauguration/index.shtm#interesting {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123125624/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/inauguration/index.shtm |date=2013-01-23 }} |Johnson Library, University of Texas&lt;/ref&gt; Grey suits also became the unofficial uniform of [[Madison Avenue]] in [[New York City]], the center of the advertising industry.

At the beginning of the 21st century, the style was beginning to change;  grey was considered monotonous and without character. Gradually the dark blue suit gained supremacy. At recent meetings of the [[G-20]] and other international organizations,  nearly every head of state of the world was wearing a blue business suit.

===Ethics===
In ethics, grey is either used pejoratively to describe situations that have no clear moral value; "the grey area", or [[positive (linguistics)|positive]]ly to balance an all-black or all-white view; for example, shades of grey represent magnitudes of good and bad.

===Folklore===
In [[folklore]], grey is often  associated with [[goblins]], [[elves]] and other legendary mischievous creatures. [[Scandinavia]]n folklore often depicts [[gnome]]s and [[Tomte|nisser]] in grey clothing. This is partly because of their association with [[dusk]], as well as because these creatures were said to be outside traditional moral standards of black and white.

The writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] made use of this folkloric symbolism of grey in his works, which often draw upon Scandinavian folkloric names and themes. [[Gandalf]] is called the Grey Pilgrim; settings include the [[Grey Havens]] and [[Ered Mithrin]], the grey mountains; and characters include the [[Sindar|Grey Elves]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sports===
* In [[baseball]], grey is the color typically used for road [[Baseball uniform|uniforms]]. This came about because in the 19th and early 20th century, away teams didn't normally have access to laundry facilities on the road, thus stains were not noticeable on the darker grey uniforms as opposed to the white uniforms worn by the home team.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Parapsychology===
Believers in [[parapsychology]] say that those who are suffering from the [[mental illness]] of [[Clinical depression|depression]] have grey [[aura (paranormal)|aura]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Powell ''The Astral Body and Other Astral Phenomenon'' Wheaton, Illinois:1927—Theosophical Publishing House Page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay culture===
* In [[gay slang]], a ''grey queen'' is a gay person who works for the [[financial services]] industry (this term originates from the fact that in the 1950s, people who worked in this [[profession]] often wore grey flannel suits).&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Bruce ''Gay Talk (The Queen’s Vernacular): A Dictionary of Gay Slang''  New York:1972 Parragon Books, an imprint of G.P. Putnam’s Sons  Page 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associations and symbolism==
In America and Europe, grey is one of the least popular colors; In a European survey, only one percent of men said it was their favorite color, and thirteen percent called it their least favorite color; the response from women was almost the same. According to color historian Eva Heller, "grey is too weak to be considered masculine, but too menacing to be considered a feminine color. It is neither warm nor cold, neither [[materials science|material]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]]. With grey, nothing seems to be decided."&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques''. (Pg. 226)&lt;/ref&gt;

Grey is the color most commonly associated in many cultures with the elderly and old age, because of the association with grey hair; it symbolizes the wisdom and dignity that come with experience and age. The New York Times is sometimes called ''The Grey Lady'' because of its long history and esteemed position in American journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', pg. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grey is the color most often associated in Europe and America with modesty. &lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques''. (Pg. 226)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Varley''' (17 August 1778{{snd}}17 November 1842) was an English [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[astrologer]], and a close friend of [[William Blake]]. They collaborated in 1819–1820 on the book ''[[Visionary Heads]]'', written by Varley and illustrated by Blake.  He was the elder brother of a family of artists: [[Cornelius Varley]], William Fleetwood Varley, and Elizabeth, who married the painter [[William Mulready]].

==Life and work==

John Varley was born at the ''Old Blue Post Tavern'', [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], on 17 August 1778. His father, Richard Varley, born at [[Epworth, Lincolnshire|Epworth]] in [[Lincolnshire]], had settled in [[London]] after the death of his first wife in [[Yorkshire]]. His parents discouraged his leanings towards art, and placed him under a silversmith.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Varley, John|volume=27|page=922}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on their death he was for a brief time employed by a portrait painter in [[Holborn]] and then, at the age of 15 or 16, he became a pupil of Joseph Charles Barrow ([[floruit|fl.]] 1789–1802) who had an evening drawing school twice a week at 12 Furnival's Inn Court, Holborn. It was Barrow who took Varley on a sketching tour to [[Peterborough]] from which he emerged as a professional painter. In 1798 he exhibited a highly regarded sketch of [[Peterborough Cathedral]] at the [[Royal Academy]] and became a regular exhibitor at the RA until the foundation of the ''[[Royal Watercolour Society|Old Watercolour Society]]'' in 1805.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1799 he visited [[North Wales]], and in its wild mountain scenery found the subjects best suited to his brush. He returned to the same district in 1800, and again in 1802, and the impressions then received powerfully influenced the whole course of his art.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

As one of the founders of the OWS, Varley exhibited largely there over 700 drawings. He also became a highly successful drawing master with pupils including [[Copley Fielding]], [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]] and [[William Turner (artist)]] of Oxford. Despite his success, his growing family meant he was constantly in financial difficulties, "since he was both a hopeless businessman and by temperament something of a [[Wilkins Micawber|Micawber]]". (Mallalieu). Varley was particularly skilled at the laying of flat washes of watercolour which suited the placid, contemplative mood that he often sought to evoke.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Varley published ''A Treatise on the Principles of Landscape Drawing'', 1816–21 and ''A Practical Treatise on the Art of Drawing in Perspective''. He also wrote an [[astrological]] text (with illustrations) entitled ''A Treatise on [[Zodiac]]al [[Physiognomy]]'' in 1828.

He is buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Paths&gt;{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=101|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], "Varley's landscapes are graceful and solemn in feeling, and simple and broad in treatment, being worked with a full brush and pure fresh transparent tints, usually without any admixture of body-colour. Though his works are rather mannered and conventional, they are well considered and excellent in composition. Some of his earlier water-colours, including his "Views of the Thames," were painted upon the spot, and possess greater individuality than his later productions, which are mainly compositions of mountain and lake scenery, produced without direct reference to nature."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Image:JuanTamad.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Buhay na Pinagdaanan ni Juan Tamad na Anac ni Fabio at ni Sofia sa Caharian nang Portugal'' (The life lived by Lazy John, son of Fabio and Sofia in the Kingdom of Portugal"), published in 1919]]
'''''Juan Tamad''''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]] for "Lazy John") is a character in [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[folklore]] noteworthy for extreme [[laziness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Filipinos: Folklore | url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Norway-to-Russia/Filipinos.html | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually portrayed as a child, although in some interpretations, he is said to be a young man.

==Stories==
Arguably, the ''Juan Tamad'' story most often told illustrates his utmost laziness to the point of stupidity that it becomes [[comedy|comedic]]. In it, Juan Tamad comes upon a [[guava]] tree bearing ripe fruit. Being too slothful to climb the tree and take the fruits, he instead decides to lie beneath the tree and let [[gravity]] do its work. There he remained, waiting for the fruit to fall into his gaping mouth.

Other ''Juan Tamad'' stories include:
* ''Juan Tamad and the Mud Crabs"
: Juan Tamad is instructed by his mother to purchase [[Scylla serrata|mud crab]]s at the market. Being too lazy to carry them home, he sets them free in a ditch and tells them to go on home, as he would be along later.

* "Juan Tamad and the Rice Cakes"
: Juan Tamad's mother makes some [[Puto|rice cake]]s and instructs him to sell these at the market. Passing by a pond, he sees frogs swimming to and fro. Being too lazy to sell the cakes at the market, he instead throws them at the frogs, who eat the cakes. Upon reaching home, he tells his mother that all the cakes had been sold on credit; the buyers would pay for them the next week.

* "''Juan Tamad and the Flea-Killer''"
: ''Juan Tamad'''s mother instructs him to go to the village market and buy a rice pot. A [[flea]] infestation in the village soon has ''Juan Tamad'' jumping and scratching for all he's worth; he lets go of the pot and it breaks into pieces. Thinking quickly, he picks up the pieces, grinds them into fine powder and wraps the powder in [[banana]] leaves, which he markets as "flea-killer."

* "''Juan Tamad takes a Bride''"
: ''Juan Tamad'''s mother tells him it is time he took a bride. He asks his mother what sort of woman should he look for. His mother replies "a woman of a few words." ''Juan Tamad'' searches long and hard, but all the women he encounters seem to talk too much. Finally, he comes upon a house where an old woman and her daughter live. Upon seeing the girl, he proposes "Will you marry me?" The girl simply stares at him. He tells himself, "Ah, here is a woman of a few words," and lifts her up and takes her back to his mother. His mother chastises him, for he had brought back a corpse.

==Books==
A book published by an unknown author in 1919 in [[Manila]] entitled ''Buhay na Pinagdaanan ni Juan Tamad na Anac ni Fabio at ni Sofia sa Caharian nang Portugal'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "The Life lived by Juan Tamad, son of Fabio and Sofia, in the Kingdom of Portugal") contains a poem consisting of 78 pages of four-line [[stanza]]s at seven stanzas per page. It tells of how ''Juan Tamad'' was born to a couple named Fabio and Sofia, and his adventures in [[Portugal]].

In 1957, Manuel E. Arguilla (author of ''How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife'') and Lyd Arguilla wrote the book ''Philippine Tales and Fables'' which included the story of Juan Tamad with illustrations by Romeo V. Tabuena. In 1965, playwright and publisher Alberto Florentino took the Arguillas' re-telling of Juan Tamad and published it as ''Stories of Juan Tamad,'' part of a series of 3 booklets for young readers. Illustrated with woodcuts by the late J. Elizalde Navarro (post-humously declared National Artist for Visual Arts), the book is out-of-print and is now considered a collector's item.

==Films==
Several Filipino [[film]]s have treated ''Juan Tamad'' as a central or supporting character.
* ''Si Juan Tamad '', released in 1947 and directed by [[Manuel Conde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Si  Juan Tamad| url=https://italian.imdb.com/title/tt0791573/combined | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Juan Tamad Goes to Congress'', released in 1960 and directed by [[Manuel Conde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Juan Tamad Goes to Congress | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436458/#comment | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Juan Tamad Junior'' released in 1980, features [[Niño Muhlach]] as Juan Tamad Jr. and [[Manuel Conde]] as Juan Tamad Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Juan Tamad Junior | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1167640/ | accessdate = 2000-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mongolian Barbecue The Movie'', released in 1991, features director [[Manuel Urbano, Jr.]]'s television character [[Mr. Shooli]] and [[Eric Quizon]] as ''Juan Tamad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Mongolian Barbecue The Movie | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437337/ | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Juan Tamad'', released in 1993, again bills [[Eric Quizon]] as ''Juan Tamad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Juan Tamad | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441330/ | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
* GMA 7 had also launched their newest comedy serye, ''Juan Tamad'' with StarStruck Alumni Sef Cadayona, Max Collins, RJ Padilla, Stephanie Sol, &amp; more, the show was premiering on August 23, 2015, a part of GMA 7's 65th Anniversary Offering.

==In Philippine folklore==

'''La Vaughn Belle''' is an artist from the [[United States Virgin Islands]] who uses a variety of media including drawings, paintings, woodwork, ceramics, photography, and video.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/world/europe/denmark-statue-black-woman.html|title=Denmark Gets First Public Statue of a Black Woman, a ‘Rebel Queen’|last=Sorensen|first=Martin Selsoe|date=2018-03-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacqueline-bishop/la-vaughn-belles-contempo_b_5917632.html|title=La Vaughn Belle's Contemporary Art Practice of Speaking in Layers|last=Bishop|first=Jacqueline|date=2014-10-03|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is best known for co-creating with Jeannette Ehlers the 23-foot tall statue “I Am Queen Mary,” the first public statue of a black woman in Denmark, featuring labor leader [[Mary Thomas (labor leader)|Mary Thomas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Belle was born on the island of [[Tobago]], but moved to the [[United States Virgin Islands]] when she was young and considers herself a native.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stcroixthisweek.com/st-croix/art/meet-cover-artist-lavaughn-belle.html|title=Meet Cover Artist LaVaughn Belle|last=Week|first=|date=|website=www.stcroixthisweek.com|publisher=St. Croix This Week|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother is from Tobago and her father is from [[Barbados]]. She attended [[Columbia University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], and in her junior year she took a painting class and decided to become an artist. However, she had already switched her major from Pre-Med to English, and couldn't switch majors again. After receiving her bachelor's degree, she started teaching and moved back to St. Croix. She received an MFA at el [[Instituto Superior de Arte]] in [[Cuba]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Works ==
Belle considers herself a contemporary artist and has stated she likes her art to speak "in layers."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She seeks to undermine and challenge the European-based hierarchical caste system in the Caribbean, which she believes places people of African descent at the bottom of the social pyramid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She regularly incorporates colonial artifacts into her work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== "Somebody’s Been Sitting In My Chair" ===
Belle created the video performance “Somebody’s Been Sitting In My Chair” where Goldilocks walks into a Great House. Inside displays several people sitting in a planter’s chair. It is meant to reflect the taboo surrounding not being able to touch anything in a Caribbean Great House.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== “Chaney” pieces ===
These feature broken ceramics from China and Denmark that often resurface after it rains in the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== "I Am Queen Mary" statue ===
Denmark was an active participant in the transatlantic slave trade and greatly benefitted from it, though has never officially apologized. Belle co-created the statue "I Am Queen Mary" with fellow black artist Jeannette Ehlers to challenge "Denmark’s collective memory" about slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-industry-news-natural-history-museum-1257872|title=Art Industry News: Museum of Natural History Sued Over Expansion Plans + More Must-Read Stories {{!}} artnet News|date=2018-04-02|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/denmark-gets-statue-of-a-rebel-queen-who-led-fiery/article_5155dd3c-8d20-552d-aead-45cdb0796365.html|title=Denmark gets statue of a ‘rebel queen’ who led fiery revolt against colonialism|last=Times|first=Martin Selsoe Sorensen {{!}} The New York|work=The Santa Fe New Mexican|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 23-foot statue depicts [[Mary Thomas (labor leader)|Mary Thomas]], who helped lead the [[1878 St. Croix labor riot|1878 "Fireburn" labor riot]] in [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]] where workers in the [[Danish West Indies]] staged a protest.&lt;ref name="Lewishon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Divers Information on The Romantic History of St. Croix: From the Time of Columbus until Today|last=Lewishon|first=Florence|publisher=Dukane Press|year=1964|pages=48–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olwig"&gt;{{cite book|title=Small Islands, Large Questions: Society, Culture and Resistance in the Post-Emancipation Caribbean|date=14 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|editor-last=Olwig|editor-first=Karen Fog|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theglowup.theroot.com/in-queen-mary-denmarks-first-public-monument-honoring-1824263350|title=I Am Queen Mary, Denmark’s 1st Public Monument Honoring a Black Woman, Recalls a Fierce Rebel|last=Branigin|first=Anne|work=The Glow Up|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sits on a peacock chair, recalling “the iconic 1967 photograph of Huey P.

{{confuse|Group of Lie type}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''Lie group''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|l|iː}} "Lee") is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a [[differentiable manifold]], with the property that the group operations are smooth. Lie groups are named after Norwegian mathematician [[Sophus Lie]], who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous [[transformation group]]s.

In rough terms, a Lie group is a continuous group, that is, one whose elements are described by several real parameters. As such, Lie groups provide a natural model for the concept of continuous symmetry, such as rotational symmetry in three dimensions. Lie groups are widely used in many parts of modern mathematics and physics. Lie's original motivation for introducing Lie groups was to model the continuous symmetries of [[differential equations]], in much the same way that finite groups are used in [[Galois theory]] to model the discrete symmetries of [[algebraic equations]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Circle as Lie group.svg|right|thumb|The set of all [[complex number]]s with [[absolute value]] 1 (corresponding to points on the [[circle]] of center 0 and radius 1 in the [[complex plane]]) is a Lie group under complex multiplication:  the [[circle group]].]]
Lie groups are [[smoothness|smooth]] [[differentiable manifold]]s and as such can be studied using [[differential calculus]], in contrast with the case of more general [[topological group]]s. One of the key ideas in the theory of Lie groups is to replace the ''global'' object, the group, with its ''local'' or linearized version, which Lie himself called its "infinitesimal group" and which has since become known as its [[Lie algebra]].

Lie groups play an enormous role in modern [[geometry]], on several different levels. [[Felix Klein]] argued in his [[Erlangen program]] that one can consider various "geometries" by specifying an appropriate transformation group that leaves certain geometric properties [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. Thus [[Euclidean geometry]] corresponds to the choice of the group [[Euclidean group|E(3)]] of distance-preserving transformations of the Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, [[conformal geometry]] corresponds to enlarging the group to the [[conformal group]], whereas in [[projective geometry]] one is interested in the properties invariant under the [[projective group]]. This idea later led to the notion of a [[G-structure]], where ''G'' is a Lie group of "local" symmetries of a manifold.

Lie groups (and their associated Lie algebras) play a major role in modern physics, with the Lie group typically playing the role of a symmetry of a physical system. Here, the [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] of the Lie group (or of its [[Lie algebra representation|Lie algebra]]) are especially important. Representation theory [[Particle physics and representation theory|is used extensively in particle physics]]. Groups whose representations are of particular importance include [[3D_rotation_group|the rotation group SO(3)]] (or its [[3D_rotation_group#Connection_between_SO(3)_and_SU(2)|double cover SU(2)]]),  [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for SU(3)#Representations of the SU.283.29 group|the special unitary group SU(3)]] and the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]].

On a "global" level, whenever a Lie group [[group action|acts]] on a geometric object, such as a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] or a [[symplectic manifold]], this action provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure. The presence of continuous symmetries expressed via a [[Lie group action]] on a manifold places strong constraints on its geometry and facilitates [[global analysis|analysis]] on the manifold. Linear actions of Lie groups are especially important, and are studied in [[representation theory]].

In the 1940s&amp;ndash;1950s, [[Ellis Kolchin]], [[Armand Borel]], and [[Claude Chevalley]] realised that many foundational results concerning Lie groups can be developed completely algebraically, giving rise to the theory of [[algebraic group]]s defined over an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]]. This insight opened new possibilities in pure algebra, by providing a uniform construction for most [[finite simple group]]s, as well as in [[algebraic geometry]]. The theory of [[automorphic form]]s, an important branch of modern [[number theory]], deals extensively with analogues of Lie groups over [[adele ring]]s; [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] Lie groups play an important role, via their connections with Galois representations in number theory.

== Definitions and examples ==
A '''real Lie group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a finite-dimensional real [[Differentiable manifold#Definition|smooth manifold]], in which the group operations of [[multiplication]] and inversion are [[smooth map]]s.  Smoothness of the group multiplication

:&lt;math&gt; \mu:G\times G\to G\quad \mu(x,y)=xy&lt;/math&gt;

means that μ is a smooth mapping of the [[Manifold#Cartesian products|product manifold]] ''G''×''G'' into ''G''.  These two requirements can be combined to the single requirement that the mapping
:&lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto x^{-1}y&lt;/math&gt;
be a smooth mapping of the product manifold into ''G''.

=== First examples ===
* The 2×2 [[real number|real]] [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] form a group under multiplication, denoted by [[general linear group|GL(2, '''R''')]] or by GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''):

:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{GL}(2, \mathbf{R}) = \left\{A=\begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\c&amp;d\end{pmatrix}: \det A=ad-bc \ne 0\right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

: This is a four-dimensional [[compact space|noncompact]] real Lie group; it is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^4&lt;/math&gt;. This group is [[connected space|disconnected]]; it has two connected components corresponding to the positive and negative values of the [[determinant]].

* The [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] matrices form a [[subgroup]] of GL(2, '''R'''), denoted by SO(2, '''R'''). It is a Lie group in its own right: specifically, a one-dimensional compact connected Lie group which is [[diffeomorphic]] to the [[circle]]. Using the rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; as a parameter, this group can be [[parametric equations|parametrized]] as follows:
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SO}(2, \mathbf{R}) =\left\{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\varphi &amp; -\sin \varphi \\ \sin \varphi &amp; \cos \varphi \end{pmatrix}:  \varphi\in\mathbf{R}/2\pi\mathbf{Z}\right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

:Addition of the angles corresponds to multiplication of the elements of SO(2, '''R'''), and taking the opposite angle corresponds to inversion. Thus both multiplication and inversion are differentiable maps.

* The [[Affine group#Matrix representation|affine group of one dimension]] is a two-dimensional matrix Lie group, consisting of &lt;math&gt;2\times 2&lt;/math&gt; real, upper-triangular matrices, with the first diagonal entry being positive and the second diagonal entry being 1. Thus, the group consists of matrices of the form
::&lt;math&gt; A= \left( \begin{array}{cc} a &amp; b\\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right),\quad a&gt;0,\, b\in\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Counterexample ===
We now present an example of a group with an uncountable number of elements that is not a Lie group under a certain topology.   The group given by 

:&lt;math&gt;H = \left\{\left .\left(\begin{matrix}e^{2\pi i\theta} &amp; 0\\0 &amp; e^{2\pi ia\theta}\end{matrix}\right) \right| \theta \in \mathbb{R}\right\} \subset \mathbb{T}^2 = \left\{\left .\left(\begin{matrix}e^{2\pi i\theta} &amp; 0\\0 &amp; e^{2\pi i\phi}\end{matrix}\right)\right| \theta, \phi \in \mathbb{R}\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb P = \mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; a ''fixed'' [[irrational number]], is a subgroup of the [[torus]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T^2&lt;/math&gt; that is not a Lie group when given the [[subspace topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossmann|2001|loc=Chapter 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we take any small neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, for example, the portion of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is disconnected. The group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; winds repeatedly around the torus and forms a [[dense set|dense]] subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T^2&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Irrational line on a torus.png|thumb|right|A portion of the group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; inside &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T^2&lt;/math&gt;. Small neighborhoods of the element &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt; are disconnected in the subset topology on &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;]]

The group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; can, however, be given a different topology, in which the distance between two points &lt;math&gt;h_1,h_2\in H&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the length of the shortest path ''in the group H'' joining &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt;. In this topology, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is identified homeomorphically with the real line by identifying each element with the number &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. With this topology, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is just the group of real numbers under addition and is therefore a Lie group.

The group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is an example of a "[[Lie subgroup]]" of a Lie group that is not closed. See the discussion below of Lie subgroups in the section on basic concepts.

===Matrix Lie groups===

Let GL(''n''; '''C''') denote the group of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} invertible matrices with entries in '''C'''. Any [[Closed subgroup theorem|closed subgroup]] of GL(''n'', '''C''') is a Lie group;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.45&lt;/ref&gt; Lie groups of this sort are called '''matrix Lie groups.''' Since most of the interesting examples of Lie groups can be realized as matrix Lie groups, some textbooks restrict attention to this class, including those of Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rossmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossmann|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restricting attention to matrix Lie groups simplifies the definition of the Lie algebra and the exponential map. The following are standard examples of matrix Lie groups.
*The [[special linear group]]s over '''R''' and '''C''', SL(''n'', '''R''') and SL(''n'', '''C'''), consisting of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with determinant one and entries in '''R''' or '''C'''
*The [[unitary group]]s and special unitary groups, U(''n'') and SU(''n''), consisting of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} complex matrices satisfying &lt;math&gt;U^*=U^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (and also &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{det}(U)=1&lt;/math&gt; in the case of SU(''n''))
*The [[orthogonal group]]s and special orthogonal groups, O(''n'') and SO(''n''), consisting of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} real matrices satisfying &lt;math&gt;R^\mathrm{T}=R^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (and also &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{det}(R)=1&lt;/math&gt; in the case of SO(''n''))
All of the preceding examples fall under the heading of the [[classical group]]s.

=== Related concepts ===
A '''[[complex Lie group]]''' is defined in the same way using [[complex manifold]]s rather than real ones (example: SL(2, '''C''')), and similarly, using an alternate [[Complete metric space#Completion|metric completion]] of '''Q''', one can define a '''''p''-adic Lie group''' over the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]], a topological group in which each point has a ''p''-adic neighborhood. [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] asked whether replacing differentiable manifolds with topological or analytic ones can yield new examples. The answer to this question turned out to be negative: in 1952, [[Andrew Gleason|Gleason]], [[Deane Montgomery|Montgomery]] and [[Leo Zippin|Zippin]] showed that if ''G'' is a topological manifold with continuous group operations, then there exists exactly one analytic structure on ''G'' which turns it into a Lie group (see also [[Hilbert&amp;ndash;Smith conjecture]]). If the underlying manifold is allowed to be infinite-dimensional (for example, a [[Hilbert manifold]]), then one arrives at the notion of an infinite-dimensional Lie group.  It is possible to define analogues of many [[group of Lie type|Lie groups over finite fields]], and these give most of the examples of [[finite simple group]]s.

The language of [[category theory]] provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie group is a [[group object]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of smooth manifolds. This is important, because it allows generalization of the notion of a Lie group to [[supergroup (physics)|Lie supergroups]].

== More examples of Lie groups ==
{{see also|Table of Lie groups|List of simple Lie groups}}

Lie groups occur in abundance throughout mathematics and physics. [[Matrix group]]s or [[algebraic group]]s are (roughly) groups of matrices (for example, [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] and [[symplectic group]]s), and these give most of the more common examples of Lie groups.

===Dimensions one and two===
The only connected Lie groups with dimension one are the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (with the group operation being addition) and the group &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers with absolute value one (with the group operation being multiplication). The &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; group is often denoted as &lt;math&gt;U(1)&lt;/math&gt;, the group of &lt;math&gt;1\times 1&lt;/math&gt; unitary matrices.

In two dimensions, if we restrict attention to simply connected groups, then they are classified by their Lie algebras. There are (up to isomorphism) only two Lie algebras of dimension two. The associated simply connected Lie groups are &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; (with the group operation being vector addition) and the affine group in dimension one, described in the previous subsection under "first examples."

=== Additional examples ===
*The [[Special unitary group#n_.3D_2|group SU(2)]] is the group of &lt;math&gt;2\times 2&lt;/math&gt; unitary matrices with determinant 1. Topologically, SU(2) is the 3-sphere &lt;math&gt;S^3&lt;/math&gt;; as a group, it may be identified with the group of unit [[quaternion]]s. 
*The [[Heisenberg group]] is a connected [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] Lie group of dimension 3, playing a key role in [[quantum mechanics]].
*The [[Lorentz group]] is a 6-dimensional Lie group of linear [[isometry|isometries]] of the [[Minkowski space]].
*The [[Poincaré group]] is a 10-dimensional Lie group of [[affine transformation|affine]] isometries of the Minkowski space.
*The [[exceptional Lie group]]s of types [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[F4 (mathematics)|''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E6 (mathematics)|''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E7 (mathematics)|''E''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E8 (mathematics)|''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]] have dimensions 14, 52, 78, 133, and 248. Along with the A-B-C-D series of [[simple Lie group]]s, the exceptional groups complete the list of simple Lie groups. 
*The [[symplectic group]] Sp(2''n'', '''R''') consists of all 2''n'' × 2''n'' matrices preserving a ''[[symplectic form]]'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. It is a connected Lie group of dimension 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n''.

=== Constructions ===
There are several standard ways to form new Lie groups from old ones:
*The product of two Lie groups is a Lie group.
*Any [[Closed set|topologically closed]] subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie group. This is known as the [[Closed subgroup theorem]] or '''Cartan's theorem'''.
*The quotient of a Lie group by a closed normal subgroup is a Lie group.
*The [[universal cover]] of a connected Lie group is a Lie group. For example, the group '''R''' is the universal cover of the circle group '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In fact any covering of a differentiable manifold is also a differentiable manifold, but by specifying ''universal'' cover, one guarantees a group structure (compatible with its other structures).

=== Related notions ===
Some examples of groups that are ''not'' Lie groups (except in the trivial sense that any group can be viewed as a 0-dimensional Lie group, with the [[discrete topology]]), are:

*Infinite-dimensional groups, such as the additive group of an infinite-dimensional real vector space. These are not Lie groups as they are not ''finite-dimensional'' manifolds.
*Some [[totally disconnected group]]s, such as the [[Galois group]] of an infinite extension of fields,  or the additive group of the ''p''-adic numbers. These are not Lie groups because their underlying spaces are not real manifolds. (Some of these groups are "''p''-adic Lie groups".) In general, only topological groups having similar [[local property|local properties]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some positive integer ''n'' can be Lie groups (of course they must also have a differentiable structure).

== Basic concepts ==

=== The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group ===
{{main|Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence}}
To every Lie group we can associate a Lie algebra whose underlying vector space is the tangent space of the Lie group at the identity element and which completely captures the local structure of the group. Informally we can think of elements of the Lie algebra as elements of the group that are "[[infinitesimal]]ly close" to the identity, and the Lie bracket of the Lie algebra is related to the [[commutator]] of two such infinitesimal elements. Before giving the abstract definition we give a few examples:
* The Lie algebra of the vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is just '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the Lie bracket given by &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [''A'',&amp;nbsp;''B''] = 0. &lt;br /&gt; (In general the Lie bracket of a connected Lie group is always 0 if and only if the Lie group is abelian.)
* The Lie algebra of the [[general linear group]] GL(''n'', '''C''') of invertible matrices is the vector space M(''n'', '''C''') of square matrices with the Lie bracket given by &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [''A'',&amp;nbsp;''B''] = ''AB''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''BA''.
*If ''G'' is a closed subgroup of GL(''n'', '''C''') then the Lie algebra of ''G'' can be thought of informally as the matrices ''m'' of M(''n'', '''R''') such that 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε''m'' is in ''G'', where ε is an infinitesimal positive number with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (of course, no such real number ε exists). For example, the orthogonal group O(''n'', '''R''') consists of matrices ''A'' with ''AA''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, so the Lie algebra consists of the matrices ''m'' with (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε''m'')(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε''m'')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, which is equivalent to ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 because ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
*The preceding description can be made more rigorous as follows. The Lie algebra of a closed subgroup ''G'' of GL(''n'', '''C'''), may be computed as
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Lie}(G) = \{ X \in M(n;\mathbb{C}) | \operatorname{exp}(tX) \in G \text{ for all } t \text{ in } \mathbb{\mathbb{R}} \},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|loc=Ch. II, § 2, Proposition 2.7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where exp(''tX'') is defined using the [[matrix exponential]]. It can then be shown that the Lie algebra of ''G'' is a real vector space that is closed under the bracket operation, &lt;math&gt;[X,Y]=XY-YX&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The concrete definition given above for matrix groups is easy to work with, but has some minor problems: to use it we first need to represent a Lie group as a group of matrices, but not all Lie groups can be represented in this way, and even it is not obvious that the Lie algebra is independent of the representation we use.&lt;ref&gt;But see {{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Proposition 3.30 and Exercise 8 in Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; To get around these problems we give 
the general definition of the Lie algebra of a Lie group (in 4 steps):
#Vector fields on any smooth manifold ''M'' can be thought of as [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivations]] ''X'' of the ring of smooth functions on the manifold, and therefore form a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket [''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'']&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''XY''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''YX'', because the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of any two derivations is a derivation.
#If ''G'' is any group acting smoothly on the manifold ''M'', then it acts on the vector fields, and the vector space  of vector fields fixed by the group is closed under the Lie bracket and therefore also forms a Lie algebra.
#We apply this construction to the case when the manifold ''M'' is the underlying space of a Lie group&amp;nbsp;''G'', with ''G'' acting on ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M'' by left translations ''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''(''h'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''gh''. This shows that the space of left invariant vector fields (vector fields satisfying ''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''X&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' =&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;gh&lt;/sub&gt;'' for every ''h'' in ''G'', where ''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the differential of ''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'') on a Lie group is a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket of vector fields.
#Any tangent vector at the identity of a Lie group can be extended to a left invariant vector field by left translating the tangent vector to other points of the manifold. Specifically, the left invariant extension of an element ''v'' of the tangent space at the identity is the vector field defined by ''v''^&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''v''. This identifies the [[tangent space]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;G'' at the identity with the space of left invariant vector fields, and therefore makes the tangent space at the identity into a Lie algebra, called the Lie algebra of ''G'', usually denoted by a [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|Fraktur]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}.&lt;/math&gt; Thus the Lie bracket on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is given explicitly by [''v'',&amp;nbsp;''w'']&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''v''^,&amp;nbsp;''w''^]&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;.

This Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional and it has the same dimension as the manifold ''G''. The Lie algebra of ''G'' determines ''G'' up to "local isomorphism", where two Lie groups are called '''locally isomorphic''' if they look the same near the identity element.
Problems about Lie groups are often solved by first solving the corresponding problem for the Lie algebras, and the result for groups then usually follows easily.  
For example, simple Lie groups are usually classified by first classifying the corresponding Lie algebras.

We could also define a Lie algebra structure on ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' using right invariant vector fields instead of left invariant vector fields. This leads to the same Lie algebra, because the inverse map on ''G'' can be used to identify left invariant vector fields with right invariant vector fields, and acts as &amp;minus;1 on the tangent space ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The Lie algebra structure on ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' can also be described as follows:
the commutator operation

: (''x'', ''y'') → ''xyx''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;

on ''G'' &amp;times; ''G'' sends (''e'',&amp;nbsp;''e'') to ''e'', so its derivative yields a [[bilinear operator|bilinear operation]] on ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;G''. This bilinear operation is actually the zero map, but the second derivative, under the proper identification of tangent spaces, yields an operation that satisfies the axioms of a [[Lie algebra#Definition and first properties|Lie bracket]], and it is equal to twice the one defined through left-invariant vector fields.

=== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ===
If ''G'' and ''H'' are Lie groups, then a Lie group homomorphism ''f'' : ''G'' → ''H''  is a smooth [[group homomorphism]]. In the case of complex Lie groups, such a homomorphism is required to be a [[holomorphic map]]. However, these requirements are a bit stringent; every continuous homomorphism between real Lie groups turns out to be (real) [[analytic map|analytic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.50. Hall only claims smoothness, but the same argument shows analyticity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of two Lie homomorphisms is again a homomorphism, and the class of all Lie groups, together with these morphisms, forms a [[category theory|category]]. Moreover, every Lie group homomorphism induces a homomorphism between the corresponding Lie algebras. Let &lt;math&gt;\phi\colon G \to H&lt;/math&gt; be a Lie group homomorphism and let &lt;math&gt;\phi_{*}&lt;/math&gt; be its [[Pushforward (differential)|derivative]] at the identity. If we identify the Lie algebras of ''G'' and ''H'' with their [[tangent space]]s at the identity elements then &lt;math&gt;\phi_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is a map between the corresponding Lie algebras:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{*}\colon\mathfrak g \to \mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;
One can show that &lt;math&gt;\phi_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is actually a [[Lie algebra homomorphism]] (meaning that it is a [[linear map]] which preserves the [[Lie bracket]]). In the language of [[category theory]], we then have a covariant [[functor]] from the category of Lie groups to the category of Lie algebras which sends a Lie group to its Lie algebra and a Lie group homomorphism to its derivative at the identity.

Two Lie groups are called ''isomorphic'' if there exists a [[bijective]] homomorphism between them whose inverse is also a Lie group homomorphism. Equivalently, it is a [[diffeomorphism]] which is also a group homomorphism. 

===Lie group versus Lie algebra isomorphisms===
Isomorphic Lie groups necessarily have isomorphic Lie algebras; it is then reasonable to ask how isomorphism classes of Lie groups relate to isomorphism classes of Lie algebras.

The first result in this direction is [[Lie's third theorem]], which states that every finite-dimensional, real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of  some (linear) Lie group. One way to prove Lie's third theorem is to use [[Ado's theorem]], which says every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is isomorphic to a matrix Lie algebra. Meanwhile, for every finite-dimensional matrix Lie algebra, there is a linear group (matrix Lie group) with this algebra as its Lie algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.20&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras need not be isomorphic. Furthermore, this result remains true even if we assume the groups are connected. To put it differently, the ''global'' structure of a Lie group is not determined by its Lie algebra; for example, if ''Z'' is any discrete subgroup of the center of ''G'' then ''G'' and ''G''/''Z'' have the same Lie algebra (see the [[table of Lie groups]] for examples). An example of importance in physics are the groups [[Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(2)|SU(2)]] and [[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3)]]. These two groups have isomorphic Lie algebras&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Example 3.27&lt;/ref&gt;, but the groups themselves are not isomorphic, because SU(2) is simply connected but SO(3) is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 1.3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, if we require that the Lie group be [[simply connected]], then the global structure is determined by its Lie algebra: two simply connected Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras are isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 5.7&lt;/ref&gt; (See the next subsection for more information about simply connected Lie groups.) In light of Lie's third theorem, we may therefore say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional real Lie algebras and isomorphism classes of simply connected Lie groups.

===Simply connected Lie groups===
{{see also|Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence|Fundamental group#Lie groups}}
A Lie group ''G'' is said to be '''[[Simply connected space|simply connected]]''' if every loop in ''G'' can be shrunk continuously to a point in ''G''. This notion is important because of the following result that has simple connectedness as a hypothesis:
:'''Theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;: Suppose &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are Lie groups with Lie algebras &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;f:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie algebra homomorphism. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is simply connected, then there is a unique Lie group homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_*=f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi_*&lt;/math&gt; is the differential of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; at the identity.
[[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence#The correspondence|Lie's third theorem]] says that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a Lie group. It follows from Lie's third theorem and the preceding result that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a ''unique'' simply connected Lie group.

An example of a simply connected group is the special unitary group [[Special unitary group#n_.3D_2|SU(2)]], which as a manifold is the 3-sphere. The [[rotation group SO(3)]], on the other hand, is not simply connected. (See [[Rotation group SO(3)#Topology|Topology of SO(3)]].) The failure of SO(3) to be simply connected is intimately connected to the distinction between [[integer spin]] and [[half-integer spin]] in quantum mechanics. Other examples of simply connected Lie groups include the special unitary group [[SU(n)]], the spin group (double cover of rotation group) [[Spin(n)]] for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;, and the compact symplectic group [[Symplectic group#Sp.28n.29|Sp(n)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 13.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for determining whether a Lie group is simply connected or not are discussed in the article on [[Fundamental group#Lie groups|fundamental groups of Lie groups]].

===The exponential map===
{{Main|Exponential map (Lie theory)}}
{{see also|derivative of the exponential map|normal coordinates}}

The [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] from the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;M(n;\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt;  of the [[general linear group]] &lt;math&gt;GL(n;\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;GL(n;\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the [[matrix exponential]], given by the usual power series:

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(X) = 1 + X + \frac{X^2}{2!} + \frac{X^3}{3!} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

for matrices &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subgroup of &lt;math&gt;GL(n;\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt;, then the exponential map takes the Lie algebra of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; thus, we have an exponential map for all matrix groups. Every element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that is sufficiently close to the identity is the exponential of a matrix in the Lie algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.42&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition above is easy to use, but it is not defined for Lie groups that are not matrix groups, and it is not clear that the exponential map of a Lie group does not depend on its representation as a matrix group. We can solve both problems using a more abstract definition of the exponential map that works for all Lie groups, as follows.

For each vector &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the tangent space to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; at the identity), one proves that there is a unique one-parameter subgroup &lt;math&gt;c:\mathbb R\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c'(0)=X&lt;/math&gt;. Saying that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a one-parameter subgroup means simply that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth map into &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and that 

:&lt;math&gt;c(s + t) = c(s) c(t)\ &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''s'' and ''t''. The operation on the right hand side is the group multiplication in ''G''. The formal similarity of this formula with the one valid for the [[exponential function]] justifies the definition

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(X) = c(1).\ &lt;/math&gt;

This is called the '''exponential map''', and it maps the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; into the Lie group ''G''. It provides a [[diffeomorphism]] between a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of 0 in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; and a neighborhood of ''e'' in ''G''. This exponential map is a generalization of the exponential function for real numbers (because '''R''' is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of [[positive real numbers]] with multiplication), for complex numbers (because '''C''' is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of non-zero complex numbers with multiplication) and for [[matrix (math)|matrices]] (because M(''n'', '''R''') with the regular commutator is the Lie algebra of the Lie group GL(''n'', '''R''') of all invertible matrices).

Because the exponential map is surjective on some neighbourhood ''N'' of ''e'', it is common to call elements of the Lie algebra '''infinitesimal generators''' of the group ''G''. The subgroup of ''G'' generated by ''N'' is  the identity component of ''G''.

The exponential map and the Lie algebra determine the ''local group structure'' of every connected Lie group, because of the [[Baker&amp;ndash;Campbell&amp;ndash;Hausdorff formula]]: there exists a neighborhood ''U'' of the zero element of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, such that for ''X'', ''Y'' in ''U'' we have

:&lt;math&gt; \exp(X)\,\exp(Y) = \exp\left(X + Y + \tfrac{1}{2}[X,Y] + \tfrac{1}{12}[\,[X,Y],Y] - \tfrac{1}{12}[\,[X,Y],X] - \cdots \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the omitted terms are known and involve Lie brackets of four or more elements. In case ''X'' and ''Y'' commute, this formula reduces to the familiar exponential law {{nowrap|exp(''X'') exp(''Y'') {{=}}}} {{nowrap|exp(''X'' + ''Y'')}}.

The exponential map relates Lie group homomorphisms. That is, if &lt;math&gt;\phi: G \to H&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie group homomorphism and &lt;math&gt;\phi_*: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; the induced map on the corresponding Lie algebras, then for all &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\exp(x)) = \exp(\phi_{*}(x)).\,&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]],&lt;ref group=Note&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~vkiritch/MAT552/ProblemSet1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928024044/http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~vkiritch/MAT552/ProblemSet1.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ExponentialMap-01.png|center]]

(In short, exp is a [[natural transformation]] from the functor Lie to the identity functor on the category of Lie groups.)

The exponential map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group is not always [[Surjective function|onto]], even if the group is connected (though it does map onto the Lie group for connected groups that are either compact or nilpotent). For example, the exponential map of [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] is not surjective. Also, exponential map is not surjective nor injective for infinite-dimensional (see below) Lie groups modelled on [[Smooth function#Differentiability classes|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Fréchet space]], even from arbitrary small neighborhood of 0 to corresponding neighborhood of 1.

=== Lie subgroup ===
A '''Lie subgroup''' ''H'' of a Lie group ''G'' is a Lie group that is a [[subset]] of ''G'' and such that the [[inclusion map]] from ''H'' to ''G'' is an [[injective]] [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] and [[group homomorphism]]. According to [[Closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]], a closed [[subgroup]] of ''G'' admits a unique smooth structure which makes it an [[embedding|embedded]] Lie subgroup of ''G''—i.e. a Lie subgroup such that the inclusion map is a smooth embedding.

Examples of non-closed subgroups are plentiful; for example take ''G'' to be a torus of dimension ≥ 2, and let ''H'' be a [[one-parameter subgroup]] of ''irrational slope'', i.e. one that winds around in ''G''. Then there is a Lie group [[homomorphism]] φ : '''R''' → ''G'' with ''H'' as its image. The [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''H'' will be a sub-torus in ''G''.

The [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] gives a [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence#The correspondence|one-to-one correspondence]] between the connected Lie subgroups of a connected Lie group ''G'' and the subalgebras of the Lie algebra of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.20&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, the subgroup corresponding to a subalgebra is not a  closed subgroup.  There is no criterion solely based on the structure of ''G'' which determines which subalgebras correspond to closed subgroups.

==Representations==
{{main|Representation of a Lie group}}
{{see also|Compact group#Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group|Lie algebra representation}}
One important aspect of the study of Lie groups is their representations, that is, the way they can act (linearly) on vector spaces. In physics, Lie groups often encode the symmetries of a physical system. The way one makes use of this symmetry to help analyze the system is often through representation theory. Consider, for example, the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]] in quantum mechanics, &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}\psi = E\psi&lt;/math&gt;. Assume the system in question has the [[rotation group SO(3)]] as a symmetry, meaning that the Hamiltonian operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the action of SO(3) on the wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;. (One important example of such a system is the [[Hydrogen atom]].) This assumption does not necessarily mean that the solutions &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are rotationally invariant functions. Rather, it means that the ''space'' of solutions to &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}\psi = E\psi&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under rotations (for each fixed value of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;). This space, therefore, constitutes a representation of SO(3). These representations have been [[Representation of a Lie group#An example: The rotation group SO.283.29|classified]] and the classification leads to a substantial [[Hydrogen-like atom|simplification of the problem]], essentially converting a three-dimensional partial differential equation to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation.

The case of a connected compact Lie group ''K'' (including the just-mentioned case of SO(3)) is particularly tractable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Part III&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, every finite-dimensional representation of ''K'' decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The irreducible representations, in turn, were classified by [[Hermann Weyl]]. [[Compact group#Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group|The classification]] is in terms of the "highest weight" of the representation. The classification is closely related to the [[Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras|classification of representations of a semisimple Lie algebra]].

One can also study (in general infinite-dimensional) unitary representations of an arbitrary Lie group (not necessarily compact). For example, it is possible to give a relatively simple explicit description of the [[Representation theory of SL2(R)|representations of the group SL(2,R)]] and the [[Wigner%27s classification|representations of the Poincaré group]].

== Early history ==
According to the most authoritative source on the early history of Lie groups (Hawkins, p.&amp;nbsp;1), [[Sophus Lie]] himself considered the winter of 1873–1874 as the birth date of his theory of continuous groups. Hawkins, however, suggests that it was "Lie's prodigious research activity during the four-year period from the fall of 1869 to the fall of 1873" that led to the theory's creation (''ibid''). Some of Lie's early ideas were developed in close collaboration with [[Felix Klein]].  Lie met with Klein every day from October 1869 through 1872: in Berlin from the end of October 1869 to the end of February 1870, and in Paris, Göttingen and Erlangen in the subsequent two years (''ibid'', p.&amp;nbsp;2). Lie stated that all of the principal results were obtained by 1884. But during the 1870s all his papers (except the very first note) were published in Norwegian journals, which impeded recognition of the work throughout the rest of Europe (''ibid'', p.&amp;nbsp;76). In 1884 a young German mathematician, [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]], came to work with Lie on a systematic treatise to expose his theory of continuous groups. From this effort resulted the three-volume ''Theorie der Transformationsgruppen'', published in 1888, 1890, and 1893. The term ''groupes de Lie'' first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie's student Arthur Tresse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Sur les invariants différentiels des groupes continus de transformations | author= Arthur Tresse |journal=Acta Mathematica|volume=18|year=1893|pages=1–88 |doi=10.1007/bf02418270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lie's ideas did not stand in isolation from the rest of mathematics. In fact, his interest in the geometry of differential equations was first motivated by the work of [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]], on the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s of first order and on the equations of [[classical mechanics]].  Much of Jacobi's work was published posthumously in the 1860s, generating enormous interest in France and Germany (Hawkins, p.&amp;nbsp;43). Lie's ''idée fixe'' was to develop a theory of symmetries of differential equations that would accomplish for them what [[Évariste Galois]] had done for algebraic equations: namely, to classify them in terms of group theory. Lie and other mathematicians showed that the most important equations for [[special functions]] and [[orthogonal polynomials]] tend to arise from group theoretical symmetries. In Lie's early work, the idea was to construct a theory of ''continuous groups'', to complement the theory of [[discrete group]]s that had developed in the theory of [[modular form]]s, in the hands of [[Felix Klein]] and [[Henri Poincaré]]. The initial application that Lie had in mind was to the theory of [[differential equation]]s. On the model of [[Galois theory]] and [[polynomial equation]]s, the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying, by the study of [[symmetry]], the whole area of [[ordinary differential equation]]s. However, the hope that Lie Theory would unify the entire field of ordinary differential equations was not fulfilled. Symmetry methods for ODEs continue to be studied, but do not dominate the subject. There is a [[differential Galois theory]], but it was developed by others, such as Picard and Vessiot, and it provides a theory of [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]]s, the [[indefinite integral]]s required to express solutions.

Additional impetus to consider continuous groups came from ideas of [[Bernhard Riemann]], on the foundations of geometry, and their further development in the hands of Klein. Thus three major themes in 19th century mathematics were combined by Lie in creating his new theory: the idea of symmetry, as exemplified by Galois through the algebraic notion of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]; geometric theory and the explicit solutions of [[differential equation]]s of mechanics, worked out by [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] and Jacobi; and the new understanding of [[geometry]] that emerged in the works of [[Julius Plücker|Plücker]], [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]], [[Grassmann]] and others, and culminated in Riemann's revolutionary vision of the subject.

Although today Sophus Lie is rightfully recognized as the creator of the theory of continuous groups, a major stride in the development of their structure theory, which was to have a profound influence on subsequent development of mathematics, was made by [[Wilhelm Killing]], who in 1888 published the first paper in a series entitled ''Die Zusammensetzung der stetigen endlichen Transformationsgruppen'' (''The composition of continuous finite transformation groups'') (Hawkins, p.&amp;nbsp;100). The work of Killing, later refined and generalized by [[Élie Cartan]], led to classification of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s, Cartan's theory of [[Riemannian symmetric space|symmetric spaces]], and [[Hermann Weyl]]'s description of [[group representation|representations]] of compact and semisimple Lie groups using [[highest weight]]s.

In 1900 [[David Hilbert]] challenged Lie theorists with his [[Hilbert's fifth problem|Fifth Problem]] presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris.

Weyl brought the early period of the development of the theory of Lie groups to fruition, for not only did he classify irreducible representations of semisimple Lie groups and connect the theory of groups with quantum mechanics, but he also put Lie's theory itself on firmer footing by clearly enunciating the distinction between Lie's ''infinitesimal groups'' (i.e., Lie algebras) and the Lie groups proper, and began investigations of topology of Lie groups.{{sfnp|Borel|2001}} The theory of Lie groups was systematically reworked in modern mathematical language in a monograph by [[Claude Chevalley]].

==The concept of a Lie group, and possibilities of classification==
Lie groups may be thought of as smoothly varying families of symmetries. Examples of symmetries include rotation about an axis.  What must be understood is the nature of 'small' transformations, for example, rotations through tiny angles, that link nearby transformations. The mathematical object capturing this structure is called a Lie algebra ([[Sophus Lie|Lie]] himself called them "infinitesimal groups"). It can be defined because Lie groups are smooth manifolds, so have [[tangent space]]s at each point.

The Lie algebra of any compact Lie group (very roughly: one for which the symmetries form a bounded set) can be decomposed as a [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of an [[abelian Lie algebra]] and some number of [[simple Lie group|simple]] ones. The structure of an abelian Lie algebra is mathematically uninteresting (since the Lie bracket is identically zero); the interest is in the simple summands. Hence the question arises: what are the [[simple Lie group|simple Lie algebras]] of compact groups? It turns out that they mostly fall into four infinite families, the "classical Lie algebras" A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, which have simple descriptions in terms of symmetries of Euclidean space. But there are also just five "exceptional Lie algebras" that do not fall into any of these families. E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is the largest of these.

Lie groups are classified according to their algebraic properties ([[simple group|simple]], [[semisimple group|semisimple]], [[solvable group|solvable]], [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]], [[abelian group|abelian]]), their [[connectedness]] ([[connected space|connected]] or [[simply connected space|simply connected]]) and their [[compact space|compactness]].

A first key result is the [[Levi decomposition]], which says that every simply connected Lie group is the semidirect product of a solvable normal subgroup and a semisimple subgroup. 

*Connected [[compact Lie group]]s are all known: they are finite central quotients of a product of copies of the circle group '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and simple compact Lie groups (which correspond to connected [[Dynkin diagram]]s).
*Any simply connected solvable Lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices of some rank, and any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of such a group is 1-dimensional. Solvable groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions.
*Any simply connected nilpotent Lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal of some rank, and any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of such a group is 1-dimensional. Like solvable groups, nilpotent  groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions.
*[[Simple Lie group]]s are sometimes defined to be those that are simple as abstract groups, and sometimes defined to be connected Lie groups with a simple Lie algebra. For example, [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] is simple according to the second definition but not according to the first. They have all been [[list of simple Lie groups|classified]] (for either definition).
*[[Semisimple group|Semisimple]] Lie groups are Lie groups whose Lie algebra is a product of simple Lie algebras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sigurdur |last=Helgason |title=Differential Geometry, Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |year=1978 |page=131 |isbn=0-12-338460-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are central extensions of products of simple Lie groups.

The [[identity component]] of any Lie group is an open [[normal subgroup]], and the [[quotient group]] is a [[discrete group]]. The universal cover of any connected Lie group is a simply connected Lie group, and conversely any connected Lie group is a quotient of a simply connected Lie group by a discrete normal subgroup of the center. Any Lie group ''G'' can be decomposed into discrete, simple, and abelian groups in a canonical way as follows.  Write 
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;con&lt;/sub&gt; for the connected component of the identity
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt; for the largest connected normal solvable subgroup
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;nil&lt;/sub&gt; for the largest connected normal nilpotent subgroup
so that we have a sequence of normal subgroups
:1 ⊆ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;nil&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;con&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''G''.
Then
:''G''/''G''&lt;sub&gt;con&lt;/sub&gt; is discrete
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;con&lt;/sub&gt;/''G''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[group extension|central extension]] of a product of [[list of simple Lie groups|simple connected Lie groups]].
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt;/''G''&lt;sub&gt;nil&lt;/sub&gt; is abelian. A connected abelian Lie group is isomorphic to a product of copies of  '''R''' and the [[circle group]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;nil&lt;/sub&gt;/1 is nilpotent, and therefore its ascending central series has all quotients abelian.

This can be used to reduce some problems about Lie groups (such as finding their unitary representations) to the same problems for connected simple groups and nilpotent and solvable subgroups of smaller dimension.

* The [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphism group]] of a Lie group acts transitively on the Lie group
* Every Lie group is [[parallelizable]], and hence an [[orientable manifold]] (there is a [[fibre bundle|bundle isomorphism]] between its [[tangent bundle]] and the product of itself with the [[tangent space]] at the identity)

==Infinite-dimensional Lie groups==
Lie groups are often defined to be finite-dimensional, but there are many groups that resemble Lie groups, except for being infinite-dimensional. The simplest way to define infinite-dimensional Lie groups is to  model them locally on [[Banach space]]s (as opposed to [[Euclidean space]] in the finite-dimensional case), and in this case much of the basic theory is similar to that of finite-dimensional Lie groups. However this is inadequate for many applications, because many natural examples of infinite-dimensional Lie groups are not Banach manifolds. Instead one needs to define Lie groups modeled on more general [[Locally convex space|locally convex]] topological vector spaces. In this case the relation between the Lie algebra and the Lie group becomes rather subtle, and several results about finite-dimensional Lie groups no longer hold.

The literature is not entirely uniform in its terminology as to exactly which properties of infinite-dimensional groups qualify the group for the prefix ''Lie'' in ''Lie group''. On the Lie algebra side of affairs, things are simpler since the qualifying criteria for the prefix ''Lie'' in ''Lie algebra'' are purely algebraic. For example, an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra may or may not have a corresponding Lie group. That is, there may be a group corresponding to the Lie algebra, but it might not be nice enough to be called a Lie group, or the connection between the group and the Lie algebra might not be nice enough (for example, failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity). It is the "nice enough" that is not universally defined.

Some of the examples that have been studied include:
*The group of [[diffeomorphism]]s of a manifold. Quite a lot is known about the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. Its Lie algebra is (more or less) the [[Witt algebra]], whose [[Lie algebra extension|central extension]] the [[Virasoro algebra]] (see [[Lie algebra extension#Virasoro algebra|Virasoro algebra from Witt algebra]] for a derivation of this fact) is the symmetry algebra of [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]]. Diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds of larger dimension are [[Convenient vector space#Regular Lie groups|regular Fréchet Lie groups]]; very little about their structure is known.
The diffeomorphism group of spacetime sometimes appears in attempts to [[Quantization (physics)|quantize]] gravity.
*The group of smooth maps from a manifold to a finite-dimensional Lie group is an example of a [[gauge group]] (with operation of [[pointwise multiplication]]), and is used  in [[quantum field theory]] and [[Donaldson theory]]. If the manifold is a circle these are called [[loop group]]s, and have central extensions whose Lie algebras are (more or less) [[Kac&amp;ndash;Moody algebra]]s.
*There are infinite-dimensional analogues of general linear groups, orthogonal groups, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bäruerle|de Kerf|ten Kroode|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important aspect is that these may have ''simpler'' topological properties: see for example [[Kuiper's theorem]]. In [[M-theory]], for example, a 10 dimensional SU(N) gauge theory becomes an 11 dimensional theory when N becomes infinite.

'''Music recording certification''' is a system of certifying that a music [[Sound recording|recording]] has shipped, sold, or streamed a certain number of units. The threshold quantity varies by type (such as album, [[single (music)|single]], [[music video]]) and by nation or territory (see [[List of music recording certifications]]).

Almost all countries follow variations of the [[RIAA certification]] categories, which are named after precious materials ([[gold]], [[platinum]] and [[diamond]]).

The threshold required for these awards depends upon the population of the territory where the recording is released. Typically, they are awarded only to international releases and are awarded individually for each country where the album is sold. Different sales levels, some perhaps 10 times lower than others, may exist for different music media (for example: videos versus [[album]]s, singles, or downloads).

== History ==
The original gold and silver record awards were presented to artists by their own record companies to publicize their sales achievements. The first silver disc was awarded by [[Regal Zonophone]] to [[George Formby]] in December 1937 for sales of 100,000 copies of "[[The Window Cleaner]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgeformby.co.uk/alan_randall/memorobilia/list.htm |title=Alan's treasured possessions |work=Alan Randall's Memorabilia |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PUFMCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&amp;lpg=PT54 |title=George Formby: An Intimate Biography of the Troubled Genius |publisher=Lulu Press |first=David |last=Bret |page=54 |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-291-87257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first gold disc was awarded by [[RCA Victor]] (under division imprint [[Bluebird Records]])  to [[Glenn Miller and His Orchestra]] in February 1942, celebrating the sale of 1.2 million copies of single "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]". Another example of a company award is the gold record awarded to [[Elvis Presley]] in 1956 for one million units sold of his single "[[Don't Be Cruel]]". The first gold record for an [[LP record|LP]] was awarded by RCA Victor to [[Harry Belafonte]] in 1957 for the album ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' (1956), the first album to sell over 1,000,000 copies in RCA's reckoning.

At the industry level, in 1958 the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] introduced its gold record award program for records of any kind, [[LP record|albums]] or [[single (music)|singles]], which achieved one million dollars in retail sales. These sales were restricted to U.S.-based record companies and did not include exports to other countries.&lt;ref name="Venable2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gold: A Cultural Encyclopedia |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |first=Shannon L. |last=Venable |year=2011 |isbn= 0-313-38431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shelton1986"&gt;{{cite book |title=No Direction Home: The Life and Music of Bob Dylan |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |first=Robert |last=Shelton |page=389 |year=1986 |isbn=0-688-05045-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For albums in 1968, this would mean shipping approximately 250,000 units; for singles the number would be higher due to their lower retail price.&lt;ref name="Shelton1986" /&gt; The platinum certification was introduced in 1976 for the sale of one million units for albums and two million for singles, with the gold certification redefined to mean sales of 500,000 units for albums and one million for singles.&lt;ref name="White1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Billboard Book of Gold &amp; Platinum Records |publisher=Billboard Books |first=Adam |last=White |page=viii |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-7119-2196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; No album was certified platinum prior to this year. For instance, the recording by [[Van Cliburn]] of [[Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 (Van Cliburn 1958 recording)|the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto]] from 1958 would eventually be awarded a platinum citation, but this would not happen until two decades after its release. In 1999, [[list of best-selling albums in the United States|the diamond certification]] was introduced for sales of ten million units. In the late 1980s, the certification thresholds for singles were dropped to match that of albums.&lt;ref name="White1990" /&gt;

{{Main|RIAA certification}}
[[File:Artie's Gold Record.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Gold record presented to [[Artie Schroeck]] for his arrangement on "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]", 1967]]
The first official designation of a "gold record" by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was established for [[single (music)|singles]] in 1958, and the RIAA also [[trademark]]ed the term "gold record" in the United States. On 14 March 1958, the RIAA certified its first gold record, [[Perry Como]]'s hit single "[[Catch a Falling Star]]". The ''[[Oklahoma! (soundtrack)|Oklahoma!]]'' soundtrack was certified as the first gold album four months later. In 1976, RIAA introduced the platinum certification, first awarded to the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] compilation album ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'' on 24 February 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=Eagles&amp;ti=Their+greatest+hits&amp;lab=&amp;genre=&amp;format=&amp;date_option=release&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;award=&amp;type=&amp;category=&amp;adv=SEARCH# |title=Gold &amp; Platinum: Eagles/Their Greatest Hits 1971 - 1975 |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Johnnie Taylor]]'s single "[[Disco Lady]]" on 22 April 1976.&lt;ref name="riaa-story"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/story/ |title=Story of Gold &amp; Platinum |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=&amp;ti=&amp;lab=&amp;genre=&amp;format=&amp;date_option=release&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;award=P&amp;type=&amp;category=&amp;adv=SEARCH&amp;col=certification_date&amp;ord=asc#search_section |title=Gold &amp; Platinum: Platinum Awards |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As music sales increased with the introduction of compact discs, the RIAA created the Multi-Platinum award in 1984. Diamond awards, honoring those artists whose sales of singles or albums reached 10,000,000 copies, were introduced in 1999.&lt;ref name="riaa-award-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/about-awards/ |title=About the Awards |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, and for a part of the first decade of the 21st, it was common for distributors to claim certifications based on their shipments – wholesale to retail outlets – which led to many certifications which outstripped the actual final retail sales figures. This became much less common once the majority of retail sales became paid digital downloads and digital streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunecore.com/blog/2011/04/getting-a-gold-record-by-selling-nothing.html |title=Getting A Gold Record By Selling Nothing |publisher=TuneCore |first=Jeff |last=Price |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital media certification ===
In most countries certifications no longer apply solely to physical media but now also include sales awards recognizing digital [[download]]s (in the U.S. and U.K. since 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodbye, 2004. Hello, 2005!|url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=&amp;resultpage=30&amp;id=D518ECA3-C7F5-6CDB-F346-A6E9BDEF73C9|publisher=Recording Industry Association of American|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, the RIAA also certified the [[ringtone]] downloads of songs. Streaming from on-demand services such as [[Apple Music]],
[[Spotify]], [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] and [[Napster (streaming music service)|Napster]] has been included into existing digital certification in the U.S since 2013 and the U.K. and Germany since 2014. In the U.S. and Germany video streaming services like [[YouTube]], [[VEVO]], and [[Yahoo! Music]] also began to be counted towards the certification, in both cases using the formula of 100 streams being equivalent to one download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&amp;news_month_filter=5&amp;id=03662575-C88F-51CF-779C-8396A2B8D74D |title=RIAA Adds Digital Streams To Historic Gold &amp; Platinum Awards |publisher=RIAA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924161215/http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&amp;news_month_filter=5&amp;id=03662575-C88F-51CF-779C-8396A2B8D74D |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stream"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1560846/exclusive-on-demand-streams-now-count-toward-riaa-gold-platinum |title=Exclusive: On-Demand Streams Now Count Toward RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum|author= Alex Pham |date= 9 May 2013 |work=Billboard }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikindustrie.de/aktuell_einzel/news/neuer-diamond-award-fuer-die-erfolgreichsten-singles-und-alben-in-deutschland/|title=Neuer DIAMOND AWARD für die erfolgreichsten Singles und Alben in Deutschland|publisher=Bundesverband Musikindstie|accessdate=15 May 2014|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626082058/http://www.musikindustrie.de/aktuell_einzel/news/neuer-diamond-award-fuer-die-erfolgreichsten-singles-und-alben-in-deutschland/|archivedate=26 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as Denmark and Spain, maintain separate awards for digital download singles and streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ifpi.dk/?q=node/11|title=IFPI Denmark: Guld og platin (2014)|year=2014|publisher=[[IFPI]] Denmark|language=Danish|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promusicae.es/listas/semanales|title=Listas semanales: 14 July 2014 – 20.7.2014|publisher=[[PROMUSICAE]]|language=Spanish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727040623/http://www.promusicae.es/listas/semanales|archivedate=27 July 2014|date=July 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IFPI certification ===
The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) was founded in 1996, and grants the IFPI Platinum Europe Award for album sales over one million within Europe and (as of October 2009) the Middle East. Multi-platinum Europe Awards are presented for sales in subsequent multiples of one million. Eligibility is unaffected by time (from date of release), and is not restricted to European-based artists.

=== IMPALA certification ===
The [[Independent Music Companies Association]] (IMPALA) was founded in 2000 to grow the independent music sector and promote independent music in the interests of artistic, entrepreneurial and cultural diversity. IMPALA sales awards were launched in 2005 as the first sales awards recognising that success on a pan-European basis begins well before sales reach one million. The award levels are Silver (20,000+), Double Silver (40,000+), Gold (75,000+), Double Gold (150,000+), Diamond (200,000+), Platinum (400,000+) and Double Platinum (800,000+).

== Certification thresholds ==
{{Main|List of music recording certifications}}

[[File:Gold Record.jpg|thumb|Boy band [[Plus One (band)|Plus One]] displaying their gold records]]
Below are certification thresholds for the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and France. The numbers in the tables are in terms of "units", where a unit represents one sale or one shipment of a given medium. Certification is often awarded cumulatively, and it is possible for a single album to be certified silver, gold, and platinum in turn. An album that becomes Platinum twice over, for example, an album which has sold 2,000,000 copies in the United States, is said to be "Double-Platinum", or sometimes "Multi-Platinum".

== Manufacture of awards ==
[[File:Saadoaliw1.jpg|thumb|[[Somali people|Somali]] singer [[Saado Ali Warsame]] receiving a gold record Lifetime Achievement Award]]
The plaques themselves contain various items under the glass. Modern awards often use CDs instead of records. Most gold and platinum records are actually vinyl records which have been [[Vacuum metallizing|vacuum metallized]] and tinted, while trimmed and plated metal "masters", "mothers", or "stampers" (metal parts used for pressing records out of vinyl) were initially used. The music in the grooves on the record may not match the actual recording being awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/154422901/ |title=All That Music is Not Gold |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |page=65 |date=12 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual plaque-makers produced their awards according to available materials and techniques employed by their graphic arts departments. The plaques, depending on size and elaborateness of design, cost anywhere between [[US$]]135 and $275, most often ordered and purchased by the record label that issued the original recording.

'''Nyumba ya Sanaa''' (in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], "House of Art"), also known as the '''Mwalimu&lt;ref&gt;''Mwalimu'', "teacher", is a honorary title widely used in Tanzania to refer to the country's first president, [[Julius Nyerere]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nyerere Cultural Centre''' or '''Julius Nyerere Cultural Centre''', is a cultural centre, art workshop and shop located in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]], established to promote local art and craftmanship.

The Centre was founded by [[United States|American]] [[Maryknoll]] Sister [[Jean Pruitt]] in 1972. It is intended to support local artists and help them display and sell their works. The centre also stages dance and music exhibitions, and it is one of the major visitor attractions in Dar es Salaam.

Painter and sculptor [[George Lilanga]], one of the most famous and internationally acclaimed Tanzanian artists, began his career at the Centre. Part of the buildings of the Centre, as well as its main entrance gates, have been decorated by Lilanga. Other notable artists that have operated at Nyumba ya Sanaa include [[Augustino Malaba]], [[Patrick Francis]], and [[Robino Ntila]].

'''Provincetown Arts''' is an annual magazine published in midsummer that focuses on artists, performers and writers who inhabit or visit Lower Cape Cod and the cultural life of the nation's oldest continuous artists' colony in Provincetown. Drawing upon a century-long tradition of art, theater and writing, Provincetown Arts publishes essays, fiction, interviews, journals, poetry, profiles, reporting, reviews and visual features.&lt;ref name="duotrope"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://duotrope.com/listing/16438|title=Duotrope - Provincetown Arts Magazine|website=duotrope.com|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provincetown Arts is published by Provincetown Arts Press, Inc., a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]] organization.&lt;ref name="findthecompany"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofits.findthecompany.com/l/196173/Provincetown-Arts-Press-Inc|website=nonprofits.findthecompany.com|title=Provincetown Arts Press, Inc.|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Provincetown Arts was launched in 1985.&lt;ref name="provincetownarts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://provincetownarts.org/home/?page_id=182|title=About &amp;#124; Provincetown Arts Magazine|website=provincetownarts.org|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Christopher Busa, who is also the publisher and editorial director. He is the son of painter Peter Busa (1914–1985),&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-peter-busa-11686|title=Oral history interview with Peter Busa, 1965 September 5 &amp;#124; Archives of American Art|website=aaa.si.edu|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; who participated in the formative years of Abstract Expressionism and formed a school for painters in Provincetown.

Contributors to the magazine include emerging artists as well as established figures. Its articles mainly cover art, culture, and literature. Articles also feature topics of national interest, including profiles of prominent figures, human interest stories, interviews and book reviews.

Since 2006, the magazine has featured in each issue two cover artists, one visual artist and one writer. There was an exception to this format in 2014, when the magazine focused on the centennial celebration of the Provincetown Art Association and Museum.&lt;ref name="wbur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/artery/2014/10/20/provincetown-frame-project|title=Provincetown Is Reframing Its History In A Cool New Way &amp;#124; The ARTery|website=wbur.org|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious views on love''' vary widely between different religions. 

==Specific religious views==

===Bahá'í===
{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|"Love is the mystery of divine revelations! Love is the effulgent manifestation! Love is the spiritual fulfilment! Love is the light of the Kingdom! Love is the breath of the Holy Spirit inspired into the human spirit! Love is the cause of the manifestation of the Truth (God) in the phenomenal world!. Love is the necessary tie proceeding from the realities of things through divine creation!"|`Abdu'l-Bahá, ''Tablets of `Abdu'l-Bahá'' v3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1909 |title = Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Chicago, USA |pages=524–526 |id =  |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TAB/tab-573.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], taught that God created humans due to his love for them, and thus humans should in turn love [[God]]. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], Bahá'u'lláh's son, wrote that love is the greatest power in the world of existence and the true source of eternal happiness.  The [[Bahá'í teachings]] state that all genuine love is divine, and that love proceeds from God and from humans.  God's love is taught to be part of his own essence, and his love for his creatures gives them their material existence, divine grace and eternal life.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= love |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 227–228 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í teachings state that human love is directed towards both God and other humans; that the love of God attracts the individual toward God, by purifying the human heart and preparing it for the revelation of divine grace.  Thus through the love of God, humans become transformed and become self-[[sacrifice|sacrificing]]. It is also stated that true love for other humans occurs when people see the beauty of God in other people's [[soul]]s. The Bahá'í teachings state that Bahá'ís should love all humans regardless of religion, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or community, and also should love their enemies.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

===Buddhist===
In [[Buddhism]], ''[[kāma]]'' is sensuous,  love. The vast majority believe it to be an obstacle on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], perceiving it as selfish.

''[[Karuṇā]]'' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom, and is necessary for enlightenment.

''[[Advesa]]'' and ''[[mettā]]'' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from common conceptions of love which are often confused with attachment and sexual desire, and can be self-interested. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.

The Bodhisattva ideal in Tibetan Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish love for others.

===Christian===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Theological virtues]] --&gt;
Most Christians also believe that [[God]] is the source and essence of eternal [[Love of God (Christianity)|love]], even if in the [[New Testament]] the expression "God is love" explicitly occurs only twice and in two not too distant verses: [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] {{bibleref2-nb|1 John|4:8,16|NIV}} (NIV).

Most Christians believe that the greatest commandment is "thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment"; in addition to the second, "thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself", these are what [[Jesus Christ]] called the two greatest commandments (see Mark 12:28–34, Luke 10:25–28, Matthew 22:37–39, Matthew 7:12; cf. Deuteronomy 6:5, Deuteronomy 11:13, Deuteronomy 11:22, Leviticus 19:18, Leviticus 19:34). See also [[Ministry of Jesus#General ethics]].

In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus said: "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], if you love one another." (NIV, John 13:34–35; cf. John 15:17). Jesus also taught "[[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|Love your enemies]]." (Matthew 5:44, Luke 6:27).

{{Quote box|

|quote="Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."
|source=[[1 Corinthians]] 13:4–7 (NIV)|}}

The New Testament, which was written in Greek, only used two Greek words for love: ''[[agapē]]'' and ''[[philia]]''. However, there are several [[Greek words for love]].
*''Agapē''. In the New Testament, ''[[agapē]]'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love seen as creating goodness in the world, it is the way God is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for others.
*''Philia''. Also used in the New Testament, ''[[philia]]'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful.  Also known as "brotherly love".
*''[[Eros (love)|Eros]]'' (sexual love) is never used in the New Testament but is more prominent in the Old Testament.
*''[[Storge]]'' (needy child-to-parent love) only appears in the compound word ''philostorgos'' (Rom 12:10).

[[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] glorifies ''agapē'' in the quote above from [[1 Corinthians]] 13, and as the most important virtue of all: "Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away." (13:8 [[NIV]]).

Christians believe that because of [[God]]'s ''agapē'' for humanity He sacrificed his Son for them. [[John the Apostle]] wrote, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved." ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16–17 [[KJV]])

In ''[[Works of Love]]'' (1847), [[Søren Kierkegaard]], a philosopher, claimed that Christianity is unique because love is a ''requirement''.

Regarding love for enemies, Jesus is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five:

''“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.  He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.  If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?  Are not even the tax collectors doing that?  And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?  Do not even pagans do that?  Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”
- Matthew 5: 43-48''

Tertullian wrote regarding love for enemies: ''“Our individual, extraordinary, and perfect goodness consists in loving our enemies.  To love one's friends is common practice, to love one's enemies only among Christians.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Swartley | first=Willard M. | title=The Love of Enemy and Nonretaliation in the New Testament, Studies in peace and scripture; (As Scapulam I) cited by Hans Haas, Idee und Ideal de Feindesliebe in der ausserchristlichen Welt (Leipzig: University of Leipzig, 1927). | publisher= Westminster John Knox Press | year= 1992 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjbYqFHzg_EC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Our+individual,+extraordinary,+and+perfect+goodness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MFo5tSwfag&amp;sig=cB9PzBTiz9lzkMonKUmtXxpggpc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc6KLEg9rLAhUUVWMKHRTlCFUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Our%20individual%2C%20extraordinary%2C%20and%20perfect%20goodness&amp;f=false |page=24 | isbn=9780664253547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latter-day Saints====
[[File:Book of Mormon English Missionary Edition Soft Cover.jpg|150px|thumb|right|And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God. ~ The ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', {{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|2|17}}   ]]

According to [[Russell M. Nelson]], there are examples of the love of [[Jesus]] in the [[Book of Mormon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/2011/10/what-the-book-of-mormon-teaches-about-the-love-of-god?lang=eng |title= What the Book of Mormon Teaches about the Love of God |first= Russell M. |last= Nelson |authorlink= Russell M. Nelson | date= October 2011 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First there is a [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] with Christ. [[King Benjamin]] stated in the [[Book of Mosiah]]:

{{quote|And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.|{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|5|7}} }}

Then there are the [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] of the gospel. Jesus stated in the Book of Mormon in [[Third Nephi]]:

{{quote|Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.| {{lds|3 Nephi|3-ne|27|20}} }}

And at last Jesus exhorts us to follow his example:

{{quote|And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according to the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just. Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.| {{lds|3 Nephi|3-ne|27|27}} }}

[[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], the last prophet of the book, wrote about love:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/01/a-book-about-gods-love?lang=eng |title= A Book about God’s Love  |first= Lenet |last= Read |authorlink= Lenet Read | date= January 1988 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.|{{lds|Moroni|moro|7|47}} }}

===Islam===
{{religious text primary|section|date=June 2012}}
In the Sahih Muslim [[Hadith]], the Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said: “You will not enter paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another.”

Muslims are directed by Allah ('God') in the ways to become close to Him and how to gain His love.

God loves those who:
*do good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|195|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|134|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|93|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are pure and clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|222|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|108|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are righteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|76|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|4|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|7|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|96|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are just and act rightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|42|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|49|9|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|60|8|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*trust Him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|159|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are patient and persevering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|146|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*love Him and follow the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*fight in His cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|61|4|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an also says that God loved Moses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|20|39|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and God Himself will produce people He will love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|54|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here in this selection of verses we notice again the Arabic preference for the negative to state an opposite. While the following do not state that God hates, it certainly enforces the idea that the love of God is withheld from those who practice certain deeds or are described as manifesting a certain character. Several of the verses are repetitious and so we have the following categories.

God does not love:
*the mua'tadeen, those who overstep boundaries or limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|190|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|87|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|55|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the fasideen, those who spread corruption or mischief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|205|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|64|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|77|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the kafireen, the unbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|32|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|30|45|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the dalemeen, the wrongdoers or oppressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|57|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|140|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|42|40|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the musarifeen, the wasteful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|6|141|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the proud and boastful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|31|18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|57|23|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|16|23|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*those who boast in their riches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|76|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the treacherous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|8|58|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*those who are given to crime and to evil speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|107|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmadiyya'''

According to the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims, love of the creatures of God is essential for all Muslims. Ahmadi Muslims express that the Qur'an was sent as a gift to mankind, and its teachings are filled with love, tolerance and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/reply/Love-for-All-Pamphlet.pdf | title=Love for All Pamphlet| publisher=alislam.org | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of the Ahmadiyya sect in Islam, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The task for which God has appointed me is that I should remove the malaise that afflicts the relationship between God and His creatures and restore the relationship of love and sincerity between them. Through the proclamation of truth and by putting an end to religious conflicts, I should bring about peace and manifest the Divine verities that have become hidden from the eyes of the world. I am called upon to demonstrate spirituality which lies buried under egoistic darkness. It is for me to demonstrate by practice, and not by words alone, the Divine powers which penetrate into a human being and are manifested through prayer or attention. Above all, it ismy task to re-establish in people’s hearts the eternal plant of the pure and shining Unity of God which is free from every impurity of polytheism, and which has now completely disappeared. All this will be accomplished, not through my power, but through the power of the Almighty God, Who is the God of heaven and earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewofreligions.org/10547/the-purpose-of-the-advent-of-the-promised-messiah-2/| title=The Purpose of the Advent of the Promised Messiah | publisher=[[Review of Religions]] | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hindu===
In Hinduism ''[[kāma]]'' is pleasurable, personified by the god [[Kama (Hinduism)|Kama]]. For many Hindu schools it is the third end in life.

In contrast to ''kāma'', ''[[prema (love)|prema]]'' or ''prem'' refers to elevated love. Love in Hinduism is sacrament. It preaches that one gives up selfishness in love, not expecting anything in return.

It also believes "God is love". A sacred text named Kanda Guru Kavasa quotes, " Oh holy Great flame, Grant me with love..
You said the spreading love is Para Brahma,
For the thing which is everywhere is only Love,
And Love is the only thing which is like a soul within us,
Love is Kumara, Love is Kanda" Simply means Love is God.


The love of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Avatar|deity]] [[Krishna]] with [[Radha]] and many other [[gopi]]s (milkmaids) of [[Vrindavana]] is highly revered. His amorous dance with the [[gopi]]s became known as the ''[[Rasa lila]]''&lt;ref name="golove"&gt;{{cite book | title=Gopīs' Love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa| last=Hanumanprasad| first=Poddar| year=1941| publisher=Gita Press| location=Gorakhpur}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were romanticised in the poetry of [[Jayadeva]], the author of [[Gita Govinda]]. These became important as part of the development of the Krishna bhakti traditions worshiping [[Radha]] [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Quote box|

|quote="And you shall love the &lt;small&gt;[[Tetragrammaton|LORD]]&lt;/small&gt; your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might."
|source=[[Deuteronomy]] 6:5|}}

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Ahava'' is the most Commonly used term for both interpersonal love of family and love of God. Other related but dissimilar terms are ''chen'' (grace, good will, kindness) and ''[[chesed]]'' (kindness, love), which basically combines the meaning of "affection" and "compassion" and is sometimes rendered in English as "loving-kindness" or "steadfast love."

As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: "See life with the wife you love" ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The Biblical book [[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]] is considered a romantically-phrased metaphor of love between God and his people, but in its plain reading reads like a love song.

===Polytheism===
Different cultures have deified love, typically in both male and female form. Even though in monotheistic religions, the God is considered to represent love, there are often [[angel]]s or similar beings that represent love as well.
* [[Áine]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of fertility and passionate love in [[Irish mythology]]
* [[Eros]] or [[Cupid]]&amp;nbsp;– god of passionate love in [[Roman mythology]]
* [[Antheia]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess in [[Crete mythology]] of love, flowers, gardens, and marshes
* [[Aonghus]] or ''Aengus''— god of beauty, youth, and sensual love in Irish mythology
* [[Aphrodite]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of beauty and passionate love in [[Greek mythology]]
* [[Astarte]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of love in Canaanite mythology
* [[Eros (god)|Eros]]&amp;nbsp;– god of passionate love in Greek mythology
* [[Freyja]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of love, fertility and war in [[Norse mythology]]
* [[Hathor]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of love in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]
* [[Inanna]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of sexual love in [[Sumerian mythology]]
* [[Ishtar]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of love and war in [[Babylonian mythology]]
* [[Kama (Hinduism)|Kama]]&amp;nbsp;– god of sensual love in [[Hindu mythology]]
* [[Mithra|Mihr]]&amp;nbsp;– spirit of love in [[Persian mythology]]
* [[Rati]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of passionate love in Hindu mythology
* [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of beauty and passionate love in Roman mythology
* [[Xochipilli]]&amp;nbsp;– god in [[Aztec mythology]].

===Sikhism===

In [[Sikhism]] Love  means love for the Lord and His creation. This is one of five virtues that is vigorously promoted by the Sikh Gurus. The other four qualities in the arsenal are: ''[[Truth]]'' (Sat), ''[[Contentment]]'' (Santokh), ''[[Compassion]]'' (Daya) and ''[[Humility]]'' (Nimrata). These five qualities are essential to a Sikh and it is their duty to meditate and recite the [[Gurbani]] so that these virtues become a part of their mind set.

This is a very positive and powerful tool in the Sikhs arsenal of virtues. When one's mind is full of love, the person will overlook deficiency in others and accept them wholeheartedly as a product of God. Sikhism asks all believers to take on "god-like" virtues and this perhaps is the most "god-like" characteristic of all. Gurbani tells us that Waheguru is a "loving God", full of compassion and kindness. It is the duty of the Sikh to take on qualities of this nature and to easily forgive; to never hate anyone; to live in His Hukam - "Will" and to practise compassion and humility.

"jin prem keyo tin hee prab paeyo" &amp;nbsp;- "Only those who have love, will attain God" - Guru Gobind Singh Ji.

===Unificationism===

The concept of True Love is the most central part of Unificationist theology.

From "MAPPING KNOWLEDGE: THE UNIFICATION ENCYCLOPEDIA PROJECT" http://www.unification.net/misc/ency.html

"The central value in human life, which we may term "true love," means that which seeks the best for others and the betterment of human life in all its dimensions. True love means living for others, giving without thought of a return. Its source is transcendental, beyond the self; the person who practices true love taps into an inexhaustible reservoir of life. The various philosophies and religions of the world speak of this value with a variety of emphases, aspects, and concepts, such as: compassion, grace, justice, charity, liberation, righteousness, and agape love. While recognizing that certain of these aspects may sometimes be in tension (e.g., the well-known Jewish discussion of the dichotomy between divine justice and divine mercy), we may regard the positive tendency of all of them as aspects of a single divine and universal value. This value, true love, is the aspiration and hope of all human beings and the manifestation of the best in human nature. "

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10878">'''Revolutionary songs''' are political songs that advocate or praise [[revolution]]s. They are used to boost morale, as well as for [[political]] [[propaganda]] or [[agitator|agitation]]. Amongst the most well-known revolutionary songs are "[[La Marseillaise]]" and "[[The Internationale]]". Many [[protest song]]s can be considered revolutionary - or later become canonized as revolutionary songs following a successful revolution. On the other hand, once a revolution is established, some of the aspects of [[protest song]] may be considered [[counter-revolutionary]].

Revolutionary songs are a notable part of propaganda. The singing of such songs is often considered as a demonstrative or revolutionary action. Such songs have been known to lend solidarity to disjointed political communities. Some revolutionary songs have appeared spontaneously; others have been written by notable authors, such as [[Bertolt Brecht]]. Revolutionary songs are frequently targeted at certain governments.

==By country==
Music was part of the cultural support of the earliest revolutions, and institutionalized as a genre of socialist or workers' music in countries including the [[Soviet Union]], its former [[Eastern Europe]]an satellites, [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cuba]] and [[North Korea]], as well as less permanent revolutionary movements in other countries.

===French Revolution===
During the [[French Revolution]] notable songs, beyond [[La Marseillaise]], included [[Chant du départ]], [[Carmagnole]], ''[[Ah! ça ira|Ah! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira]]'' (1790), Allons Français au Champs de Mars (1790), L'aristocratie en déroute (1790), Aux bons citoyens (1790), Le bonnet de la liberté, and many more.

===American Revolution===
Songs during the [[American Revolutionary War]] with revolutionary lyrics and propaganda purposes include songs such as "[[Dying Redcoat]]", "[[Free America]]", "[[Poor Old Tory]]", and "[[Jefferson and Liberty]]".

===Greek Revolution===
The successful [[Greek War of Independence]] between 1821 and 1832, generated not only revolutionary songs in Greece, but wide artistic and musical support from other western nations.

===Revolutions of 1848===
The [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Europe generated a wide range of revolutionary, nationalist and patriotic popular song. This tapped into earlier support for the Napoleonic revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Billington -Fire in the Minds of Men: Origins of the Revolutionary Faith - Page 589  1980 "See the anticipation of this idea in the revolutionary song of the 1830s, "The Devil is Dead": J. Puech, "Chants d'il y a cent ans, autour des Saint- Simoniens," La Revolution de 1848, 1933, Mar-Apr-May, 26-9. 122."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Music and German National Identity - Page 68 Celia Applegate, Pamela Maxine Potter - 2002 "Hymnic moments such as this also occur in the IV Marsche, especially in the lyrical, trio-like sections of the second and fourth pieces. The mixture of martial and religious elements in Schumann's "revolutionary" music is a sounding metaphor ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Athenæum: a journal of literature, science, the fine arts  Page 214 James Silk Buckingham, John Sterling, Frederick Denison Maurice - 1882 "Portraits of Kossuth and other heroes of the revolution adorn the parliament house ; revolutionary music is played freely everywhere, and the people are, she says, singularly impressionable to music."&lt;/ref&gt;
The current Romanian national anthem "[[Deșteaptă-te, române!]]" is a revolutionary song of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Tolz, Stephenie Booth -Nation and gender in contemporary Europe - Page 85  2005 "Some of the new symbols belonged to nineteenth-century nationalist imagery: the 1848 'revolutionary' song "Desteapta-te romane" (Awaken, Romanians) became the national anthem, while the red-yellow-blue banner was reinstated as the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Revolution===
{{main|Soviet music}}

===Spanish Civil War===
Many revolutionary songs appeared during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and subsequent [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|social revolution]], especially amongst members of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT). The most famous of these, "[[A Las Barricadas]]", remains popular for anarchist militants to this day.

===Europe===
In post-[[World War II]] [[Europe]], revolutionary songs were taught in schools and sung at celebrations and [[official functions]].&lt;ref&gt;A rebel in music: selected writings - Page 59  Hanns Eisler - 1978 "The most important requisite of revolutionary music is to divide it into music for practical performance: songs of struggle, satirical songs and so on, and music to be listened to: didactic plays, choral montage and choral pieces with a theoretical..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{main|Political music in China}}
Revolutionary songs were a prominent part of the popular culture of the [[People's Republic of China]] during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. One of the more popular Chinese revolutionary songs was "[[Nanniwan]]", a 1943 song lauding the exploits of the Chinese Red Army in a gorge in [[Shaanxi]] province near the revolutionary base of [[Yan'an]]. Revolutionary songs of Communist China often served to glorify the 1949 revolution and to present an image of unity amongst China's 56 ethnic groups and its various regions. Songs such as "[[The Sky Above the Liberated Zone]]" (praising the [[Communist Party of China]] and romanticizing life in the CCP-held liberated zones during the wars against [[Japan]] and the [[Kuomintang]]) and "[[Osmanthus Flowers Blooming Everywhere in August]]", a Red Army folk song from the [[Sichuan]] province, are among the best-known revolutionary songs from the wartime and [[Maoist]] periods in [[China]].

===North Korea===
{{main|Music of North Korea}}

===Vietnam===
{{main|Nhạc đỏ}}
Nhạc đỏ, "Red Music," is the common name of the revolutionary music (nhạc cách mạng) genre in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Cannon ''Reorienting the Voices in Nhạc cách mạng: Constructing Identity in Vietnamese Revolutionary Songs.''&lt;/ref&gt; Composers during the struggle against the French include [[Đinh Nhu]]&lt;ref&gt;Asian music: journal of the Society for Asian Music - Volume 35  Page 75 [[Society for Asian Music]] 2004 "Dinh Nhu (1910-1945) assumes an important position in the hagiography of Vietnamese revolutionary music. Captured by the French after participating in the Nghệ Tĩnh Soviet uprising in 1930, he organized cultural events in prison including .."&lt;/ref&gt; then songwriters of [[Vietnamese popular music]] such as [[Văn Cao]].

===Cuba and Latin America===
{{main|Music of Cuba}}
Cuba's national anthem "[[La Bayamesa]] (El Himno de Bayamo)" dates to 1868, but many new songs were generated by the revolution. The key focus is on the rural people.&lt;ref&gt;Music and Marx: ideas, practice, politics - Page 216 Karl Marx, Regula Qureshi - 2002 "The key term or trope in the identity discourse of Central American revolutionary music is el pueblo. Inclusive, positive, respectful, empowering and democratic are all inferential in the music's articulation of "the people." "&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Hasta siempre]]" (1965) was written when [[Che Guevara]] departed Cuba to spread the revolution in Africa. Another well known Latin American song, "[[El pueblo unido jamás será vencido]]" (1973), is not a revolutionary song, but a [[Chile]]an [[protest song]] in support of [[Salvador Allende]]. Cuban government sponsored revolutionary [[Nueva trova]] is often similar to [[Nueva canción]], Latin American [[protest song]]s.

===Iranian revolution===
Following the [[Iranian revolution]] musicians were obliged to create music different from the pre-revolutionary music both in terms of rhythm and content.&lt;ref&gt;Sanam Zahir, The music of the children of revolution Page 9 The University of Arizona. Near Eastern Studies - 2008 "Musicians have been obliged to create Iranian music different from the pre-revolutionary music is terms of rhythm and content, resulting in the growth of Iranian music and emergence of different genres and lyrical content unique to ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian revolutionary songs ({{lang-fa|سرودهای انقلاب اسلامی}}) are epic ballads, composed during the [[Islamic Revolution]] in [[Iran]] in support of the revolution and in opposition to the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. Before the success of the revolution, these chants were made by various political supporters- many of them recorded on cassette tapes in underground and home studios. On the anniversary of the revolution, many of the songs were broadcast by Iranian state television. In schools the songs have been sung by students as part of the celebrations Fajr for decades.

==Musical genres==
Some revolutionary songs intentionally mimic folk (children's) songs to make them palatable in non-political settings. An example of this type of song is a [[lullaby]] from Hungary (tentative translation follows), which starts off as a lullaby but shifts into more direct propaganda toward the end:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The bunch of little bears happily sleeping&lt;br&gt;
And the pool sleeps on a soft pillow&lt;br&gt;
The swing sleeps too, and the night will be their good blanket&lt;br&gt;
Dream, my little one, soft dream flies&lt;br&gt;
It flies to your eyes&lt;br&gt;
Be silent, little baby&lt;br&gt;
Our dreams were hushed away by the grim despotism&lt;br&gt;
And only our hunger sung our song.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another example is "Tomorrow Belongs to Me", which is performed by a young man in the movie ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]''.  It starts off as a sweet folk song about nature, and then it becomes apparent that the young man is a member of the [[Hitlerjugend]].  Soon the song changes into a marching song, and the lyrics became a fascist propaganda about "rising up."

Another kind of revolutionary songs are folk songs that become popular or change lyrics during revolutions or civil wars. Typical examples, the Mexican song "[[La Cucaracha]]" and the Russian song "[[Yablochko]]" (Little Apple) have humorous (often darkly humorous) lyrics that come in easily remembered stanzas and vary highly from singer to singer.

==Psychology==
The effect of some revolutionary song has been compared to a trumpeted [[cavalry charge]], inspiring individuals to be united with a larger group.&lt;ref&gt;Page 362 1985 "Like the charge played at football games, or a trumpeted cavalry charge, revolutionary music is inspirational. It helps individuals overcome fear and raises their emotions to a higher pitch, so that they may be united with a larger group."&lt;/ref&gt;

Island]] lead vocalist [[Lee Hong-ki]] as an [[Korean pop idol|idol star]] who learns to cope with his past and rediscovers music during community work at a hospice for terminally ill patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hong|first=Lucia|title=FTIsland Lee Hong-ki to make big screen debut|url=http://www.tenasia.com/ftisland-lee-hong-ki-to-make-big-screen-debut/|work=TenAsia|accessdate=2014-04-06|date=30 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407084611/http://www.tenasia.com/ftisland-lee-hong-ki-to-make-big-screen-debut/|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sunwoo|first=Carla|title=Not all is grim when the reaper pays a visit|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2972026|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2014-04-04|date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Chung-ui is a famous [[K-pop|Korean pop]] star with a temper. After he beats up a man at a night club, he is sentenced to do [[community service]] at a [[hospice]] for [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] patients. The reluctant young man first hates his chores and dislikes the people around him, but as he gets to know their stories, he becomes attached to them. The hospice struggles with funding, leading to a possible close-down, so the hospice in-house band, The Phoenix Band decides to apply to a talent show on television. For this, they need an original song, so they ask Chung-ui to help them. The singer refuses at first, then tries to use the opportunity to reduce his sentence days. He ends up seriously changing his mind about music, his behavior and grows to accept his mother's death, while helping the patients achieve their dreams. Even after the death of the band members, he continues to revive The Phoenix Band each time, assisting new patients.

The '''''Sacrifice of Isaac''''' is the title of two paintings from c. 1598 - 1603 depicting the [[sacrifice of Isaac]]. The paintings could be painted by the Italian master [[Caravaggio]] (1571–1610) but there is also strong evidence that they may have been the work of [[Bartolomeo Cavarozzi]], a talented early member of the Caravaggio following who is known to have been in Spain about 1617-1619.

== Princeton version ==

The ''Sacrifice of Isaac'' in the Piasecka-Johnson Collection in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], is a disputed work that was painted circa 1603. According to [[Giulio Mancini]], a contemporary of Caravaggio and an early biographer, the artist, while convalescing in the Hospital of the Consolazione, did a number of paintings for the prior who took them home with him to Seville. (The hospital had a Spanish prior from 1593 to around mid-1595). This would date the work to the mid-1590s, but it seems far more sophisticated than anything else known from that period of Caravaggio's career, and [[Peter Robb (author)|Peter Robb]], in his 1998 biography of Caravaggio, dates it to about 1598. The model for Isaac bears a close resemblance to the model used for the ''[[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist]]'' now in the museum of Toledo cathedral, which suggests that the two should be considered together. The presence of paintings by Caravaggio in Spain at an early date is important for the influence they may have had on the young [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], but there is also strong evidence that they may have been the work of [[Bartolomeo Cavarozzi]], a talented early member of the [[Caravaggio]] following who is known to have been in Spain about 1617-1619.

The painting shows the moment when [[Abraham]], about to sacrifice his son [[Isaac]] in obedience to God's command, is stayed by an [[angel]] who offers him a ram in Isaac's place. The scene is lit with the dramatically enhanced [[chiaroscuro]] (tenebrism) with which Caravaggio was to revolutionize Western art, falling like a stage spotlight on the face of the youthful angel; the faces of Abraham and Isaac are in shadow, but show acute emotions; the gestures of the hands are acutely eloquent, the angel's hand resting on the ram's head in imitation of the way Abraham's left hand rests on the head of his son, the [[Patriarch]]'s other hand holding the knife but already relaxing as he listens to the angel. The three figures and the ram are shown without background or context, with nothing to distract from the powerful psychological drama as God's promise is delivered.

== Uffizi version ==

The second ''Sacrifice of Isaac'' is housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], [[Florence]]. According to the early biographer Giovanni Bellori, Caravaggio painted a version of this subject for Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, the future [[Pope Urban VIII]], and a series of payments totalling one hundred scudi were made to the artist by Barberini between May 1603 and January 1604. Caravaggio had previously painted a ''[[Portrait of Maffeo Barberini]]'', which presumably pleased the cardinal enough for him to commission this second painting.

Isaac has been identified as [[Cecco del Caravaggio|Cecco Boneri]], who appeared as Caravaggio's model in several other pictures. Recent X-ray analysis showed that Caravaggio used Cecco also for the angel, and later modified the profile and the hair to hide the resemblance.

The '''Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre''' ({{lang-sl|Gledališče sester Scipion Nasice}}) was founded on October 13, 1983, with a founding manifesto (The Sister Letter). The manifesto set this theatre group a time frame of operation – four years – and described its stages from formation to self-destruction. The Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre (1983-1987) constituted – along with [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] and [[IRWIN]] groups – one of the three pillars of the [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] retrogarde movement. Within the retrogarde movement, theatre research engaged in the relation between religion, art and state. It focused on rituals and the function of spectacle in theatre and in the function of spectacle the state.

The founders of the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre were [[Eda Čufer]], [[Dragan Živadinov]] and [[Miran Mohar]].

The retrogarde production of events, as it was announced in the manifesto (The Sister Letter), incorporated an external manifestative part (actions) and an internal creative part (operations):
- external part: The Appearance (1983), The Resurrection (1984) and The Self-Destruction (1987)
- internal part: three stages of transformation - The Illegality (1984), The Exorcism (1985) and The Retro-Classic (1986)

In 1987, the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre performed self-destruction.

The '''Scottish Artists Union''' is the representative voice for visual and applied artists in [[Scotland]], one of the largest arts membership organisations in the country.&lt;ref name="BBC Creative Scotland"&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Creative Scotland faces criticism from Scottish Artists Union |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 October 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19932756 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The SAU was constituted in 2001 with a meeting of Scottish artists at the [[Scottish Trades Union Congress]] headquarters in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name="Herald 2001"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jim McLean |title=Artists draw up first trade union |work=[[Herald Scotland]] |date=12 May 2001 |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/artists-draw-up-first-trade-union-1.188072 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union claim to be the first new trade union of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title = About the SAU: History |work=sau.org.uk |publisher=Scottish Artists Union |date=|url=http://www.sau.org.uk/about/history.php |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish artists involved in the initiative from the outset included Guyan John Porter, Ann McCluskey, painter Gerry Morris and photographer Ken Palmer.&lt;ref name="Herald 2001" /&gt;

The new trade union was set up with three main aims, protection and extension of artists' rights, to lobby on behalf of artists and to provide financial benefits, such as cheaper insurance.&lt;ref name="Herald 2001" /&gt;

One of the recurring priorities for the SAU has been fair rates of pay for visual artists doing workshops and other such activities. The SAU produced a statement on Recommended Rates of Pay in 2002 and this was endorsed by the Scottish Arts Council.  The SAU continues to campaign for appropriate contracts across all areas of visual artists practice including for workshops, as well as with galleries exhibiting work, and commissioners.

In 2006-07 the SAU was able to secure a deal for Public [[Liability Insurance]] for the membership, following 2–3 years research by Chris Biddlecombe, a founding member of the Executive.  This was a priority because increasingly members were describing Public Liability Insurance being a requirement for working for Local Authorities, Open Studio Events and other aspects of trading as a visual artist in Scotland.  Later, a studio contents insurance package was added.

The SAU has attempted to establish as wide a remit as possible from the very beginning. There is virtually no discipline within [[visual arts]] and [[applied arts]] that does not qualify for membership. The criteria on which membership is predicated are designed simply to ensure that the membership is made up of professionals.

By 2012 the SAU had almost 1000 members, making it one of the largest arts membership organisations in Scotland.&lt;ref name="BBC Creative Scotland" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1531">The '''Symphony No. 2''' of [[Douglas Lilburn]] was completed in 1951, and received its premiere in 1959. It appears to have been revised in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;See: {{OCLC|154285031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is divided into four movements:
*''Prelude: [[Tempo|Moderato]]'' ([[half note]]=betw. 52-56 ([[tempo|tempo in beats per minute]]))
*''[[Scherzo]]: [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|vivace]]'' ([[quarter note]]=approx. 152)
*''Introduction: Poco lento'' (quarter note=approx. 69) - without pause -
*''Finale: Allegro'' ([[half note]]=betw. 116-120)&lt;ref&gt;metronome markings are from the 1979 score.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical performance of the piece lasts around 30 minutes, and several recordings exist. The work was published in 1979 by Price Milburn of [[Wellington]]&lt;ref&gt;See: {{OCLC|8319388}} (e.g. University of Missouri Kansas City, other locations. Typeset miniature score, 116 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt; though it seems to have circulated in manuscript copies earlier.&lt;ref&gt;This makes sense as there were several earlier recordings. A holograph of the 1974 revision is at Victoria University of Wellington (see OCLC link), for instance. (According to library and Worldcat, [[holograph]] score- 136 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bang-Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War''''' is a 2000 autobiographical styled text about the [[Bang-Bang Club]], a group of four South African photographers active within the townships of [[South Africa]] during the [[apartheid]] period, particularly between 1990 and 1994. The journalists were [[Kevin Carter]], [[Greg Marinovich]], [[Ken Oosterbroek]], and [[João Silva (photographer)|João Silva]]. The book was co-authored by two of the journalists, [[Greg Marinovich]] and [[João Silva (photographer)|João Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldpressphoto.org/people/joao-silva|title=The Bang-Bang Club, a factual account of news photographers in South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the years between 1990 and 1994 the fight from apartheid to democracy in South Africa was extremely  violent.  About the members of the Bang Bang Club was much written at this time and later too.  But the stories painted  a picture "of a group of hard-living men wo worked, played and hung out together pretty much all of the time", how Greg Marinovich wrote in the preface of the book. The next sentence started with the words: "Let us set the record straight: …" In 1997 started Marinovich and Joao Silva to write the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Marinovich|first1= Greg|author-link1= Greg Marinovich|last2= Silva|first2= João|author-link2= João Silva (photographer)|date= 20 September 2000|title= The Bang-Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War|url= https://books.google.se/books?id=_6cyzX7DzYkC&amp;dq|chapter=Preface|location= New York, N.Y.|publisher= Basic Books|isbn= 0-465-04413-1|id= {{LIBRIS|4962156}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the acknowledgments were mentioned the many ''Impimpi'' – informants who contributed to the book. ''Impimpi'' is a Zulu word and in the glossary of the book it is translated as "spy". These 45 people, the parents of Kevin Carter also, helped Marinovich and Silva to write the book "straight". [[Judith Matloff]], also listed under ''impimpi'', wrote in an article: "But the reporters and photographers stationed in South Africa at the time were also compassionate human beings who exposed themselves to danger because they wanted to record history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cjr.org/review/bang_bang_off_target.php|first=Judith|last=Matloff|title=Bang Bang Off Target| publisher=Columbia Journalism Review, CJR|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other witnesses or impimpi for the book from that era include: [[James Nachtwey]], [[Peter Magubane]], [[Ken Oosterbroek#Death|Brian Mkhize]], [[Gilles Peress]], [[Jo%C3%A3o Silva (photographer)#Personal life| Vivian Silva]], and more.

The book was first published in January 2000 by William Heinemann, London, UK and then by Basic Books, New York. It was translated into Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and  2015 into German. It is published in 19 Editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/263261-the-bang-bang-club-snapshots-from-a-hidden-war|title=The Bang-Bang Club Snapshots From a Hidden War published in 19 Editions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Book review ==
Niranjan Karnik&lt;ref name=karnik&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/niranjan-s-karnik-md-phd-fapa|title=Niranjan Karnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the review for H-SAfrica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/10670/reviews/10938/karnik-marinovich-and-silva-bang-bang-club-snapshots-hidden-war|first=Niranjan|last=Karnik|title=Review of Marinovich, Greg; Silva, Joao, The Bang Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War, H-SAfrica, H-Net Reviews, June 2003. The Personal and Professional Price of Journalism|publisher=H-Net: Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of his review Niranjan Karnik wrote: "I have several concerns about the future of this profession".&lt;ref name="karnik"/&gt; He expressed that conflict journalist need a "debriefing" after the experience in a conflict or war zone "akin to what the International Committee of the Red Cross requires of its fieldworkers". The usefulness of the book is for him: "Its overall value is not as much in its use as source of history, but in how it openly exposes the way journalists suffer in the course of their work, and the heavy ethical and moral questions they face on an daily basis."

Karnik wrote that "Students of the media and aspiring journalists will find special value and significance in this book, for its unsparing and often graphic portrayal of events in South Africa."

The moral and ethical questions are central themes in the book. Karnik discuss the themes in the example of the [[The vulture and the little girl|noted photograph]] by Kevin Carter.

{{Cquote|Carter, for example, won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for a photograph of a starving child that he took in south sudan in 1993. The famous photograph shows a small, emaciated girl curled over in exhaustion while a vulture sits a short distance away on the ground next to her. The photograph became the cover image for many humanitarian groups in their fundraising appeals. It also raised ethical questions about the limits that journalists will go to get an image.}}

Karnik explains that the book "lacks the academic and critical analysis", which he is used to write as an author and which he reads in his profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Niranjan_Karnik|title=Author Karnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; But newertheless he wrote that the book: "as a perspective into the dynamics of wartime reporting it is valuable".

== Film adaptation ==
In 2010, the Canadian director [[Steven Silver (film director)|Steven Silver]] released a [[film adaptation]] of the book as a full-feature film also entitled ''[[The Bang Bang Club (film)|The Bang Bang Club]]''.

'''''The Dark Abode''''' is a collage presentation of South Asian [[feminist]] novelist [[Sarojini Sahoo]]'s novel and American poet and painter Ed Baker's 23 sketches, which deal with terrorism that people often face from micro- to macrosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oriyanari.com/id21.html accessed 15 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==

The novel begins with questioning the mere physicality of the man-woman relationship but then transports the reader into the higher planes of platonic love. The central character of the novel is Kuki, a Hindu woman from India who falls (and then rises) in love with a [[Muslim]] artist from [[Pakistan]]. The unusualness of the socio-cultural background of these two characters is delicately portrayed by [[Sarojini Sahoo|Sahoo]] in a sensitive and convincing manner. Readers become familiar with the two sets of roles that Kuki plays; that of a lover and that of a wife.  [[Sarojini Sahoo|Sahoo]] subtly balances these two roles and at the same time, highlights the superiority of a wife in a pragmatic world. But the novel is not merely a love story. Though love is a part of the novel, it deals with a much broader topic: the providence of a woman in India. At the same time, it also portrays a story of how a perverted man, over time, becomes a perfect man. It also delves into the relationship between the 'state' and the 'individual' and comes to the conclusion that 'the state' represents the moods and wishes of a ruler and hence, 'the state' actually becomes a form of 'an individual'. Additionally, it takes a broader look at terrorism and state-sponsored anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sarojinisahoo.com/novels6.htm] – Accessed 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== About sketches ==

Baker's Uma is a collection of sketches of the Hindu goddess, also known for feminine power.  The sketches have their genesis as images in a dream, according to Baker. Uma, to him, is symbolic of many things that give us pleasure in life. As to how these images are realised, the artist confesses he is just not sure. "I just watch and wait for something to happen...and something always does," he says.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feminine-fragrance.blogspot.com/2008_11_01_archive.html]. Accessed 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
It is said in the Saimdarua Lahiri that [[Parvati|Uma]] is the source of all power in the universe and because of her; [[Lord Shiva]] gets all of his powers. She is often depicted as half of [[Lord Shiva]], the supreme god, and she also is a major symbol of [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]]. Her name refers to her being born daughter of Himavan ([[Himalaya]]), lord of the mountains. Beautiful, gentle, powerful consort of Shiva, mother of [[Ganesha]] and [[Murugan|Kartikeya]]). Along with [[Saraswati]] and [[Lakshmi]], she encompasses their powers and exudes a tranquil, serene beauty and provides a calm within. Uma is a symbol of many noble traditional ([[Hindu]]) virtues: fertility, marital felicity, spousal devotion, asceticism and power. She refers to the symbol of early feminine power and energy. Known formally as goddess Uma, Lady of the Mountains, she shows us how to balance the many aspects of our lives. Beautiful and (benignly) powerful, she is also known as [[Shakti]], [[Parvati]] (consort of [[Lord Shiva|Shiva]]), Ambika, Annapurna, Bhairavi, Candi, Gauri, [[Durga]], Jagadmata (Mother of the World), [[Kali]], Kanyakumari, [[Kumari (children)|Kumari]], painter Mahadevi, and [[Shyama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sarojinisahoo.com/novels6.htm ] – Accessed 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Impossible: The Miraculous Story of a Mother's Faith and Her Child's Resurrection''''' is a [[Christian literature|Christian novel]] written by American author Joyce Smith, alongside contributor Ginger Kolbaba. The book, released on November 7, 2017, tells the story of Joyce's 14-year-old son John, who fell through icy [[Lake St. Louis, Missouri|Lake Ste. Louise]] in Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy who fell through ice at Lake Sainte Louise is awake, recognizing people, officials say|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/stcharles/boy-who-fell-through-ice-at-lake-sainte-louise-is/article_8c0ffb76-be53-5a19-b766-eb88fb9bd4e1.html|accessdate=March 6, 2018|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==
When Joyce Smith's fourteen-year-old son John fell through an icy [[Lake St. Louis, Missouri|Missouri lake]] one winter morning, she and her family had seemingly lost everything. At the hospital, John lay lifeless for more than sixty minutes. But Joyce was not ready to give up on her son. She mustered all her faith and strength into one force and cried out to God in a loud voice to save him. Miraculously, her son's heart immediately started beating again.

In the coming days, John would continue to defy every expert, every case history, and every scientific prediction. Sixteen days after falling through the ice and being clinically dead for an hour, he walked out of the hospital under his own power, completely healed.

From a historic, artistic and archaeological point of view, the Treasure of Villena constitutes a "unicum", a non-normalised deposit, according to its weight and content (A. Perea). In fact, '''''it is the second most important golden tableware finding in Europe''''', after that of the Royal Graves in Mycenae in Greece (A. Mederos)|ref= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gold pieces include eleven bowls, three bottles and 28 bracelets.

The iron pieces are the oldest found in the Iberian Peninsula and correspond to a stage in which iron was considered to be a [[precious metal]], and so was hoarded. The archaeologists estimate the date of this trove at c. 1000 BC.

The hoard was found in December 1963 by archaeologist [[José María Soler]] 5&amp;nbsp;km from [[Villena]], and since then has been the main attraction of Villena's Archaeological Museum. Its discovery was published in most of the Spanish media and also some abroad, mainly in France, Germany and the United States of America. It has been exhibited in [[Madrid]], [[Alicante]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]], and now there are two sets of copies of the whole treasure to be shown in exhibitions while the originals are permanently conserved in an armoured showcase at Villena's Archaeological Museum.

The same type of metalwork is also found in the big [[Eberswalde Hoard]] that was discovered in [[Brandenburg]], Germany, in 1913.

[[File:Wikipedian-in-Residence Scope Diagram Page 1.png|thumb|The relationship between a Wikipedian in residence and the community. The diagram represents the stakeholders and what each stakeholder provides and receives in a typical Wikipedian in Residence project.]]

A '''Wikipedian in residence''' or '''Wikimedian in residence''' ('''WiR''') is a [[Wikipedia]] editor, a [[Wikipedian]] (or Wikimedian), who accepts a placement with an institution, typically an art gallery, library, archive or museum ([[GLAM (industry sector)|GLAM]]), [[learned society]], or institute of higher education (such as a university) to facilitate [[Wikipedia editing|Wikipedia entries]] related to that institution's mission, encourage and assist it to release material under open licences, and to develop the relationship between the institution and the Wikimedia community. A Wikipedian in residence generally helps to coordinate Wikipedia-related outreach events between the GLAM and the general public.

Institutions that have hosted a Wikipedian in residence include large institutions like the [[National Library of Wales]], [[British Museum]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], the [[British Library]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[National Library of Norway]], and the [[Federal Archives of Switzerland]] and smaller venues like the [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] and [[The New Art Gallery Walsall]] in the UK; the [[Palace of Versailles]] in France; the [[Museu Picasso]] in Spain; and in the US, the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library]], and the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].

== Developing interest ==

In 2010, Australian Liam Wyatt became the first Wikipedian in residence when he volunteered at the [[British Museum]] for a period of five weeks.&lt;ref name="Cohen group"&gt;{{cite web |last = Cohen |first = Noam |title = Venerable British Museum Enlists in the Wikipedia Revolution |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/arts/design/05wiki.html |work = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate = 27 January 2013 |date = 5 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/arts/artsspecial/warming-up-to-the-culture-of-wikipedia.html |title = Warming Up to the Culture of Wikipedia |work = The New York Times |date = 19 March 2014 |accessdate = 24 March 2014 |last = Cohen |first = Noam }}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the need for Wikipedia to strengthen partnerships with museums to create the most up-to-date and accurate information,&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;{{cite web |title = Museum Hires First Wikipedian-in-Residence |url = http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=49490#middle |work = Inside Indiana Business |accessdate = 27 January 2013 |location = Indianapolis, Indiana |date = 19 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying "we are doing the same thing for the same reason, for the same people, in the same medium. Let's do it together." The [[Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] became involved with the program after Wikipedian Lori Phillips volunteered for a GLAM event in 2010,&lt;ref name=Inside /&gt; becoming the second Wikipedian in residence. The third, Benoît Evellin, spent six months at the [[Palace of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Château de Versailles|GLAM Château de Versailles Project page]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museu Picasso]] in Barcelona, Spain, and the [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] in the United Kingdom were also early adopters of the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Museu Picasso|GLAM Museu Picasso Project page]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Derby|GLAM Derby Project page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] expressed interest in the idea, which led to the hiring of Sarah Stierch in July as Wikipedian in Residence.&lt;ref name=Cohen2&gt;{{cite web |last = Cohen |first = Noam |title = Success may be Wikipedia's biggest challenge |url = http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2010/07/12/success_may_be_wikipedias_biggest_challenge/ |work = [[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate = 27 January 2013 |date = 12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Switzer |first = Cody |url = http://philanthropy.com/blogs/social-philanthropy/wikipedian-in-residence-helps-share-smithsonian-archives/28989 |title = Wikipedian-in-residence helps share Smithsonian archives |work = The Chronicle of Philanthropy |date = 28 July 2011 |accessdate = 27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Shen |first = Aviva |url = http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/aroundthemall/2012/04/how-many-women-does-it-take-to-change-wikipedia/ |title = How many women does it take to change Wikipedia? |work = Smithsonian Magazine |date = 4 April 2012 |accessdate = 27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[The Independent]] |first = Paul |last = Gallagher |title = Wikipedia fires editor who enhanced entries for cash |date = 10 January 2014 |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikipedia-fires-editor-who-enhanced-entries-for-cash-9052308.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] followed suit and hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks, a student from [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]], who was pursuing a [[master's degree]] in history and archives management, to work at its Archives II location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[The Baltimore Sun]] |first = Julie |last = Baughman |title = National Archives hires 'Wikipedian in residence' |date = 13 July 2011 |url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-07-13/news/bs-md-wikipedia-archives-20110621_1_national-archives-wikipedian-archives-information |accessdate = 26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[The Washington Post]] |first = Lisa |last = Rein |title = National Archives hires first 'Wikipedian' |date = 2 June 2011 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/national-archives-hires-first-wikipedian/2011/03/23/AG63MCHH_blog.html |accessdate = 26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDevitt-Parks had been editing Wikipedia since 2004 and was hired for this position by [[David Ferriero]].&lt;ref name=Washington/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[Tampa Bay Times]] |title = National Archives appoints a 'Wikipedian' |date = 3 June 2011 |url = http://www.tampabay.com/incoming/national-archives-appoints-a-wikipedian/1173507 |accessdate = 26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 [[Wikimedia UK]] engaged Andy Mabbett, an editor since 2003, as an "Outreach Ambassador" in-residence at the Bristol-based wildlife charity [[Wildscreen]], working on the [[m:ARKive project|ARKive project]].&lt;ref name="Bristol24-7"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bristol247.com/2011/09/16/bristol-wikipedians-taught-to-edit-online-encylopaedia-26319/ |title = Bristol 'Wikipedians' taught to edit online encylopaedia |last = Zaba |first = Christina |date = 16 September 2011 |work = Bristol24-7 |accessdate = 13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Mabbett has been a Wikipedian in residence at other organisations such as [[the New Art Gallery Walsall]].&lt;ref name="Museums Association"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.museumsassociation.org/museum-practice/wikipedia/17062013-the-new-art-gallery-walsall |title = The New Art Gallery Walsall |last = Brown |first = Julie |date = 17 June 2013 |publisher = Museums Association |accessdate = 13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library]] became the first [[Presidential library]] to hire a Wikipedian in residence, when they hired Michael Barera, a master's student at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=Kaczmarczyk&gt;{{cite web |last = Kaczmarczyk |first = Jeffrey |title = President Gerald R.

In September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration became the first organisation to employ a permanent full-time Wikipedian in residence when it hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks to join its Office of Innovation in that capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.archives.gov/aotus/?p=5179 |title = Breaking New Ground Again |date = 19 September 2013 |publisher = [[National Archives and Records Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:20151009 145940 HDR.jpg|thumb|Dominic McDevitt-Parks speaking at WikiConference USA 2015 hosted at the [[National Archives Building]]]]

In March 2014, [[Harvard University]] posted a job listing seeking applicants to be their Wikipedian in residence at the [[Houghton Library]].&lt;ref name="Outreach"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian_in_Residence |title = Wikipedian in Residence |work = Outreach Wiki |accessdate = 18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the [[University of Victoria]] Libraries announced that in collaboration with The Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) and the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences that [[:fr:Christian Vandendorpe|Christian Vandendorpe]] had been named Honorary Resident Wikipedian-in-Residence for the 2014/2015 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ideas-idees.ca/media/media-releases/honorary-resident-wikipedian-professor-christian-vandendorpe |title = Honorary resident Wikipedian: Professor Christian Vandendorpe - Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher =  |accessdate = 28 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, more than 100 Wikipedians had taken part in the role,&lt;ref name="Outreach" /&gt; most of whom were paid by either the institution where they work or a Wikimedia-related organization.

== Role and duties ==

The primary role of the Wikipedian-in-Residence is to serve as a liaison between the host institution and the Wikimedia community by assisting with events and training that support the missions of both organisations. Typical duties include  arranging and/or leading training events and [[editathon|editathons;]]&lt;ref name="theregister orlowski 20120216"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/16/british_library_wikipedian/ |title = British Library seeks taxpayer-funded Wikipedia-fiddler |work = [[The Register]] |date = 16 February 2012 |accessdate = 19 June 2013 |last = Orlowski |first = Andrew |authorlink = Andrew Orlowski }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc 20130424"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22264118 |title = National Library of Scotland recruits 'Wikipedian' |work = [[BBC News]] |date = 24 April 2013 |accessdate = 19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing explanations to other staff and members of the public about policies and practice, such as policies about conflict-of-interest; as well as making contributions to articles relevant to the institution's materials and mission, such as articles about significant cultural objects in an organisation's collection.&lt;ref name="bristolwireless woods 20130418"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bristolwireless.net/2013/04/national-library-of-scotland-seeks-wikipedian-in-residence/ |title = National Library of Scotland seeks Wikipedian in residence |work = Bristol Wireless |date = 18 April 2013 |accessdate = 19 June 2013 |last = Woods |first = Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compensation ==
While Wikipedia discourages direct paid compensation for article editing and prohibits undisclosed advocacy, Wikipedians in residence are [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest#Wikipedians in residence|permitted to be compensated for work on-wiki]], either by offering credit, stipend or salary, through their sponsoring institutions {{em|provided that}} they adhere to strict guidelines against engaging in public relations or marketing for their institution.

== Reception ==

One such advertised post has been reported positively by others as being a "unique opportunity to help enrich Wikipedia and its sister projects and share with the world... resources and knowledge."&lt;ref name="bristolwireless woods 20130418" /&gt; Conversely, journalist [[Andrew Orlowski]] criticized another advertised post as a waste of government funds.&lt;ref name="theregister orlowski 20120216" /&gt; In 2013, a part-time temporary position was advertised by [[National Library of Scotland]] and was noted as being "the first large-scale partnership" between a Scottish institution and [[Wikimedia UK]].&lt;ref name="bbc 20130424" /&gt; This initiative was followed by [[University of Edinburgh]] where a Wikimedian in residence was appointed in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.studentnewspaper.org/university-of-edinburgh-to-employ-wikimedian-in-residence-web-editor/ |title = University of Edinburgh to employ ‘Wikimedian in Residence’ web editor |last = Ho |first = Amanda |date = 13 October 2015 |website = The Student Newspaper |access-date = 7 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
