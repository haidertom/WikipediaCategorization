      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Allosemitism''' is a neologism used to encompass both [[philo-Semitic]] and [[anti-Semitic]] attitudes towards Jews as [[Other (philosophy)|other]].

==Origin of term==

The term was coined by Polish [[literary critic]] [[Artur Sandauer]] and popularized by Polish sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]]. Sandauer used the term "allosemitism" in his essay ''On Situation of Polish Writer of Jewish Descent In the 20th Century'' published as a book in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Sandauer, O sytuacji pisarza polskiego pochodzenia żydowskiego w XX wieku (Rzecz, którą nie ja powinienem był napisać...) (Warszawa: Czytelnik, 1982, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zygmunt Bauman]] proposed the term in his 1997 essay "Allosemitism: Premodern, Modern, Postmodern",” in which he argued  that "allosemitism" should be used in place of "[[anti-semitism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt Bauman, “Allosemitism: Premodern, Modern, Postmodern,” in Modernity, Culture, and “the Jew,” ed. Bryan Cheyette and Laura Marcus (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Bauman's argument is that allosemitism can represent a “radically ambivalent attitude,” that encompassing both [[Philo-Semitism]] and anti-Semitism;&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Valerie. "Dissolving Boundaries: Assimilation and Allosemitism in E. A. Dupont's "Das Alte Gesetz" (1923) and Veit Harlan's "Jud Süss" (1940)." The German Quarterly 78.4 (2005): 496-516.&lt;/ref&gt; allosemitism is a form of [[proteophobia]], fear and horror of things that defy clean-cut categories, not, like antisemitism, of a simple fear of the "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]" ([[heterophobia]]); and that Judeophobia is diverse, and, therefore, not adequately encompassed by the term antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Frojmovic. Review of Kessler, Herbert L.; Nirenberg, David, eds., Judaism and Christian Art: Aesthetic Anxieties from the Catacombs to Colonialism, 
H-Judaic, H-Net Reviews. March, 2013. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=32937]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth Gruber]] describes the neologism as a response to "the idea that, good or bad, Jews are different from the non-Jewish mainstream and thus unable to be dealt with in the same way or measured by the same yardstick."&lt;ref name=GruberOther&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gruber|first1=Ruth|title=Allosemitism (noun)—Jews as the perpetual ‘other’|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/allosemitism_noun_jews_as_the_perpetual_other_20080807|accessdate=10 August 2016|publisher=Jewish Journal|date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gruber, the term was coined by Polish-Jewish literary critic [[Artur Sandauer]].&lt;ref name=GruberOther/&gt;

In her 2010 book ''Modernism, Feminism, and Jewishness'', literary scholar Maren Tova Linnett describes the term as originated by both Sandauer and Bauman.&lt;ref&gt;Briefel, Aviva. "Allosemitic Modernism." NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction 43, no. 2 (2010): 361-63. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40959717.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use== 

Linnett uses the term "to describe the multiple modes of difference that these women authors ascribed to the Jew in order to complicate what she views as the overly simplistic polarities of anti-Semitism and philo-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;Briefel, Aviva. "Allosemitic Modernism." NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction 43, no. 2 (2010): 361-63. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40959717.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Eliezer Ben-Rafael]] employs the concept in his 2014 book ''Confronting Allosemitism in Europe: The Case of Belgian Jews.''

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Anaerobic digestion''' is a collection of processes by which [[microorganisms]] break down [[biodegradable]] material in the absence of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name="nnfcc"&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-fuels-and-energy-factsheet-anaerobic-digestion "NNFCC Renewable Fuels and Energy Factsheet: Anaerobic Digestion"], Retrieved on 2011-11-22&lt;/ref&gt; The process is used for industrial or domestic purposes to [[Waste management|manage waste]] or to produce fuels. Much of the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] used industrially to produce food and drink products, as well as home fermentation, uses anaerobic digestion.

Anaerobic [[digestion]] occurs naturally in some soils and in lake and [[oceanic basin]] [[sediment]]s, where it is usually referred to as "anaerobic activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Koyama, Tadashiro|year=1963|title=Gaseous metabolism in lake sediments and paddy soils and the production of atmospheric methane and hydrogen|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=68|issue=13|pages=3971–3973|doi=10.1029/JZ068i013p03971|bibcode=1963JGR....68.3971K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Pamatmat, Mario Macalalag|author2=Bhagwat, Ashok M.|year=1973|title=Anaerobic metabolism in Lake Washington sediments|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=18|issue=4|pages=611&amp;ndash;627|url=http://aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_18/issue_4/0611.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216221344/http://aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_18/issue_4/0611.pdf|archivedate=16 December 2013|deadurl=yes|doi=10.4319/lo.1973.18.4.0611|df=dmy-all|bibcode=1973LimOc..18..611P}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the source of [[Methane#Occurrence|marsh gas methane]] as discovered by [[Alessandro Volta]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zehnder, Alexander J.

The digestion process begins with [[bacteria]]l [[hydrolysis]] of the input materials. Insoluble [[organic polymer]]s, such as [[carbohydrate]]s, are broken down to soluble derivatives that become available for other bacteria. [[Acidogenesis|Acidogenic bacteria]] then convert the [[sugar]]s and [[amino acid]]s into carbon dioxide, [[hydrogen]], [[ammonia]], and [[organic acid]]s. These bacteria convert these resulting organic acids into [[acetic acid]], along with additional ammonia, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Finally, [[methanogen]]s convert these products to methane and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waste.nl/content/download/472/3779/file/WB89-InfoSheet(Anaerobic%20Digestion).pdf Anaerobic digestion reference sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005194523/http://www.waste.nl/content/download/472/3779/file/WB89-InfoSheet(Anaerobic%20Digestion).pdf |date=5 October 2011 }}, waste.nl.

Anaerobic digestion is used as part of the process to treat biodegradable waste and [[sewage sludge]]. As part of an integrated [[waste management]] system, anaerobic digestion reduces the emission of [[landfill gas]] into the atmosphere. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with purpose-grown energy crops, such as [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/biogas/agricultural-biogas/ Agricultural Biogas], www.clarke-energy.com, accessed 08.11.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaerobic digestion is widely used as a source of [[renewable energy]]. The process produces a [[biogas]], consisting of [[methane]], [[carbon dioxide]], and traces of other ‘contaminant’ gases.&lt;ref name="nnfcc" /&gt; This biogas can be used directly as fuel, in combined heat and power gas engines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.co.uk/gas_engines.html GE Jenbacher Biogas Engines], www.clarke-energy.com, accessed 15.04.11&lt;/ref&gt; or upgraded to natural gas-quality [[biomethane]]. The nutrient-rich [[digestate]] also produced can be used as [[fertilizer]].

With the re-use of waste as a resource and new technological approaches that have lowered [[capital costs]], anaerobic digestion has in recent years received increased attention among governments in a number of countries, among these the United Kingdom (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/anaerobic-digestion-strat-action-plan.pdf Anaerobic Digestion Strategy and Action Plan], defra.gov.uk.

==Process==
{{Main|Anaerobic respiration}}

Many microorganisms affect anaerobic digestion, including acetic acid-forming [[bacteria]] ([[acetogen]]s) and methane-forming [[archaea]] ([[methanogen]]s). These organisms promote a number of chemical processes in converting the biomass to [[biogas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy (Report), NNFCC 09-012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaseous oxygen is excluded from the reactions by physical containment. Anaerobes utilize electron acceptors from sources other than oxygen gas. These acceptors can be the organic material itself or may be supplied by inorganic [[oxide]]s from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself, the 'intermediate' end products are primarily [[alcohol]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and organic acids, plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide, and trace levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]].&lt;ref&gt;''Adapted from'' Beychok, M. (1967) [[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]], First edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]&lt;/ref&gt; In an anaerobic system, the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.&lt;ref name="Fergusen, T. 2006 p49" /&gt;

Populations of anaerobic microorganisms typically take a significant period of time to establish themselves to be fully effective. Therefore, common practice is to introduce anaerobic microorganisms from materials with existing populations, a process known as "seeding" the digesters, typically accomplished with the addition of sewage sludge or cattle slurry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80434e/80434E0k.htm The biogas plant], unu.edu. Retrieved 5.11.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process stages===
The four key stages of anaerobic digestion involve [[hydrolysis]], [[acidogenesis]], [[acetogenesis]] and [[methanogenesis]].&lt;ref name="Anaerobic digestion" /&gt;
The overall process can be described by the chemical reaction, where organic material such as glucose is biochemically digested into carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) by the anaerobic microorganisms.
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid; max-width: 450px;"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* '''Hydrolysis'''
In most cases, biomass is made up of large organic polymers. For the bacteria in anaerobic digesters to access the energy potential of the material, these chains must first be broken down into their smaller constituent parts. These constituent parts, or monomers, such as sugars, are readily available to other bacteria. The process of breaking these chains and dissolving the smaller molecules into solution is called hydrolysis. Therefore, hydrolysis of these high-molecular-weight polymeric components is the necessary first step in anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref&gt;Sleat, R. &amp; Mah, R. (2006) Hydrolytic Bacteria ''in'' Anaerobic digestion of biomass, p15&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[hydrolysis]] the complex organic molecules are broken down into [[simple sugar]]s, amino acids, and [[fatty acid]]s.

Acetate and hydrogen produced in the first stages can be used directly by methanogens. Other molecules, such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs) with a chain length greater than that of acetate must first be [[catabolised]] into compounds that can be directly used by methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, D. &amp; Mah, R. (2006) Transitional bacteria in anaerobic digestion of biomass, p35&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Acidogenesis'''
The biological process of [[acidogenesis]] results in further breakdown of the remaining components by acidogenic (fermentative) bacteria. Here, VFAs are created, along with ammonia, carbon dioxide, and [[hydrogen sulfide]], as well as other byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sop.inria.fr/relation_ext/slides/water_treatment.pdf What is anaerobic digestion], sop.inria.fr. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of acidogenesis is similar to the way [[sour milk|milk sours]].

* '''Acetogenesis'''
The third stage of anaerobic digestion is [[acetogenesis]]. Here, simple molecules created through the acidogenesis phase are further digested by acetogens to produce largely acetic acid, as well as carbon dioxide and hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotank.co.uk/anaerobic_digestion.htm Anaerobic digestion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012031436/http://www.biotank.co.uk/anaerobic_digestion.htm |date=12 October 2007 }}, biotank.co.uk. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Methanogenesis'''
The terminal stage of anaerobic digestion is the biological process of [[methanogenesis]]. Here, methanogens use the intermediate products of the preceding stages and convert them into methane, carbon dioxide, and water. These components make up the majority of the biogas emitted from the system. Methanogenesis is sensitive to both high and low pHs and occurs between pH 6.5 and pH 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anaerobic Digester: How It Works [Process] {{!}} GreenTheFuture.com|url = http://greenthefuture.com/DIGESTER_HOWITWORKS_PROCESS.html|website = greenthefuture.com|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining, indigestible material the microbes cannot use and any dead bacterial remains constitute the digestate.

===Configuration===
Anaerobic digesters can be designed and engineered to operate using a number of different configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, [[Mesophilic digester|mesophilic]] vs. [[Thermophilic digester|thermophilic]] temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Comparative Evaluation of Batch and Continuous Anaerobic Digesters in Biogas Production from Municipal Solid Waste using Mathematical Models|url = http://www.cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/view/1160|journal = Agricultural Engineering International: CIGR Journal|date = 2009-01-16|issn = 1682-1130|language = en|first = Igoni Hilkia|last = A|first2 = M.

A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anaerobic Digestion Systems|url = http://www.wtert.eu/default.asp?Menue=13&amp;ShowDok=17|website = www.wtert.eu|access-date = 2016-02-23|first = DEVinitiv GbR,|last = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Batch or continuous====
Anaerobic digestion can be performed as a batch process or a continuous process. In a batch system, biomass is added to the reactor at the start of the process. The reactor is then sealed for the duration of the process. In its simplest form batch processing needs [[inoculation]] with already processed material to start the anaerobic digestion. In a typical scenario, biogas production will be formed with a [[normal distribution]] pattern over time. Operators can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. There can be severe odour issues if a batch reactor is opened and emptied before the process is well completed. A more advanced type of batch approach has limited the odour issues by integrating anaerobic digestion with [[in-vessel composting]]. In this approach inoculation takes place through the use of recirculated degasified percolate. After anaerobic digestion has completed, the biomass is kept in the reactor which is then used for [[in-vessel composting]] before it is opened&lt;ref&gt;[http://aikantechnology.com/how-it-works/batch-processing.html aikantechnology.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206123235/http://www.aikantechnology.com/how-it-works/batch-processing.html |date=6 February 2012 }} Retrieved 10. Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work, it is typically a cheaper form of digestion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/research/renewable/biomass/anaerobic_digestion/index.html Anaerobic digestion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613112417/http://www.energy.ca.gov/research/renewable/biomass/anaerobic_digestion/index.html |date=13 June 2009 }}, energy.ca.gov. Retrieved 18.06.09.&lt;/ref&gt; Using more than one batch reactor at a plant can ensure constant production of biogas.

In continuous digestion processes, organic matter is constantly added (continuous complete mixed) or added in stages to the reactor (continuous plug flow; first in – first out). Here, the end products are constantly or periodically removed, resulting in constant production of biogas. A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used. Examples of this form of anaerobic digestion include [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]]s, [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]]s, [[expanded granular sludge bed]]s, and [[internal circulation reactor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paques.nl/?pid=42&amp;parentid=41 BIOPAQ IC], paques.nl.

====Temperature====
The two conventional operational temperature levels for anaerobic digesters determine the species of methanogens in the digesters:&lt;ref&gt;Song, Y.C., Kwon, S.J., Woo, J.H. (2004) Mesophilic and thermophilic temperature co-phase anaerobic digestion compared with single-stage mesophilic- and thermophilic digestion of sewage sludge, Water Res. 2004 Apr;38(7):1653–62&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mesophilic digester|''Mesophilic'' digestion]] takes place optimally around 30 to 38&amp;nbsp;°C, or at ambient temperatures between 20 and 45&amp;nbsp;°C, where mesophiles are the primary microorganism present.
* [[Thermophilic digester|''Thermophilic'' digestion]] takes place optimally around 49 to 57&amp;nbsp;°C, or at elevated temperatures up to 70&amp;nbsp;°C, where thermophiles are the primary microorganisms present.

A limit case has been reached in [[Bolivia]], with anaerobic digestion in temperature working conditions of less than 10&amp;nbsp;°C. The anaerobic process is very slow, taking more than three times the normal mesophilic time process.&lt;ref name="lrrd.org"/&gt; In experimental work at [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], a 1,000 litre digester using [[psychrophiles]] harvested from "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" has produced 200–300&amp;nbsp;litres of methane per day, about 20 to 30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates.&lt;ref name="NewSc2785p14"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesophilic species outnumber thermophiles, and they are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are, therefore, considered to be more stable than thermophilic digestion systems. In contrast, while thermophilic digestion systems are considered less stable, their energy input is higher, with more biogas being removed from the organic matter in an equal amount of time. The increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates, and thus faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater pathogen reduction of the digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the [[Animal By-Products Regulations]] in the European Union, requires digestate to meet certain levels of pathogen reduction there may be a benefit to using thermophilic temperatures instead of mesophilic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/animalbyproducts/index_en.htm Animal by-products introduction], ec.europa.eu. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional pre-treatment can be used to reduce the necessary retention time to produce biogas. For example, certain processes shred the substrates to increase the surface area or use a thermal pretreatment stage (such as pasteurisation) to significantly enhance the biogas output. The pasteurisation process can also be used to reduce the pathogenic concentration in the digesate leaving the anaerobic digester. Pasteurisation may be achieved by heat treatment combined with [[maceration (sewage)|maceration]] of the solids.

====Solids content====
In a typical scenario, three different operational parameters are associated with the solids content of the feedstock to the digesters:
* High solids (dry—stackable substrate)
* High solids (wet—pumpable substrate)
* Low solids (wet—pumpable substrate)

High solids (dry) digesters are designed to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters are designed to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed into the top of the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.&lt;ref name="eunomia.co.uk"&gt;[http://eunomia.co.uk/NI%20AD%20final%20report.pdf Feasibility study concerning anaerobic digestion in Northern Ireland], eunomia.co.uk, Retrieved 19.08.07. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128093059/http://eunomia.co.uk/NI%20AD%20final%20report.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maximum"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Jewell | first1 = W.| first2 = R.| first3 = B. | title = Methane fermentation of energy crops: Maximum conversion kinetics and in situ biogas purification | journal = Biomass and Bioenergy | volume = 5| issue = 3–4 | pages = 261–278 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1016/0961-9534(93)90076-G| last2 = Cummings| last3 = Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High solids (wet) digesters process a thick slurry that requires more energy input to move and process the feedstock. The thickness of the material may also lead to associated problems with abrasion. High solids digesters will typically have a lower land requirement due to the lower volumes associated with the moisture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} High solids digesters also require correction of conventional performance calculations (e.g. gas production, retention time, kinetics, etc.) originally based on very dilute sewage digestion concepts, since larger fractions of the feedstock mass are potentially convertible to biogas.&lt;ref name="Methods"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B.| first2 = R.| first3 = T.| first4 = W. | title = Methods for kinetic analysis of methane fermentation in high solids biomass digesters| last1 = Richards | journal = Biomass and Bioenergy | volume = 1| issue = 2 | pages =  65–73| year = 1991 | doi = 10.1016/0961-9534(91)90028-B| last2 = Cummings| last3 = White| last4 = Jewell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low solids (wet) digesters can transport material through the system using standard pumps that require significantly lower energy input. Low solids digesters require a larger amount of land than high solids due to the increased volumes associated with the increased liquid-to-feedstock ratio of the digesters. There are benefits associated with operation in a liquid environment, as it enables more thorough circulation of materials and contact between the bacteria and their food. This enables the bacteria to more readily access the substances on which they are feeding, and increases the rate of gas production.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Complexity====
Digestion systems can be configured with different levels of complexity.&lt;ref name="eunomia.co.uk" /&gt; In a '''single-stage digestion system''' (one-stage), all of the biological reactions occur within a single, sealed reactor or holding tank. Using a single stage reduces construction costs, but results in less control of the reactions occurring within the system. Acidogenic bacteria, through the production of acids, reduce the pH of the tank. Methanogenic bacteria, as outlined earlier, operate in a strictly defined pH range.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZdRJfMKORwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=acidogens+reduce+ph&amp;source=web&amp;ots=EJkTnAMkfq&amp;sig=qlyQVlqbt_N_1m1c20NduxAEK90#PPP1,M1 Biomethanation in advances in biochemical engineering and biotechnology], books.google.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the biological reactions of the different species in a single-stage reactor can be in direct competition with each other. Another one-stage reaction system is an [[anaerobic lagoon]]. These lagoons are pond-like, earthen basins used for the treatment and long-term storage of manures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/explore/envqual/eq0387.htm Anaerobic Lagoons for Storage/Treatment of Livestock Manure], missouri.edu. Retrieved 8.11.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the anaerobic reactions are contained within the natural anaerobic sludge contained in the pool.

In a '''two-stage digestion system''' (multistage), different digestion vessels are optimised to bring maximum control over the bacterial communities living within the digesters. Acidogenic bacteria produce organic acids and more quickly grow and reproduce than methanogenic bacteria. Methanogenic bacteria require stable pH and temperature to optimise their performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71002223/ABSTRACT Abstract: Methanogenic population dynamics during start-up of anaerobic digesters treating municipal solid waste and biosolids], interscience.wiley.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under typical circumstances, hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and acidogenesis occur within the first reaction vessel. The organic material is then heated to the required operational temperature (either mesophilic or thermophilic) prior to being pumped into a methanogenic reactor. The initial hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks prior to the methanogenic reactor can provide a buffer to the rate at which feedstock is added. Some European countries require a degree of elevated heat treatment to kill harmful bacteria in the input waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.archive.mlodeuu.com/ahvla-en/animalh/disease-control/by-prods Animal By-Products Regulations], defra.gov.uk. Retrieved 24.10.07. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416182207/http://www.defra.gov.archive.mlodeuu.com/ahvla-en/animalh/disease-control/by-prods |date=16 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, there may be a pasteurisation or sterilisation stage prior to digestion or between the two digestion tanks. Notably, it is not possible to completely isolate the different reaction phases, and often some biogas is produced in the hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks.

==== Residence time ====
The residence time in a digester varies with the amount and type of feed material, and with the configuration of the digestion system. In a typical two-stage mesophilic digestion, residence time varies between 15 and 40&amp;nbsp;days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=4reportspubs%5C4_8focus%5Chimetfocus.xml HIMET—A Two-Stage Anaerobic Digestion Process for Converting Waste to Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030224122741/http://gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=4reportspubs%5C4_8focus%5Chimetfocus.xml |date=24 February 2003 }}, gastechnology.org. Retrieved 19.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt; while for a single-stage thermophilic digestion, residence times is normally faster and takes around 14&amp;nbsp;days. The plug-flow nature of some of these systems will mean the full degradation of the material may not have been realised in this timescale. In this event, digestate exiting the system will be darker in colour and will typically have more odour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the case of an [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] (UASB), hydraulic residence times can be as short as 1 hour to 1 day, and solid retention times can be up to 90 days. In this manner, a UASB system is able to separate solids and hydraulic retention times with the use of a sludge blanket.&lt;ref&gt;Finstein, M. S. (2006) [http://www.oaktech-environmental.com/documents/ProceedingsSWANA2006Nashville.pdf ArrowBio process integrates preprocessing and advanced anaerobic digestion to recover recyclables and generate electricity], oaktech-environmental.com. Retrieved 19.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous digesters have mechanical or hydraulic devices, depending on the level of solids in the material, to mix the contents, enabling the bacteria and the food to be in contact. They also allow excess material to be continuously extracted to maintain a reasonably constant volume within the digestion tanks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Inhibition===
The anaerobic digestion process can be inhibited by several compounds, affecting one or more of the bacterial groups responsible for the different organic matter degradation steps. The degree of the inhibition depends, among other factors, on the concentration of the inhibitor in the digester. Potential inhibitors are ammonia, sulfide, light metal ions (Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al), heavy metals, some organics (chlorophenols, halogenated aliphatics, N-substituted aromatics, long chain fatty acids), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2007.01.057 | pmid=17399981 | volume=99 | issue=10 | title=Inhibition of anaerobic digestion process: A review | year=2008 | journal=Bioresource Technology | pages=4044–4064 | last1 = Chen | first1 = Ye | last2 = Cheng | first2 = Jay J. | last3 = Creamer | first3 = Kurt S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feedstocks==
[[File:Anaerobic Lagoon at Cal Poly.jpg|thumb|Anaerobic lagoon and generators at the Cal Poly Dairy, United States]]

The most important initial issue when considering the application of anaerobic digestion systems is the feedstock to the process. Almost any organic material can be processed with anaerobic digestion;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31, Alfagy.com, retrieved 16.08.09] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110727/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31, |date=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, if biogas production is the aim, the level of putrescibility is the key factor in its successful application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisbiorefine.org/proc/anaerobic.pdf Anaerobic digestion feedstock classification] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034038/http://www.wisbiorefine.org/proc/anaerobic.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}, wisbiorefine.org. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; The more putrescible (digestible) the material, the higher the gas yields possible from the system.

Feedstocks can include biodegradable waste materials, such as waste paper, grass clippings, leftover food, sewage, and animal waste.&lt;ref name=nnfcc /&gt; [[Wood]]y wastes are the exception, because they are largely unaffected by digestion, as most anaerobes are unable to degrade [[lignin]]. Xylophalgeous anaerobes (lignin consumers) or using high temperature pretreatment, such as pyrolysis, can be used to break lignin down. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with specially grown [[energy crop]]s, such as [[silage]], for dedicated biogas production. In Germany and continental Europe, these facilities are referred to as "biogas" plants. A codigestion or cofermentation plant is typically an agricultural anaerobic digester that accepts two or more input materials for simultaneous digestion.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmer, A. &amp; Oeschsner, H. [http://ltnet.lv-h.de/en/volltext/Lt20016/LT20016E_412_413.pdf Co-fermentation of grass and forage maize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128093059/http://ltnet.lv-h.de/en/volltext/Lt20016/LT20016E_412_413.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}, Energy, Landtechnik, 5/11, p 56, ltnet.lv-h.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of time required for anaerobic digestion depends on the chemical complexity of the material. Material rich in easily digestible sugars breaks down quickly, whereas intact lignocellulosic material rich in cellulose and hemicellulose polymers can take much longer to break down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anaerobic-digestion.com/old-rope-anaerobic-digestion-article], waste-management-world.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Anaerobic microorganisms are generally unable to break down lignin, the recalcitrant aromatic component of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Benner, Ronald |year=1989 |title=Book Review: ''Biology of anaerobic microorganisms'' |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |volume=34|issue=3|page=647 |doi=10.4319/lo.1989.34.3.0647|url=http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_34/issue_3/0647.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113181527/http://aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_34/issue_3/0647.pdf |archivedate=13 November 2006 |deadurl=yes|bibcode=1989LimOc..34..647B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaerobic digesters were originally designed for operation using sewage sludge and manures. Sewage and manure are not, however, the material with the most potential for anaerobic digestion, as the biodegradable material has already had much of the energy content taken out by the animals that produced it. Therefore, many digesters operate with codigestion of two or more types of feedstock. For example, in a farm-based digester that uses dairy manure as the primary feedstock, the gas production may be significantly increased by adding a second feedstock, e.g., grass and corn (typical on-farm feedstock), or various organic byproducts, such as slaughterhouse waste, fats, oils and grease from restaurants, organic household waste, etc. (typical off-site feedstock).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Anaerobic Digestion Initiative Advisory Committee (ADIAC)|title=Feedstock|url=http://www.bcfarmbiogas.ca/Feedstockenergy/feedstock |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213185207/http://bcfarmbiogas.ca/Feedstockenergy/feedstock |archivedate=13 December 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moisture content===
A second consideration related to the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable it will be to handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?doi=XfhO-iP3em4C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=high+solids+anaerobic+digestion+bulking&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fEDEUaGKK4&amp;sig=B9CbvsX37xfMDLF4ILVhMKp2D-U#PPP1,M1 Management of Urban Biodegradable Waste], books.google.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvsde.ops-oms.org/bvsaar/cdlodos/pdf/anaerobiccodigestion495.pdf Anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge and rice straw], bvsde.ops-oms.org. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.&lt;ref name="Low" /&gt;

===Contamination===
The level of contamination of the feedstock material is a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as plastic, glass, or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seas.ucla.edu/stenstro/r/r10 Anaerobic digestion of classified municipal solid wastes], seas.ucla.edu. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; If it is not removed, then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that mechanical biological treatment plants are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more processing machinery will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/economic-assessment-of-anaerobic-digestion-technology-and-its-suitability-to-uk-farming-and-waste-systems-report-2nd-edition-nnfcc-10-010 Economic Assessment of Anaerobic Digestion Technology &amp; its Suitability to UK Farming &amp; Waste Systems (Report, 2nd Edition), NNFCC 10-010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409201012/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/economic-assessment-of-anaerobic-digestion-technology-and-its-suitability-to-uk-farming-and-waste-systems-report-2nd-edition-nnfcc-10-010 |date=9 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After sorting or screening to remove any physical contaminants from the feedstock, the material is often shredded, minced, and mechanically or hydraulically pulped to increase the surface area available to microbes in the digesters and, hence, increase the speed of digestion. The maceration of solids can be achieved by using a [[chopper pump]] to transfer the feedstock material into the airtight digester, where anaerobic treatment takes place.

===Substrate composition===
Substrate composition is a major factor in determining the methane yield and methane production rates from the digestion of biomass. Techniques to determine the compositional characteristics of the feedstock are available, while parameters such as solids, elemental, and organic analyses are important for digester design and operation.&lt;ref&gt;Jerger, D. &amp; Tsao, G. (2006) Feed composition in Anaerobic digestion of biomass, p65&lt;/ref&gt; Methane yield can be estimated from the elemental composition of substrate along with an estimate of its degradability (the fraction of the substrate that is converted to biogas in a reactor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Biotechnology|last=Rittmann 1, McCarty 2|first=B 1, P 2|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2001|isbn=978-0072345537|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to predict biogas composition (the relative fractions of methane and carbon dioxide) it is necessary to estimate [[carbon dioxide]] [[Partition coefficient|partitioning]] between the aqueous and gas phases, which requires additional information (reactor temperature, [[pH]], and substrate composition) and a chemical speciation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=D.

If the putrescible waste processed in anaerobic digesters were disposed of in a landfill, it would break down naturally and often anaerobically. In this case, the gas will eventually escape into the atmosphere. As methane is about 20 times more potent as a [[greenhouse gas]] than carbon dioxide, this has significant negative environmental effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2005/02/01/global_warming_methane_could_be_far_worse_than_carbon_dioxide.htm Global warming methane could be far more potent than carbon dioxide] newmediaexplorer.org.

In countries that collect household waste, the use of local anaerobic digestion facilities can help to reduce the amount of waste that requires transportation to centralized landfill sites or incineration facilities. This reduced burden on transportation reduces carbon emissions from the collection vehicles. If localized anaerobic digestion facilities are embedded within an electrical distribution network, they can help reduce the electrical losses associated with transporting electricity over a national grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/04-05/demand_side_management/framework5.htm Renewable Energy Framework], esru.strath.ac.uk.

Methane and power produced in anaerobic digestion facilities can be used to replace energy derived from fossil fuels, and hence reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, because the carbon in biodegradable material is part of a [[carbon cycle]]. The carbon released into the atmosphere from the combustion of biogas has been removed by plants for them to grow in the recent past, usually within the last decade, but more typically within the last growing season. If the plants are regrown, taking the carbon out of the atmosphere once more, the system will be carbon neutral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afbini.gov.uk/index/services/specialist-advice/renewable-energy/re-anaerobic-digestion-intro/re-anaerobic-digestion-benefits.htm Benefits of Anaerobic Digestion], afbini.gov.uk.

Biogas from [[sewage sludge treatment]] is sometimes used to run a [[gas engine]] to produce electrical power, some or all of which can be used to run the sewage works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/38-hhv-caterpillar-bio-gas-engine-fitted-to-long-reach-sewage-works.html 38% HHV Caterpillar Bio-gas Engine Fitted to Sewage Works | Claverton Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], claverton-energy.com&lt;/ref&gt; Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester. The waste heat is, in general, enough to heat the digester to the required temperatures. The power potential from sewage works is limited – in the UK, there are about 80&amp;nbsp;MW total of such generation, with the potential to increase to 150&amp;nbsp;MW, which is insignificant compared to the average power demand in the UK of about 35,000&amp;nbsp;MW. The scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter – energy crops, food waste, abattoir waste, etc. - is much higher, estimated to be capable of about 3,000&amp;nbsp;MW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Farm biogas plants using animal waste and energy crops are expected to contribute to reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and strengthen the grid, while providing UK farmers with additional revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31 Alfagy.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110257/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31 |date=7 July 2011 }}, "Be Green – Make Gas"&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oakland, California at the [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]]’s main wastewater treatment plant (EBMUD), [[food waste]] is currently codigested with primary and secondary municipal wastewater solids and other high-strength wastes. Compared to municipal wastewater solids digestion alone, food waste codigestion has many benefits. Anaerobic digestion of food waste pulp from the EBMUD food waste process provides a higher normalized energy benefit, compared to municipal wastewater solids: 730 to 1,300 kWh per dry ton of food waste applied compared to 560 to 940 kWh per dry ton of municipal wastewater solids applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=East Bay Municipal Utility District|title=Anaerobic Digestion of Food Waste|year=2008|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/organics/ad/EBMUDFinalReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organics: Anaerobic Digestion|url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/organics/ad/index.html|work=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grid injection===
Biogas grid-injection is the injection of biogas into the [[natural gas grid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgrid.com/corporate/About+Us/climate/press/020209.htm Half Britain’s homes could be heated by renewable gas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208061528/http://www.nationalgrid.com/corporate/About+Us/climate/press/020209.htm |date=8 December 2009 }}, nationalgrid.com&lt;/ref&gt; The raw biogas has to be previously upgraded to biomethane. This upgrading implies the removal of contaminants such as hydrogen sulphide or siloxanes, as well as the carbon dioxide. Several technologies are available for this purpose, the most widely implemented being [[Pressure swing adsorption|pressure swing adsorption (PSA)]], water or [[Amine gas treating|amine scrubbing]] (absorption processes) and, in recent years, [[Membrane technology|membrane separation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-biogas.net/files/daten-redaktion/download/publi-task37/upgrading_rz_low_final.pdf Petersson A., Wellinger A.

===Vehicle fuel===
After upgrading with the above-mentioned technologies, the biogas (transformed into biomethane) can be used as vehicle fuel in adapted vehicles. This use is very extensive in Sweden, where over 38,600 gas vehicles exist, and 60% of the vehicle gas is biomethane generated in anaerobic digestion plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngvaeurope.eu/sweden Natural &amp; bioGas Vehicle Association (NVGA).

===Fertiliser and soil conditioner===
The solid, fibrous component of the digested material can be used as a soil conditioner to increase the organic content of soils. Digester liquor can be used as a fertiliser to supply vital nutrients to soils instead of chemical fertilisers that require large amounts of energy to produce and transport. The use of manufactured fertilisers is, therefore, more carbon-intensive than the use of anaerobic digester liquor fertiliser. In countries such as [[Spain]], where many soils are organically depleted, the markets for the digested solids can be equally as important as the biogas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compostnetwork.info/index.php?id=44 Introduction and Spanish organic waste situation], compostnetwork.info. Retrieved 19.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooking gas===
By using a [[bio-digester]], which produces the bacteria required for decomposing, cooking gas is generated. The organic garbage like fallen leaves, kitchen waste, food waste etc. are fed into a crusher unit, where the mixture is conflated with a small amount of water. The mixture is then fed into the bio-digester, where the bacteria decomposes it to produce cooking gas. This gas is piped to kitchen stove. A 2 cubic meter bio-digester can produce 2 cubic meter of cooking gas. This is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;kg of LPG. The notable advantage of using a bio-digester is the sludge which is a rich organic manure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/article3698431.ece|title= Satisfaction of reducing your carbon footprint|journal= The Hindu| accessdate=2012-07-31|date= 2012-07-28|last1= Vijay|first1= Hema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digestate===
{{Main|digestate}}

Digestate is the solid remnants of the original input material to the digesters that the microbes cannot use. It also consists of the mineralised remains of the dead bacteria from within the digesters. Digestate can come in three forms: fibrous, liquor, or a sludge-based combination of the two fractions. In two-stage systems, different forms of digestate come from different digestion tanks. In single-stage digestion systems, the two fractions will be combined and, if desired, separated by further processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waste.nl/page/248 Fact sheet on anaerobic digestion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055626/http://www.waste.nl/page/248 |date=28 September 2007 }}, waste.nl.

The second byproduct (acidogenic digestate) is a stable, organic material consisting largely of lignin and cellulose, but also of a variety of mineral components in a matrix of dead bacterial cells; some plastic may be present. The material resembles domestic compost and can be used as such or to make low-grade building products, such as fibreboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexmarshall.me.uk/index_files/documents/ResponsetoConsultationonthesourcesegregationrequirementinParagraph7AofSchedule3totheWasteMan.pdf Oaktech Consultation Response to UK Source Segregation Requirement], alexmarshall.me.uk.

Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;
The solid digestate can also be used as feedstock for ethanol production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/bit.22627 | pmid=19998279 | title=A sustainable pathway of cellulosic ethanol production integrating anaerobic digestion with biorefining | year=2010 | journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume=105 | issue=6 | pages=1031–9 | last1 = Yue | first1 = Zhengbo | last2 = Teater | first2 = Charles | last3 = Liu | first3 = Yan | last4 = MacLellan | first4 = James | last5 = Liao | first5 = Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third byproduct is a liquid (methanogenic digestate) rich in nutrients, which can be used as a fertiliser, depending on the quality of the material being digested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalwarming101.com/content/view/595/88888958/ Biomass and biogas], globalwarming101.com.

This will depend upon the quality of the original feedstock. In the case of most clean and source-separated biodegradable waste streams, the levels of PTEs will be low. In the case of wastes originating from industry, the levels of PTEs may be higher and will need to be taken into consideration when determining a suitable end use for the material.

Digestate typically contains elements, such as lignin, that cannot be broken down by the anaerobic microorganisms. Also, the digestate may contain ammonia that is phytotoxic, and may hamper the growth of plants if it is used as a soil-improving material. For these two reasons, a maturation or composting stage may be employed after digestion. Lignin and other materials are available for degradation by aerobic microorganisms, such as fungi, helping reduce the overall volume of the material for transport. During this maturation, the ammonia will be oxidized into nitrates, improving the fertility of the material and making it more suitable as a soil improver. Large composting stages are typically used by dry anaerobic digestion technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ows.be/pub/Vitoria_InfoEnviro.mei07.pdf Vitoria Plant Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128093059/http://www.ows.be/pub/Vitoria_InfoEnviro.mei07.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}, ows.be.

===Wastewater===
The final output from anaerobic digestion systems is water, which originates both from the moisture content of the original waste that was treated and water produced during the microbial reactions in the digestion systems. This water may be released from the dewatering of the digestate or may be implicitly separate from the digestate.

The wastewater exiting the anaerobic digestion facility will typically have elevated levels of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD). These measures of the reactivity of the effluent indicate an ability to pollute. Some of this material is termed 'hard COD', meaning it cannot be accessed by the anaerobic bacteria for conversion into biogas. If this effluent were put directly into watercourses, it would negatively affect them by causing [[eutrophication]]. As such, further treatment of the wastewater is often required. This treatment will typically be an oxidation stage wherein air is passed through the water in a sequencing batch reactors or [[reverse osmosis]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dosta|first=Joan|last2=Galí |first2=Alexandre |last3=Macé |first3=Sandra |last4=Mata‐Álvarez |first4=Joan|title=Modelling a sequencing batch reactor to treat the supernatant from anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste|journal=Journal of Chemical Technology &amp; Biotechnology|date=February 2007|volume=82|issue=2|pages=158–64|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jws/jctb/2007/00000082/00000002/art00006?crawler=true|accessdate=16 September 2013|doi=10.1002/jctb.1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.co.uk/clarke_waste/water_treatment.htm Clarke Energy Reverse Osmosis Unit], clarke-energy.co.uk.

[[Feed-in tariffs in Germany]] were enacted in 1991, also known as FIT, providing long-term contracts compensating investments in renewable energy generation. Consequently, between 1991 and 1998 the number of anaerobic digester plants in Germany grew from 20 to 517. In the late 1990s, energy prices in Germany varied and investors became unsure of the market’s potential. The German government responded by amending FIT four times between 2000 and 2011, increasing tariffs and improving the profitability of anaerobic digestion, and resulting in reliable returns for biogas production and continued high adoption rates across the country.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Asatkalpa''' (Sanskrit: असत्कल्प्), this Sanskrit term is derived from the word, ''asat'', meaning 'unreal' combined with the word, ''kalpa'', here in the context of [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy meaning 'a little less than complete', and is another word for ''mithya'' meaning 'the almost unreal world' or 'unreal conceptuality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jeffry Hopkins Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.thlib.org/internal_definitions/public_term/141321?mode=search }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Yogacara]] school of [[Buddhism]] it is one of the three transformed modes of the mind which three are – ''parikalpa'', 'the act of imagination', ''abh utaparikalpa'', 'the act of imagining the unreal forms', and ''asatkalpa'', 'the act of imagining the non-existent'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Buddhist Doctrine of Experience|author= Thomas A.

==Advaita view==

The [[Upanishads]] teach that [[Brahman]], 'the First Cause', in itself is devoid of attributes, devoid of any form ([[Brahma Sutra]] III.ii14). Brahman is the only reality, there is no difference between Brahman, the Universal Self, and the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the Individual self, and the association of one’s ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' with ''[[buddhi]]'' is preceded by incorrect knowledge.

[[Gaudapada]] is believed to have revived the [[monistic]] teaching of the [[Upanishads]]; [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] states that Gaudapada had recovered the Absolutist (Advaita) creed from the Vedas. Gaudapada’s ''Karika'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]], comprises four sections – ''agama'' ('scripture'), ''vaitathya'' ('unreality'), ''advaita'' ('unity') and ''alatsanti'' ('the extinction of the burning coal'). In the first section, he concludes that the world appearance would have ceased if it had existed and that all this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] is mere [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (magic or illusion). And therefore, in the next section, he calls the world appearance a dream because all existence is unreal; that all dreams and all experiences are illusory creations of the self. The mind perceives all things but he states that what is perceived by the mind is perceived as existing at the moment of perception only, and that which is unmanifested in the mind and that which appears as distinct and manifest outside are all imaginary productions in association with the sense faculties, for in reality there is neither production nor destruction. In the third section Gaudapada explains that 'duality' is a distinction imposed upon the one (''advaita'') by ''Maya''; that the one, in the active mind, appears to be many in the dream state as also in the waking state, once the same active mind ceases to see production then it sees no other object of knowledge other than the unproduced Self. In the last section, while drawing attention to the ''regress ad infinitum'' of Cause and Effect, he reasons that if the cause is regarded as the effect then the cause cannot be truly unproduced i.e. eternal, because it suffers production. That things exist, do not exist, do exist and not exist, and neither exist or not exist; that they are moving or steady or none of those are but thoughts with which fools are deluded. 

Sankara carried on the work of Gaudapada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|page=425|url=http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/A-History-of-Indian-Philosophy-Vol-111/#p159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Vivekachudamani]] St.400 he reiterates - असत्कल्पो विकल्पोऽयं विश्वमित्येकवस्तुनि - meaning – 'This variegated world imagined in the one Entity, Brahman, is asatkalpa (all but unreal, it appears but is not real)';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrashekhara Bharati of Srngeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=387|url= http://www.bhavans.info/store/bookdetail.asp?bid=364&amp;bauth=Sri+Sankara+Bhagavatpadacarya }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase - Asatkalpo-vikalpo of this passage, means 'imagined unrealities' (Vivekachudamani St.528), for the mind is the cause of imagination of the unreal, it is the cause for the non-existent imaginations and agitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekchoodamani|author= Swami Chinmayananda|publisher= Chinmaya Mission| page=582|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mArVw7yUkCsC&amp;pg=PA582&amp;lpg=PA582&amp;dq=asatkalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mEsP9esU7g&amp;sig=Yx2mHKeItsSxg2F7M45R6MyZQF4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KZqtUovUFsaL7Abm9YEI&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asatkalpa&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist view==

The [[Yogacara]] system and the system of [[Nagarjuna]] is said to have evolved from the [[Prajnaparamita]], the originating text of the [[Mahayana]] school of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mother of the Buddhas: Meditation on the Prajnaparamita Sutra|author=Lex Histon|publisher=Quest Books|page=x|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmuSxqoiwNEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=prajnaparamita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5aWuUuyjCYrR7Aa2roGYDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prajnaparamita&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trisvabhavakarika (of [[Vasubandhu]]) or Trisvabhavanirdesa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trisvabhavakarika|author=Vasubandhu|url=http://www.fodian.net/world/3zsl_en.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; details the Yogacara theory of the Three Natures in the context of the Theory of Two-truths. In the context of the 'Conventional truth' it states that there are three natures of being (''svabhava''),- a) 'the imaginary' (''kalpita''), b) 'the dependent' (''paratantra'') and c) 'the absolute' (''parinispanna''); the dependent nature is what appears depending on the causes i.e. ''[[Vāsanā|vasana]]s'' (the beginning-less potencies of desires associated with objects) remaining in the subconsciousness in latent, subliminal form but conditions permitting revitalized pass into the consciousness, they appear in the mind as ''asatkalpa'' as 'unreal mental creations' or reactualization of the ''vasanas''.

''Karika'' 5 of this text explains why the mind is designated with the word ''asatkalpa'', the mind, which is a series of representations etc.; that are originated by the ''vasanas'', is an unreal mental creation because a) the image projected by the mind (is as it is imagined) does not corresponds to its true being since it is conceived as a real ego which grasps an equally real object although its true nature is the ''ab aeterno'' inexistence of the subject-object duality; and because b) the objects of those representations, which present themselves as real and external to the mind (as it imagines the objects) do not exist as such since they are only imaginations produced by the reactualizations of the ''vasanas'' without real corresponding objects.

The imaginary nature is the form under which the dependent nature manifests itself, and ''Karika'' 4 states that ''asatkalpa'' is the dependent nature which appears with duality i.e. composed by a subject who knows as opposed to an object which is known, because this is the essence of all cognoscitive empirical processes because this is unavoidable form under which all cognoscitive empirical processes come to being. The absolute nature is unalterable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Being as Consciousness: Yogacara Philosophy of Buddhism|author=Fernando Tola|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|pages=199-200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ah2XR9be5uwC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;dq=asatkalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u4_xEsuFvt&amp;sig=I9Rs1gjvEQT37WX9pLCba7BnPto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ip-tUonvFtSP7AaSjYCIAQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=asatkalpa&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imagined nature is non-dual because it consists of unreal/imaginary distinction between subject and object, the dependent nature is non-dual because it does not exist in the dual form in which it manifests itself and the absolute nature is also undual because it is by its very nature the absence of duality between subjectivity and objectivity. Explaining thus, Vasubandhu states that one can be by working of the 'unconscious' (''alaya-vijnana'' or ''mula-vijnana'') make one’s mental power i.e. the power to imagine unreal forms (''asatkalpa''), appear in the form of 'duality' (''dvyatmana'') which form one will subsequently superimpose on things so that the latter will be mistaken for subjects and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Buddhist Doctrine of Experience|author=Thomas A.

The '''Australian Drug Evaluation Committee''' or '''ADEC''', was a [[committee]] that provided independent scientific advice to the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] regarding therapeutic [[medication|drugs]]. The committee was originally formed in 1963 and more recently authorised under the ''Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth)'' as part of the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA). In 2010, ADEC was replaced by the [http://www.tga.gov.au/committee/acpm.htm Advisory Committee on Prescription Medicines (ACPM)]

ADEC provided advice to the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Secretary of the Department of Health on:
*quality, risk-benefit, effectiveness and accessibility of drugs referred to ADEC for evaluation
*medical and scientific evaluations of applications for registration of new drugs

An important role of ADEC was the classification of drugs in Australia into [[Pregnancy category|pregnancy categories]].

The two main subcommittees of ADEC which were responsible for specific aspects of drug regulation in Australia:
*the [[Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee]] (ADRAC) (replaced in 2010 by the separate Advisory Committee on the Safety of Medicines, ACSOM);
*the Pharmaceutical Subcommittee &amp;ndash; which made recommendations to ADEC on the [[pharmaceutical]] aspects ([[chemistry]], [[quality control]], [[pharmacokinetics]], etc.) of drugs proposed for registration (replaced by the pharmaceutical subcommittee of the ACPM).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1435">'''Chinese Apartment Art''' is the avante-gard art that was produced underground during the 1970s - 1990s in China. The word for apartment is ''gongyu'' in Chinese. The literal meaning of apartment is “government-owned residential complex” or “public house.” Chinese artists created private work space within public residential complexes out of sight of authorities. The pieces tend to be smaller as to fit on the confines of the living spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitt.libguides.com/c.php?g=550617&amp;p=4133279|title=Chinese Apartment Art|last=Jones|first=Kiana|date=|website=pitt.libguides.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.artintern.net/index.php/review/main/html/4/378|title=What is "Apartment Art" ? - Reviews - Artintern.net|website=en.artintern.net|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.artintern.net/index.php/exhibition/main/html/273|title=Apartment Art in China 1970s-1990s - Exhibitions - Artintern.net|website=en.artintern.net|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chul Hyun Ahn''' is a South Korean artist who works primarily with light.

==Description==
[[File:Chul Hyun Ahn, "Visual Echo Experiment," 2005, 9 pieces, 104 x 104 x 5.5 inches.jpg|thumb|Chul Hyun Ahn, "Visual Echo Experiment," 2005, 9 pieces, 104 x 104 x 5.5 inches]]
Ahn is a member of a group of young [[light art]]ists including [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Iván Navarro (artist)|Ivan Navarro]], [[Spencer Finch]], and [[Leo Villareal]]. Ahn creates meditations on zen notions of the infinite and the void which distinguishes Ahn's oeuvre from other artists working with light. Ahn’s multiple on-going sculpture series including "Forked Series" and "Tunnel Series" systematically explore the limitations of space and optics.

Hilarie M. Sheets, contributing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'' who also writes regularly for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Art In America]]'', and ''[[Art + Auction]]'', said his work is "At once thrilling and ominous, it suggests a rabbit hole to another world—underwater, outer space, afterlife—or journey to the unknown, the kind of leap of faith involved in the artist’s own passage to an unfamiliar country and language."&lt;ref&gt;Sheets, Hilarie M. Illuminated Void. Comp. C. Grimaldis Gallery. Baltimore: C. Grimaldis Gallery, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a pillar in the resurgence of light art, "Ahn creates sculptures utilizing light, color and illusion as physical representations of his investigation of infinite space." &lt;ref&gt;"Chul Hyun Ahn." C.grimaldisgallery.com. C. Grimaldis Gallery. Web. 12 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://www.cgrimaldisgallery.com/2010/05/25/chul-hyun-ahn/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahn lives and works in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where he is represented by [[C. Grimaldis Gallery]].

== Biography ==
Chul Hyun Ahn was born in [[Busan]], South Korea. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the [[Chugye University for the Arts]] in [[Seoul]]. In 1997 he moved to the United States and received a Master of Fine Arts from the Mount Royal School at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] in [[Baltimore]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/galleries/artists_detail.asp?G=&amp;gid=424035807&amp;which=&amp;aid=3277649&amp;ViewArtistBy=online&amp;rta=http://www.artnet.com C. Grimaldis Gallery. art net. Artnet Worldwide Corporation. Website. 8 December 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Grimaldis first saw Ahn's work at his 2002 MFA thesis exhibition at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Soon after, he had his first exhibition with C. Grimaldis Gallery in the winter of 2003 in a solo exhibition titled ''Infinity - Emptiness'' which featured six light sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;C. Grimaldis Gallery, "Infinity - Emptiness." Price List. January 9 - February 8, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capricehorn.com/images/Baltimore_Sun_-_Today-(5F0F7955-6561-1004-B5F2-871068250123).pdf Mcnatt, Glenn. "Illuminating Colorful Reflections." The Baltimore Sun [Baltimore&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 17 January 2007, 4C]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003 Chul Hyun Ahn has exhibited extensively nationally and internationally, and his work can be found in numerous important private and public collections.

In a review of Ahn's 2008 C. Grimaldis Gallery solo exhibition, ''Phenomena: Visual Echo'' art critic Cara Ober wrote: "What does infinity look like? Chul Hyun Ahn's show of thirteen mirrored light boxes (all 2008) answered this question over and over, in subtly different ways. The constructions of plywood and fluorescent light with exposed electrical cords unavoidably recall [[Donald Judd]] and [[Dan Flavin]], but Ahn uses these industrial materials to a different end. Rather than clarifying visual phenomena without artifice, Ahn seeks to mystify." &lt;ref&gt;Ober, Cara. "Chul Hyun Ahn." Rev. of Phenomena: Visual Echo solo exhibition. ''ARTnews'' December 2008: 131. Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://caraober.com/artwork/920999_ARTnews_Chul_Hyun_Ahn_at_Grimaldis.html Ober, Cara. ''Cara Ober.''

'''Cognitive deficit''' or '''cognitive impairment''' is an inclusive term to describe any characteristic that acts as a barrier to [[cognition|the cognition process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coren |first=Stanley |author2=Lawrence M. Ward |author3=James T. Enns  |title=Sensation and Perception |publisher=[[Harcourt Brace]] |year=1999 |page=9 |isbn= 0-470-00226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term may describe
* deficits in overall [[intelligence]] (as with [[intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]]),
* specific and restricted deficits in cognitive abilities (such as in [[learning disability|learning disorders]] like [[dyslexia]]),
* [[Neuropsychological assessment|neuropsychological deficits]] (such as in [[attention]], [[working memory]] or [[Executive functions|executive function]]),
* or it may describe drug-induced impairment in cognition and memory (such as that seen with [[alcohol]], [[glucocorticoids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11461709 | volume=35 | title=Corticosteroids and cognition. | journal=J Psychiatr Res | pages=127–45 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3956(01)00018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[benzodiazepine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kalachnik | first1 = JE. | last2 = Hanzel | first2 = TE. | last3 = Sevenich | first3 = R. | last4 = Harder | first4 = SR. | title = Benzodiazepine behavioral side effects: review and implications for individuals with mental retardation | journal = Am J Ment Retard | volume = 107 | issue = 5 | pages = 376–410 |date=Sep 2002 | pmid = 12186578 | doi = 10.1352/0895-8017(2002)107&lt;0376:BBSERA&gt;2.0.CO;2| issn = 0895-8017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
It usually refers to a durable characteristic, as opposed to [[altered level of consciousness]], which may be acute and reversible. Cognitive deficits may be [[Congenital disorder|inborn]] or caused by environmental factors such as [[acquired brain injury|brain injuries]], [[neurological disorders]], or [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hockenbury, Don and Sandy | title=Discovering Psychology | publisher=Worth Publishers | year=2004 | isbn=0-7167-5704-4}}{{page needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Fried, Yehuda  |author2=Joseph Agassi, | title=Paranoia: A Study in Diagnosis| publisher=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, 50 | year=1976 | isbn=90-277-0704-9}}{{page needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Older people with cognitive impairment appear to improve somewhat with [[light therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiu|first1=HL|last2=Chan|first2=PT|last3=Chu|first3=H|last4=Hsiao|first4=SS|last5=Liu|first5=D|last6=Lin|first6=CH|last7=Chou|first7=KR|title=Effectiveness of Light Therapy in Cognitively Impaired Persons: A Metaanalysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=October 2017|volume=65|issue=10|pages=2227-2234|doi=10.1111/jgs.14990|pmid=28734045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==

{{Cleanup|section|reason=most of these examples are longitudinal studies with large samples, not case studies|date=December 2015}}

There is evidence to indicate that parallel age trends have been similar over a vast amount of time, as with Schaie’s Seattle Longitudinal Study, which contained fifty years worth of data  as well as seventy years in Wechsler tests. Studies such as these{{Example needed}} have demonstrated the different patterns in age trends have two specific patterns in cognition, a constant decrease in measures of processing abilities such as reasoning, and stability followed by a steady decline for knowledge previously acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gualtieri|first=C. Thomas|author2=Johnson, Lynda G.|title=Age-related cognitive decline in patients with mood disorders|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|volume=32|issue=4|pages=962–967|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.12.030|pmid=18243461|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A twelve-year study published in 2012 researched the effects of lifestyle activities on cognitive deficit in the hopes that a long study such as this could, to some degree, help older adults to ward off cognitive decline. The study looked at verbal speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory to be influenced by physical, social, and cognitive activities. The results of the study concluded that maintenance of cognitive functions with normal aging can be maintained by keeping an active lifestyle. The results also seemed to conclude that the correlation between lifestyle activities and cognition is not a simple one, as not all cognitive abilities were related to changes in the daily activities. Therefore, further research of longitudinal design observing the matches between activities and cognitive abilities in cognitively impaired adults could be critical.&lt;ref name="Small 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=B|author2=Dixon R|author3=McArdle J|author4=Grimm K.|title=Do changes in lifestyle engagement moderate cognitive decline in normal aging? Evidence from the Victoria Longitudinal Study|journal=Neuropsychology|date=March 2012|volume=26|issue=2|pages=144–155|doi=10.1037/a0026579|pmid=22149165|pmc=3761970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies using brain imaging have been done in an attempt to note early signs of cognitive decline on healthy individuals before changes noticed clinically occur. In this way the study attempted to find more biomarkers for early onset of degenerative diseases.  The results from the study concluded that there are indeed patterns of brain abnormality that can be associated with brain decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=VH|author2=Resnick SM|author3=Doshi J|author4=Beason-Held LL|author5=Zhou Y|author6=Ferrucci L|author7=Wong DF|author8=Kraut MA|author9=Davatzikos C|title=Longitudinal imaging pattern analysis (SPARE-CD index) detects early structural and functional changes before cognitive decline in healthy older adults|journal=Neurobiology of Aging|volume=33|issue=12|pages=2733–45|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.01.010|pmid=22365049|pmc=4023476|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-sectional study, researchers investigated patients with mood disorders in comparison with a control group to see if there was a difference on the effect of aging between the groups. These patients were tested with the Central Nervous System Vital Signs, a neurocognitive battery test. The study examined subjects from ages 18 to 90, noticing a sharp decline in the patients with mood disorder compared to the normal group when subjects were ages 65 and up. These declines were observed in the cognitive areas of attention, executive function, processing speed, and memory.&lt;ref name="Small 2012" /&gt;

== Other findings ==

Although one would expect cognitive decline to have major effects on [[job performance]], it seems that there is little to no correlation of health with job performance.  With the exception of cognitive-dependent jobs such as air-traffic controller, professional athlete, or other elite jobs, age does not seem to impact one’s job performance. This obviously conflicts with cognitive tests given, so the matter has been researched further.
One possible reason for this conclusion is the rare need for a person to perform at their maximum. There is a difference between typical functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– the normal level of functioning for daily life, and maximal functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– what cognitive tests observe as our maximum level of functioning. As the maximum cognitive ability that we are able to achieve decreases, it may not actually affect our daily lives, which only require the normal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salthouse|first=Timothy|title=Consequences of Age-Related Cognitive Declines|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=10 January 2012|volume=63|issue=1|pages=201–226|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100328|pmc=3632788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have indicated that childhood hunger might have a protective effect on cognitive decline. One possible explanation is that the onset of age-related changes in the body can be delayed by [[calorie restriction]]. Another possible explanation is the selective survival effect, as the study participants who had a childhood with hunger tend to be the healthiest of their era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barnes |first=L.

'''Cognitive holding power''' is a concept measured by John C. Stevenson in 1994 using a [[questionnaire]], the Cognitive Holding Power Questionnaire (CHPQ). This tool is assesses first- or second-order [[cognitive process]]ing preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=John|title=Performance of the cognitive holding power questionnaire in schools|journal=Learning and Instruction|date=October 1998|volume=8|issue=5|pages=393–410|doi=10.1016/S0959-4752(97)00029-7|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475297000297|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=John C.|last2=Evans|first2=Glen T.|title=Conceptualization and Measurement of Cognitive Holding Power|journal=Journal of Educational Measurement|date=June 1994|volume=31|issue=2|pages=161–181|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1994.tb00441.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-3984.1994.tb00441.x/abstract|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7477">Collective [[inductive reasoning|induction]] is a task developed by Steiner and used in [[research]] on group [[problem solving]].&lt;ref name=Steiner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=I. D.|title=Models for inferring relationships between group size and potential group [[productivity]].|journal=Behavioral Science|year=1966|volume=11|pages=273–283|doi=10.1002/bs.3830110404}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Broadly, the method entails "the cooperative search for descriptive, predictive, and explanatory generalizations, rules, and principles" &lt;ref name=Laughlin&gt;{{cite book|last=Laughlin|first=Patrick|title=Group Problem Solving|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-14790-1|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; among members in a group working on the same task.  James Larson further defined collective induction tasks as "[tasks] in which problem solvers work cooperatively to induce a general rule or principle that can account [[parsimoniously]] for a given set of facts or observations" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larson|first=James|title=In Search of Synergy in Small Group Performance|year=2010|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8058-5943-0|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;     This particular process has been used to determine if groups are better problem solvers than individuals.

'''Rule Induction Tasks'''

The most frequently used collective induction task is a task that requires participants to discern the [[pattern]] that a particular series of [[playing cards]] are laid in.  The task experimenter first generates a rule about how cards should be laid.  The rule may be determined based on any facet of the cards.  For example, the pattern could be two red cards followed by a spade.  The experimenter begins by laying a card that fits the rule.  Then group members make suggestions for what card should be laid next.  If the card fits the pattern, the experimenter places the card to the right of the previous correctly laid card.  If the card does not fit the pattern, then the experimenter places it below the previous card.  Participants work to discern the pattern.  After ten rounds, participants are asked to propose their [[hypothesis]] about what the rule could be. Some modifications to this procedure have been used.  For example, in some variations, groups are allowed to put forth multiple hypotheses and use multiple card displays &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|author2=Magley, Shupe|title=Positive and negative hypothesis testing by cooperative groups|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=1997|volume=69|pages=265–275|doi=10.1006/obhd.1997.2687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, less widely used collective induction task also involves cards.  In this task, four cards are used with the letters A or D on one side of the card and the numbers 4 or 7 on the other side.  The cards are placed on the table to show one face of each letter and number.  Participants are asked to determine the minimum number of cards they will need to turn over in order to determine if cards with vowels always have even numbers on their opposite side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wason |first=P. C. |chapter=Reasoning |title=New Horizons in Psychology |year=1966 |editor=B. Foss |pages=135–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Collective Induction Task.jpg|thumb|These cards are laid in a pattern following the 2 red cards, one spade rule.]]

'''Do groups perform better than individuals?'''

This question has been tested by comparing group [[performance]] to the performance of individuals alone or in a [[Nominal group technique|nominal group]], a group of individuals whose performance is grouped together even though they did not work together.&lt;ref name=Larson&gt;{{cite book|last=Larson|first=James|title=In Search of Synergy in Small Group Performance|year=2010|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8058-5943-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if groups of four worked on a task together, then researchers could see if they performed better than individuals by randomly combining the efforts of four individuals who worked on the same task independently.  This allows researchers to assess the potential gains or losses caused by group interaction while recognizing that more people working on a task may be more likely to arrive at the solution by random chance.  Group performance is compared against both the best performing individual in each nominal group (thus answering the question, "do groups perform better than all individuals?") and the average of all individual performances ("do groups perform better than average?").  Several experiments have sought to address this question and results have consistently suggested that groups perform better than the average individual though not as well as the best individual in nominal groups.

The first researchers to test if group performance is better than individual performance were Laughlin and Shippy in 1983.&lt;ref name=Larson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|author2=Shippy|title=Collective induction|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1983|volume=45|pages=94–100|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.45.1.94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They found that groups performed better than individuals, proposing more plausible hypotheses and finding the correct rule with fewer rounds than individuals.  However, this does not address whether individuals working cooperatively can perform better than the best member of a similarly sized nominal group.  This was tested in three separate experiments by Laughlin and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|author2=Bonner, Altermatt|title=Collective versus individual induction with single versus multiple hypotheses|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=75|pages=1481–1489|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.6.1481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|author2=VanderStoep, Hollingshead|title=Collective versus individual induction: Recognition of truth, rejection of error, and collective information processing|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=61|pages=50–67|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.1.50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these studies, results indicated that groups working cooperatively performed about as well as the best individual in each nominal group and significantly better than the second, third, and worst members of the nominal group.  No study to date has shown that groups perform better than the best member of a nominal group.&lt;ref name=Larson /&gt;

'''Twelve Postulates of Collective Induction Tasks'''

As noted by Patrick Laughlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laughlin|first=Patrick|title=Group Problem Solving|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-14790-1|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are twelve postulates of collective induction tasks.  These rules are the result of years of research on collective induction tasks with groups and were originally published in the journal [[Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|first=Patrick|title=Collective Induction: Twelve Postulates|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=1999|volume=80|issue=1|pages=50–69|doi=10.1006/obhd.1999.2854}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These twelve postulates compose a theory of collective induction.&lt;ref name=Laughlin /&gt;

[[File:Parabola.svg|right|thumb|A [[parabola]], a simple example of a curve]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''curve''' (also called a '''curved line''' in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a [[line (geometry)|line]] but that need not be [[Linearity|straight]]. Thus, a curve is a generalization of a line, in that its [[curvature]] need not be zero.{{efn|In current mathematical usage, a line is straight. Previously{{when?|date=December 2017}} lines could be either curved or straight.{{cn|date=December 2017}}}}

Various disciplines within mathematics have given the term different meanings depending on the area of study, so the precise meaning depends on context. However, many of these meanings are special instances of the definition which follows. A curve is a [[topological space]] which is locally [[homeomorphic]] to a line. In everyday language, this means that a curve is a set of points which, near each of its points, looks like a line, up to a deformation.  A simple example of a curve is the [[parabola]], shown to the right. A [[list of curves|large number of other curves]] have been studied in multiple mathematical fields.

A '''closed curve''' is a curve that forms a [[path (topology)|path]] whose starting point is also its ending point—that is, a path from any of its points to the same point.

Closely related meanings include the [[graph of a function]] (for example, [[Phillips curve]]) and a [[two-dimensional graph]].

==History==
[[File:Newgrange Entrance Stone.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Megalithic art]] from Newgrange showing an early interest in curves]]
Interest in curves began long before they were the subject of mathematical study.  This can be seen in numerous examples of their decorative use in art and on everyday objects dating back to prehistoric
times.&lt;ref name="Lockwood"&gt;Lockwood p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; Curves, or at least their graphical representations, are simple to create, for example by a stick in the sand on a beach.

Historically, the term "line" was used in place of the more modern term "curve". Hence the phrases "straight line" and "right line" were used to distinguish what are today called lines from "curved lines". For example, in Book I of [[Euclid's Elements]], a line is defined as a "breadthless length" (Def. 2), while a ''straight'' line is defined as "a line that lies evenly with the points on itself" (Def. 4). Euclid's idea of a line is perhaps clarified by the statement "The extremities of a line are points," (Def. 3).&lt;ref&gt;Heath p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentators further classified lines according to various schemes. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Heath p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;
*Composite lines (lines forming an angle)
*Incomposite lines
**Determinate (lines that do not extend indefinitely, such as the circle)
**Indeterminate (lines that extend indefinitely, such as the straight line and the parabola)

[[File:Conic sections with plane.svg|thumb|225px|The curves created by slicing a cone ([[conic section]]s) were among the curves studied in ancient Greece.]]
The Greek [[geometers]] had studied many other kinds of curves. One reason was their interest in solving geometrical problems that could not be solved using standard [[compass and straightedge]] construction.
These curves include:
*The [[conic section]]s, deeply studied by [[Apollonius of Perga]]
*The [[cissoid of Diocles]], studied by [[Diocles (mathematician)|Diocles]] and used as a method to [[doubling the cube|double the cube]].&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[conchoid of Nicomedes]], studied by [[Nicomedes (mathematician)|Nicomedes]] as a method to both double the cube and to [[angle trisection|trisect an angle]].&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Archimedean spiral]], studied by [[Archimedes]] as a method to trisect an angle and [[Squaring the circle|square the circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|class=Curves|id=Spiral|title=Spiral of Archimedes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[spiric section]]s, sections of [[torus|tori]] studied by [[Perseus (geometer)|Perseus]] as sections of cones had been studied by Apollonius.

[[File:Folium Of Descartes.svg|thumb|225px|left|Analytic geometry allowed curves, such as the [[Folium of Descartes]], to be defined using equations instead of geometrical construction.]]
A fundamental advance in the theory of curves was the advent of [[analytic geometry]] in the seventeenth century. This enabled a curve to be described using an equation rather than an elaborate geometrical construction. This not only allowed new curves to be defined and studied, but it enabled a formal distinction to be made between curves that can be defined using [[algebraic equation]]s, [[algebraic curve]]s, and those that cannot, [[transcendental curve]]s. Previously, curves had been described as "geometrical" or "mechanical" according to how they were, or supposedly could be, generated.&lt;ref name="Lockwood" /&gt;

Conic sections were applied in [[astronomy]] by [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]].
Newton also worked on an early example in the [[calculus of variations]]. Solutions to variational problems, such as the [[brachistochrone]] and [[tautochrone]] questions, introduced properties of curves in new ways (in this case, the [[cycloid]]). The [[catenary]] gets its name as the solution to the problem of a hanging chain, the sort of question that became routinely accessible by means of [[differential calculus]].

In the eighteenth century came the beginnings of the theory of plane algebraic curves, in general. Newton had studied the [[cubic curve]]s, in the general description of the real points into 'ovals'. The statement of [[Bézout's theorem]] showed a number of aspects which were not directly accessible to the geometry of the time, to do with singular points and complex solutions.

Since the nineteenth century there has not been a separate theory of curves, but rather the appearance of curves as the one-dimensional aspect of [[projective geometry]], and [[differential geometry]]; and later [[topology]], when for example the [[Jordan curve theorem]] was understood to lie quite deep, as well as being required in [[complex analysis]]. The era of the [[space-filling curve]]s finally provoked the modern definitions of curve.

=={{anchor|Definitions}} Definition==
[[File:Mandelbrot Components.svg|250px|right|thumb|Boundaries of hyperbolic components of [[Mandelbrot set]] as closed curves]]

In general, a '''curve''' is defined through a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma \colon I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; from an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{mvar|I}} of the [[real number]]s into a [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}}. Depending on the context, it is either &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; or its image &lt;math&gt;\gamma(I)&lt;/math&gt; which is called a curve.

In [[general topology]], when non-[[differentiable function]]s are considered, it is the map &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, which is called a curve, because its image may look very differently from what is commonly called a curve. For example, the image of the [[Peano curve]] completely fills the square. On the other hand, when one considers curves defined by a [[differentiable function]] (or, at least, a [[piecewise differentiable]] function), this is commonly the image of the function which is called a curve.

*The curve is said to be '''simple''', or a '''Jordan arc''', if &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is [[injective]], i.e. if for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\gamma(x) = \gamma(y)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;.   If &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a closed bounded interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt;, we also allow the possibility &lt;math&gt;\gamma(a) = \gamma(b)&lt;/math&gt; (this convention makes it possible to talk about "closed" simple curves, see below). In other words, this curve "does not cross itself and has no missing points".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jordan%20arc |title=Jordan arc definition at Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc |publisher=[[Dictionary.reference.com]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;\gamma(x)=\gamma(y)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x\ne y&lt;/math&gt; (other than the extremities of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;\gamma(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''double''' (or '''multiple''') '''point''' of the curve. This is a special case of a [[singular point of a curve]].
*A curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''closed''' or '''a loop''' if &lt;math&gt;I = [a,
b]&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;\gamma(a) = \gamma(b)&lt;/math&gt;.  A closed curve is thus the image of a continuous mapping of the circle &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;; a '''simple closed curve''' is also called a '''Jordan curve'''. The [[Jordan curve theorem]] states that such curves divide the plane into an "interior" and an "exterior".

{{anchor|Space curve}}
A '''[[plane curve]]''' is a curve for which &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euclidean plane]]&amp;mdash;these are the examples first encountered&amp;mdash;or in some cases the [[projective plane]]. A '''space curve''' is a curve for which &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is of three dimensions, usually [[Euclidean space]]; a '''skew curve''' {{anchor|skew curve}} is a space curve which lies in no plane. These definitions of plane, space and skew curves apply also to [[real algebraic geometry|real algebraic curve]]s, although the above definition of a curve does not apply (a real algebraic curve may be [[connected space|disconnected]]).

This definition of curve captures our intuitive notion of a curve as a connected, continuous geometric figure that is "like" a line, without thickness and drawn without interruption, although it also includes figures that can hardly be called curves in common usage. For example, the image of a curve can cover a [[Square (geometry)|square]] in the plane ([[space-filling curve]]). The image of simple plane curve can have [[Hausdorff dimension]] bigger than one (see [[Koch snowflake]]) and even [[positive number|positive]] [[Lebesgue measure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osgood|first=William F.| authorlink1=William Fogg Osgood |date=January 1903|title=A Jordan Curve of Positive Area|journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|volume=4|issue=1|pages=107–112|doi=10.2307/1986455|issn=0002-9947|jstor=1986455}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-06-04--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (the last example can be obtained by small variation of the [[Peano curve]] construction). The [[dragon curve]] is another unusual example.

Roughly speaking a '''differentiable curve''' is a curve that is defined as being locally the image of an injective [[differentiable function]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma \colon I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; from an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{mvar|I}} of the [[real number]]s into a [[differentiable manifold]] {{mvar|X}}, often &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

More precisely, a differentiable curve is a subset {{mvar|C}} of {{mvar|X}} where every point of {{mvar|C}} has a neighborhood {{mvar|U}} such that &lt;math&gt;C\cap U&lt;/math&gt; is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to an interval of the real numbers. In other words, a differentiable curve is a differentiable manifold of dimension one.

==Length of a curve==
{{main|Arc length}}

If &lt;math&gt; X = \mathbb{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], and if &lt;math&gt; \gamma: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; is an injective and continuously [[differentiable function]], then the '''length''' of &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the quantity
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Length}(\gamma) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ \int_{a}^{b} |\gamma\,'(t)| ~ \mathrm{d}{t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The length of a curve is independent of the [[parametrization]] &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, the length &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; of the [[graph of a function|graph]] of a continuously differentiable function &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt; defined on a closed interval &lt;math&gt; [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
s = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1 + [f'(x)]^{2}} ~ \mathrm{d}{x}.
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]] with metric &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt;, then we can define the length of a curve &lt;math&gt; \gamma: [a,b] \to X &lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Length}(\gamma)
~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~
\sup \!
\left( \left\{
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} d(\gamma(t_{i}),\gamma(t_{i - 1})) ~ \Bigg| ~ n \in \mathbb{N} ~ \text{and} ~ a = t_{0} &lt; t_{1} &lt; \ldots &lt; t_{n} = b
\right\} \right),
&lt;/math&gt;
where the supremum is taken over all &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; and all partitions &lt;math&gt; t_{0} &lt; t_{1} &lt; \ldots &lt; t_{n} &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; [a, b] &lt;/math&gt;.

A '''rectifiable curve''' is a curve with [[wiktionary:finite|finite]] length. A curve &lt;math&gt; \gamma: [a,b] \to X &lt;/math&gt; is called '''natural''' (or '''unit-speed''' or '''parametrized by arc length''') if for any &lt;math&gt; t_{1},t_{2} \in [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; t_{1} \leq t_{2} &lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Length} \! \left( \gamma|_{[t_{1},t_{2}]} \right) = t_{2} - t_{1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \gamma: [a,b] \to X &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz-continuous]] function, then it is automatically rectifiable. Moreover, in this case, one can define the '''speed''' (or [[metric derivative]]) of &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; t \in [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
{\operatorname{Speed}_{\gamma}}(t) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ \limsup_{[a,b] \ni s \to t} \frac{d(\gamma(s),\gamma(t))}{|s - t|}
&lt;/math&gt;
and then show that
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Length}(\gamma) = \int_{a}^{b} {\operatorname{Speed}_{\gamma}}(t) ~ \mathrm{d}{t}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Differential geometry==
{{main|Differential geometry of curves}}
While the first examples of curves that are met are mostly plane curves (that is, in everyday words, ''curved lines'' in ''two-dimensional space''), there are obvious examples such as the [[helix]] which exist naturally in three dimensions. The needs of geometry, and also for example [[classical mechanics]] are to have a notion of curve in space of any number of dimensions. In [[general relativity]], a [[world line]] is a curve in [[spacetime]].

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[differentiable manifold]], then we can define the notion of ''differentiable curve'' in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This general idea is enough to cover many of the applications of curves in mathematics. From a local point of view one can take &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to be [[Euclidean space]]. On the other hand, it is useful to be more general, in that (for example) it is possible to define the [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]]s to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by means of this notion of curve.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth manifold]], a ''smooth curve'' in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth map]]

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \colon I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a basic notion. There are less and more restricted ideas, too. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; manifold (i.e., a manifold whose [[chart (topology)|charts]] are &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; times [[continuously differentiable]]), then a &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; curve in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is such a curve which is only assumed to be &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; times continuously differentiable).  If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an [[manifold|analytic manifold]] (i.e. infinitely differentiable and charts are expressible as [[power series]]), and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an analytic map, then &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is said to be an ''analytic curve''.

A differentiable curve is said to be ''regular'' if its [[derivative]] never vanishes. (In words, a regular curve never slows to a stop or backtracks on itself.)  Two &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; differentiable curves

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_1 \colon I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_2 \colon J \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;

are said to be ''equivalent'' if there is a [[bijection|bijective]] &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; map

:&lt;math&gt;p \colon J \rightarrow I&lt;/math&gt;

such that the [[inverse map]]

:&lt;math&gt;p^{-1} \colon I \rightarrow J&lt;/math&gt;

is also &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{2}(t) = \gamma_{1}(p(t))&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  The map &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''reparametrisation'' of &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt;; and this makes an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of all &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; differentiable curves in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  A &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; ''arc'' is an [[equivalence class]] of &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; curves under the relation of reparametrisation.

==Algebraic curve==
{{main|Algebraic curve}}
Algebraic curves are the curves considered in [[algebraic geometry]]. A plane algebraic curve is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of the points of coordinates ''x'', ''y'' such that ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 0, where ''f'' is a polynomial in two variables defined over some field ''F''. Algebraic geometry normally looks not only on points with coordinates in ''F'' but on all the points with coordinates in an [[algebraically closed field]] ''K''. If ''C'' is a curve defined by a polynomial ''f'' with coefficients in ''F'', the curve is said to be '''defined''' over ''F''. The points of the curve ''C'' with coordinates in a field ''G'' are said to be '''rational''' over ''G'' and can be denoted ''C''(''G'')). When ''G'' is the field of the [[rational number]]s, one simply talks of ''rational points''. For example, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] may be restated as: ''For n'' &gt; 2, ''every rational point of the [[Fermat curve]] of degree n has a zero coordinate''.

Algebraic curves can also be space curves, or curves in a space of higher dimension, say {{math|''n''}}. They are defined as [[algebraic varieties]] of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] one. They may be obtained as the common solutions of at least {{math|''n''–1}} polynomial equations in {{math|''n''}} variables. If {{math|''n''–1}} polynomials are sufficient to define a curve in a space of dimension {{math|''n''}}, the curve is said to be a [[complete intersection]]. By eliminating variables (by any tool of [[elimination theory]]), an algebraic curve may be projected onto a [[plane algebraic curve]], which however may introduce new singularities such as [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]s or [[double point]]s.

A plane curve may also be completed in a curve in the [[projective plane]]: if a curve is defined by a polynomial ''f'' of total degree ''d'', then ''w''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''(''u''/''w'', ''v''/''w'') simplifies to a [[homogeneous polynomial]] ''g''(''u'', ''v'', ''w'') of degree ''d''. The values of ''u'', ''v'', ''w'' such that ''g''(''u'', ''v'', ''w'') = 0 are the homogeneous coordinates of the points of the completion of the curve in the projective plane and the points of the initial curve are those such ''w'' is not zero. An example is the [[Fermat curve]] ''u''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''w''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which has an affine form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. A similar process of homogenization may be defined for curves in higher dimensional spaces

Important examples of algebraic curves are the [[conic]]s, which are nonsingular curves of degree two and [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] zero, and [[elliptic curve]]s, which are nonsingular curves of genus one studied in [[number theory]] and which have important applications to [[cryptography]].  Because algebraic curves in fields of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero are most often studied over the [[complex number]]s, algebraic curves in algebraic geometry may be considered as [[real number|real]] surfaces.  In particular, the nonsingular complex projective algebraic curves are called [[Riemann surface]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3761">'''Edward Stuart Russell''' [[OBE]] [[Fellow of the Linnean Society|FLS]] (25 March 1887 – 24 August 1954) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] biologist and philosopher of biology.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite journal|title=E.

Russell was born near Glasgow. He studied at [[Greenock Academy]] and later at [[Glasgow University]] under Sir [[John Graham Kerr|Graham Kerr]] and worked with [[John Arthur Thomson|J. Arthur Thompson]] after he graduated. He was influenced by his friend [[Patrick Geddes]] and in his zoological studies, sought to find holistic principles. He also believed in [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] heritability. He was involved in fishery research, working on research vessels and publishing on the biology of cephalopods and quantitative methods for gathering fishery data. He also worked as [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Fisheries]] expert, Inspector of Fisheries and as an advisor to [[HM Government]]. He was an honorary lecturer on animal behaviour at the [[University College, London]] for about fifteen years. He was elected President of the Zoology section of the [[British Science Association|British Association]] in 1934. From 1940—42, he served as the President of the [[Linnean Society]]. He died at Hastings, East Sussex, from heart failure at the age of 67.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|title=Fisheries Scientist|date= 27 August 1954|page=8|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sj1AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VlkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3036%2C5705269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education 2030 Agenda''' refers to the global commitment of the [[Education For All|Education for All]] movement to ensure access to basic education for all.  It is an essential part of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The roadmap to achieve the Agenda is the Education 2030 [[Incheon declaration|Incheon Declaration]] and Framework for Action, which outlines how countries, working with [[UNESCO]] and global partners, can translate commitments into action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002472/247234e.pdf|title=Education Transforms Lives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=6, 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education 2030 Agenda stretches from early childhood learning to youth and adult education and training; Emphasizes the acquisition of skills for work; Underlines the importance of citizenship education; Focuses on inclusion, equity and gender equality; And aims to ensure quality learning outcomes for all, throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the main responsibility for implementing the agenda lies with governments, UNESCO and partners provide support through coordinated policy advice, technical assistance, capacity development and monitoring of progress at global, regional and national levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ten targets to achieve the Education 2030 Agenda ==
The 10 targets of [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] 4 encompass many different aspects of education. Seven targets are of expected outcomes and three are means of achieving these targets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.5 Gender equality and inclusion:''' By 2030, eliminate [[Sex differences in education|gender disparities in education]] and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and [[Children in emergencies and conflicts|children in vulnerable situations]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.6 Universal youth and adult literacy:''' By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve [[literacy]] and numeracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.7 Education for sustainable development and global citizenship:''' By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, [[global citizenship]] and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.a Effective learning environments:''' Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.b Scholarships:''' By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programmes, in developed countries and other developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.c Teachers and educators:''' By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An '''emergent organization''' (alternatively '''emergent organisation''') is an [[organization]] that spontaneously [[emergence|emerges]] from and exists in a complex dynamic [[natural environment|environment]] or [[market place]], rather than being a construct or copy of something that already exists. The term first appeared in the late 1990s and was the topic of the Seventh Annual Washington [[Evolutionary Systems]] Conference at [[University of Ghent]], [[Belgium]] in May, 1999. Emergent organizations and their dynamics pose interesting questions; for example, how does such an organization achieve closure and stability?

Alternatively, [[James R. Taylor]] wrote in 2000 his seminal book, ''The Emergent Organization'', where he suggests that all organizations emerge from communication, especially from the interplay of conversation and text. This idea concerns human organizations, but is consistent with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] or [[Gabriel Tarde]]'s [[monadology]], or with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s [[process philosophy]], which explains the macro—both in human and non-human "societies"—from the processes taking place between its constituent parts.

'''Feminist epistemology''' is an examination of the subject matter of [[epistemology]] from a [[feminist]] standpoint. [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]] describes feminist epistemology as being concerned with the way in which [[gender]] influences our concept of knowledge and "practices of inquiry and justification".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Anderson | first = Elizabeth S. | author-link = Elizabeth S. Anderson | contribution = Feminist epistemology and philosophy of science | editor-last = Zalta | editor-first = Edward N. | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta |title = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2004 Edition) | year = 2004 | url = http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/archives/sum2004/entries/feminism-epistemology/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally regarded as falling under the umbrella of [[social epistemology]].

==Overview==
Feminist epistemology emphasizes how important ethical and political values are in shaping epistemic practices, and interpretations of evidence. Feminist epistemology studies how gender influences our understanding of knowledge, justification and theory of knowledge; it describes how knowledge and justification disadvantage women. Scientists of feminist epistemology claim that knowledge discriminate women by: preventing them from inquiry and presenting women as an inferior, because these theories of knowledge satisfy only male interests, which strengthen gender hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"&gt;{{Citation | last = Young | first = I. M. | contribution = Throwing like a girl and other essays in feminist political theory. |title = Bloomington: Indiana University Press  | year = 1990 | url = https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central idea of feminist epistemology is that knowledge reflects the particular perspectives of the theory. The main interest of feminist philosophers is how gender stereotypes situate knowing subjects. They approach this interest from three different perspectives: feminist standpoint theory, feminist postmodernism, and feminist empiricism. Standpoint theory defines a specific social perspective as epistemically privileged. Feminist postmodernism emphasizes the instability of the social identity explorers and therefore their representations. Empiricism focuses on combining the main ideas of feminism and their observations to prove feministic theories through evidence.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

Elizabeth Anderson argues that the concept of [[situated knowledge]] is central to feminist epistemology. [[Donna Haraway]] asserts that most knowledge (in particular academic knowledge) is always situated and "produced by positioned actors working in/between all kinds of locations, working up/on/through all kinds of research relation(ships)" (Cook, ''et al.''),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Cook, 'Positionality/Situated Knowledge'  for David Sibley ''et al.'' (eds)''Critical Concepts in Cultural Geography''. London, IB: Taurus http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/downloads/gesdraftpapers/iancook-situatedknowledge.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925160741/http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/downloads/gesdraftpapers/iancook-situatedknowledge.pdf |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus what is known and the ways in which this knowledge can be known is subject to the position—the situation and perspective—of the knower.

The English feminist philosopher [[Miranda Fricker]] has argued that in addition to social or political injustices, there can be [[epistemic injustice|''epistemic'' injustices]] in two forms: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. ''Testimonial injustice'' consists in prejudices that cause one to "give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957052-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fricker gives the example of a woman who due to her gender is not believed in a business meeting. She may make a good case, but prejudice causes the listeners to believe her arguments to be less competent or sincere and thus less believable. In this kind of case, Fricker argues that as well as there being an injustice caused by possible outcomes (such as the speaker missing a promotion at work), there is a testimonial injustice: "a kind of injustice in which someone is ''wronged specifically in her capacity as a knower''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957052-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''hermeneutical injustice'', "speakers' knowledge claims fall into lacunae in the available conceptual resources, thus blocking their capacity to interpret, and thence to understand or claim a hearing for their experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Code, 2008. [https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23398-epistemic-injustice-power-and-the-ethics-of-knowing/ Review of Epistemic Injustice.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, when the language of '[[sexual harassment]]' or '[[homophobia]]' were not generally available, those who experienced these wrongs lacked the resources to make a claim to being wronged in morally relevant ways.

The philosopher [[Susan Haack]] is a notable critic of feminist epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Haack|authorlink=Susan Haack|title=Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate: Unfashionable Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ezeTXOlQngC |year=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31137-1 |origyear=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lynn Hankinson Nelson|title=The Very Idea of Feminist Epistemology|jstor=3810236|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|number=3|pages=31–49|year=1995|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1995.tb00736.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] organized feminist epistemology into three categories: feminist empiricism, standpoint epistemology, and post-modern epistemology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Doucet, A., &amp; Mauthner, N. (2006). Feminist methodologies and epistemology. ''Handbook of 21st Century Sociology. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage'', 36-45.
&lt;/ref&gt; While potentially a limited set of categories, post-modern feminism was a transitional ideology that denounced absolute objectivity and asserted the death of the meta-narrative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While these three categories of feminist epistemology have their place in history (see [[feminist empiricism]], [[standpoint feminism]], [[postmodern feminism]]), as ideological frameworks they hold epistemic insights in contemporary feminist method. Feminist theorist [[Nina Lykke]], has expanded upon these three categories to include "''postmodern feminist (anti-)epistemology''...[and]...''postconstructionist feminist epistemology''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j7THBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=nina+lykke+feminist+epistemology&amp;lr=|title=Feminist Studies: A Guide to Intersectional Theory, Methodology and Writing|last=Lykke|first=Nina|date=2010-04-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136978982|location=|pages=126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist empiricism ==
Feminist empiricism emerged from a feminist critique that gave attention to male bias in positivistic practices of science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 2nd Wave feminist researchers identified how quantification and objectivity, as facets of positivism, have been held as the “gold standard” for social and political science research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = C. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = R. L. | year = 2010 | title = Feminists really do count: The complexity of feminist methodologies | url = | journal = International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 189–196 | doi = 10.1080/13645579.2010.482249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantification, and its political relationships to notions of objectivity, maintains methodological dominance and preference primarily in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is perpetuated by how funding authorities tend to prioritize quantitative research with positivist frameworks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Feminist empiricists believe in the concept of positivism; that all knowledge can be understood objectively and can be accessed through empirical research.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hesse-Biber, S. N. &amp; Leavy, P. L. (2007). Feminist empiricism: challenging gender bias and “setting the record straight”. In Hesse-Biber, S. N. &amp; Leavy, P. L. ''Feminist research practice'' (pp. 26-52). : SAGE Publications Ltd doi: 10.4135/9781412984270.n2
&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that pre-feminist positivism was actually not objective at all, since traditional positivism’s ‘androcentric bias’ led to only partial or ‘subjective’ knowledge of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In essence, all empirical inquiry is inherently skewed by value judgments and biased interpretation of evidence by male-biased authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, it was not until retrieving statistical data on the prevalence of women in the workplace experiencing (what is now known to be) ‘sexual harassment’ through surveys in the 1970s that sexual harassment became identified by political authorities as a commonality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Without this intervention of feminists in an empirical field, this commonality would never have been identified as an issue, since males had no reason to pursue this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Londa Schiebinger further asserts that empirical research “embodies many core feminist values”, in that feminist empiricists are actively seeking out and eliminating exploitative research whilst resisting strategic, oppressive explanations of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schiebinger | first1 = L | year = 2003 | title = Introduction: Feminism inside the sciences | url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 859–886 | doi=10.1086/345319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist empiricism is critiqued for its belief that “objectivity” is best achieved through quantification, whether or not viewed through a feminist lens or utilized for feminist ideals.  The division between quantitative and qualitative data has historically reinforced gendered dichotomies of “hard/soft, emotional/rational, worthy/worthless”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many assert that ‘objective truth’ is a false concept, and thus feminist empiricists may overestimate the extent to which they can increase objectivity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bart, J. (1998, January 19). Feminist Theories of Knowledge: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Retrieved October, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dean.sbc.edu/bart.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, positivism and quantitative research has been critiqued as a “detached” philosophical framework that inherently objectifies its research subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Feminist empiricists respond to the problem of value-neutrality by lengthening Quine's argument: theory is not determined by evidence. Any observation counts as proof for
particular thesis only if connected with certain background presumptions, because similar observation might support different hypotheses. In daily life, scientists face some restrictions in selecting the background assumptions, that are based on cognitive values like simplicity and conservatism, which a political and social philosophy that is based on retaining traditional social establishments. Feminist empiricists state that no logical or methodological principle categorically prohibits scientists from choosing their background assumptions as their political and social values or other interests. Therefore, feminist scientists may select their background presumptions on account of their opinions on some feminist values.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Two paradoxes ===
There are two central paradoxes with feminist empiricism

'''The paradoxes of bias''' 
The first paradox is that many feminist empiricists advocate for exposing the androcentric and sexist biases in scientific research, namely that people have a bias towards gender difference and sexuality.  However, while feminist empiricists would claim that the feminist inquiry helps the development of science, their own perspective adopts certain bias about gender and science.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

'''The paradox of social construction'''
The second paradox is about many science criticisms expose that the scientific inquiry is influenced by both social and political factors.The theories of androcentric and sexist are influenced by the most society are what they advocate, which can be understood as in order to eliminate the bias, the term like “ individualist epistemology” would be used.  However, they want scientific to be open to different social influences, which the bias of female is also a part of social influence.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

'''Criticism of empiricism theory:''' It is the most criticized theory by others, for its assumptions that transhistorical subject of knowledge exists outside of social determination ([[Sandra Harding|Harding]] 1990). Also feminist empiricism theory states that science will correct all the biases and errors in theories about women and other groups by itself.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

== Standpoint epistemology ==
At a basic level, standpoint epistemology asserts that marginalized groups such as women are bestowed with an “epistemic privilege”, where there exists the potential for less distorted understandings of the world than dominant groups, such as men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This methodology presents many new ideas to the Feminist Empiricist notion that androcentric dominance and bias presents an incomplete understanding of the world.  A “standpoint” is not so much about a subject’s biased perspective, but instead the ‘realities’ that structure social relationships of power.

Standpoint theories portray the universe from a concrete situated perspective. Every standpoint theory must specify: the  social location from the  feminist perspective, the  scope of its privileges, the social role and the identity that generates knowledge and the justification of these privileges. Feminist standpoint theory states a privilege in gender relations, various feminist standpoint theories are based on the statement about the epistemic privilege in different feministic situations. Feminist standpoint theory is one of the types of critical theory, their main intention is to improve their situation. In order to achieve this critical aim, social theories must represent the understanding of feministic problems and try to improve their condition. Critical theory is theory of, by, and for the subjects of study. Feminism and feminist epistemology is all about inquiry, assumptions, and theories. Through these methods feminist epistemology overcomes the tension between bias on which feminist empiricism is based on.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Harding, S. (1996). Borderlands Epistemologies. In A. Ross (ed.), ''Science wars''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press 331-340.  &lt;nowiki&gt;https://femmethodsuwyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/hardingborderlandsepist.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; It presents an elaborate map or method for maximizing “strong objectivity” in natural and social science,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; yet does not necessarily focus on encouraging positivistic scientific practices, like is central to Feminist Empiricism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although standpoint epistemology has been critiqued for focusing too closely on a distinctive women’s perspective which may render invisible concepts of historically and sociologically variable knowledge,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Harding strongly asserts that standpoint epistemology does not essentialize any particular marginalized identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Harding further argues that the methodology does not subscribe to notions of “maximizing neutrality” between groups in an effort to maximize objectivity, but instead recognizes that the power relations between groups are what complicate these relationships.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is in some ways contrary to Doucet’s assertion&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that the controversy of ''how'' power influenced knowledge production is a post-standpoint, more contemporary debate. Standpoint epistemology also poses a necessity to ask critical questions about the lives and social institutions created by dominant groups; where the field becomes a sociology ''for'' women and not solely ''about'' women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In practicality, standpoint theory has widespread use as "a philosophy of knowledge, a philosophy of science, a sociology of knowledge, a moral/political advocacy of the expansion of democratic rights".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although it has been asserted that “epistemic privilege” is inherent to marginalized groups,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harding poses standpoint theory as an explanatory means for both marginalized and dominant group individuals to be able to achieve liberatory perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In building her standpoint epistemology, Sandra Harding used and built on the work of philosophers of science [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Willard Quine]]. Harding's standpoint theory is also grounded in Marxism, although she largely rejected Marxism for it's portrayal of women in merely class terms.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinnick|first=Cassandra L.|date=1994|title=Feminist Epistemology: Implications for Philosophy of Science|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/188340|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=61|issue=4|pages=646–657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn argued that scientific progress does not occur through gradual accumulation of correct ideas. Rather, he believed that there were occasionally large revolutions that completely overturned the previous scientific theories. When a crisis occurs within the prevailing theory of a time, revolutionary scientists will challenge them and build new scientific theories. For example, in his view, the transition from the geocentrism of Ptolemy to the heliocentric theory of Copernicus did not occur through a gradual series of challenges and improvements to the previous model. Rather, it was a sudden and complete revolution because it is impossible to conceptualize the theory of heliocentrism within the dominant geocentric theory. Kuhn argued that together, the ideas of Newton, Galileo, and Kepler completed the revolution that Copernicus started. However, most students of science do not learn of the many failed and alternative scientific paradigms. They are taught a version of the history of science where progress is guaranteed and linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 4th Edition|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=9780226458120|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Harding’s view, Kuhn’s theories showed that all science was situated within its historical context, and that any theory could remain accepted if its believers held power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HARDING|first=SANDRA|date=1992|title=After the Neutrality Ideal: Science, Politics, and "Strong Objectivity"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40970706|journal=Social Research|volume=59|issue=3|pages=567–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of standpoint theory:''' Philosopher [[Helen Longino]] is against standpoint theory, because she claims that standpoint theory can not provide the knowledge of which standpoints have the most privilege. Bar On (1993) said that if feminine ethics of care provides privileged perspective on morality, then our moral knowledge is convinced only by existence of gender relations. Bar On also claims that theory which explains structural relationship between advanced and less developed, which dictates epistemic privilege can not be applied to women. [[Marx]] claimed that class conflict derives other conflicts such as racism, sexism, national and religious conflicts.

Feminist epistemology is criticized by different philosophers. Feminist postmodernists blame feminist empiricists for assuming the existence of an individual and for admitting an uncritical concept of experience. Naturalized Quine epistemology of some feminist empiricists perceives knowers as socially situated; Hundleby, a standpoint theorist, criticizes feminist empiricism for disregarding the key role of women in political activities.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

Standpoint theory is often criticized for the lack of evidence available to support it and the ideas underlying it, such as the lack of justification for the [[underdetermination]] theory Harding uses. Pinnick, to illustrate her point about Harding's poor evidence, points to standpoint theory’s claim that science is more objective if it is politically motivated, which Pinnick claims runs contrary to what has happened in the past when scientists deliberately injected politics into their theories (she cites eugenics and intelligence test designs as examples of politicized science). She also criticizes Harding for claiming that marginalized groups produce better, less biased scientific results because, according to Pinnick, Harding fails to provide any empirical evidence for this idea.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Post-modernism ==
Post-modern thought marks a feminist group shift away from dominant, positivistic ideals of objectivity and universal understanding.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Instead, it acknowledges a diversity of unique human perspectives, none of which can claim absolute knowledge authority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Post-Modern feminism has thus been critiqued for having a relativist-stance, where ongoing power relations between key identities have been often neglected attention.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is possible to see this political stance in direct opposition to the “emancipatory aspirations” of women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, [[Saba Mahmood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahmood | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Feminist Theory, Embodiment, and the Docile Agent: Some Reflections on the Egyptian Islamic Revival | url = | journal = Cultural Anthropology | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 202–236 | doi = 10.1525/can.2001.16.2.202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; would argue this critique is in some ways oppositional to global understandings of female desire, where the idea of ‘freedom’ is an essential, conditionally oppressive component to western feminism which may wrongly assume that women of eastern countries dominated by male power are victims needing to be liberated.

[[Donna Haraway]], a post-modern feminist, shows how post-modern feminism recognizes positivism as an inherently oppressive ideology, where science’s rhetoric of truth was used to undermine marginalized people’s agency and delegitimize ‘embodied’ accounts of truth.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haraway | first1 = D | year = September–October 1988 | title = Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective | url = https://philpapers.org/rec/HARSKT| journal = Feminist Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 575–599 | doi = 10.2307/3178066 | jstor = 3178066 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they argue that ‘objectivity’ is an external, disembodied point of view left only to privileged (unmarked bodies), because marginalized (marked bodies) cannot have perspectives dissociated from ‘who they are’.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Despite post-modern relativist criticism,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this theory resists relativism in firmly recognizing power relations in that objectivity is a privilege of unmarked bodies. Haraway’s theory of “situated knowledges” holds true to post-modern ideology, where knowledge should be placed in context; this creates a more limited range of knowledge than theoretical “objectivity”, but is richer in allowing for exchange of understanding between individual experiences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Positivism inherently gives way to authoritarian positions of knowledge which hinder discussion and render limited understanding of the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both positivist science and relativism have been recognized as contrary to post-modern feminist thought, since both minimize the significance of context (geographic, demographic, power) on knowledge claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = P. H. | year = 1990 | title = Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 221–238 | doi = 10.2307/2074808 | jstor = 2074808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of postmodernism:''' Key features of postmodernism: “Women” not the category of analysis and contains of perspectives which are controversial with feminist theory. The fact that women are in different social position can experience sexism differently, does not mean that they do not suffer from it ([[MacKinnon]] 2000). The postmodernism theory dissolves all groups, and supports the ideas that knowledge from any source is  better than no knowledge at all ([[Susan Bordo|Bordo]] 1990).&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Theory in the flesh ===
Post-modern feminism’s assertion of “situated knowledges”,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; plays well into [[Cherríe Moraga|Cherrie Moraga]]’s piece “Theory in the Flesh”, where the ‘physical realities’ of indigenous peoples’ lives are said to be the means of creating a decolonial politic against oppressive, inaccessible, Eurowestern academic methods of knowledge production.&lt;ref&gt;Moraga, C., &amp; Anzaldúa, G. (1983). Theory in the Flesh. In ''This bridge called my back: Writings by radical women of color''. New York: Kitchen Table, Women of Color Press. 23.
&lt;/ref&gt; This epistemological framework has been utilized by feminists like [[bell hooks]], who claims that theorizing is often tied to a process of self-recovery and collective liberation; it is not thus limited to those in the western academic realm, nor does it require ‘scientific’ research.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Hooks, B. (1994). Theory as a Liberatory Practice. In ''Teaching to transgress: Education as the practice of freedom''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks asserts that theory and practical application of emancipatory politics can, and often do, exist simultaneously and reciprocally.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Post-Modern feminism has given way to the question of whether or not there should be any particular feminist ways of knowing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 'theory in the flesh' seems to suggest that prioritizing or normalizing any specific feminist epistemology would in itself be, and has been, oppressive.

=== Feminist epistemic virtue theory ===
This theory focuses on how power and gender relations behave in terms of value theory and epistemology. [[Susan Bordo|Bordo]]’s (1990) and [[Genevieve Lloyd|Lloyd]]’s (1984) examined how “maleness” and “femaleness” are used in philosophical theories and discussions about relationship such as, reason/unreason, reason/emotion and objectivity/subjectivity. [[Lorraine Code]]’s (1987, 1991, 1995, 1996) with other feminist co-workers determined in which ways political and social routine shapes our identities and perspectives of our world and especially gender, how it leads to understanding of epistemic responsibility. Code’s works also have been influential in epistemological fields, which can be described as version of naturalism takes and reinvents simple and uncontroversial empirical beliefs, for example the belief like “I know that I am seeing a bird”, deforms the epistemic animal nature. Feminist epistemic virtue theorists rejects almost all the assumptions. Skeptical problems can not get any connections with it, so it is ignored and considered as a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref&gt;Feminist Epistemology. (n.d.).

=== Feminist science criticism: bias as error ===
Feminist science criticism mainly has five different kinds of research about gender and science to address five identified biases.  These are studies of how:
* Exclusion or marginalization of women scientists impair scientific progress.
* Applications of science and technology disadvantage women and other vulnerable groups and treat their interests as less important.
* Science has ignored women and gender, and how turning attention to these issues may require revisions of accepted theories.
* Biases toward working with “masculine” cognitive styles (and in some cases even the words related to them) that may — through limiting, partial, or incomplete perspective — lead to errors of omission or unjustified conclusions.
* Research into sex differences that reinforces sex stereotypes and sexist practices fail to live up to standards of good science.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Feminist science: bias as resource ===

Feminist science argues that the inquiry of science which informed by feminist epistemology is based on legalizing and produce the limiting partial bias.
Pluralist feminist scientists and philosophers of science define feminist science as preferred content and “feminine” method.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

The '''Ferrer Colony''' and the associated '''Ferrer Modern School''' was an [[anarchy|anarchist]] [[intentional community]]. It was founded in 1911 in [[Manhattan]] in New York City and in 1915 it moved to [[Piscataway, New Jersey]]. It lasted for more than 40 years before disbanding in 1953.

==History==
The colony was founded in 1911 in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. In 1915 it moved to [[Piscataway, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Followers of Spanish Anarchist Take Over School Site in Jersey.  |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/05/18/105545556.pdf |quote=Three hundred followers of Francisco Ferrer, the anarchist, who was put to death in Barcelona, Spain, on October 9, 1909, dedicated yesterday a Ferrer school ... |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 18, 1915 |accessdate=2009-05-16 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ferrer Modern School]] opened later.

Inhabitants were free to leave or join, with no questions asked. It gained a reputation for being a center of the [[free love]] movement, which drew in new inhabitants.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

The colony purchased farmland for about $100 a plot. The plot was then sold to a community member for $150. By 1922, at their peak, 90 homes had been established. Some of the homes were only lived in during the weekend because people commuted to work in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

During the [[World War II]] the U.S. Government bought the surrounding land, and the buildings that were only occupied sporadically were subject to theft and vandalism.&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite book | author=[[David Wallechinsky]] |date=1975 | title = The Peoples Almanac | publisher = [[Doubleday &amp; Company]]|url=http://www.trivia-library.com/a/attempted-utopias-society-ferrer-colony-and-modern-school-part-2.htm |quote=&lt;!--Because of its anarchist philosophy the Ferrers did nothing to intrude on human relationships, whether those relationships were sanctioned by marriage, or not.

[[File:Scout Girl in Concentration.jpg|thumb|right|Concentrating on a task is one aspect of flow.]]
In [[positive psychology]], '''flow''', also known colloquially as being in '''the zone''', is the [[mental state]] of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time.

Named by [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]] in 1975, the concept has been widely referred to across a variety of fields (and has an especially big recognition in [[occupational therapy]]), though the concept has existed for thousands of years under other names, notably in some [[East Asian religions|Eastern religions]].&lt;ref name="Csikszentmihalyi1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mihaly Csikszentmihályi|title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9KrQgAACAAJ|accessdate=|year=1990|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-016253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow shares many characteristics with [[hyperfocus]].  However, hyperfocus is not always described in a positive light. Some examples include spending "too much" time playing video games or getting side-tracked and pleasurably absorbed by one aspect of an assignment or task to the detriment of the overall assignment. In some cases, hyperfocus can "capture" a person, perhaps causing them to appear unfocused or to start several projects, but complete few.

==Components==
Jeanne Nakamura and Csíkszentmihályi identify the following six factors as encompassing an experience of flow:&lt;ref name="PsychologyProfessor2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nakamura, J.|author2=Csikszentmihályi, M.|editor=C. R. Snyder Erik Wright, and Shane J. Lopez|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Cr5rP8jOnsC|accessdate=20 November 2013|date=20 December 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803094-2|pages=195–206|chapter=Flow Theory and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intense and focused [[Attentional control|concentration]] on [[the present]] moment
# Merging of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[awareness]]
# A loss of [[Self-reflection#Modern_era|reflective]] [[self-consciousness]]
# A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
# A distortion of temporal experience, one's [[sense of time|subjective experience of time]] is altered
# Experience of the activity as intrinsically [[Reward system|rewarding]], also referred to as [[wiktionary:autotelic|autotelic]] experience

Those aspects can appear independently of each other, but only in combination do they constitute a so-called ''flow experience''. Additionally, psychology writer Kendra Cherry has mentioned three other components that Csíkszentmihályi lists as being a part of the flow experience:&lt;ref name="kendracherry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cherry|first1=Kendra|title=What is Flow?|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/PositivePsychology/a/flow.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# "Immediate feedback"&lt;ref name=kendracherry /&gt;
# Feeling that you have the potential to succeed  
# Feeling so engrossed in the experience, that other needs become negligible 
Just as with the conditions listed above, these conditions can be independent of one another.

==Etymology==
Flow is so named because during Csíkszentmihályi's 1975 interviews several people described their "flow" experiences using the metaphor of a water current carrying them along.&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mihály Csíkszentmihályi|title=Beyond boredom and anxiety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ro-gAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 November 2013|year=1975|publisher=Jossey-Bass Publishers|isbn=978-0-7879-5140-5|pages=10-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mihaly Csikszentmihályi and his fellow researchers began researching flow after Csikszentmihályi became fascinated by artists who would essentially get "lost" in their work. Artists, especially painters, got so immersed in their work that they would disregard their need for food, water and even sleep. Thus, the origin of research on the theory of flow came about when Csikszentmihályi tried to understand this phenomenon experienced by these artists. Flow research became prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s, with Csikszentmihályi and his colleagues in Italy still at the forefront. Researchers interested in optimal experiences and emphasizing positive experiences, especially in places such as schools and the business world, also began studying the theory of flow at this time. The theory of flow was greatly used in the theories of [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]] in their development of the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic tradition of psychology]].&lt;ref name="PsychologyProfessor2001"/&gt;

Ideas similar to flow have been recognized throughout history and across cultures. The teachings of Buddhism and of Taoism speak of a state of mind known as the "action of inaction" or "doing without doing" (''[[wu wei]]'' in Taoism) that greatly resembles the idea of flow. Also, [[Hindu]] texts on Advaita philosophy such as Ashtavakra Gita and the Yoga of Knowledge such as Bhagavad-Gita refer to a similar state.

==Mechanism==
In any given moment, there is a great deal of information made available to each individual. Psychologists have found that one's mind can attend to only a certain amount of information at a time. According to Csikszentmihályi's 2004 [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk, that number is about "110 bits of information per second".&lt;ref name="lateralaction.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGuinness|first1=Mark|title=Mihaly Csikszentmihályi – Does Creativity Make You Happy?|url=http://lateralaction.com/articles/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/|website=Lateral Access|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That may seem like a lot of information, but simple daily tasks take quite a lot of information. Just decoding speech takes about 60 bits of information per second.&lt;ref name="lateralaction.com"/&gt; That is why when having a conversation one cannot focus as much [[attention]] on other things.

For the most part (except for basic bodily feelings like hunger and pain, which are innate), people are able to decide what they want to focus their attention on. However, when one is in the flow state, they are completely engrossed with the one task at hand and, without making the conscious decision to do so, lose awareness of all other things: time, people, distractions, and even basic bodily needs. This occurs because all of the attention of the person in the flow state is on the task at hand; there is no more attention to be allocated.&lt;ref name="csi1988"&gt;{{citation |last=Csikszentmihályi |first=M. |editor-last=Csikszentmihályi |editor-first=M. |title= Optimal experience: psychological studies of flow in consciousness |chapter=The flow experience and its significance for human psychology |pages=15–35 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge, UK |year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNt6bdfoyxQC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=The%20flow%20experience%20and%20its%20significance%20for%20human%20psychology&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-521-43809-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flow state has been described by Csikszentmihályi as the "optimal experience" in that one gets to a level of high gratification from the experience.&lt;ref name=harper&amp;row&gt;{{cite web|last1=Csikszentmihályi|first1=Mihály|last2=Harper &amp; Row|title=FLOW: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|url=http://www.psy-flow.com/sites/psy-flow/files/docs/flow.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving this experience is considered to be personal and "depends on the ability" of the individual.&lt;ref name=harper&amp;row /&gt; One's capacity and desire to overcome challenges in order to achieve their ultimate goals not only leads to the optimal experience, but also to a sense of [[life satisfaction]] overall.&lt;ref name=harper&amp;row /&gt;

==Measurement==
There are three common ways to measure flow experiences: the flow questionnaire (FQ), the experience sampling method (ESM), and the "standardized scales of the componential approach".&lt;ref name="moneta2012"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advances in Flow Research|last = Moneta|first = Giovanni|publisher = Springer|year = 2012|isbn = 1461423589|location = New York|pages = |chapter = On the Measurement and Conceptualization of Flow|url = |editor-first = Stefan|editor-last = Engeser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow questionnaire===
The FQ requires individuals to identify definitions of flow and situations in which they believe that they have experienced flow, followed by a section that asks them to evaluate their personal experiences in these flow-inducing situations. The FQ identifies flow as multiple constructs, therefore allowing the results to be used to estimate differences in the likelihood of experiencing flow across a variety of factors. Another strength of the FQ is that it does not assume that everyone's flow experiences are the same. Because of this, the FQ is the ideal measure for estimating the prevalence of flow. However, the FQ has some weaknesses that more recent methods have set out to address. The FQ does not allow for measurement of the intensity of flow during specific activities. This method also does not measure the influence of the ratio of challenge to skill on the flow state.&lt;ref name="moneta2012" /&gt;

===Experience sampling method===
The ESM requires individuals to fill out the experience sampling form (ESF) at eight randomly chosen time intervals throughout the day. The purpose of this is to understand subjective experiences by estimating the time intervals that individuals spend in specific states during everyday life. The ESF is made up of 13 categorical items and 29 scaled items. The purpose of the categorical items is to determine the context and [[Motivation|motivational]] aspects of the current actions (these items include: time, location, companionship/desire for companionship, activity being performed, reason for performing activity). Because these questions are open-ended, the answers need to be coded by researchers. This needs to be done carefully so as to avoid any biases in the statistical analysis. The scaled items are intended to measure the levels of a variety of subjective feelings that the individual may be experiencing. The ESM is more complex than the FQ and contributes to the understanding of how flow plays out in a variety of situations, however the possible biases make it a risky choice.&lt;ref name="moneta2012" /&gt;

===Standardized scales===
Some researchers are not satisfied with the methods mentioned above and have set out to create their own scales. The scales developed by Jackson and Eklund are the most commonly used in research, mainly because they are still consistent with Csíkszentmihályi's definition of flow and consider flow as being both a state and a trait. Jackson and Eklund created two scales that have been proven to be psychometrically valid and reliable: the Flow State Scale-2 (which measures flow as a state) and the Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (designed to measure flow as either a general trait or domain-specific trait). The statistical analysis of the individual results from these scales gives a much more complete understanding of flow than the ESM and the FQ.&lt;ref name="moneta2012" /&gt;

==Conditions==
{{Mental state}}
A flow state can be entered while performing any activity, although it is most likely to occur when one is wholeheartedly performing a task or activity for [[Motivation#Intrinsic motivation|intrinsic purposes]].&lt;ref name="csi1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sl2007"&gt;{{citation |last1=Snyder |first1=C.R. |last2=Lopez |first2=S.J. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Positive psychology: The scientific and practical explorations of human strengths |publisher=Sage Publications |place=London, UK |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive activities like taking a bath or even watching TV usually do not elicit flow experiences as individuals have to actively do something to enter a flow state.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihályi, M., Larson, R., &amp; Prescott, S. (1977). The ecology of adolescent activity and experience. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 6'', 281-294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delle Fave, A., &amp; Bassi, M. (2000). The quality of experience in adolescents' daily lives: Developmental perspectives. ''Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs, 126'', 347-367.&lt;/ref&gt; While the activities that induce flow may vary and be multifaceted, Csikszentmihályi asserts that the experience of flow is similar despite the activity.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihayli, M. (2000). Happiness, flow, and economic equality. "American Psychologist, 55" 1163-1164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow theory postulates three conditions that have to be met to achieve a flow state:
# One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress. This adds direction and structure to the task.&lt;ref name="can2005"&gt;{{citation |last1=Csikszentmihályi |first1=M. |last2=Abuhamdeh |first2=S. |last3=Nakamura |first3=J. |lastauthoramp=yes |editor-last=Elliot |editor-first=A. |title=Handbook of Competence and Motivation |chapter=Flow |pages=598–698 |publisher=The Guilford Press |place=New York |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the person negotiate any changing demands and allows them to adjust their performance to maintain the flow state.&lt;ref name="can2005"/&gt;
# One must have a good balance between the ''perceived'' challenges of the task at hand and their own ''perceived'' skills. One must have confidence in one's ability to complete the task at hand.&lt;ref name="can2005"/&gt;

However, it was argued that the antecedent factors of flow are interrelated, as a perceived balance between challenges and skills requires that one knows what he or she has to do (clear goals) and how successful he or she is in doing it (immediate feedback). Thus, a perceived fit of skills and task demands can be identified as the central precondition of flow experiences.&lt;ref name="Keller2012"&gt;Keller, J., &amp; Landhäußer, A. (2012). The flow model revisited. In S. Engeser (Ed.), ''Advances in flow research'' (pp. 51-64). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Massimini, Csíkszentmihályi and Carli published the 8-channel model of flow shown here.&lt;ref&gt;Massimini, F., Csikszentmihályi, M., &amp; Carli, M. (1987).

(2011). Psychological selection and optimal experience across cultures: Social empowerment through personal growth (Vol. 2). Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; The Experience Fluctuation Model depicts the channels of experience that result from different levels of perceived challenges and perceived skills. This graph illustrates one further aspect of flow: it is more likely to occur when the activity at hand is a higher-than-average challenge (above the center point) and the individual has above-average skills (to the right of the center point).&lt;ref name="csi1988"/&gt; The center of this graph (where the sectors meet) represents one's average levels of challenge and skill across all activities an individual performs during their daily life. The further from the center an experience is, the greater the intensity of that state of being (whether it is flow or anxiety or boredom or relaxation).&lt;ref name="sl2007"/&gt;

Several problems of this model have been discussed in literature.&lt;ref name="Keller2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moneta, G. B. (2012). On the measurement and conceptualization of flow. In S. Engeser (Ed.), ''Advances in flow research'' (pp. 23-50). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; One is that it does not ensure a perceived balance between challenges and skills which is supposed to be the central precondition of flow experiences. Individuals with a low average level of skills and a high average level of challenges (or the other way round) do not necessarily experience a fit between skills and challenges when both are above their individual average.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, G. D., Voelkl, J. E., &amp; Morris, C. (1994). Measurement and analysis issues with explanation of variance in daily experience using the flow model. ''Journal of Leisure Research, 26'', 337.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one study found that low challenge situations which were surpassed by skill were associated with enjoyment, relaxation, and happiness, which, they claim, is contrary to flow theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haworth|first=John|author2=Stephen Evans|title=Challenge, skill and positive subjective states in the daily life of a sample of YTS students.|journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology|date=June 1995|volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=109–121|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8325.1995.tb00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaffer (2013) proposed 7 flow conditions:
#Knowing what to do
#Knowing how to do it
#Knowing how well you are doing
#Knowing where to go (if navigation is involved)
#High perceived challenges
#High perceived skills
#Freedom from distractions&lt;ref name="Schaffer_2013"&gt;{{Citation |first=Owen |last=Schaffer |year=2013 |title=Crafting Fun User Experiences: A Method to Facilitate Flow |publisher=Human Factors International |url=http://humanfactors.com/funexperiences.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaffer also published a measure, the Flow Condition Questionnaire (FCQ), to measure each of these 7 flow conditions for any given task or activity.&lt;ref name="Schaffer_2013"/&gt;

===Challenges to staying===
Some of the challenges to staying in flow include states of apathy, boredom, and anxiety. Being in a state of apathy is characterized when challenges are low and one's skill level is low producing a general lack of interest in the task at hand. Boredom is a slightly different state in that it occurs when challenges are low, but one's skill level exceeds those challenges causing one to seek higher challenges. Lastly, a state of anxiety occurs when challenges are so high that they exceed one's perceived skill level causing one great distress and uneasiness. These states in general differ from being in a state of flow, in that flow occurs when challenges match one's skill level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=Jeanne|author2=Csikszentmihályi|title=The concept of flow|journal=Handbook of Positive Psychology|year=2005|pages=89–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Csíkszentmihályi has said, "If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills."&lt;ref name="kendracherry" /&gt;

===The autotelic personality===
Csíkszentmihályi hypothesized that people with several very specific personality traits may be better able to achieve flow more often than the average person. These personality traits include curiosity, persistence, low self-centeredness, and a high rate of performing activities for intrinsic reasons only. People with most of these personality traits are said to have an ''[[autotelic]] personality''.&lt;ref name="sl2007"/&gt; The term “autotelic” is acquired from two Greek words, ''auto'', meaning self, and ''telos'' meaning goal. Being Autotelic means having a self-contained activity, one that is done not with the expectation of some future benefit, but simply to experience it as the main goal.&lt;ref name="CWilson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meloncelli |first=C Wilson |title=The Autotelic Personality - Finding Happiness in Flow |url=https://www.cwilsonmeloncelli.com/the-autotelic-personality-finding-happiness-in-flow/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, there is not much research on the ''[[autotelic]] personality'', but results of the few studies that have been conducted suggest that indeed some people are more prone to experience flow than others. One researcher (Abuhamdeh, 2000) found that people with an autotelic personality have a greater preference for "high-action-opportunity, high-skills situations that stimulate them and encourage growth" compared to those without an autotelic personality.&lt;ref name="sl2007"/&gt; It is in such high-challenge, high-skills situations that people are most likely to enter the flow state.

Experimental evidence shows that a balance between skills of the individual and demands of the task (compared to boredom and overload) only elicits flow experiences in individuals characterized by an internal [[locus of control]]&lt;ref&gt;Keller, J., &amp; Blomann, F. (2008). Locus of control and the flow experience. An experimental analyses. ''European Journal of Personality, 22'', 589-607.&lt;/ref&gt; or a habitual action orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, J., &amp; Bless, H. (2008). Flow and regulatory compatibility: An experimental approach to flow model of intrinsic motivation. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34'', 196-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Several correlational studies found [[need for achievement]] to be a personal characteristic that fosters flow experiences.&lt;ref name="enge2008"&gt;Engeser, S., &amp; Rheinberg, F. (2008). Flow, performance and moderators of challenge-skill balance. ''Motivation and Emotion, 32'', 158-172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schue2007"&gt;Schüler, J. (2007).

Flow experiences at work: for high need achievers alone? ''Journal of Organizational Behavior, 26'', 755-775.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group==
{{see also|Crowd psychology}}

Group flow is notably different from independent flow as it is inherently mutual.  Group flow is attainable when the performance unit is a group, such as a team or musical group.  When groups cooperate to agree on goals and patterns, social flow, commonly known as group cohesion, is much more likely to occur.  If a group still has not entered flow, a team-level challenge may stimulate the group to harmonize.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, C. J. (2010). Experiencing flow: Is doing it together better than doing it alone?, "The Journal of Positive Psychology, 5," 3-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Applications suggested by Csíkszentmihályi versus other practitioners===
Only Csíkszentmihályi seems to have published suggestions for [[extrinsic]] applications of the flow concept, such as [[design]] methods for playgrounds to elicit the flow experience. Other practitioners of Csíkszentmihályi's flow concept focus on [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] applications, such as [[spirituality]], [[performance improvement]], or [[self-help]]. His work has also informed the measurement of donor momentum by The New Science of Philanthropy.

===Education===
[[File:South-Goodwin.jpg|thumb|250px|Young child, painting a model]]
In [[education]], the concept of [[overlearning]] plays a role in a student's ability to achieve flow. Csíkszentmihályi&lt;ref name="CM1990"&gt;{{Citation |last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály |title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience |publisher=[[Harper and Row]] |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=0-06-092043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that overlearning enables the mind to concentrate on visualizing the desired performance as a singular, integrated action instead of a set of actions. Challenging assignments that (slightly) stretch one's skills lead to flow.&lt;ref name="PP11"&gt;{{citation |last=Snyder |first= C.R. |authorlink=C. R. Snyder |last2=Lopez |first2=Shane J. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Positive Psychology |publisher=Sage Publications, Inc. |year=2007 |chapter=11 |isbn=0-7619-2633-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s British cybernetician Gordon Pask designed an adaptive teaching machine called SAKI, an early example of "e-learning". The machine is discussed in some detail in Stafford Beer's book "Cybernetics and Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Stafford|title=Cybernetics and Management|publisher=The English Universities Press|isbn=978-0340045947}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the patent application for SAKI (1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pask|first1=Gordon|title=US patent 2984017 A: Apparatus for assisting an operator in performing a skill|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2984017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pask's comments (some of which are included below) indicate an awareness of the pedagogical importance of balancing student competence with didactic challenge, which is quite consistent with flow theory:

{{quote|If the operator is receiving data at too slow a rate, he is likely to become bored and attend to other irrelevant data.

If the data given indicates too precisely what responses the operator is required to make, the skill becomes too easy to perform and the operator again tends to become bored.

If the data given is too complicated or is given at too great a rate, the operator is unable to deal with it. He is then liable to become discouraged and lose interest in performing or learning the skill.

Ideally, for an operator to perform a skill efficiently, the data presented to him should always be of sufficient complexity to maintain his interest and maintain a competitive situation, but not so complex as to discourage the operator. Similarly these conditions should obtain at each stage of a learning process if it is to be efficient. A tutor teaching one pupil seeks to maintain just these conditions.}}

Around 2000, it came to the attention of Csíkszentmihályi that the principles and practices of the [[Montessori Method]] of education seemed to purposefully set up continuous flow opportunities and experiences for students. Csíkszentmihályi and psychologist Kevin Rathunde embarked on a multi-year study of student experiences in Montessori settings and traditional educational settings. The research supported observations that students achieved flow experiences more frequently in Montessori settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Rathunde |first1=K. |last2=Csikszetnmihályi |first2=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=American Journal of Education |title=Middle school students' motivation and quality of experience: A comparison of Montessori and traditional school environments |issue=3 |volume=111 |pages=341–371 |year=2005 |doi=10.1086/428885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Rathunde |first1=K. |last2=Csikszentmihályi |first2=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The social context of middle school: Teachers, friends, and activities in Montessori and traditional school environments |journal=Elementary School Journal |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=59–79 |year=2005 |doi=10.1086/496907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Rathunde |first1=K. |last2=Csikszentmihályi |first2=M. |title=The developing person: An experiential perspective |editor1-first=R.M. |editor1-last=Lerner (ed.) |editor2-first=W. |editor2-last=Damon (series ed.) |series=Handbook of Child Psychology |booktitle=Theoretical models of human development |issue=1 |edition=6 |place=New York |publisher=Wiley |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Musicians, especially [[improvisation]]al [[solo (music)|soloists]], may experience a state of flow while playing their instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Parncutt |first1=Richard |last2=McPherson |first2=Gary E. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Science &amp; Psychology of Music Performance: Creative Strategies for Teaching and Learning Book |publisher=Oxford University Press US |page=119 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NCySp2NzAm8C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=improvisation+flow+Cs%C3%ADkszentmih%C3%A1lyi |accessdate=2009-02-07 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-513810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research has shown that performers in a flow state have a heightened quality of performance as opposed to when they are not in a flow state. In a study performed with professional classical pianists who played piano pieces several times to induce a flow state, a significant relationship was found between the flow state of the pianist and the pianist's heart rate, blood pressure, and major facial muscles. As the pianist entered the flow state, heart rate and blood pressure decreased and the major facial muscles relaxed. This study further emphasized that flow is a state of effortless attention. In spite of the effortless attention and overall relaxation of the body, the performance of the pianist during the flow state improved.&lt;ref name="de ManzanoTheorell2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Manzano|first1=Örjan|last2=Theorell|first2=Töres|last3=Harmat|first3=László|last4=Ullén|first4=Fredrik|title=The psychophysiology of flow during piano playing.|journal=Emotion|volume=10|issue=3|year=2010|pages=301–311|issn=1931-1516|doi=10.1037/a0018432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of drummers experience a state of flow when they sense a collective energy that drives the beat, something they refer to as ''getting into the groove'' or [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrainment]]. Likewise drummers and bass guitarists often describe a state of flow when they are feeling the downbeat together as being ''in the pocket.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drummercafe.com/education/articles/in-the-pocket.html|title=In The Pocket|website=www.drummercafe.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
[[File:Concentration.jpg|thumb|left|Flow may occur in challenging sports such as [[eventing]].]]
The concept of ''being in the zone'' during an athletic performance fits within Csíkszentmihályi's description of the flow experience, and theories and applications of ''being in the zone'' and its relationship with athletic competitive advantage are topics studied in the field of [[sport psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Janet A. |last1=Young |first2=Michelle D. |last2=Pain |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Zone: Evidence of a Universal Phenomenon for Athletes Across Sports |work=Athletic Insight |url=http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol1Iss3/Empirical_Zone.htm |accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy Gallwey]]'s influential works on the "inner game" of sports such as [[golf]] and [[tennis]] described the mental coaching and attitudes required to "get in the zone" and fully internalize mastery of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Inner Tennis&amp;nbsp;— Playing the Game |year=1976 |author=Timothy Galwey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Palmer suggests that "being in the zone" may also influence movement patterns as better integration of the conscious and subconscious reflex functions improves coordination. Many athletes describe the effortless nature of their performance while achieving personal bests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Running in the Zone  A Handbook for Seasoned Athletes|last=King|first=Steve|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1412068576|location=Victoria, BC Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/7223/|title=Being in the zone : notions of agency in athletic performance|last=Abigail|first=Locke,|date=2001-02-01|website=eprints.hud.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2015/05/21/stephen-curry-mvp-golden-state-warriors-sports-illustrated-nba-playoffs|title=No one gets hotter faster than the NBA's lights-out MVP|last=Jenkins|first=Lee|website=www.si.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[martial arts]], the term [[Budō]] is used to describe psychological flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henderson|first1=Shihan|title=Finding Your Inner Master – Kigatsuku|url=http://www.i-budo.com/zen-kata/|website=International Budo Institute|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mixed martial arts]] champion and [[Karate]] master [[Lyoto Machida]] uses meditation techniques before fights to attain [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]], a concept that, by his description, is in all respects equal to flow.

The [[Formula One]] driver [[Ayrton Senna]], during qualifying for the [[1988 Monaco Grand Prix]], explained: "I was already on pole, [...] and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car. And suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it by a kind of instinct, only I was in a different dimension. It was like I was in a tunnel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Ayrton Senna at Monaco (1988)|year=2012 |author=Gerald Donaldson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|500 GP]] rider [[Wayne Gardner]] talking about his victory at the [[1990 Australian motorcycle Grand Prix|1990 Australian Grand Prix]] on ''The Unrideables 2'' documentary said: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;During these last five laps I had this sort of above body experience where actually raised up above and I could see myself racing. It was kind of a remote control and it's the weirdest thing I've ever had in my life. [...] After the race [[Mick Doohan|Mick [Doohan]]] and in fact [[Wayne Rainey]] said: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;How the hell did you do that?&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; and I said: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;I have no idea.'&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/92724437#t=1212s|title=The Unrideables 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and spirituality===
Csíkszentmihályi may have been the first to describe this concept in Western [[psychology]], he was most certainly not the first to quantify the concept of flow or develop applications based on the concept.

For millennia, practitioners of [[East Asian religions|Eastern religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and later in [[Sufism]] have honed the discipline of overcoming the duality of self and object as a central feature of spiritual development. Eastern spiritual practitioners have developed a very thorough and holistic set of theories around overcoming duality of self and object, tested and refined through spiritual practice instead of the systematic rigor and controls of modern science.

Csíkszentmihályi's flow concept relates to the idea of being at one with things or as psychology expert, Kendra Cherry, describes it: "complete immersion in an activity".&lt;ref name="kendracherry" /&gt; Practitioners of the varied schools of [[Zen Buddhism]] apply concepts similar to flow to aid their mastery of [[art]] forms, including, in the case of Japanese Zen Buddhism, [[Aikido]], [[Cheng Hsin]], [[Judo]],  [[Honkyoku]], [[Kendo]] and [[Ikebana]]. In [[Yoga|yogic]] traditions such as [[Raja Yoga]], reference is made to a state of ''flow''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yoga Sutras 3.9-3.16: Witnessing Subtle Transitions with Samyama |url=http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-30916.htm|publisher=Swamij.com|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the practice of [[Samyama]], a psychological absorption in the object of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink=J. Nigro Sansonese |last=Sansonese |first=J. Nigro |title=The Body of Myth: Mythology, Shamanic Trance, and the Sacred Geography of the Body |page=26 |year=1994 |publisher=Inner Traditions |isbn=978-0-89281-409-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUZBqTKTAfIC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=samyama+japan+koan |accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theravada Buddhism]] refers to "access concentration", which is a state of flow achieved through meditation and used to further strengthen concentration into [[jhana]], and/or to develop [[vipassana|insight]].

In [[Sufi]] [[Islam]], the first mental state that precedes human action is known as jila al-khatir, which roughly translates to 'cleansing the heart'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Jilani|first1=Shaikh ‘Abd Al-Qadir|title=Purification of the Mind|url=http://www.quranicstudies.com/books/purification-of-the-mind/|website=Quranic Studies|publisher=Luna Plena|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}

===Games and Gaming===

Flow in [[game]]s and gaming has been linked to the [[Laws of learning|Laws of Learning]] as part of the explanation for why learning-games (the use of games to introduce material, improve understanding, or increase retention) have the potential to be effective.&lt;ref name="WhyGamesWorkAndTheScienceOfLearning"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Curtiss |title=Why Games Work and the Science of Learning |url=http://www.goodgamesbydesign.com/?p=59 |accessdate=2011-07-25 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, flow is intrinsically motivating, which is part of the Law of [[Laws of learning|Readiness]]. The condition of feedback, required for flow, is associated with the feedback aspects of the Law of [[Laws of learning|Exercise]]. This is exhibited in well designed games, in particular, where players perform at the edge of their competency as they are guided by clear goals and feedback.&lt;ref name="Drpamelarutledge"/&gt; The positive emotions associated with flow are associated with the Law of [[Laws of learning|Effect]]. The intense experiences of being in a state of flow are directly associated with the Law of [[Laws of learning|Intensity]]. Thus, the experience of gaming can be so engaging and motivating as it meets many of the Laws of Learning, which are inextricably connected to creating flow.

In games often much can be achieved thematically through an imbalance between challenge level and skill level.  Horror games often keep challenges significantly above the player's level of competency in order to foster a continuous feeling of anxiety.  Conversely, so called "relaxation games" keep the level of challenges significantly below the player's competency level, in order to achieve a similar but opposite effect.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The video game [[Flow (video game)|Flow]] was designed as part of [[Jenova Chen]]'s master's thesis for exploring the design decisions that allow players to achieve the flow state, by adjusting the difficulty dynamically during play.&lt;ref name="JSint"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Ross |title=Joystiq interview: Jenova Chen |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/18/joystiq-qanda-jenova-chen/ |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=2011-01-05 |date=2006-09-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102012220/http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/18/joystiq-qanda-jenova-chen/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It improves performance; calling the phenomenon "TV trance", a 1981 ''[[BYTE]]'' article discussed how "the best seem to enter a trance where they play but don't pay attention to the details of the game".&lt;ref name="smith198112"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n279/mode/2up | title=The Game of Left/Right | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=29 January 2015 | author=Smith, Truck | pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of games is to create entertainment through [[Motivation#Intrinsic motivation|intrinsic motivation]], which is related to flow; that is, without intrinsic motivation it is virtually impossible to establish flow.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;Paul Benjamin Lowry, James Gaskin, Nathan W. Twyman, Bryan Hammer, and Tom L. Roberts (2013). "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2177442 Taking 'fun and games' seriously: Proposing the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM)]," Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS), vol. 14(11), 617–671.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the balance of skill and challenge the player's brain is aroused, with attention engaged and motivation high.&lt;ref name="Drpamelarutledge"&gt;{{cite web|last=Drpamelarutledge|title=The Positive Side of Video Games: Part III|url=http://en.paperblog.com/the-positive-side-of-video-games-part-iii-294723/|publisher=paper blog|accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the use of flow in games helps foster an enjoyable experience which in turn increases motivation and draws players to continue playing. As such, game designers strive to integrate flow principles into their projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=J. |title=Flow in Games |url=http://www.jenovachen.com/flowingames/introduction.htm |accessdate=2008-05-16 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the experience of play is fluid and is intrinsically psychologically rewarding independent of scores or in-game successes in the flow state.&lt;ref name="Drpamelarutledge"/&gt;

===Design of intrinsically motivated computer systems===
A simplified modification to flow has been combined with the [[technology acceptance model]] (TAM) to help guide the design of and explain the adoption of intrinsically motivated computer systems. This model, the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) is model to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt; HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamification. Instead of a minor, TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based concept of cognitive absorption (CA). The HMSAM further builds on van der Heijden's (2004) model of hedonic system adoption&lt;ref&gt;Hans Van der Heijden (2004) User Acceptance of Hedonic Information Systems, MIS Quarterly, vol. 28(4), pp. 695-704&lt;/ref&gt; by including CA as a key mediator of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and of behavioral intentions to use (BIU) hedonic-motivation systems. Typically, models simplistically represent "intrinsic motivations" by mere perceived enjoyed. Instead, HMSAM uses the more complex, rich construct of CA, which includes joy, control, curiosity, focused immersion, and temporal dissociation. CA is construct that is grounded in the seminal flow literature, yet CA has traditionally been used as a static construct, as if all five of its subconstructs occur at the same time—in direct contradiction to the flow literature. Thus, part of HMSAM's contribution is to return CA closer to its flow roots by re-ordering these CA subconstructs into more natural process-variance order as predicted by flow. Empirical data collection along with mediation tests further support this modeling approach.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; when developing in an undistracted state. Stock market operators often use the term "in the pipe" to describe the psychological state of flow when trading during high volume days and market corrections. Professional [[poker]] players use the term "playing the A-game" when referring to the state of highest concentration and strategical awareness, while [[pool (cue sports)|pool]] players often call the state being in "dead stroke".

===In the workplace===
Conditions of flow, defined as a state in which challenges and skills are equally matched, play an extremely important role in the workplace. Because flow is associated with achievement, its development could have concrete implications in increasing workplace satisfaction and accomplishment. Flow researchers, such as Csikszentmihályi, believe that certain interventions may be performed to enhance and increase flow in the workplace, through which people would gain 'intrinsic rewards that encourage persistence" and provide benefits. In his consultation work, Csikszentmihályi emphasizes finding activities and environments that are conducive to flow, and then identifying and developing personal characteristics to increase experiences of flow. Applying these methods in the workplace, can improve morale by fostering a sense of greater happiness and accomplishment, which may be correlated with increased performance. In his review of Mihály Csikszentmihályi's book "Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning," Coert Visser introduces the ideas presented by Csikszentmihályi, including  "good work" in which one "enjoys doing your best while at the same time contributing to something beyond yourself."&lt;ref name="Visser_2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Visser|first=Coert|title=Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning|url=http://articlescoertvisser.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-business-leadership-flow-and.html|accessdate=26 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110043540/http://articlescoertvisser.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-business-leadership-flow-and.html|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then provides tools by which managers and employees can create an atmosphere that encourages good work. Some consultants suggest that the experience sampling form (EMS) method be used for individuals and teams in the workplace in order to identify how time is currently being spent, and where focus should be redirected to in order to increase flow experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Positive Psychology Principles Applied to Consulting Psychology at the Individual and Group Level|last = Foster|first = Sandra|date = 2007|journal = Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Lloyd|first2 = Paul|pages = 30–40|volume = 59|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to achieve flow, Csikszentmihályi lays out the following three conditions:
# Goals are clear
# Feedback is immediate
# A balance between opportunity and capacity

Csikszentmihályi argues that with increased experiences of flow, people experience "growth towards complexity". People flourish as their achievements grow and with that comes development of increasing "emotional, cognitive, and social complexity."&lt;ref name="Visser_2007"/&gt; Creating a workplace atmosphere that allows for flow and growth, Csikszentmihályi argues, can increase the happiness and achievement of employees. An increasingly popular way of promoting greater flow in the workplace is using [[Serious Play]] facilitation methods. Some commercial organisations have used the concept of flow in building corporate branding and identity for example [[The Floow Limited]] which created its company brand from the concept.

===Barriers===
There are, however, barriers to achieving flow in the workplace. In his chapter "Why Flow Doesn't Happen on the Job," Csikszentmihályi argues the first reason that flow does not occur is that the goals of one's job are not clear. He explains that while some tasks at work may fit into a larger, organization plan, the individual worker may not see where their individual task fits it. Second, limited feedback about one's work can reduce motivation and leaves the employee unaware of whether or not they did a good job.  When there is little communication of feedback, an employee may not be assigned tasks that challenge them or seem important, which could potentially prevent an opportunity for flow.

In the study "Predicting flow at work: Investigating the activities and job characteristics that predict flow states at work", Karina Nielsen and Bryan Cleal used a 9- item flow scale to examine predictors of flow at two levels: activity level (such as brainstorming, problem solving, and evaluation) and at a more stable level (such as role clarity, influence, and cognitive demands). They found that activities such as planning, problem solving, and evaluation predicted transient flow states, but that more stable job characteristics were not found to predict flow at work. This study can help us identify which task at work can be cultivated and emphasized in order to help employees experience flow on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Karina |last1=Nielsen |first2=Bryan |last2=Cleal|title=Predicting flow at work: investigating the activities and job characteristics that predict flow states at work|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date=April 2010|volume=15|issue=2|pages=180–90|doi=10.1037/a0018893|pmid=20364915}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her article in ''Positive Psychology News Daily'', Kathryn Britton examines the importance of experiencing flow in the workplace beyond the individual benefits it creates. She writes, "Flow isn't just valuable to individuals; it also contributes to organizational goals. For example, frequent experiences of flow at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development (Csikszentmihályi, 1991, 2004). So finding ways to increase the frequency of flow experiences can be one way for people to work together to increase the effectiveness of their workplaces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Britton|first=Kathryn|title=Flowing Together|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/kathryn-britton/200809071013|work=Positive Psychology News Daily|date=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

===Positive experiences===
Books by Csikszentmihályi suggest that enhancing the time spent in flow makes our lives more happy and successful. Flow experiences are predicated to lead to positive affect as well as to better performance.&lt;ref name="CM1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csik1990"&gt;Csikszentmihályi, M. (1997). ''Finding flow. The psychology of engagement with everyday life.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, delinquent behavior was reduced in adolescents after two years of enhancing flow through activities.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, J., &amp; Csikszentmihályi, M. (year). The concept of flow. In Handbook of positive psychology (89-105).  New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

People who have experienced flow, describe the following feelings:
# Completely involved in what we are doing - focused, concentrated.
# A sense of ecstasy - of being outside everyday reality.
# Great inner clarity - knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing.
# Knowing that the activity is doable - that our skills are adequate to the task.
# A sense of serenity - no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego.
# Timelessness - thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by the minute.
# Intrinsic motivation - whatever produces flow becomes it own reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|title=Flow, the secret to happiness|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow#t-883527|language=en|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, further empirical evidence is required to substantiate these preliminary indications, as flow researchers continue to explore the problem of how to directly investigate causal consequences of flow experiences using modern scientific instrumentation to observe the neuro-physiological correlates of the flow state.&lt;ref name="land2012"&gt;Landhäußer, A., &amp; Keller, J. (2012). Flow and its affective, cognitive, and performance-related consequences. In S. Engeser (Ed.), ''Advances in flow research'' (pp.65-86). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Positive affect and life satisfaction====
Flow is an innately positive experience; it is known to "produce intense feelings of enjoyment".&lt;ref name="csi1988"/&gt;  An experience that is so enjoyable should lead to positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[happiness]] in the long run. Also, Csikszentmihályi stated that happiness is derived from personal development and growth&amp;nbsp;– and flow situations permit the experience of personal development.&lt;ref name="csik1990"/&gt;

Several studies found that flow experiences and positive affect go hand in hand,&lt;ref name="schue2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberg, F., Manig, Y., Kliegl, R., Engeser, S., &amp; Vollmeyer, R. (2007). Flow bei der Arbeit, doch Glück in der Freizeit. Zielausrichtung, Flow und Glücksgefühle [Flow during work but happiness during leisure time: goals, flow-experience, and happiness]. ''Zeitschrift für Arbeits- und Organisationspsychologie, 51'', 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt; and that challenges and skills above the individual's average foster positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, S. G., &amp; Haworth, J. T. (1994). "Flow" experience in the daily lives of sixth-form college students. ''British Journal of Psychology, 85'', 511-523.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massimini, F., &amp; Carli, M. (1988). The systematic  assessment of flow in daily experience. In M. Csikszentmihályi &amp; I. S. Csikszentmihályi (Eds.), ''Optimal experience: Psychological studies of flow in consciousness'' (pp. 288-306). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shernoff, D. J., Csikszentmihályi, M., Schneider, B., &amp; Shernoff, E. S. (2003). Student engagement in High School classrooms from the perspective of flow theory. ''School Psychology Quarterly, 18'', 158-176.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the causal processes underlying those relationships remains unclear at present.

====Performance and learning====
Flow experiences imply a growth principle. When one is in a flow state, he or she is working to master the activity at hand. To maintain that flow state, one must seek increasingly greater challenges. Attempting these new, difficult challenges stretches one's skills. One emerges from such a flow experience with a bit of personal growth and great "feelings of competence and efficacy".&lt;ref name="can2005"/&gt; By increasing time spent in flow, intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning also increases.&lt;ref&gt;Hektner, J.M. &amp; Csikszentmihályi, M. (1996). A longitudinal exploration of flow an intrinsic motivation in adolescents. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American education research association, New York. Alfred Sloan Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow has a documented correlation with high performance in the fields of artistic and scientific creativity,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; teaching,&lt;ref&gt;Csíkszentmihályi, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; learning,&lt;ref&gt;Csíkszentmihályi et al., 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and sports;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Thomas, Marsh, &amp; Smethurst, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Kimiecik, Daniels, &amp; Jackson, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow has been linked to persistence and achievement in activities while also helping to lower anxiety during various activities and raise self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, J., &amp; Csikszentmihályi, M. (2014). The concept of flow. "Handbook of positive psychology," 89-105.  New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, evidence regarding better performance in flow situations is mixed.&lt;ref name="land2012"/&gt; For sure, the association between the two is a reciprocal one. That is, flow experiences may foster better performance but, on the other hand, good performance makes flow experiences more likely. Results of a longitudinal study in the academic context indicate that the causal effect of flow on performance is only of small magnitude and the strong relationship between the two is driven by an effect of performance on flow.&lt;ref name="enge2008"/&gt;
In the long run, flow experiences in a specific activity may lead to higher performance in that activity as flow is positively correlated with a higher subsequent motivation to perform and to perform well.&lt;ref name="can2005"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Csikszentmihályi writes about the dangers of flow himself: &lt;blockquote&gt;...enjoyable activities that produce flow have a potentially negative effect: while they are capable of improving the quality of existence by creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at which point the self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and is then unwilling to cope with the ambiguities of life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Further, he writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The flow experience, like everything else, is not "good" in an absolute sense. It is good only in that it has the potential to make life more rich, intense, and meaningful; it is good because it increases the strengths and complexity of the self. But whether the consequence of any particular instance of flow is good in a larger sense needs to be discussed and evaluated in terms of more inclusive social criteria.&lt;ref name="Csikszentmihályi2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mihály Csikszentmihályi |title=Flow: The Psychology of Happiness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qLWNQAACAAJ |accessdate=25 October 2015 |year=1992 |publisher=Rider |isbn=0-7126-5477-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Fuzion''''' is a [[generic role-playing game system]] created by the collaboration of [[R. Talsorian Games]] and [[Hero Games]]. The rights to Fuzion are jointly held by [[Mike Pondsmith]] of R. Talsorian Games, along with [[Steve Peterson (game designer)|Steve Peterson]] and [[Ray Greer]] of Hero Games.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|150}} ''Fuzion'' is a combination of the [[Interlock System]], (used in games like ''[[Mekton]]'' and ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]''), and the [[Hero System|HERO]] system (used in ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'', ''[[Justice, Inc. (role-playing game)|Justice, Inc.]]'', ''[[Star Hero]]'', etc.). ''Fuzion'' is an adaptable system which can be played in any genre and setting imaginable.

''Fuzion'' is noted for its [[anime]]-genre support, customizable rules flexibility, and being one of the first generic game systems to be released for free over the [[internet]]. It is one of the first games to readily allow licensing, albeit not the "hands-off" licensing offered by the [[Open Gaming License]] (OGL) that came about some years later. A modified OGL set of rules based on ''Fuzion'' is published by Gold Rush Games as the ''Action! System''.

There are two versions of ''Fuzion'' that have been published: the simplified '''''Instant Fuzion''''', and more detailed '''''Total Fuzion''''' (also known as ''Primary Fuzion''). A third, '''''Maximum Fuzion''''', was hinted at in ''Fuzion''-based ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'' RPG, but has never been published.

==Making ''Fuzion'' characters==
''Fuzion'' uses a point-based creation method for building characters. This system is similar to both of the parent systems as well as other generic games like ''[[GURPS]]''.

===Character Points===
''Fuzion'' characters are built with ''Character Points (CPs)'', also known as Stat Points. Depending on the "power level" of the game, the Referee (or [[Game Master]]), assigns players a number of CPs to buy Attribute Stats. Usually, 40 to 50 points are enough for a heroic "action-adventure" setting.  Fewer points would be given for low-power games set in a more realistic, "mundane" world. A hundred (or more) points are given for high-powered, superheroic adventures. CPs are used to buy levels in ''Primary Stats'' which are the basic attribute abilities of the character.

===Option Points and Power Points===
''Option Points (OPs)'', or Campaign Points, are given to characters to buy Character Options. OPs are assigned by the Referee and are usually kept separate from the Character Point pool. The Referee usually gives a pool of as many OPs as he gives CPs. At the player's choice, any leftover CPs not used to buy Stats can be traded for OPs at a ratio of 1:5, (1 CP = 5 OP) and vice versa. OPs can also be converted into money to buy Equipment at a ratio of 1:100; (1 OP = 100 units of currency). The actual type of currency is dependent upon the genre being played, (for instance a fantasy medieval-era game may use gold pieces, a modern action game set in the United States would use dollars, a sci-fi future setting may use galactic credits).

Certain campaigns using the ''Fuzion'' system can have ''Power Points (PPs)'', which are assigned to the players by the Referee just like CPs and OPs. PPs are optional and are used with Magic, Psionics, and Super Powers. CPs can be traded for PPs at a ratio of 1:1, (1 CP = 1 PP), and OPs can be traded as well, at a ratio of 5:1, (5 OP = 1 PP). Using PPs helps the Referee keep superpowers under control by restricting how often a character can use them.

===Primary Stats===

In ''Total Fuzion'', a character usually has ten ''Stats'', (or Characteristics), organized in four groups as follows:

'''Physical Group:'''
*Constitution (CON)
*Strength (STR)
*Body (BODY)
'''Mental Group:'''
*Intelligence (INT)
*Willpower (WILL)
*Presence (PRE) (or Personality (PER), or Cool (COOL)&lt;ref&gt;Cyberpunk V.3 Rulebook&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Combat Group:'''
*Technique (TECH)
*Reflexes (REF)
*Dexterity (DEX)
'''Movement Group:'''
*Movement (MOVE)

In the slimmed down ''Instant Fuzion'' rules, the character has only four main Stats based on each of the four Stat groups: Physical, Mental, Combat, and Movement.

Character Points are used to buy levels in a Stat at a ratio of 1:1; 1 CP buys 1 level of a Stat. For the average "competent" human, each Stat has a level of 3 or 4, while 1 and 2 represent mundane abilities. Stats of 5 and 6 are considered "heroic"; 7 and 8, are "legendary"; 9 and above are "superhuman".

''Fuzion'' is a flexible and easily modifiable system, so more Stats can be added to any category by the Referee as they see fit. For instance, in a magical world, the Referee could add a Mana Stat for the casting and control magic spells, or add a Comeliness Stat, which rates the physical attractiveness of a character.  Likewise, Stats can be removed without too much difficulty. If the Referee feels there is no real difference between Dexterity and Reflexes, they could remove one or the other, and use a single Stat for both.

===Derived Stats===
''Fuzion'' characters have numerous ''Derived Stats'', which get their values based on the level of a primary Stat and performing a mathematical formula to calculate a number. For instance, a character gets [[Hit Points]] (called ''Hits''), and Stun Points (called ''Stun''), by taking their Body Stat and multiplying it by 5. Therefore, a character with a Body Stat of 5 would have 25 Hits and 25 Stun. Derived Stats do not cost points to purchase. Depending on the genre, the Referee can choose what Derived Stats he wants in his campaign. Some are required, like Hits, Stun, and Recovery, but others, like Luck and Humanity, are optional. Characters can also trade up to 1/2 of their Stun points for more Hits if they so desire.

In ''Instant Fuzion'', a character has two Derived Stats: Hits and Defense.

===Skills===
''Fuzion'' characters have [[skill (role-playing)|Skill]]s that represent specific areas of knowledge that are useful in the game. Skills are purchased with Option Points at a ratio of 1:1, (1 OP = 1 level of a Skill). ''Fuzion'' has a large array of Skills to choose from. Referees and players can also make up their own skills as needed. Skills are organized by type:

*'''Fighting Skills''' are used mainly in combat situations for evading attacks and using hand held weapons. They may also be used for Martial Arts and unarmed combat. Usually a character focuses on a particular type of weapon, such as Sword, Mace, Dagger and Hand-to-Hand.
*'''Ranged Fighting Skills''' are used for handling ranged weapons such as guns and bows. Usually they are focused on a particular type of ranged weapon, such as Crossbow, Shotgun and Rocket Launcher.
*'''Awareness Skills''' are such skills as Perception, Search, Tracking and Lip Reading
*'''Control Skills''' are used for operating vehicles and handling animals. Usually they are focused on a type of vehicle, such as Automobile driving or Helicopter piloting.
*'''Physical or Body Skills''' are such skills as Acrobatics, Climbing, and Stealth.
*'''Social Skills''' are such skills as Bribery, Interrogation and Etiquette.
*'''Technical or Technique Skills''' are complex skills such as Surgery, First Aid, Demolitions and Lockpicking.
*'''Performance Skills''' are such as Acting, Singing, Painting and playing a specific kind of musical instrument.
*'''Knowledge Skills''' represent complex areas of specialized education, such as Criminal Law, Forensics, Chemistry, Engineering, and Foreign Language.

For free, a starting character gets a set of ''Everyman Skills'' that are picked by the Referee as appropriate to the campaign. Everyman Skills include 2 points each in such Skills as Education (which includes all basic knowledge a character learns through years of schooling like basic mathematics and reading for example), and other skills, like Evasion, Hand-to-Hand, Local Area Knowledge and Perception.  For a modern or futuristic campaign, Driving and Computer Use may also be common Everyman skills. At the Referee's discretion, the Education skill can be used as a catch-all for when a character faces a challenge in a skill they do not possess; they can "wing it" by adding their Education skill bonus to the die roll.

===Character options===
Character options come in the form of Talents, Complications, Perks, Lifepaths, and Templates.

''Talents'' represent special innate abilities of a character that cannot be taken away from them, or used by another character. They represent certain areas of special training, or inherited abilities that are not covered by Skills. In a way, they are similar to Advantages in ''[[GURPS]]'', or Feats in a ''[[d20 System]]'' game, and offer benefits to the character. Talents cost 3 Option Points each. Some Talents include: Combat Sense, Lightning Calculator, Photographic Memory, Light Sleeper, Speed Reading, and Ambidexterity.

''Complications'' represent special hindrances to the character. They are similar to Disadvantages in ''[[GURPS]]''. Complications are a way to gain back OPs to spend elsewhere.  Each Complication returns a number of points based on the hindrance they give the character, and how often they crop up in the game. A permanent Complication, such as Missing Limb, is always a problem for a character and returns many points. Others, like Enemy or Dependent, may crop up occasionally during a game and offer less points back. Some other Complications include: Bad Tempered, Sense of Duty, Stubbornness, Dependents, Phobias, Bad Reputation, Poverty, and Addiction.

''Perks'' are similar to Talents, but are not innate to the character. They can be lost or taken away by actions in the game. They usually include Special Equipment, Security Clearances, Licenses, Permits, and Contacts (who a character can use to gain information or call in favors from).

''Lifepaths'' are an optional way to randomly generate character backgrounds and personalities through a series of tables. A character rolls on a list of options, or they can pick and chose them as they see fit. Some Lifepath choices could give a character a special Talent, Complication, or Perk for free.

''Templates'' are featured in certain ''Fuzion'' campaigns, which can be chosen by players to help design a well rounded character suited for a specific career, (such as police officer, soldier, doctor, etc.). Templates explain things about the character's job, and give a listing of particular Skills, Talents, Complications, Perks and starting equipment.

==''Fuzion'' game mechanics==
In ''Fuzion'', whenever a character performs some kind of critical action that needs to be resolved, they make a die roll to see if they succeed or fail at the task. There are two kinds of resolution tests in ''Fuzion''; those rolled against a ''Difficulty Value (DV)'' determined by the Referee, and those rolled against another character. DVs range from "very easy", such as hefting a bag of garbage to the street (DV 2), to "cosmic", like hefting a mountain and throwing it into an ocean (DV 100+). When resolving a contest between characters, the DV of the check is the result of the opposing force's roll or, to save time, the Referee could add a set number, "+X", to an NPC's abilities (typically +10 when using 3d6 or +5 using 1d10).

Regardless of what the character is rolling against, the player has to roll the target number or higher on the dice to succeed. This the opposite of ''Fuzion's'' parent, the HERO System (which is similar to the GURPS mechanic), where the roll must be equal to, or less than the target number to succeed.

===Resolving actions===
Under standard rules, ''Fuzion'' offers two ways to resolve actions with dice. A Referee can pick either using three six-sided dice (3d6), like the HERO System, or one ten-sided die (d10), like the Interlock System used in ''Cyberpunk'' and ''Mekton''. Using 3d6 for checks subjects it to the more predictable "[[Normal distribution|bell curve]]" and has a higher probability of success. Using a d10 is more unpredictable and adds a level of uncertainty and suspense. When using d10, the DV values are set lower than when using 3d6.

Another aspect of ''Fuzion''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s flexibility is the easy adaptation to the use of d12 or d20 dice for making checks. Consult the table below for variations of the Difficulty Values by die type:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:0.5em auto"
|-
! Difficulty Value
! 1d10 Resolution (+5)
! 3d6 or 1d20 Resolution (+10)
! +1d6-1d6 or +1d10-1d10 (+0)
! +1d12 (6)
|-
! Challenged (DV 0)
| 5
| 10
| 0
| 6
|-
! Everyday (DV 4)
| 9
| 14
| 4
| 10
|-
! Competent (DV 8)
| 13
| 18
| 8
| 14
|-
! Heroic (DV 12)
| 17
| 22
| 12
| 18
|-
! Incredible (DV 16)
| 21
| 26
| 16
| 22
|-
! Legendary (DV 20)
| 25
| 30
| 20
| 26
|}

The resolution formula is: ''Stat + Skill + Die Roll vs. Difficulty Value (DV)''.  When an action is opposed by another character or two characters are competing to complete the same action, the formula becomes ''Stat + Skill + Die Roll vs. Stat + Skill + (Die Roll or +X)''.  Combat resolution is similar to an opposed skill check.  If a character's Stat + Skill already meets or exceeds the DV, it is usually considered an automatic success without making a die roll.

There is also the optional rule of ''Critical Successes'' and ''Critical Failures''. If using a d10, rolling a 10 is a Critical Success, and allows a second roll. The result of the second roll is added to the first to calculate the result. Further 10's may be rerolled. A roll of 1 is an critical failure and you subtract 1d10 from your total. When using 3d6; a roll of all sixes, (an 18), is a Critical Success, and two additional dice can be rolled and added to the result. A roll of three ones, (a 3), is a Critical Failure, (even if all you only needed to roll was a 3 to succeed the check), and subtract 2d6 from the total. A Critical Failure may represent something more disastrous happening to the character as the Referee sees fit. A Critical Failure on a Lockpicking task, for example, could trigger a silent alarm the character wasn't aware of.

===Combat actions===
''Fuzion'' uses rounds, (called ''Phases''), to time actions taken in combat. A typical Phase in ''Fuzion'' represents 3 seconds of real time, and 20 Phases = 1 minute.

During a Phase, a character can perform one of several ''Basic Actions'', such as Attack, Block (Parry), or Move.

''Advanced Actions'' usually take more time and additional phases to perform, like casting a spell, or performing another complex task.

''Free Actions'' take such little time that can be performed immediately and do not use up time, such as dropping an item, standing up, or calling to an ally. The character in a party with the highest Reflexes stat acts first, or they can hold the action and wait to see what someone else is doing. There are no Initiative checks unless the Referee decides to randomly see who goes first. In such a case, the Reflexes Stat can be added to the 3d6 die roll. Usually a party of several NPC's act on one Initiative. Initiative is rolled again for each combat Phase, or to save time, the GM can opt to use the same initiative for the rest of the combat scene.

When making an opposed roll against another character, (or NPC), the resolution is handled differently and attempt to counteract what the opposition does.

The typical opposed check formula is:
''Attack Value (AV) + Die Roll vs. Defense Value (DV) + Die Roll, or Defense Value + Flat X''

To make things easier, a player should calculate their character's AVs and DVs ahead of time before beginning play. Another option for the defender to choose ''Flat X'', (or Flat 10), where the Difficulty is always 10 + the defender's DV. The attacker only rolls dice during the combat Phase, which helps speed a combat scene along. The Flat X can be further modified by armor, cover and range penalties.

===Resolving damage===
Living characters in ''Fuzion'' can take two kinds of damage; ''Lethal Damage'', (that subtracts Hits), or ''Stun Damage'', that subtracts Stun points. When Hits fall to zero, a character is unconscious and may be dying. Losing further Hits can kill a character if it should fall twice below their Body Stat, that is,  a character with Body 5, (and 25 Hits), dies when his Hits fall to -10. When Stun falls to zero, a character is out cold. At this point, any further damage becomes ''Stun Rollover'' at 1/5 the Stun damage and begin deducting from their Hits. When a character loses 1/2 of their Hits, all their stats drop by 2. If 3/4 Hits are lost, all stats drop by 4.

Inanimate objects, have ''Structural Damage Points'' or SDPs. When an object loses all its SDPs, it is rendered useless; (a vehicle shuts down and grinds to a halt, a weapon will no longer fire, etc.). It is destroyed when it reaches twice its SDPs in damage. To keep things simple, (and avoid rolling lots of dice), large scale weapons inflict points of damage called ''Kills'', which represent destruction on a much larger scale. Kills are used for such things as giant mecha robots and spaceships.  Weapons that inflict Kill damage are not usually small enough to be carried around by characters.

Character sized weapons in ''Fuzion'' have ''Damage Classes'', or (DCs). Each point of DC represents a six-sided die that is rolled to see how much damage the weapon can cause. Six-sided dice are always used for damage rolls, regardless of using a d10 (or other die types) for checks. For instance, a light weight handgun typically has a DC of 3; meaning 3d6 is rolled to determine the damage it causes when it hits something. Some weapons also have a ''Weapon Accuracy (WA)'' value. This number is further added to the Attack roll and raise the chances of getting a successful hit.

Melee weapon sometimes have a ''Minimum Strength'' value. This is an optional rule to add more realism. A character must possess the listed minimum level of STR to fully inflict the weapon's damage. For every point of STR under the minimum, the weapon does one less die of damage. For example: A Battleaxe has a DC 5 and a Minimum STR of 5. A character with an STR 3, that uses the Battleaxe, suffers a -2 penalty to his Attack roll. It will also only inflict DC 3 of damage because the character's STR is 2 less than the minimum of 5. The character also suffers a -2 penalty to any Reflex checks and Reflex-based Skill checks when wielding the weapon.

For unarmed physical damage, a character deals 1 DC of punching damage per level of STR Stat, that is, a character with STR 3 does 3 DC of damage. Kicking adds an additional DC, that is,  with a STR of 3, a character deals 4 DC of damage with a kick.

Some ''Fuzion'' campaigns offer an optional ''Hit Location Chart'' where 3d6 is rolled to determine what specific part of the body is hit by an attack. Depending on the location, the damage may be modified.  For instance, if damage is applied to the head, the damage taken is doubled. If a hand is struck, the damage is halved. Using Hit Locations allows ''Called Shots'' with a -4 penalty to an attack roll to strike a specific area.

===Rewards===
After a good game of ''Fuzion'', Referees can reward characters with more Option Points, (or Award Points), which they can use to improve skills, and convert to money to buy more equipment. Enough OPs that are saved up can later allow a player to raise a Stat or two, and maybe buy a Talent or Perk, however the price for future ability upgrades becomes costly and keeps characters from becoming too powerful, too quickly. For example, to raise a skill from 4 to 5 costs a number of Option Points per point of the skill's next level. In this case, 5 option points. To raise it again to 6, costs 6 more points. To raise a primary stat costs 5 option points per level starting with the first. For example, to raise a stat from 4 to 5 costs 25 option points (5x5). Again to 6 would cost 30 more points (5x6).

The '''Great White Brotherhood''', in belief systems akin to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[New Age]], are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans.&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sects, 'Cults', and Alternative Religions: A World Survey and Sourcebook|last= Barrett|first= David|year= 1996|publisher= Blandford|location= London|isbn= 0-7137-2567-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] or the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]].&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;  The first person to talk about them in the West was [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] (Theosophy), after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them.  These included [[Helena Roerich]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Alice A. Bailey]], [[Guy Ballard]], Geraldine Innocente ([[The Bridge to Freedom]]), [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] and [[Benjamin Creme]].&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;

==History==
The idea of a secret organization of enlightened mystics, guiding the spiritual development of the human race, was pioneered in the late eighteenth century by [[Karl von Eckartshausen]] (1752-1803) in his book ''[[The Cloud upon the Sanctuary]]''; Eckartshausen called this body of mystics, who remained active after their physical deaths on earth, the ''Council of Light''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl von Eckartshausen|von Eckartshausen, K.]], ''[[The Cloud upon the Sanctuary]]'' (Isabelle de Steiger, translator).  (Weiser: 2003.  {{ISBN|0-89254-084-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adepti.com/docs/eck.pdf ''The Cloud on the Sanctuary''] ([[PDF]] etext; accessed Dec. 14, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Eckartshausen's proposed communion of living and dead mystics, in turn, drew partially on Christian ideas such as the [[Communion of Saints|Communion of the Saints]], and partially on previously circulating European ideas about [[secret society|secret societies]] of enlightened, [[mysticism|mystical]], or [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] adepts typified by the [[Rosicrucian]]s and the [[Illuminati]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin, J]]. ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Mahatma Letters]]'' began publication in 1881 with information purportedly revealed by "[[Koot Hoomi]]" to [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], and were also influential on the early development of the tradition. Koot Hoomi, through Sinnett, revealed that high-ranking members of mystic organizations in [[India]] and [[Tibet]] were able to maintain regular [[telepathy|telepathic]] contact with one another, and thus were able to communicate to each other, and also to Sinnett, without the need for either written or oral communications, and in a manner similar to the way that [[spirit medium]]s claimed to communicate with the spirits of the dead. The letters published by Sinnett, which proposed the controversial doctrine of [[reincarnation]], were said to have been revealed through this means.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin, J.]] ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), ch. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eckartshausen's idea was expanded in the teachings of [[Helena P. Blavatsky]] as developed by [[Charles W. Leadbeater]], [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Helena Roerich]]. Blavatsky, founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], attributed her teachings to just such a body of adepts; in her 1877 book ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', she called the revealers of her teachings the "Masters of the Hidden Brotherhood" or the "[[Mahatma]]s". Blavatsky claimed that she had made physical contact with these adepts' earthly representatives in Tibet; but also, that she continued to receive teachings from them through psychic channels, through her abilities of spirit mediumship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, R.]] ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'' (Oxford, 2000; {{ISBN|0-19-820744-1}}), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas about this secret council of sages, under several names, were a widely shared feature of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century [[esotericism]]. [[Arthur Edward Waite]], in his 1898 ''Book of Black Magic and of Pacts'', hinted at the existence of a secret group of initiates who dispense truth and wisdom to the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Edward Waite]], ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm80.htm The Book of Ceremonial Magic]'' (first edition title: ''The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts''), conclusion.  (London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; A young [[Aleister Crowley]], reading this, wrote Waite and was directed to read von Eckartshausen's book. Crowley's search for this secret wisdom eventually led him to become a neophyte in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], which represented itself to be the visible and earthly outer order of the Great White Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]] ([[John Symonds|Symonds, John]] and [[Kenneth Grant|Grant, Kenneth]], eds.), ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'' (Bantam, 1971), pp. xiv-xv (Symonds introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Golden Dawn itself, its teachings claimed to be derived from a similar body of initiates which in that tradition were called the [[Secret Chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, supra, p. 347 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual phrase "Great White Brotherhood" was used extensively in Leadbeater's 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. W. Leadbeater|Leadbeater, C. W.]], ''The Masters and the Path'' (Theosophical Publishing House, 1925; expanded, 1927)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice A. Bailey]] also claimed to have received numerous revelations from the Great White Brotherhood between 1920 and 1949, which are compiled in her books known collectively by her followers as the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey Material]].'' Since the introduction of the phrase, the term "Great White Brotherhood" is in some circles used generically to refer to any concept of an enlightened community of adepts, on earth or in the hereafter, with benevolent aims toward the spiritual development of the human race, and without strict regard to the names used within the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, supra.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dion Fortune]] adopts the name to refer to the community of living and dead adepts.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Dion Fortune|Fortune, Dion]], ''The Training and Work of an Initiate'' (1930; rev. ed. Weiser, 2000; {{ISBN|1-57863-183-1}}) and ''The Esoteric Orders and their Work'' (1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ritual magic]]ians of the [[Western mystery tradition]] sometimes refer to the Great White Brotherhood as the "Great White Lodge", a name that appears to indicate that they imagine it constitutes an [[initiation|initiatory]] [[hierarchy]] similar to [[Freemasonry]]. [[Gareth Knight]] describes its members as the "Masters" or "Inner Plane Adepti", who have "gained all the experience, and all the wisdom resulting from experience, necessary for their spiritual evolution in the worlds of form." While some go on to "higher evolution in other spheres", others become teaching Masters who stay behind to help younger initiates in their "cyclic evolution on this planet". Only a few of this community are known to the human race; these initiates are the "teaching Masters."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gareth Knight|Knight, G]], ''A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism'' (1965; repr. Weiser, 1978; {{ISBN|0-87728-397-4}}), v. 1 ch. X "Chesed", ss. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[AMORC]] Rosicrucian order maintains a difference between the "Great White Brotherhood" and the "Great White Lodge", saying that the Great White Brotherhood is the "school or fraternity" of the Great White Lodge, and that "every true student on the Path" aspires to membership in this Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. Spencer Lewis|Lewis, H. S.]], ''Rosicrucian Manual'' (AMORC, 1938), pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Aleister Crowley's remarks appear to indicate that Crowley identified the Great White Brotherhood with the [[A∴A∴]], his magical secret society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley|Crowley, A.]] ''[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/aba/app2.html Liber ABA]'', book 4. part 3, appendix II; a/k/a ''Magick in Theory and Practice'' (Sangreal, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bulgaria]]n [[Gnostic]] master [[Peter Deunov]] referred to his organization of followers as the [[Universal White Brotherhood]], and it is clear that he too was referring to the [[Western mystery tradition|Western esoteric community-at-large]]. When ex-communicated as a heretic on 7 July 1922, he defended the Brotherhood as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 ‘Let the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] resolve this issue, whether Christ has risen, whether Love is accepted in the Orthodox Church. There is one church in the world. But the Universal White Brotherhood is outside the church - it is higher than the church. But even higher than the Universal White Brotherhood is the Kingdom of Heaven. Hence the Church is the first step, the Universal White Brotherhood is the second step, and the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] is the third step - the greatest one that is to be manifested.’ (24 June 1923).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, [[Bulgaria]]n teacher [[Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov]] ([[Deunov]]'s principal disciple) formally established [[Fraternité Blanche Universelle]] as an "exoteric" esoteric organization still operating today in Switzerland, Canada, the USA, the UK and parts of Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbu.org/site_anglais/general_english/oma.htm |title=Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov |publisher=Fbu.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Great White Brotherhood'' was further developed and popularized in 1934 with the publication of "Unveiled Mysteries"&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Guy Ballard|Guy Ballard's]] [["I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Germain Foundation. ''The History of the "I AM" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation''. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This Brotherhood of "Immortal Saints and Sages"&lt;ref&gt;Vyasa, Krishna-Dwaipayana. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/maha/index.htm Mahabharata]. Chapter 23 - Arjuna's Quest: Indra addresses Arjuna saying: "This area is the abode of Immortal Saints and Sages. War and war-weapons are just unknown here."&lt;/ref&gt; who have gone through the Initiations of the Transfiguration, Resurrection, and the Ascension&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie. London: Theosophical Publishing House 1912&lt;/ref&gt; was further popularized by [[Ascended Master Teachings]] developed by [[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[The Summit Lighthouse]] and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], and The Temple of The Presence.

[[Benjamin Creme]] has published books—he claims the information within them has been telepathically transmitted to him from the Great White Brotherhood.

==Founding of the Great White Brotherhood==
In 1952, [[Geraldine Innocente]], messenger for ''The Bridge to Freedom'', delivered this address purported to be from [[Sanat Kumara]] describing the founding of the "Great White Brotherhood":

:" . . . I had nothing to work with but Light and Love, and many centuries passed before even two lifestreams applied for membership - One, later became Buddha (now, Lord of the World, the Planetary Logos [[Gautama Buddha]]) and the Other, became the Cosmic Christ (Lord [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], now the Planetary Buddha). The Brotherhood has grown through these ages and centuries until almost all the offices are held now by those belonging to the evolution of Earth and those who have volunteered to remain among her evolution. . .."&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' November 1953 (Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation).&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[The Bridge to Freedom]] believe that on July 4, 1954 [[Sanat Kumara]] stated through Geraldine Innocente:

:" . . . Thus We took Our abode upon the sweet Earth. Through the same power of centripetal and centrifugal force of which I spoke (cohesion and expansion of the magnetic power of Divine Love), We then began to magnetize the Flame in the hearts of some of the Guardian Spirits who were not sleeping so soundly and who were not too enthusiastically engaged in using primal life for the satisfaction of the personal self.
 
:"In this way, the Great White Brotherhood began. The Three-fold Flame within the heart of [[Shamballa]], within the Hearts of the Kumaras and Myself, formed the magnetic Heart of the Great White Brotherhood by Whom you have all been blessed and of which Brotherhood you all aspire to become conscious members. . . . "&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' November 1955 (Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Brotherhood of Light==
The Great White Brotherhood, also known as Great Brotherhood of Light or the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, is perceived as a spiritual organization composed of those [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] who have risen from the Earth into immortality, but still maintain an active watch over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. ''Isis Unveiled'' Volume 2 page 100:  ". . . the Secret Association is still alive and as active as ever"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, Nicholas and Helena ''Hierarchy'' Agni Yoga Society, Inc. 1931 (reprinted 1977): "Certainly, when the black lodge directs its arrows against the White Brotherhood, the consequences are self-destructive, and the manifestation of a rebounding blow is unavoidable. What you heard is a consequence of self-destruction, because the aimed arrow returned to the sender."&lt;/ref&gt; C.W. Leadbeater said "The Great White Brotherhood also includes members of the Heavenly Host (the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] directly concerned with the evolution of our world), [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings on Venus|Beneficent Members from other planets]] that are interested in our welfare, as well as certain unascended [[Apprenticeship|chelas]]".&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] are believed by Theosophists to be joined together in service to the Earth under the name of the Great White Brotherhood. The use of the term "white" refers to their use of white magic, as opposed to black, and is unrelated to race. The later versions of Blavatsky described the masters as&lt;ref&gt;Sinnett, Alfred Percy. ''[[s:The Occult World/Occultism and Its Adepts#Page 24|The Occult World]]''. Boston: Colby &amp; Rich, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; ethnically [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] or [[India]]n ([[Hindu]]), not [[European ethnic groups|European]]. Recent skeptical research indicates, however, that this description was used by Blavatsky to hide the real identity of her teachers, some of whom are said to have really been well known Indian rulers or personalities of her time.&lt;ref&gt;K. Paul Johnson: The Masters Revealed. Madame Blavatsky and the myth of the Great White Lodge. Albany, NY 1994: SUNY press&lt;/ref&gt;

Most occult groups assign a high level of importance to the Great White Brotherhood, but some make interaction with the Ascended Masters of the Brotherhood a major focus of their existence. Of these several, the most prominent are the [["I Am" Activity]], founded in the 1930s, The Bridge to Freedom, the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], and The Temple of The Presence.&lt;ref&gt;''White Paper - Wesak World Congress 2002''. Acropolis Sophia Books &amp; Works 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teachings of various organizations that have continued and expanded the Theosophical philosophical concepts.&lt;ref&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'' Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Information given by the Summit Lighthouse and the I AM movement is suspect, since none of the writers of these groups are Masters of any Brotherhood. Examples of those believed to be Ascended Masters would be, according to different unconfirmed sources are the [[Master Jesus]], [[Confucius]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Mary the Mother of Jesus]], [[Master Hilarion|Hilarion]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Paul the Venetian]], [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]], [[Comte de Saint-Germain|Saint Germain]], and [[Kuthumi]]. These sources say that all these peoples put aside any differences they might have had in their Earthly careers, and unite instead to advance the spiritual well-being of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Sinnett, Alfred Percy. ''[[s:The Occult World/Recent Occult Phenomena#Page 95|The Occult World]]''. Boston: Colby &amp; Rich, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agni Yoga==

The Great White Brotherhood is the name given in some metaphysical/occult circles to adepts of wisdom in or out of earthly incarnation who have assumed responsibility for the cosmic destiny of the human race, both individually and collectively. [[Nicholas Roerich]] and his wife, [[Helena Roerich]], inspired by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] writings of [[H.P. Blavatsky]], published the "[[Agni Yoga]]" series of books. Their contents, claimed to be inspired by the Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]], described the work of the White Brotherhood and the Spiritual Hierarchy.

'''Henry Hodgkin''' (1877-1933) was a [[medical doctor]] and a British [[Quaker]] [[missionary]] who, in the course of his 55-year life, co-founded the [[West China Union University]] in [[Chengdu]], co-founded and led the first [[Christian pacifist]] movement, the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]], and founded the [[Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation|Pendle Hill Quaker meeting and training center]], in [[Wallingford, Pennsylvania]].

==Life==

===Early Years===
Henry Theodore Hodgkin was born on 21 April 1877 in a very affluent Quaker family of [[Darlington]] in [[County Durham]], [[North East England]].&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2368451/?page=1 British Medical Journal, 1 April 1933]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Jonathan Backhouse Hodgkin (1843-1926), banker and mayor of Darlington, and of Mary Anna Pease, both from [[Quaker]] families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestry.co.uk/genealogy/records/jonathan-backhouse-hodgkin_37048073 Genealogic site ancestry.co.uk, last accessed on 14/12/2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hodgkins lived in the majestic Victorian manor of Elm Ridge in  Darlington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html Elm Ridge manor (now belonging to the [[Methodist Church]]) history page, last accessed on 15/12/2015.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912030904/http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html |date=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[Leighton Park School]] he studied first in [[King's College (Cambridge)|King's College, Cambridge]], then in [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London, to become a [[medical doctor]] (M.B. B.Ch (Cantab) ).&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; Extremely tall, with exceptional charisma and personality,&lt;ref name=DDA&gt;Dave D’Albert, A Lexicon of Spiritual Leaders In the IFOR Peace Movement, Part 1, Version 3, 2010 [https://www.ifor.org/s/spiritual-leaders-of-ifor.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; he became President of the English Student Missionary Union from 1902 to 1905. This organization's aim was to recruit missionaries among British students.&lt;ref name=BDCM&gt;Ralph R. Covell,  article du Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Christianity, citant George Herbert Wood, Henry T. Hodgkin: A Memoir (1937).

===Missionary work in China===
After completing his studies in 1905, Henry Hodgkin left immediately for [[Chengdu]], in the [[Sichuan]] province, [[China]], as a missionary The Friends' Foreign Missionary Association, a Quaker organisation which later became The Friends Service Council ; he stayed in China until 1909. During his stay in Chnegdu, he helped set up the [[West China Union University]], a Protestant university sponsored by several Protestant churches until its closure in 1926; after 1926 the Chinese professors took over from the foreign professors, and perpetuated their work so well that this university has now been incorporated into Chengdu's various universities.

From 1910 to 1920, Henry Hodgkin returned to England, to be the Secretary of The Friends' Foreign Missionary Association. He departed again for China in 1921, initially to deliver a series of lectures. He received however as a result a pressing invitation to become one of the secretaries of the [[National Christian Council of China]]; he held this position from 1922 to 1929.&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=BDCM/&gt;

===Launching of the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]]===
During his decade in Britain from 1910 to 1920, Hodgkin became active on the [[pacifist]] scene. In the summer of 1914, he had joined a group of about 150 European Christians who were convinced that a major conflagration was coming soon in Europe and who had gathered in [[Constance]], in southern Germany, to envisage possible actions to avert an actual war. This conference was far from successful since it was interrupted by the actual declaration of war! While conference participants were hurriedly returning home by train, Henry Hodgkin and the [[Germany|German]] [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]] [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]] made a mutual commitment before parting in [[Cologne]] that while their countries might be at war with each other, "We are one in Christ and can never be at war." This commitment implied of course to abstain from any direct personal participation in the conflict, in line with the traditional pacifist Quaker position, but also to work relentlessly to reestablish peace between their two nations no matter the policies of their governments.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kupisch, Die deutschen Landes Kirchen im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, Publisher: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1975, 127 pages, quoting p. 93: "Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze was a pioneer of ecumenism. On 1 August 1914, he was present at the conference of the "Council of Churches of the British and German empires for the promotion of friendly relations between the two peoples" as he was the secretary of this organization. Unfortunately the beginning of the war put an end to the debates even before they could start. With great difficulty, and working his way through them thanks to his good relations with the German imperial court as former pastor of the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Friedenskirche Potsdam]], Siegmund-Schultze managed to secure the return of the 130 British participants by organising a special train to the Netherlands via [[Cologne]]. " It is on one of the platforms of the [[Köln Hauptbahnhof|Cologne Central Station]] that, on 3 August 1914, the famous embrace between Henry Hodgkin Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze took place during which they mutually promised to remain united in Christ in spite of war and to proclaim the message of peace of the Gospel whatever the circumstances."&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hodgkin kept his word immediately and initiated a first meeting at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], where he lectured in philosophy: an ecumenical group of about 20 people came together to reflect on the implications of war on their personal and community life. They wrote a common declaration stating they could conceive God as a [[nationalist]] and couldn’t accept the idea of a moratorium on the [[Sermon on the Mount]] on hold for the duration of the war.  The first chapter of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) was born. Another meeting gathered 128 people at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where Henry Hodgkin was elected president of the FOR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forusa.org/blogs/ifor/ifor-centennial-invitation/12896 US site of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation, last accessed on 14/12/2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222111715/http://forusa.org/blogs/ifor/ifor-centennial-invitation/12896 |date=2015-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1915 Hodgkin travelled to New York City with a group of 66 people and convened a meeting at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] that included some very influential theologians and ministers the day, including [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] (who would become critical of Christian pacifism in the ’30s and consequently break with the FOR). Among those present that day were [[Edward Evans (divine)|Edward Evans]], [[Norman Thomas]], socialist educator [[Jessie Wallace Hughan]] (who would later found the more secular [[War Resisters League]]), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[Paul Jones (bishop)|bishop Paul Jones]] (who would be forced to resign his Utah see in April 1918 because of his outspoken opposition to World War I), [[Grace Hutchins]] et [[John Haynes Holmes]]. The American chapter of the now [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]] was then founded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://levellers.wordpress.com/2009/11/08/a-brief-history-of-the-fellowship-of-reconciliation/ « Levellers » site, last accessed on 14/12/2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in the United States===
In 1929 Henry Hodgkin was called to launch the Quaker [[Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation|religious and social meeting centre of Pendle Hill]] near [[Philadelphia]] ( [[Pendle Hill]] being the name of the [[Lancashire]] hill where [[George Fox]], the inspirator of [[Quakerism]], had his founding vision).&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; Historian Douglas Gwyn has shown Henry Hodgkin’s determining role, contributing his spiritual depth and his social concern to the drafting of the meeting centre’s vision:&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Gwyn, Personality and Place: The Life and Times of Pendle Hill, Plain Press, 2014. 512 pages.  {{ISBN|9781500549367}} [http://www.friendsjournal.org/personality-and-place-the-life-and-times-of-pendle-hill/  Review by Valerie Brown in The Friends’ Journal, 1 November 2015, last accessed on 14/12/2105]&lt;/ref&gt; Pendle Hill’s early vision was to be "a vital center of spiritual culture and as a place for training leaders." In 1929, Henry Hodgkin gathered a dozen leaders to discern the direction for this new center and four key focus areas were chosen as a result:
*House of Rest, a place of peace and deep quiet;
*School of the Prophets, a place to be grounded in a few well-chosen areas rather than teaching on many interesting topics;
*Laboratory of Ideas, a place to test beliefs in practice; and
*Fellowship ’Round Christ among students and staff.
He had to leave this position in 1932 for health reasons.&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt;

==Books==
Henry  Hodgkin wrote several books, among which: 
*The Message and Mission of Quakerism (1912) (with [[William Charles Braithwaite]] (1862 – 1922))
*Friends beyond the Seas (1916)&lt;ref&gt;Publisher Headley Bros., London, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Missionary Spirit - Swarthmore Lecture for 1916&lt;ref&gt;Publisher Headley Bros., London, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Christian Revolution (1923)
*Living Issues in China (1932)

==Philosophy==
Henry Hodgkin’s philosophy was rooted in his Quaker faith, which brought along a deep adhesion to [[pacifism]] and in a high social sensitivity. His views evolved from a strict English Quaker missionary’s view to a more multicultural approach. One of his biographers wrote that he was "a man large of body and mind".&lt;ref name=DDA/&gt; He summarised his own evolution as follows: "By processes too numerous and diverse even to summarize, I have reached a position which may be stated in a general way somewhat like this: "I believe that God's best for another may be so different from my experience and way of living as to be actually impossible for me. I recognize a change to have taken place in myself, from a certain assumption that mine was really the better way, to a very complete recognition that there is no one better way and that God needs all kinds of people and ways of living through which to manifest Himself in the World. This has seemed to carry with it two conclusions which greatly affect conduct. One is that I really find myself wanting to learn from people whom I previously would have regarded as fit objects for my 'missionary zeal'. To discover another way in which God is operating - along lines it may be distasteful or dangerous to me - is a large part of the fun of living. The second direction in which conduct is influenced is the deliberate attempt to share the life and interests of others who are not in my circle ... [for] in such sharing I can most deeply understand the other's life and through that reach, maybe, fresh truths about God.&lt;ref name=DDA/&gt;"

==Family==
Henry Hodgkin married Elizabeth Joy Montgomery. They had three children. He died on 26 March 1933 in [[Dublin]] a few weeks after undergoing surgery. 
His family counted a variety of personalities who deeply influenced the region of [[Darlington]]:
*As a banker, his father had financed a fair share of the region’s  industrial development. 
*His father-in-law, John Pease was the oldest son of railway pioneer [[Edward Pease (railway pioneer)|Edward Pease]], and another affluent Quaker industrialist who had the Elm Ridge manor built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html Page historique sur Elm Ridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912030904/http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html |date=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*His brother Jonathan Edward Hodgkin (1875-1953) was a devoted humanitarian during World War I, heading the local branch of The Friends War Victims Relief Committee - FWVRC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaker.org.uk/about-quakers/our-history/quakers-and-wwi Historical page about the Quakers, last accessed on 15/12/2015]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1916 on he served in [[Durham, England|Durham]] as a Quaker chaplain to the imprisoned conscientious objectors and organised transport for wounded in Darlington district. He also became treasurer of the [[Peace Society|London Peace Society]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conscription and Conscience: A History, 1916-1919″, quoted by [http://www.durhamatwar.org.uk/story/11343/  Historical of Durham city]&lt;/ref&gt;
*His sister Mary Hodgkin (1882-1956) was the secretary of Darlington Town Mission for many years. She raised the needed money to build the Chapel at the Darlington Memorial Hospital for the use of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutdarlington.co.uk/friends_burial_ground.htm Her grave can be seen in Darlington Quaker cemetery.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Table Hanzi}}
Until the beginning of the 20th century, governmental and scholarly documents in Vietnam were written in [[classical Chinese]] (Vietnamese: ''cổ văn'' 古文 or ''văn ngôn'' 文言&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tri Tài |date=2002 |title=Giáo trình tiếng Hán. Tập I: Cơ sở |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), using [[Chinese character]]s with Vietnamese approximations of [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciations.

At the same time popular novels and poetry in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] were written in the ''[[chữ nôm]]'' script, which used Chinese characters for [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] and an adapted set of characters for the native vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Asian &amp; Pacific quarterly of cultural and social affairs – Volumes 20–21 Cultural and Social Centre for the Asian and Pacific Region 1988 – Page 7 "... known script that was used by the Vietnamese, the "Southerners," to transcribe their language, in contrast to the Chinese ideographs (called chữ Hán i.e., "Chinese script," or chữ nho i.e. "Confucian script") of the "Northerners," the Chinese."&lt;/ref&gt;

The two scripts coexisted until the era of [[French Indochina]] when the Latin alphabet [[quốc ngữ]] script gradually became the written medium of both government and popular literature.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam 10 – Page 522 Nick Ray, Yu-Mei Balasingamchow, Iain Stewart – 2009 "For centuries, the Vietnamese language was written in standard Chinese characters (chữ nho). Around the 13th century, the Vietnamese devised their own writing system called chữ nôm (or just nôm), which was created by combining two Chinese words or by using single Chinese characters for their phonetic value. Both writing systems were in use until the 20th century – official business and scholarship was conducted in chữ nho, while chữ nôm was used for popular literature. The Latin-based quốc ngữ script, widely used since WWI, was developed in the 17th century by Alexandre de Rhodes (see the boxed text, right). Quốc ngữ served to undermine the position of Mandarin officials, whose power was based on traditional scholarship in chữ nho and chữ nôm, scripts that were largely inaccessible to the masses."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In Vietnamese, Chinese characters are called ''chữ Hán'' (字漢 "words from [[Han Chinese]]"), ''Hán tự'' (漢字 "[[Han people|Han]] characters/words". The same characters are pronounced as [[Hanzi]] in Chinese [[Putonghua]], [[Hanja]] in [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Kanji]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), ''Hán văn'' (漢文 "Han script"), or ''chữ nho'' (字儒 "words of [[Confucians]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tài Cẩn |date=2001 |title=Nguồn gốc và quá trình hình thành cách đọc Hán Việt |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học quốc gia Hà Nội |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hội Khai-trí tiến-đức |date=1954 |title=Việt-nam tự-điển |publisher=Văn Mới |pages=141, 228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Đào |first=Duy Anh |date=2005 |title=Hán-Việt từ-điển giản yếu |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn hoá Thông tin |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hán văn'' (漢文) (literally 'Han literature') denotes Chinese language literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hội Khai-trí tiến-đức |date=1954 |title=Việt-nam tự-điển |publisher=Văn Mới |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Đào |first=Duy Anh |date=2005 |title=Hán-Việt từ-điển giản yếu |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn hoá Thông tin |pages=281, 900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese word ''chữ'' (character, script, writing, letter) is derived from a [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation of 字 (Modern [[Pinyin]]: zì), meaning 'character'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tài Cẩn |date=1995 |title=Giáo trình lịch sử ngữ âm tiếng Việt (sơ thảo) |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Giáo dục |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] (Vietnamese: ''từ Hán Việt'' 詞漢越 "Sino-Vietnamese words") is a term which is used by modern scholars in relation to Vietnam's Chinese-language texts to emphasise local characteristics and particularly the [[phonology]] of the Chinese written in Vietnam, though in regard to [[syntax]] and [[vocabulary]] this Sino-Vietnamese was no more different from Chinese used in Beijing than medieval English Latin was different from the Latin of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Marr ''Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920–1945'' 1984 p141 "Because the Chinese characters were pronounced according to Vietnamese preferences, and because certain stylistic modifications occurred over time, later scholars came to refer to a hybrid 'Sino-Vietnamese' (Han-Viet) language. However, there would seem to be no more justification for this term than for a Fifteenth Century 'Latin-English' versus the Latin written contemporaneously in Rome."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[chữ Nôm]] (字喃 "Southern characters")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Khuê |date=2009 |title=Chữ Nôm: cơ sở và nâng cao |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |pages=5, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the former transcription system for vernacular Vietnamese-language texts, written using a mixture of original Chinese characters and locally coined [[nôm]] characters not found in Chinese to phonetically represent Vietnamese sounds."&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Dyson Walker East Asia A New History -2012 Page 262 "...chu nom, Vietnamese transcription, using Chinese and nom characters for Vietnamese sounds."&lt;/ref&gt; However the character set for chữ nôm is extensive, up to 20,000, and both arbitrary in composition and inconsistent in pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hannas |first=Wm. C. |title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C&amp;pg=PA82 |page=82 |year=1997 |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |location=Honolulu |quote=The linguistic defects are the same as those noted throughout this book for Chinese characters generally, caused by the large number of tokens (some twenty thousand in ''chữ nôm''), the arbitrariness of their composition, and the inconsistent way the units and their components connect with the sounds of the language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hán Nôm'' (漢喃 ‘Han and chữ Nôm characters’)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trần |first=Văn Chánh |date=January 2012 |title=Tản mạn kinh nghiệm học chữ Hán cổ|journal=Suối Nguồn, tập 3&amp;4 |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Tổng hợp Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; may mean either both [[Hán]] and [[Nôm]] taken together, as in the research remit of Hanoi's [[Hán-Nôm Institute]], or refer to texts which are written in a mixture of Hán and Nôm, or refer to some Hán texts with parallel Nôm translations. There is a significant orthographic overlap between Hán and Nôm and many characters are used in both Hán and Nôm with the same reading.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Hung, Judy Wakabayashi ''Asian translation traditions'' 2005 Page 174 "A large portion of the lexicon of the Vietnamese language in recent centuries derives from Hán. Consequently, there is a significant orthographic overlap between Hán and Nôm, which is to say that many characters are used in both with the same meaning. This is primarily a lexical, not a syntactic, phenomenon, although Hán grammar did influence Nôm prose to a relatively significant extent (Xtankevich 1986)"&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[chữ quốc ngữ]] (字國語 "national language script") means Vietnamese written in romanised script.

== History ==

===Chinese domination===
No known writings in Chinese by Vietnamese writers survive from the [[Chinese domination]] period.&lt;ref name="Cœdès"/&gt;

===Imperial Vietnam===
{{main|Literary Chinese in Vietnam}}
In Imperial Vietnam (939-1919), formal writings were, in most cases, done in classical Chinese. This was true both of the language of government and administration, and also of entry into government and administration by the wholly Chinese-language [[Confucian examination system in Vietnam]]. Chinese was also the language of medicine, astrology, religion, science and high literature such as poetry. Vietnamese existed only as an oral language, before the creation of the nom script to preserve and circulate less serious poetry and narrative literature. These writings are indistinguishable from contemporaneous classical Chinese works produced in [[China]], [[Korea]], or [[Japan]] as are the first poems in chữ nho by the monk [[Khuông Việt]] (匡越) and the ''[[Nam Quốc Sơn Hà]]'' (Hán-Việt/Sino-Vietnamese) / ''[[Sông núi nước Nam]]'' (Native Vietnamese) / 南國山河 (Hán-Nôm) by general [[Lý Thường Kiệt]] (李常傑).&lt;ref name="Cœdès"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=George Cœdès |first=George |last=Cœdès |title=The Making of South East Asia |year=1966 |translator=H.

===Localisation and Sino-xenic pronunciation===
{{main|Sino-Vietnamese reading}}
{{see also|Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters}}
In Vietnam, classical Chinese texts were read with the vocalization of Chinese text as such, equivalent to the Chinese [[on'yomi|On-readings]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''[[kambun]]'' ({{lang|ja|漢文}}), or the assimilated vocalizations in [[Korean language|Korean]] ''[[hanmun]]'' ({{lang|ko|한문/漢文}}).&lt;ref&gt;Bjarke Frellesvig ''A History of the Japanese Language'' 2010 – Page 258 "... the rendition of Chinese text in Japanese, which affected grammar and usage (see 9.1) and (kanbun-)ondoku, the vocalization of Chinese text as such, which paved the way for the intake of a large number of loanwords from Chinese (9.2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichibunken newsletter Kokusai Nihon Bunka Kenkyū Sentā 1996 – No23–36 – Page 52 "The novel was then translated from Chinese into Vietnamese by a Vietnamese revolutionist. Knowledge of kanbun (classical Chinese) was quite common among Vietnamese intellectuals, and the new kanbun style of Liang Zhi-chau ..."&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred alongside entry of [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] into the vernacular Vietnamese language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hannas |first=Wm.

Pulleyblank]] was the one of the first linguists to actively employ "Sino-Vietnamese" to recover the earlier history of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Bentley ''A Descriptive Grammar of Early Old Japanese Prose'' 2001 – Page 39 "... (1975:195, fn. 3) and his reconstructions, but it is interesting to note that Pulleyblank's work actually supports Miller's claims. ... to have been one of the first linguists to notice the importance of SV in reconstructing earlier stages of Chinese."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period of coexistence of two languages and two scripts===
{{main|Vietnamese literature}}
[[File:1938 Vietnamese Birth Certificate in Nôm.jpg|thumb|right|Vietnamese birth certificate in 1938 showing different scripts in descending frequency: quốc ngữ, chữ nôm, chữ nho, French]] 
From the 13th Century the dominance of Chinese writing - chữ nho - began to be challenged by a system of modified and invented characters modeled loosely on Chinese characters called ''[[chữ nôm]]'', which, unlike the system of chữ nho (or chữ Hán), allowed for the expression of purely Vietnamese words, was created in Vietnam at least as early as the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence C. Thompson ''A Vietnamese Reference Grammar'' University of Hawaii Press 1965 revised 1987 Page 53 "Chữ nôm apparently existed for several centuries alongside the standard written Chinese of the royal court (called chữ nho 'scholar's characters' or chữ Hán 'Han [i.e., Chinese] characters')."&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Ming dynasty occupation of Vietnam]] chữ nôm printing blocks, texts and inscriptions were destroyed, so that the earliest surviving texts are from after the period.&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. McLeod, Thi Dieu Nguyen ''Culture and Customs of Vietnam'' 2001 Page 68 – "In part because of the ravages of the Ming occupation – the invaders destroyed or removed many Viet texts and the blocks for printing them – the earliest body of nom texts that we have dates from the early post-occupation era ..."&lt;/ref&gt; While designed for native Vietnamese speakers, chữ nôm required the user to have a fair knowledge of chữ Hán, and thus chữ nôm was used primarily for literary writings by cultural elites (such as the poetry of [[Nguyễn Du]] and [[Hồ Xuân Hương]]), while almost all other official writings and documents continued to be written in classical Chinese until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ha Minh Nguyen, Bac Hoai Tran, Tuan Duc Vuong ''Colloquial Vietnamese: The Complete Course for Beginners'' Routledge 2012 Page 3 "Because of thousands of years of Chinese domination and influence, the Vietnamese used Chinese characters known as chu nho as their official written language for many centuries. However chu nho was not easy to learn and only the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Sloper, Thạc Cán Lê ''Higher Education in Vietnam: Change and Response'' 1995 Page 45 "All teaching materials are written in Han, Chinese classical characters known as chu nho. From about the thirteenth century a Vietnamese system of writing, chu nom or simply nom, was developed. ... chu nho was used for official business and scholarship, while chu nom was used for popular literature."&lt;/ref&gt;

===French colonial period===
The use of classical Chinese, and its written form, chữ nho (or chữ Hán), died out in Vietnam early in the 20th century during the middle years of [[French Indochina]]. At this time there were briefly four competing writing systems in Vietnam; chữ nho, chữ nôm, quốc ngữ, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Simpson ''Language and national identity in Asia'' 2007 Page 428 "..there existed a situation in which there were briefly four different available writing systems in Vietnam, chu nho, chu nom, quoc ngu, and Romanized French. ... (4) The acceptability of quoc ngu was then further heightened by its use to translate works of literature from Chinese and chu nom, as well as through its ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first romanized script [[quốc ngữ]] newspaper, ''[[Gia Dinh Bao]]'', was founded in 1865, Vietnamese nationalists continued to use chữ nôm until after the [[First World War]] when quốc ngữ became the favoured language of the Vietnamese independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Eliot, Jonathan Rose ''A Companion to the History of the Book'' - Page 124 2009 "The first publication in quoc ngu was the first Vietnamese newspaper, Gia-dinh báo (Daily Paper, 1865), ... During World War I, the colonial administration encouraged quoc ngu journalism for propaganda purposes, and as a result journals"&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars still study it today although its application is mostly confined to the historic context of Vietnamese texts.

===Usage today===
[[File:Van Mieu han tu 5412916981 273dedbe99.jpg|180px|thumb|left|A calligrapher writing the Chinese character 祿 "good fortune" (Sino-Vietnamese reading: ''lộc'') in preparation for Tết, at the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi]] (2011)]]
Individual ''Hán tự'' are still written by [[Vietnamese calligraphy|calligraphers]] for special occasions such as the Vietnamese New Year, [[Tết]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vietnam Economic Times'' Volume 98 – Page 14 Viện kinh tế thế giới (Vietnam) "Today calligraphy is considered one of their most respected art forms. Vietnam also has a long history of calligraphy, but in its earliest form it was called Han Nom, a way of using the Chinese characters to convey Vietnamese words."&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of [[quốc ngữ]] for education in both North and South Vietnam from 1945-1975, and then all of Vietnam since 1975, has rendered most Vietnamese unable to read earlier Vietnamese texts, whether written in Chinese chữ nho, or vernacular chữ nôm. [[Hán Nôm Institute]] is the national centre for academic research into both Hán and [[nôm]] texts. Since the mid-1990s a small resurgence in teaching of Chinese characters, both for chữ nho and the additional characters used in chữ nôm, to enable the study of Vietnam's history has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Eliot, Jonathan Rose ''A Companion to the History of the Book'' Page 124 – 2011 "Since the use of quoc ngu for education has rendered most Vietnamese now incapable of reading earlier Vietnamese ... an increasing commitment to the publication of translations from Chinese or of transcriptions from nom texts to render ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many Vietnamese study Hán tự characters as a part of learning modern Japanese and Chinese, and sometimes Korean. This allows a Vietnamese speaker to learn a word in the target language (represented by Chinese characters) in relation to the Vietnamese cognate reading. The significance of the characters has occasionally entered Western depiction of Vietnam; for instance novelist [[E. M. Nathanson]] mentions the characters in ''A Dirty Distant War'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Nathanson ''Dirty Distant War'' 1987 Page 121 "So they took the Chinese ideographs for those words, changed them a little to make them distinctive from the Chinese characters, and in that way developed a written language. That's the script that became what we refer to today as chữ nho."&lt;/ref&gt;

For linguists the [[Sino-Vietnamese reading]]s of Chinese characters provide data for the study of [[historical Chinese phonology]].

In [[political science]], '''intergovernmentalism''' treats states, and national governments in particular, as the primary actors in the integration process.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergovernmentalist approaches claim to be able to explain both periods of radical change in the [[European Union]] because of converging governmental preferences and periods of inertia because of diverging national interests. Intergovernmentalism is distinguishable from [[realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] because of its recognition of the significance of [[institutionalisation]] in international politics and the impact of domestic politics upon governmental preferences.

A monetary union, the [[eurozone]], was established in 1999 and is composed of 17 member states. Through the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] the EU has developed a role in [[Foreign relations of the European Union|external relations]] and [[Military of the European Union|defence]]. Permanent [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|diplomatic missions]] have been established around the world. The EU is represented at the [[European Union and the United Nations|United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[European Union and the G8|G8]] and the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]].

Intergovernmentalism represents a way for limiting the conferral of powers upon supranational institutions, halting the emergence of common policies. In the current institutional system of the EU, the European Council and the Council play the role of the institutions which have the last word about decisions and policies of the EU, institutionalizing a de facto intergovernmental control over the EU as a whole, with the possibility to give more power to a small group of states. This extreme consequence can create the condition of supremacy of someone over someone else violating the principle of a "Union of Equals".&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Laruffa, "The European Integration and National Interests: from an intergovernmental model to a Constitutional Agreement"(Hungarian Academy of Social Sciences, Budapest, 3 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Fellowship of Reconciliation''' ('''IFOR''') is a non-governmental organization founded in 1914 in response to the horrors of war in Europe. Today IFOR counts 72 branches, groups and affiliates in 48 countries on all continents. IFOR members promote [[nonviolence]], [[human rights]] and [[reconciliation (ethnic relations)|reconciliation]] through public education efforts, training programs and campaigns. The IFOR International Secretariat in [[Alkmaar]], [[Netherlands]] facilitates communication among IFOR members, links branches to capacity building resources, provides training in gender-sensitive [[nonviolence]] through the  Women Peacemakers Program, and helps coordinate international campaigns, delegations and urgent actions. IFOR has [[ECOSOC]] status at the [[United nations|United Nations]].

==History==

===Origins in wartime===
The first body to use the name "[[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]" was formed as a result of a pact made in August 1914 at the outbreak of the [[First World War]] by two [[Christian]]s, [[Henry Hodgkin]] (an English [[Quaker]]) and [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]] (a German [[Lutheran]]), who were participating in a [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] conference in [[Konstanz]], southern Germany (near Switzerland).  On the platform of the railway station at [[Cologne]], they pledged to each other that, "We are one in Christ and can never be at war".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Nigel Young,
''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century''. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}}
(p. 24).&lt;/ref&gt;

To take that pledge forward, Hodgkin organised a conference in [[Cambridge]] in 1915 and founded the "Fellowship of Reconciliation" (FOR England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.for.org.uk|title=Home - Fellowship of Reconciliation|date=16 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German branch, Versöhnungsbund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versoehnungsbund.de/en|title=International Fellowship of Reconciliation - German Branch - Internationaler Versöhnungsbund|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded later. It held its first conference in 1932, but in 1933, when Hitler came to power, it dissolved. Schultze was arrested twenty-seven times during World War I and was forced to live in exile during the Nazi period. FOR Germany was officially reestablished just in 1956 with Dr Siegmund Schultze as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forusa.org/content/rebel-passion-eighty-five-years-fellowship-reconciliation|title=The Rebel Passion: Eighty-Five Years of the Fellowship of Reconciliation - Fellowship of Reconciliation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Shortly after the Cambridge conference, in the autumn of 1915, Henry Hodgkin went over to America and, the 11th and 12 November, the  American Fellowship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forusa.org|title=Fellowship of Reconciliation - Working for peace, justice and nonviolence since 1915|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded during a Conference at Garden City, Long Island. More than a thousand members enrolled in the American Fellowship before and during the war, which, for the U.S.A., begun on April 6, 1917.
Because of the war, it was not possible to travel to other countries and the Fellowship of Reconciliation focused its activities on trying to influence public opinion, to help victims of war and war prisoners. 600 people in England went to prison for helping more than 16.000 imprisoned during the war.  When conscription began in Britain in 1916 and in the United States many FOR members refused military service.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Brittain, "The Rebel Passion: a History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers", George Allen and Unwin ltd, London, 1964, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War one: strengthening the international movement===
[[File:1919-IFOR-c.png|thumb|First international gathering of International Fellowship of Reconciliation at [[Bilthoven]], Netherlands, in 1919.]]

After the end of the war, in 1919, the different Fellowships of Reconciliation raised in those years all around Europe and in the USA agreed to found the International Fellowship of Reconciliation as an umbrella organisation to which they affiliated as members.  In October 1919 Christian pacifists from 10 different countries met in the Netherlands, in the town of Bilthoven, to establish the "Movement Towards a Christian International" later called "International Fellowship of Reconciliation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Ferguson | title = The Fellowship of Reconciliation |series=History| publisher = IFOR | journal = The Cambridge Review |date=December 1984 | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004074828/http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  IFOR first secretary was the Swiss pacifist [[Pierre Cérésole]] jailed several times for his peace witness. He established the [[International Voluntary Service for Peace#From reconciliation to emergency aid .281920.29|Service Civil]] (International Voluntary Service for Peace), initially organizing work camps in areas torn apart by war, with volunteers from former enemy countries. Relief for the victims of war was carried out, and international conferences and meetings spread the work of peace to many other parts of the globe.  Immediately after Bilthoven IFOR appointed travelling secretaries such as [[John Nevin Sayre]], [[André and Magda Trocmé|André Trocmé]], [[Muriel Lester]], Henri Rose and Percy Bartlett.  They travelled carrying the Fellowship's messages around Europe, in Scandinavia, Central Europe, Poland, the Baltic States and the Balkans, giving life to several international conferences that took place between the two world wars.  The first one gathered 200 delegates from 20 nations (also India, Burma and Ukraine) in Sonntagberg in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen &amp; Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others followed and, in such a tense historical moment, IFOR members discussed about the necessity of disarmament and of a new role of Churches, asking clergymen to make a strong stand against the idea of "righteous wars".  In 1932, the IFOR led a Youth Crusade across Europe in support of the Geneva World Disarmament Conference.  Protestants and Catholics from all over converged on Geneva by various routes, reaching over 50,000 people and presenting to the Conference a petition calling for total disarmament among the nations.

===Ambassadors of Reconciliation===
At the end of the 1930s, given the unstable international situation, IFOR established Embassies of Reconciliation that initiated peace efforts not only in Europe but in Japan and China as well.  "Ambassadors of Reconciliation", such as George Lansbury, [[Muriel Lester]] and Anne Seesholtz, visited many world leaders, including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Leon Blum]] and [[Franklin D Roosevelt]].  Muriel Lester, English social worker, served as IFOR travelling secretary throughout the world, helping to establish its work in many countries. She met [[Mahatma Gandhi]], first in London when, in 1931, he spent some time at [[Kingsley Hall]], a community center with educational, social and recreational purposes, run by her and her sister Doris, and then in India when she went with him in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.  When [[World War II]] broke out, travels and communications became almost impossible. In many countries IFOR members suffered persecution for publicly preaching pacifism. IFOR's members, especially in America tried by inter-church mediation to find ways of ending the war, to help coscientious objectors, and struggled against internment of Japanese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen &amp; Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In France, IFOR members [[André and Magda Trocmé]], with the help of the villagers of le [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon|Chambon sur Lignon]], saved the lives of thousands of Jews escaping the Holocaust. In Belgium, feminist Magda Yoors Peeters defends Jewish refugees and conscientious objectors.

===Supporting nonviolent movements around the world===
After the war, travelling secretaries continued their work. IFOR branches and affiliates in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East grew consistently also thanks to the work of [[Jean Goss]] and [[Hildegard Goss-Mayr]] from Paris and Vienna, three times nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="pb"&gt;{{citation |authorlink1=Peter Brock (historian) |first1=Peter |last1=Brock |first2=Nigel |last2=Young |title=Pacifism in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-8156-8125-9 |pages=376–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand pacifist [[Ormond Burton]] represented the IFOR in that nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John |last=Button |title=The Radicalism Handbook: Radical Activists, Groups and Movements of the Twentieth Century |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=1995 |isbn=0-87436-838-3 |page=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From such labors arose Servicio Paz y Justicia (SERPAJ)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serpajamericalatina.org/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout Latin America. SERPAJ's founder [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel|Adolfo Perez Esquivel]] from Argentina was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1980.&lt;ref name="pb" /&gt; SERPAJ participated in the nonviolent resistance to Chile's 16-year-long military dictatorship, which culminates in free elections that restored democracy. Hildegard Goss-Mayrs' training in active nonviolence contributed significantly to the people power overthrow of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship in the [[Philippines]] in 1986, as well as the growth of nonviolent movements in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Richard | last = Deats | title = Marked for Life: The Story of Hildegard Goss-Mayr | publisher = New City Press | place = Hyde park, NY | year = 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Goss-Mayrs, IFOR Honorary Presidents, were central to the global spread of active nonviolence movement.

==IFOR members==
IFOR has 72 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.it/maps/ms?msid=214698436680848045660.0004c04fff384994c2417&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=13.55691,8.778076&amp;spn=139.474293,226.054688|title=International Fellowship of Reconciliation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 48 countries in all continents.

==How IFOR works==

===Decade for a Culture of Nonviolence===
Since the initiation of the United Nations Decade for a Culture of Peace and Nonviolence for the Children of the World, in 2001, IFOR members have been active in working for peace education and in working to establish national coalitions to support the Decade.

===Nonviolence education and training===
IFOR assists groups and individuals to find ways in which they can transform conflicts into positive and growth oriented interactions that involve dialogue and lead to reconciliation. The  Nonviolent Education Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nv-e.org/|title=*NVE - Non Violent Education*|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims at supporting sustainable implementation of nonviolence/nonviolent education, peace education and violence prevention in compulsory kindergarten and school education and thus consequent implementation of Children’s Rights expressed in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].  This is done through various presentations and training programs, as well as through the creation of resource materials and contact with trainers and resource people.

===Youth empowerment===
Thanks to the Youth Working Group, IFOR provides young people with the skills and opportunities to become active peacemakers. This is done through nonviolence and leadership training, campaigning, and through internships with IFOR branches and groups, or with the International Secretariat.

===Interfaith cooperation===
Religion has on occasion played a central role in fomenting conflict but can also be a source of inspiration and leadership for peace. IFOR sponsors interfaith delegations to areas of conflict and publishes material on nonviolence from different religious traditions.

===Disarmament===
Since our founding, IFOR has opposed war and preparations for war. IFOR members support conscientious objectors, campaign for a ban on land mines, and oppose nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. During their annual meeting, European members from different branches of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation issued the Declaration of Prali,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifor-mir.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Read-the-Declaration-of-Prali-on-Military-Spending.pdf|title=Read the Declaration of Prali on Military Spending|format=PDF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in occasion of the Global day of Action on Military Spending,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demilitarize.org/|title=Global Campaign on Military Spending - Cut Military Spending - Fund Human Needs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17 April 2012.  The Peace and Constitution Committee Working Group promotes actions to raise awareness on the [[article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] which denounces war and war-preparation activities.

===Gender justice===
In 2006 IFOR adopted a Gender Policy in which IFOR recognizes that there is a continuum of violence against women that must be confronted, from family violence in the private sphere to armed conflict in the public sphere. Unequal power relations between women and men are one root of violence, conflict and militarization, where women are often severely abused. Gender justice means that women and men can equally contribute to and benefit from peace building, non-violent conflict resolution and reconciliation.  This gender policy recognizes that gender equality is an integral part of IFOR’s fundamental values and is a core spiritual value. A transformation of the power relations between women and men is a prerequisite for a culture of peace and non-violence, and must be promoted throughout IFOR.  The Women Peacemaker Program (WPP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifor.org/WPP/|title=About IFOR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an IFOR program that works to ensure the possibility for women's access to peace negotiations and promotes the application of IFOR’s Gender Policy. 

The successful program has been institutionalized by the end of 2012.

==International representation==
IFOR maintains permanent representatives at the United Nations (UN) in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Paris (UNESCO) who regularly participate in conferences and meetings of UN bodies, providing testimony and expertise from different regional perspectives, promoting non-violent alternatives in the fields of human rights, development, and disarmament. 
IFOR has observer and consultative status to the United Nations, United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and UNESCO organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4018">The Jones model is a growth model developed in 1995 by economist [[Charles I. Jones]].

The model is essentially identical to the [[Romer model]] (1990), in particular it generalizes or modifies the description of how new technologies, ideas or design instructions arise. This should take into account the criticism made of the Romer model that the long-term growth rate depends positively on the size of the population ([[economies of scale]]). This is problematic in several respects: on the one hand larger countries do not necessarily grow faster. On the other hand, an increasing population or intensified research work did not increase the growth rate on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= [[Charles I. Jones]]|title= R&amp;D-based models of economic growth|journal= [[Journal of Political Economy]]|year= 1995|volume=103|issue=4|pages= 759-784|doi= 10.1086/262002|jstor= 2138581|ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the extent of influence from the current state of knowledge on new inventions (standing on shoulders effect).

==Model Structure==
For a single company {\ displaystyle i} i According to the following modeling applies to the emergence of new ideas or design instructions:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot A_i = \delta \cdot A(t)^\phi \cdot L_A(t)^{\lambda-1} \cdot L_{A_i}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

With

:&lt;math&gt;L_{A}&lt;/math&gt;:: Number of employees in the research sector

:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;: Technology level

:&lt;math&gt;\dot A&lt;/math&gt; refers to the derivation of the variables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; A after the time, so &lt;math&gt;\dot A= \frac{\partial A(t)}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; 

where the parameters take the following values: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; \lambda &lt; 1; \phi &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, For parameter values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \phi = 1&lt;/math&gt; results in the Romer model (&lt;math&gt;\dot A = \delta \cdot A \cdot L_A&lt;/math&gt;). After aggregation across all companies results:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot A = \delta \cdot A(t)^\phi \cdot L_A(t)^{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here the parameters have the following meaning:

* &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; lambda restricts the effect of additional labor input in the research sector. Although more researchers are producing more ideas , each researcher is contributing less and less. This relationship is also called standing-on-shoes effect (step on your feet, see also yield law ). This parameter reflects a possible negative externality of the duplication. For a single company, however, this problem does not exist because within a research department, all researchers know about the work of their colleagues.
* &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;: A negative value aims at giving only finitely many potential new ideas for a given time. This case is also referred to as a fishing-out effect: over time, the relatively "simple" inventions are made first; Today, it is becoming increasingly difficult to develop a new drug.
* &lt;math&gt;\phi = 0 &lt;/math&gt;: Here, productivity in the research sector would be independent of existing knowledge. For example, a physicist should be able to develop the same new ideas, whether he lives today or 100 years ago (an unrealistic case).
* &lt;math&gt;\phi &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;: Describes in principle a positive externality and the case encountered in reality. The current state of the art is to a certain extent involved in research. The standing-on-shoulders effect is only weakened compared to the Romer model.

==Growth rate==
In the Jones model, growth in steady state is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\dot{\hat{A(t)}}}{\hat{A(t)}} = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \hat{A(t)} = \frac{\lambda \cdot n}{1 - \phi}&lt;/math&gt; n for the growth rate of persons working in the research sector.

==Methods for ''k''-anonymization==

In the context of ''k''-anonymization problems, a database is a table with ''n'' rows and ''m'' columns. Each row of the table represents a record relating to a specific member of a population and the entries in the various rows need not be unique. The values in the various columns are the values of attributes associated with the members of the population. The following table is a nonanonymized database consisting of the patient records of some fictitious hospital in [[Kochi]]. 
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Name''' !! '''Age''' !!  '''Gender''' !!'''State of domicile''' !! '''Religion''' !! '''Disease'''
|-
|  Ramsha  || 29 ||  Female || [[Tamil Nadu]] || [[Hindu]]   || [[Cancer]]    
|-
|  Yadu  || 24  || Female || [[Kerala]]   || Hindu   || [[Viral disease|Viral infection]] 
|-
|  Salima  || 28 || Female || Tamil Nadu   || [[Muslim]]  || [[Tuberculosis|TB]]
|-
|  Sunny   || 27  || Male|| [[Karnataka]]   || [[Parsi]]   || No illness
|-
|  Joan  || 24  || Female || Kerala   || [[Christian]]   || [[Cardiovascular disease|Heart-related]]
|-
|  Bahuksana  || 23 || Male || Karnataka   || [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]   || TB
|-
|  Rambha  || 19  || Male || Kerala   || Hindu   || Cancer
|-
|   Kishor  ||  29 || Male || Karnataka   || Hindu  || Heart-related
|-
|  Johnson  || 17  || Male || Kerala   || Christian   || Heart-related
|-
|  John  || 19  || Male || Kerala   || Christian   || Viral infection
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

There are 6 attributes and 10 records in this data. There are two common methods for achieving ''k''-anonymity for some value of ''k''.

#'''Suppression''': In this method, certain values of the attributes are replaced by an asterisk '*'. All or some values of a column may be replaced by '*'. In the anonymized table below, we have replaced all the values in the 'Name' attribute and all the values in the 'Religion' attribute with a '*'.
#'''Generalization''': In this method, individual values of attributes are replaced by with a broader category. For example, the value '19' of the attribute 'Age' may be replaced by ' ≤ 20', the value '23' by '20 &lt; Age ≤ 30' , etc.

The next table shows the anonymized database.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Name''' !! '''Age''' !!  '''Gender''' !!'''State of domicile''' !! '''Religion''' !! '''Disease'''
|-
|  *  || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 ||  Female || Tamil Nadu || *   || Cancer    
|-
|  *  || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Female || Kerala   || *   || Viral infection 
|-
|  *  || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Female || Tamil Nadu   || * || TB
|-
| *   || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30  || Male|| Karnataka   || *  || No illness
|-
|  * || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Female || Kerala   || *   || Heart-related
|-
|  *  || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Male || Karnataka   || *   || TB
|-
|  *  || Age ≤ 20  || Male || Kerala   || *   || Cancer
|-
|   *  ||  20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Male || Karnataka   || *  || Heart-related
|-
|  *  || Age ≤ 20  || Male || Kerala   || *   || Heart-related
|-
|  *  || Age ≤ 20 || Male || Kerala   || *   || Viral infection
|}

&lt;/center&gt;

This data has 2-anonymity with respect to the attributes 'Age', 'Gender' and 'State of domicile' since for any combination of these attributes found in any row of the table there are always at least 2 rows with those exact attributes. The attributes available to an adversary are called [[quasi-identifier]]s. Each quasi-identifier tuple occurs in at least ''k'' records for a dataset with ''k''-anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narayanan|first1=Arvind|last2=Shmatikov|first2=Vitaly|title=Robust De-anonymization of Large Sparse Datasets|url=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak08netflix.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyerson and Williams (2004) demonstrated that optimal ''k''-anonymity is an [[NP-hard]] problem, however heuristic methods such as ''k''-Optimize as given by Bayardo and Agrawal (2005) often yields effective results.&lt;ref name=Optimal&gt;{{cite journal

| quote = Data de-identification reconciles the demand for release of data for research purposes and the demand for privacy from individuals. This paper proposes and evaluates an optimization algorithm for the powerful de-identification procedure known as ''k''-anonymization. A ''k''-anonymized dataset has the property that each record is indistinguishable from at least ''k'' - 1 others. Even simple restrictions of optimized ''k''-anonymity are NP-hard, leading to significant computational challenges. We present a new approach to exploring the space of possible anonymizations that tames the combinatorics of the problem, and develop data-management strategies to reduce reliance on expensive operations such as sorting. Through experiments on real census data, we show the resulting algorithm can find optimal ''k''-anonymizations under two representative cost measures and a wide range of k. We also show that the algorithm can produce good anonymizations in circumstances where the input data or input parameters preclude finding an optimal solution in reasonable time. Finally, we use the algorithm to explore the effects of different coding approaches and problem variations on anonymization quality and performance. To our knowledge, this is the first result demonstrating optimal ''k''-anonymization of a nontrivial dataset under a general model of the problem.

| quote = The technique of k-anonymization has been proposed in the literature as an alternative way to release public information, while ensuring both data privacy and data integrity. We prove that two general versions of optimal k-anonymization of relations are NP-hard, including the suppression version which amounts to choosing a minimum number of entries to delete from the relation. We also present a polynomial time algorithm for optimal k-anonymity that achieves an approximation ratio independent of the size of the database, when k is constant. In particular, it is a O(k log k)-approximation where the constant in the big-O is no more than 4. However, the runtime of the algorithm is exponential in k. A slightly more clever algorithm removes this condition, but is a O(k logm)-approximation, where m is the degree of the relation. We believe this algorithm could potentially be quite fast in practice.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A practical approximation algorithm that enables solving the ''k''-anonymization problem with an approximation guarantee of &lt;math&gt;O(\log k)&lt;/math&gt; was presented by Kenig and Tassa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenig|first1=Batya|last2=Tassa|first2=Tamir|title=A practical approximation algorithm for optimal k-anonymity|journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|date=2012|volume=25|pages=134–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Caveats ==
Because k-anonymization does not include any randomization, attackers can still make inferences about data sets that may harm individuals. For example, if the 19-year-old John from Kerala is known to be in the database above, then it can be reliably said that he has either cancer, a heart-related disease, or a viral infection.

''K''-anonymization is not a good method to anonymize high-dimensional datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Charu C.|title=On k-Anonymity and the Curse of Dimensionality}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, researchers showed that, given 4 locations, the unicity of mobile phone timestamp-location datasets (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_4&lt;/math&gt;, ''k''-anonymity when &lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt;) can be as high as 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|pages=1376|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1376D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been shown that ''k''-anonymity can skew the results of a data set if it disproportionately suppresses and generalizes data points with unrepresentative characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Angiuli|first1=Olivia|author2=Joe Blitzstein |author3=Jim Waldo |authorlink3=Jim Waldo|title=How to De-Identify Your Data|url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2838930|website=ACM Queue|publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suppression and generalization algorithms used to ''k''-anonymize datasets can be altered, however, so that they do not have such a skewing effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angiuli|first1=Olivia|author2=Jim Waldo|authorlink2=Jim Waldo|title=Statistical Tradeoffs between Generalization and Suppression in the De-Identification of Large-Scale Data Sets|journal=IEEE Computer Society Intl Conference on Computers, Software, and Applications|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14794">A person's '''life stance''', or '''lifestance''', is their relation with what they accept as being of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|ultimate importance]]. It involves the presuppositions and theories upon which such a stance could be made, a [[belief system]], and a commitment to potentially working it out in one's [[personal life|life]].&lt;ref&gt;
For example, as treated in ''[[The Intentional Stance]]'' by [[Daniel Dennett]] {{ISBN|0-262-54053-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It connotes an integrated perspective on reality as a whole and how to assign valuations, thus being a concept similar or equivalent to that of a [[worldview]]; with the latter word (derived from the German "Weltanschauung") being generally a more common and comprehensive term. Like the term "worldview", the term "life stance" is intended{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be a ''shared'' label encompassing both [[religion|religious]] perspectives (for instance: "a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] life stance"  or "a&amp;nbsp;[[Christian]] life&amp;nbsp;stance" or "a [[Neopaganism|Pagan]] life stance"), as well as non-religious spiritual or philosophical alternatives (for instance: "a&amp;nbsp;[[Humanism|humanist]] life&amp;nbsp;stance" or "a [[personism|personist]] life stance" or "a [[Deep Ecology]] life stance"), without discrimination in favour of any.&lt;ref name = "Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;

== Origins of the phrase ==
[[humanism|Humanists]] interested in educational matters apparently coined the [[neologism]] ''life stance'' in the mid-1970s; [[Harry Stopes-Roe]] of the [[Rationalist Association|Rationalist Press Association]] and [[British Humanist Association]] developed the concept originally in that context.&lt;ref&gt;
On "life stance education" see Stopes-Roe (1976), and Stopes-Roe (1983). Compare with the advocacy of "Education in Life Stances" in Cox (1975), on which also see Greer (1985, pp.  16–17)). The British Humanist Association pamphlet, ''Objective, Fair and Balanced'' (1975), includes the text of a letter by Stopes-Roe, printed in the ''Times Educational Supplement'' of 12 July 1974, which refers to "stances for living". It also cites the City of Birmingham's ''Agreed Syllabus of Religious Education'', dated 7 May 1974: "it introduces the new term "stance for living". (British Humanist Association, 1975, p. 15). For the related "life stance education" offered to non-religious pupils in Finland, see Slotte (2008).
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term originally arose in the context of debates over the controversial&lt;ref&gt;
Barnes (2008, p. 75), notes that the controversy reached Parliament.  Hull (1984, p. 111) notes that "an attempt was made in the spring of 1976 to introduce a Private Members Bill into the House of Commons which would have replaced religious education by 'Education in Stances for Living'". The Bill was published in "Objective, Fair and Balanced – a new law for religion in education", written by Harry Stopes-Roe and David Pollock for the British Humanist Association (1975)
&lt;/ref&gt; content of the City of [[Birmingham| Birmingham's]] ''Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education'', 1975.  That document referred to "non-religious stances for living". According to Barnes:

{{quote|It was the first syllabus to abandon the aim of Christian nurture and to embrace a multi-faith, phenomenological model of religious education; and it was also the first syllabus to require a ''systematic'' study of non-religious 'stances for living', such as Humanism, and for such study to begin in the primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes (2008, p. 75)
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the late 1980s Harry Stopes-Roe initiated a successful campaign for the adoption of the term by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and by other organisations (see also his comments quoted below on its provenance).&lt;ref&gt;
Stopes-Roe's advocacy of the term outside the literature of religious education was first published as Stopes-Roe (1987), but the article was in circulation at a Board meeting of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] in October 1987 (See Walter 1988a, p. 4). The article was reprinted in ''New Humanist'' (Stopes Roe 1988a) and Kurtz (1989). Stopes-Roe revisited the subject in Stopes-Roe (1996), and wrote the article on "Life stance" for the ''New Encyclopedia of Unbelief'' (Stopes-Roe 2007). See also the statement "[http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more Humanism is eight letters, no more]", signed by [[H.J. Blackham|Harold Blackham]], [[Levi Fragell]], [[Corliss Lamont]], [[Harry Stopes-Roe]], and [[Rob Tielman]].
&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was not an uncontroversial proposal among humanists.&lt;ref name = "needforlifestance"&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p. 21) commented that "I have found the degree of opposition to the term "life stance" among Humanists more surprising than the religionist's objection." See also the overview of the debate between Walter (1988a and 1988b) and Stopes-Roe (1988a and 1988b) in Fowler (1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=z5k5A0_nFogC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22life%20stance%22&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22life%20stance%22&amp;f=false pp. 3–4]).
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced as part of an attempt to establish a clear identity for Humanism, in order to gain recognition and respect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more See "Humanism is eight letters, no more"]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stopes-Roe:

{{quote|"Life stance" is an expression that has been current in Britain for more than ten years and is now gaining acceptance worldwide, to describe what is good in both Humanism and religion – without being encumbered by what is bad in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p.19)
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Definition==

Harry Stopes-Roe, who fought for the term's acceptance by the [[Humanism|Humanist]] movement, defined "life stance" as follows:

{{quote|"Life stance" - The style and content of an individual's or a community's relationship with that which is of ultimate importance; the presuppositions and commitments of this, and the consequences for living which flow from it. (Each individual or community hopes that it has come to a good and well-founded relationship, but the word is usually used without implying that this really is so).|[[Harry Stopes-Roe]]&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The British Humanist Association, drawing in part on jurisprudence related to the term "religion or belief" in the European Convention on Human Rights, has put forward a more analytical definition:

{{quote|A collective belief that attains a sufficient level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance and that relates the nature of life and the world to morality, values and/or the way its believers should live.|[[British Humanist Association]]&lt;ref&gt;
Memorandum from the BHA to the Charity Commission on Religion and Non-Religious Beliefs in Charity Law, August 2007: see http://www.humanism.org.uk/documents/3917&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Orthography==
A life stance may be distinguished from general support of a cause by [[capitalization]] of the first letter. For instance, the life stance of Humanism is distinguished from [[humanism]] generally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/DoerrND02.htm Humanism Unmodified] By Edd Doerr. Published in the ''Humanist'' (November/December 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Many life stances may contain humanism to a greater or lesser extent as [[instrumental value]] in order to fulfill their own chosen [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value(s)]]. However, Humanism regards it as having intrinsic value.

Not all life stances use this orthography.

==Spectrum==
The term was intended to be a ''shared'' label encompassing both [[religion]]s and alternatives to religion, without discrimination in favour of either.&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;

A life stance differs from a [[World view|worldview]] or a belief system in that the term ''life stance'' emphasizes a focus on what is of ultimate importance. Life stance differs from [[eupraxsophy]] in that the latter typically implies a strictly non-theistic outlook, whereas a life stance can be theistic or non-theistic, supernaturalistic or naturalistic.

===Religious life stances===
{{Main|Religion}}
A ''religion'' is a set of beliefs and practices, often centered upon specific supernatural and/or moral claims about [[reality]], the [[cosmos]], and [[human nature]], and often codified as [[prayer]], [[ritual]], and [[law]].  Religion also encompasses ancestral or cultural [[tradition]]s, writings, history, and [[mythology]], as well as personal [[faith]] and [[mysticism|mystic experience]]. The term "religion" refers to both the personal practices related to communal faith and to group rituals and communication stemming from shared conviction.

In the frame of [[European religious thought]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane - Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; religions present a common quality, the "hallmark of patriarchal religious thought": the division of the world in two comprehensive domains, [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|one sacred, the other profane]].&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1976, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is often described as a communal system for the coherence of belief focusing on a system of thought, unseen being, person, or object, that is considered to be [[supernatural]], sacred, [[Divinity|divine]], or of the highest [[truth]].  
[[Moral code]]s, practices, values, institutions, tradition, [[philosophy]], rituals, and [[scripture]]s are often traditionally associated with the core belief. Religion is also often described as a "[[way of life]]".

===Non-religious life stances===
{{Further|Irreligion|Secular religion}}
Alternatives to religion include life stances based on [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]], [[deism]], [[Religious skepticism|skepticism]], [[freethought]], [[pantheism]], [[secular humanism]], [[spiritual but not religious]] (SBNR), [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], [[existentialism]], modern incarnations of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]], or general [[secularism]].

====Humanism====

[[Humanism]] is an example of life stance which may be considered to be religious (usually in a non-theistic, ethical sense) or non-religious or anti-religious. One of Stopes-Roe's reasons for advocating the adoption of "life stance" as a label for the Humanist movement, was his hope that it would end the arguments between the different sides as to how best to characterise their position (note that Stopes-Roe uses the term "god-religious" to distinguish theists from non-theists in what follows):

{{quote|Humanists are divided into two camps... according to how they respond to the word "religion". Do they... respond negatively or positively? The ferocity of the antipathy on the one hand, and the power of the concern on the other, that is generated by this word quite obliterates reasoned discussion of many substantial and important questions on how we should develop Humanism. Likewise, our discussions with the god-religious are confused and frustrated. We need a new term for the idea and ideal of religion, opened out so that it is not discriminatory. Let this be "life stance". Could we, perhaps, bury the hatchet of "religion" and work together?&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;}}

Bill Cooke comments:
{{quote|Harry Stopes-Roe's contribution is significant because it makes clear humanism's value as a legitimate system of belief, without it being a pseudo-religion.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke 2003 (p. 223)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8969">{{sociology}} 
'''Manifest and latent functions''' are [[social concept|social scientific concepts]] created by anthropologist, Bronislaw Malinowski in 1922 while studying the Trobiand Islanders in the Western Pacific. It was later modified for [[sociology]] by [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diligio.com/notes26.htm Diligio, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Merton appeared interested in sharpening the conceptual tools to be employed in a [[Structural functionalism|functional analysis]].  

Manifest [[Structural functionalism|function]]s are conscious, deliberate and beneficial, the latent ones the unconscious, unintended and beneficial, and [[Dysfunction (sociology)|dysfunctions]] are unconscious, unintended and harmful. &lt;ref name=B63&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/or/sociologyshop/manlat.html Berger, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; While functions are intended (manifest) or unintended (latent), and have a positive effect on [[society]], dysfunctions are unintended or unrecognized (latent) and have a negative effect on society.&lt;ref name=Betal2004&gt;[Brinkerhoff et al. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify| reason=The ideas in the paragraph are hard to follow|date=July 2016}}

==Functions==
Manifest [[Structural functionalism|functions]] are the consequences that people observe or expect. It is explicitly stated and understood by the participants in the relevant action. The manifest function of a [[rain dance]], used as an example by Merton in his 1967 '' [[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'', is to produce [[rain]], and this outcome is intended and desired by people participating in the ritual.&lt;ref name=M57&gt;[http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/TheoryWeb/Merton.htm Merton, 1957]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M2001&gt;[http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/ecologic.htm M.D. Murphy, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Latent functions are those that are neither recognized nor intended. A latent function of a behavior is not explicitly stated, recognized, or intended by the people involved. Thus, they are identified observers.&lt;ref name=M2001/&gt; In the example of rain ceremony, the latent function [[reinforce]]s the [[group identity]] by providing a regular opportunity for the members of a [[group (sociology)|group]] to meet and engage in a common activity.&lt;ref name=M57/&gt;

[[Peter L. Berger]] describes a series of examples illustrating the differences between manifest functions and latent dysfunctions:
{{cquote|"...the “manifest” function of antigambling legislation may be to suppress gambling, its “latent” function to create an illegal empire for the gambling syndicates. Or Christian missions in parts of Africa “manifestly” tried to convert Africans to Christianity, “latently” helped to destroy the indigenous tribal cultures and this provided an important impetus towards rapid social transformation. Or the control of the Communist Party over all sectors of social life in Russia “manifestly” was to assure the continued dominance of the revolutionary ethos, “latently” created a new class of comfortable bureaucrats uncannily bourgeois in its aspirations and increasingly disinclined toward the self-denial of Bolshevik dedication (''nomenklatura''). Or the “manifest” function of many voluntary associations in America is sociability and public service, the “latent” function to attach status indices to those permitted to belong to such associations.” "&lt;ref name=B63/&gt;}}

While [[Talcott Parsons]] tends to emphasize the manifest functions of [[social behavior]], Merton sees attention to latent functions as increasing the understanding of society: the distinction between manifest and latent forces the [[sociologist]] to go beyond the reasons individuals give for their actions or for the existence of [[Tradition|customs]] and [[institution]]s; it makes them look for other [[social consequence]]s that allow these practices’ survival and illuminate the way society works.

== Dysfunctions ==
[[Dysfunction (sociology)|Dysfunction]]s can also be manifest or latent. While functions are intended or recognized (manifest), and may have a positive effect on society, dysfunctions are unintended or unrecognized, and have a negative effect on society.&lt;ref name=Betal2004/&gt;

Manifest dysfunctions are anticipated disruptions of social life. For example, a manifest dysfunction of a [[festival]] might include disruptions of transportation and excessive production of garbage.&lt;ref name=f2005&gt;[Ferrante, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Latent dysfunctions are unintended and unanticipated disruptions of order and stability. In the festival example, they would be represented by people missing work due to the traffic jam.&lt;ref name=f2005/&gt;

== Medical science model ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2013}}
Broadly stated and here relying on the systems model first developed in medical science, an interrelated bundle of [[social structure]]s (e.g., [[Zulu culture]]), treated as a [[social system]], involves the parts (structural elements) acting in such a fashion so as to help maintain the [[homeodynamic]] equilibrium of the system of which they are an element. Manifest [[Structural functionalism|functions]] are the obvious and intended consequences a structural feature displays in the maintenance of the steady state of the system of which it is a part. Latent functions are less obvious or [[unintended consequence]]s. Both manifest and latent functions contribute to the social system’s unchanging ongoingness or stasis. In this very specific sense both may be interpreted as useful and positive.

In conducting a functional analysis, '''dysfunctions''' are consequences of structural elements that produce changes in their environing social system. The flame of the candle system flickers. The structural cause would be labeled dysfunctional. The candle’s steady state has been disturbed or changed. The concept affords the only relief to structural-functionalism’s inherent conservative bias. Dysfunction signifies the mechanism by which social change is evidenced within a social system.  Whether that change is manifest or latent is a relatively simple empirical question. Whether that change is good or bad would seem to require interpretative criteria not afforded by a social scientific paradigm for functional analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12544">In economics, the '''marginal product of labor''' ('''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the change in output that results from employing an added unit of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin  | title = Economics: Principles in Action | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2003 | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ  | page = 108 | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[marginal product]] of a [[factor of production]] is generally defined as the change in output associated with a change in that factor, holding other inputs into production constant.

The marginal product of labor is then the change in output (''Y'') per unit change in labor (''L''). In discrete terms the marginal product of labor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta Y} {\Delta L}.&lt;/math&gt;

In continuous terms, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the first [[derivative]] of the [[production function]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial Y} {\partial L}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Perloff173"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphically, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the slope of the production function.

==Examples==
[[File:Marginal Product of Labor1 copy.png|frame|right|Marginal product of labor table (EDIT: Marginal Product of Labor at Labor = 7 is 4 not 3)]]

There is a factory which produces toys. When there are no workers in the factory, no toys are produced. When there is one worker in the factory, six toys are produced per hour. When there are two workers in the factory, eleven toys are produced per hour. There is a marginal product of labor of five when there are two workers in the factory compared to one. When the marginal product of labor is increasing, this is called [[increasing marginal returns]]. However, as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor may not increase indefinitely. When not [[scale (social sciences)|scale]]d properly, the marginal product of labor may go down when the number of employees goes up, creating a situation known as [[diminishing marginal returns]]. When the marginal product of labor becomes negative, it is known as [[negative marginal returns]].

==Marginal costs==

The marginal product of labor is directly related to [[Cost-of-production theory of value|costs of production]]. [[Cost]]s are divided between [[Fixed cost|fixed]] and [[variable cost]]s. Fixed costs are costs that relate to the fixed input, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], or ''rK'', where ''r'' is the rental cost of capital and ''K'' is the quantity of capital. Variable costs (VC) are the costs of the variable input, labor, or ''wL'', where ''w'' is the wage rate and ''L'' is the amount of labor employed. Thus, VC = wL . Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost per unit change in output or ∆C/∆Q. In the short run, production can be varied only by changing the variable input. Thus only variable costs change as output increases:  ∆C = ∆VC = ∆(wL). Marginal cost is ∆(Lw)/∆Q. Now, ∆L/∆Q is the reciprocal of the marginal product of labor  (∆Q/∆L). Therefore, marginal cost is simply the wage rate w divided by the marginal product of labor

:MC = ∆VC∕∆Q;
:∆VC = w∆L;
:∆L∕∆Q (the change in quantity of labor to effect a one unit change in output) = 1∕MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Therefore MC = w ∕ MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

Thus if the marginal product of labor is rising then marginal costs will be falling and if the marginal product of labor is falling marginal costs will be rising (assuming a constant wage rate).&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R. and D. Rubinfeld, ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed. Prentice-Hall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;==

The average product of labor is the total product of labor divided by the number of units of labor employed, or ''Q/L''.&lt;ref name="Perloff173"/&gt; The average product of labor is a common measure of labor productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W. and C. Snyder, ''Intermediate Microeconomics'', Thomson 2007, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W., ''Microeconomic Theory'', 9th ed. Thomson 2005, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is shaped like an inverted “u”. At low production levels the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tends to increase as additional labor is added. The primary reason for the increase is specialization and division of labor.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; At the point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; reaches its maximum value  AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Binger, B. and E. Hoffman, ''Microeconomics with Calculus'', 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley 1998, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; falls.

During the early stages of production MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will increase. Eventually the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' reaches it maximum value at the point of diminishing returns. Beyond this point MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease. However, at the point of diminishing returns the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is still above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will continue to increase until MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is below AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease.

Graphically, the ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' curve can be derived from the total product curve by drawing secants from the origin that intersect (cut) the total product curve. The slope of the secant line equals the average product of labor, where the slope = dQ/dL.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"/&gt; The slope of the curve at each intersection marks a point on the average product curve. The slope increases until the line reaches a point of tangency with the total product curve. This point marks the maximum average product of labor. It also marks the point where MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (which is the slope of the total product curve)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Microeconomics|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1429277914|authorlink=Paul Krugman|author2=Robin Wells |authorlink2=Robin Wells (economist) |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; equals the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (the slope of the secant).&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus page 177. Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the slope of the secants become progressively smaller as ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' declines. The MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve intersects the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve from above at the maximum point of the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve. Thereafter, the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is below the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve.

==Diminishing marginal returns==

The falling MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. The law states, "as units of one input are added (with all other inputs held constant) a point will be reached where the resulting additions to output will begin to decrease; that is marginal product will decline."&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"&gt;Samuelson, W. and S. Marks, ''Managerial Economics'', 4th ed. Wiley 2003, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The law of diminishing marginal returns applies regardless of whether the production function exhibits increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale. The key factor is that the variable input is being changed while all other factors of production are being held constant. Under such circumstances diminishing marginal returns are inevitable at some level of production.&lt;ref name="Varian1992"&gt;[[Hal Varian]], ''Microeconomic Analysis'', 3rd ed. Norton 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminishing marginal returns differs from diminishing returns. Diminishing marginal returns means that the marginal product of the variable input is falling. Diminishing returns occur when the marginal product of the variable input is negative. That is when a unit increase in the variable input causes total product to fall. At the point that diminishing returns begin the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Perloff178"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and profit maximization==

The general rule is that a firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where [[marginal revenue]] equals marginal costs. The [[profit maximization]] issue can also be approached from the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the variable input? To maximize profits the firm should increase usage "up to the point where the input’s marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs". So, mathematically the profit maximizing rule is MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; The marginal profit per unit of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor minus the marginal cost of labor or Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;A firm maximizes profits where Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

The marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in the variable input assume labor.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; That is, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆TR/∆L. MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the product of marginal revenue and the marginal product of labor or MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

*Derivation:
:MR = ∆TR/∆Q
:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L
:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) × (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

===Example===

*Assume that the production function is &lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"/&gt;
	•	&lt;math&gt; MC_L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;

	•	Output price is $40 per unit.
:&lt;math&gt; MP_L = 90 - 2L &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 40(90 - 2L) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 3600 - 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = MC_L &lt;/math&gt; (Profit Max Rule)
:&lt;math&gt; 3600 - 80L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 3570 = 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt;
:44.625 is the profit maximizing number of workers.
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90(44.625) - (44.625)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q= 4016.25 - 1991.39 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 2024.86 &lt;/math&gt;
:Thus, the profit maximizing output is 2025 units
	•	And the profit is
:&lt;math&gt; TR - TC = \Pi &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 40(2025) - 30(2025) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 81,000 - 60,750 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 20,250 &lt;/math&gt;

* Some might be confused by the fact that &lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt; as intuition would say that labor should be discrete. Remember, however, that labor is actually a time measure as well. Thus, it can be thought of as a worker not working the entire hour.

==Marginal productivity ethics==

In the aftermath of the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]] in economics, a number of economists including [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Thomas Nixon Carver]] sought to derive an ethical theory of income distribution based on the idea that workers were morally entitled to receive a wage exactly equal to their marginal product. In the 20th century, marginal productivity ethics found few supporters among economists, being criticised not only by egalitarians but by economists associated with the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] such as [[Frank Knight]] (in ''The Ethics of Competition'') and the [[Austrian School]], such as [[Leland Yeager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1663&amp;chapter=37668&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Can a Liberal Be an Equalitarian?

Yeager - Toward Liberty: Essays in Honor of Ludwig von Mises, vol. 2 |publisher=Online Library of Liberty |date=1971-09-29 |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, marginal productivity ethics were defended by [[George Stigler]].

The '''National Museum of Iraq''' ([[Arabic]]: المتحف العراقي) is a museum located in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].  Also known as the '''Iraq Museum''', it contains precious relics from the [[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Babylonia]]n and [[Persia]]n civilization. It was [[Archaeological looting in Iraq|looted]] during and after the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. Despite international efforts, only some of the stolen artifacts were returned. After being closed for many years while being refurbished, and rarely open for public viewing, the museum was officially reopened in February 2015.

==Foundation==
After [[World War I]], [[archaeology|archaeologists]] from [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] began several excavations throughout Iraq. In an effort to keep those findings from leaving Iraq, British traveller, intelligence agent, archaeologist, and author [[Gertrude Bell]] began collecting the artifacts in a government building in Baghdad in 1922. In 1926, the Iraqi government moved the collection to a new building and established the Baghdad Antiquities Museum, with Bell as its director.&lt;ref name = "Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/405113/National-Museum-of-Iraq "National Museum of Iraq"].  [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Retrieved February 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Bell died later that year; the new director was [[Sidney Smith (Assyriologist)|Sidney Smith]].

In 1966, the collection was moved again, to a two-story, {{convert|45000|m2|sqft|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us}} building in Baghdad's Al-Ṣāliḥiyyah neighborhood in the [[Karkh|Al-Karkh]] district on the east side of the [[Tigris|Tigris River]]. It is with this move that the name of the museum was changed to the National Museum of Iraq. It was originally known as the Baghdad Archaeological Museum.

==Collections==
[[File:Hrs KAP 0054.jpg|thumb|right|Exhibit during renovations in 2007]]
Due to the archaeological riches of Mesopotamia, its collections are considered to be among the most important in the world and has a fine record of scholarship and display. The British connection with the museum — and with Iraq — has resulted in exhibits always being displayed bilingually, in both [[English language|English]] and [[Arabic]].  It contains important artifacts from the over 5,000-year-long history of Mesopotamia in 28 galleries and vaults.

The collections of the National Museum of Iraq include art and artifacts from ancient [[Sumer]]ian, [[Babylonia]]n, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] and [[Assyria]]n civilizations. The museum also has galleries devoted to collections of both pre-Islamic and Islamic Arabian art and artifacts. Of its many noteworthy collections, the Nimrud gold collection—which features gold jewelry and figures of precious stone that date to the 9th century bce—and the collection of stone carvings and cuneiform tablets from Uruk are exceptional. The Uruk treasures date to between 3500 and 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name = "Britannica"/&gt;

==Damage and losses during 2003 war==
[[File:Iraq National Museum.jpg|220px|thumb|The Iraq National Museum in Baghdad, Iraq, was looted in 2003 but has since reopened. A statue of Nabu, the 8th century BC Assyrian god of wisdom, stands before the building.]]
In the months preceding the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Iraq war]], starting in December and January, various [[antiquities]] experts, including representatives from the [[American Council for Cultural Policy]] asked the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] and the UK government to ensure the museum's safety from both combat and looting. Although promises were not made, U.S. forces did avoid bombing the site.

On April 8, 2003 the last of the museum staff left the museum. Iraqi forces engaged U.S. forces from within the museum, as well as the nearby [[Special Republican Guard]] compound. Lt. Col. Eric Schwartz of the [[U.S. third Infantry Division]] stated that he was unable to enter the compound and secure it since they attempted to avoid returning fire at the building. Sniper positions, discarded ammunition, and 15 Iraqi Army uniforms were later discovered in the building. Iraqi forces had built a fortified wall along the western side of the compound, allowing concealed movement between the front and rear of the museum.&lt;ref name="BogdanosGazette"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bogdanos |first=Matthew |title=Pieces of the Cradle |journal=Marine Corps Gazette |issue=January 2005 |pages=60–66 |publisher=Marine Corps Association |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thefts took place between April 10 and 12, when some staff returned to the building and fended off further attempts by looters to enter the museum until U.S. forces arrived on April 16. A special team headed by Marine Col. [[Matthew Bogdanos]] initiated an investigation on April 21. His investigation indicated that despite claims to the contrary, no U.S. forces had looted the building, and that there were three separate thefts by three distinct groups over the four days. While the staff instituted a storage plan to prevent theft and damage (also used during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] and the first [[Gulf War]]), many larger [[statue]]s, [[stele]]s, and [[frieze]]s had been left in the public galleries, protected with foam and surrounded by [[sandbag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Looting Iraq | author=Poole, Robert M. | publisher=''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' | date=February 2008 | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120703020429/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-03 | accessdate=February 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty pieces were stolen from these galleries, mostly the more valuable ones. Of these 13 had been recovered as of January 2005, including the three most valuable: the [[Warka Vase|Sacred Vase of Warka]] (though broken in fourteen pieces, which was the original state it was found in when first excavated), the [[Mask of Warka]], and the [[Bassetki Statue]].&lt;ref name="BogdanosGazette" /&gt;
 
According to museum officials, the looters concentrated on the heart of the exhibition: "the [[Warka Vase]], a Sumerian alabaster piece more than 5,000 years old; a bronze Uruk statue from the Akkadian period, also 5,000 years old, which weighs 660 pounds; and the headless statue of Entemena. The [[Lyres of Ur|Harp of Ur]] was torn apart by looters who removed its gold inlay."&lt;ref name=thanassis&gt;Thanassis Cambanis and Charles M. Sennott. ''Looters Pillage Babylon Leaving Iraqis, Archeologists Devastated''. The Boston Globe Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News. April 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Among the stolen artifacts is the bronze Bassetki Statue, a life-size statue of a young man, originally found in the village Basitke in the northern part of Iraq, an [[Akkadian Empire]] piece that goes back to 2300 B.C. and the stone statue of King Schalmanezer, from the eighth century B.C.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;Newsweek.

Available: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7169977/site/newsweek/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617150354/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7169977/site/newsweek/ |date=June 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the museum's aboveground storage rooms were looted; the exterior steel doors showed no signs of forced entry. Approximately 3,100 excavation site pieces (jars, vessels, pottery shards, etc.) were stolen, of which over 3,000 have been recovered. The thefts did not appear to be discriminating; for example, an entire shelf of fakes was stolen, while an adjacent shelf of much greater value was undisturbed.&lt;ref name="BogdanosGazette" /&gt;

The third occurrence of theft was in the underground storage rooms, where evidence pointed to an inside job. The thieves attempted to steal the most easily transportable objects, which had been intentionally stored in the most remote location possible. Of the four rooms, the only portion disturbed was a single corner in the furthest room, where cabinets contained 100 small boxes containing [[cylinder seal]]s, beads, and jewelry. Evidence indicated that the thieves possessed keys to the cabinets but dropped them in the dark. Instead, they stole 10,000 small objects that were lying in plastic boxes on the floor. Of them, nearly 2,500 have been recovered.&lt;ref name="BogdanosGazette" /&gt;

One of the most valuable artifacts looted was a headless stone statue of the Sumerian king [[Entemena]] of [[Lagash]].  The Entemena statue, "estimated to be 4,400 years old, is the first significant artifact returned from the United States and by far the most important piece found outside Iraq. American officials declined to discuss how they recovered the statue."&lt;ref name=barry&gt;Barry Meier and James Glanz. Looted treasure returning to Iraq national museum. ''[[The New York Times]]''. July 26, 2006, Available: http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/07/26/news/treasure.php {{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=canadiansumerian&gt;{{cite news |title=Sumerian statue looted from Iraq found by U.S. investigators |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/sumerian-statue-looted-from-iraq-found-by-u-s-investigators-1.614814 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 |work=Arts |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of the king, located in the center of the museum's second-floor Sumerian Hall, weighs hundreds of pounds, making it the heaviest piece stolen from the museum - the looters "probably rolled or slid it down marble stairs to remove it, smashing the steps and damaging other artifacts."&lt;ref name=barry/&gt;&lt;ref name=canadiansumerian/&gt;

The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) announced the recovery of the statue of King Entemena of Lagash on July 25, 2006. The statue was returned to the Iraq government.&lt;ref name=nyt-entemena/&gt; It was recovered in the United States with the help of [[Hicham Aboutaam]], an art dealer in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=nyt-entemena&gt;{{cite news |last1=Meier|first1=Barry|last2=Glanz|first2=James |title=U.S. Helps Recover Statue and Gives It Back to Iraqis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/world/middleeast/26antiquities.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reaction to the looting===
The U.S. government was criticised for doing nothing to protect the museum after occupying Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,835730,00.html Robbing the Cradle of Civilization], [[Deutsche Welle]], April 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Irving Finkel of the [[British Museum]] said the looting was "entirely predictable and could easily have been stopped."{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Martin E. Sullivan]], chairman of the U.S. President's Advisory Committee on Cultural Property, and [[U.S. State Department]] cultural advisers Gary Vikan and Richard S. Lanier resigned in protest at the failure of US forces to prevent the looting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2958009.stm US experts resign over Iraq looting], BBC News, April 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of the looting of Iraq's National Museum has been disputed. Based on a miscommunication by the first crews on the scene, and the empty display cases in the main galleries that in most cases had held objects which museum curators had removed before the invasion, news organizations for weeks reported that as much as 170,000 catalogued lots (501,000 pieces) had been looted, when the true figure was around 15,000 items, including 5,000 extremely valuable cylinder seals.

:On April 12, 2003, The Associated Press reported: "The famed Iraq National Museum, home of extraordinary [[Babylonia]]n, [[Sumer]]ian and [[Assyria]]n collections and rare Islamic texts, sat empty Saturday - except for shattered glass display cases and cracked pottery bowls that littered the floor."

:On April 14, National Public Radio's Robert Siegel announced on All Things Considered: "As it turned out, American troops were but a few hundred yards away as the country's heritage was stripped bare."

Reacting to the incorrect initial reports that the museum was a total loss, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] on April 16, 2003, declared the incident "a crime against humanity."{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Later in 2003, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (of London) reported:

:"Officials at the National Museum of Iraq have blamed shoddy reporting amid the "fog of war" for creating the impression that the majority of the institution's 170,000 items were looted in the aftermath of the fall of Baghdad.

:A carefully prepared storage plan, used in the Iran–Iraq War and the first Persian Gulf War, ensured that tens of thousands of pieces were saved, they said. They now believe that the number of items taken was in the low thousands, and possibly hundreds." That report was clearly itself radically understating the actual number of items looted, which is now agreed to have been around 15,000. {{clarify|date=September 2014}}

When asked why the U.S. military did not try to guard the museum in the days after the invasion succeeded, Gen. [[Richard Myers]], chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said "If you remember, when some of that looting was going on, people were being killed, people were being wounded&amp;nbsp;... It's as much as anything else a matter of priorities." Civil Affairs expert William Sumner, who was tasked with handling arts, monuments, and archives, explained that the postwar Civil Affairs planners "didn't foresee the marines as going out and assigning marine units as security&amp;nbsp;... The issue of archaeological sites was considered a targeting problem," to be dealt with by those flying bombing missions.&lt;ref&gt;Rothfield, Lawrence ''The Rape of Mespotamia'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2009), 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], speaking about the museum's looting, said "stuff happens"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/08/donald-rumsfeld-book-misstatements-wmd Donald Rumsfeld book admits 'misstatements' over WMD sites], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and "to try to pass off the fact of that unfortunate activity to a deficit in the war plan strikes me as a stretch", and described the period of looting in general as "untidiness".  Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] said, "The United States understands its obligations and will be taking a leading role with respect to antiquities in general but this museum in particular."

Two weeks after the museum thefts, when major news outlets still were reporting most of the museum's artifacts were gone, Dr. [[Donny George Youkhanna]], General Director Research Studies for the Board of Antiquities in Iraq, said of the looting, "It's the crime of the century, because it affects the heritage of all mankind". After the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] set up headquarters in Baghdad's [[Palestine Hotel]], Dr. Youkhanna said he went there to plead for troops to protect the remainder of the Museum collection, but no guards were sent for another three days. Whether or not this was due to continued fighting is unclear.

===Attempts to recover lost items===
A few days later, agents of the [[FBI]] were sent to Iraq to search for stolen Museum property. [[UNESCO]] organized an emergency meeting of antiquities experts on April 17, 2003 in Paris to deal with the aftermath of the looting and its effects on the global art and antiquities market.

On April 18, 2003, the Baghdad Museum Project was formed in the United States with a proposal to assure the National Museum of Iraq every possibility of the eventual safe return of its collection, even if that is to take hundreds of years. Rather than focus only on law enforcement and the current antiquities market, the group set its mission as being to (1) establish a comprehensive online catalog of all cultural artifacts in the museum's collection, (2) create a virtual Baghdad Museum that is accessible to the general public over the Internet, (3) build a 3D collaborative workspace within the virtual Baghdad Museum for design and fundraising purposes, and (4) establish a resource center within the virtual Baghdad Museum for community cultural development.  Various ancient items believed looted from the museum have surfaced in [[Jordan]], Lebanon, the United States, [[Switzerland]], and [[Japan]], and on [[eBay]].

On May 7, 2003, U.S. officials announced that nearly 40,000 [[manuscript]]s and 700 [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s belonging to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad were recovered by [[United States|U.S.]] Customs agents working with museum experts in Iraq. Some looters had returned items after promises of rewards and amnesty, and many items previously reported missing had actually been hidden in secret storage vaults at the museum prior to the outbreak of war. On June 7, 2003, U.S. authorities announced that world-famous treasures of [[Nimrud]] were recovered from a secret vault in the [[Iraqi Central Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-14738523.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The artifacts included necklaces, plates, gold earrings, finger and toe rings, bowls and flasks.  Officials said that of the 170,000 items initially believed missing, just 3,000 remained unaccounted for. And, of those, 47 were main exhibition artifacts. In November, 2003 Coalition officials reported a few dozen of the most important items remained missing from the museum's public galleries, along with another 10,000 other items—most of them tiny and some of them fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/07/03/iraq.museum/index.html |work=CNN |title=Iraq briefly reopens looted museum |date=July 3, 2003 |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate figure is now estimated at around 15,000 and the tiny items include some of the most valuable artifacts on the antiquities markets.

The museum has been protected since its looting, but archaeological sites in Iraq were left almost entirely unprotected by coalition forces, and there has been massive looting, especially in the period just before the invasion (when Saddam Hussein pulled forces away from site protection) and between summer 2003 and the end of 2007. Estimates are that 400–600,000 artifacts have been plundered. Iraqi sculptor [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]] spearheaded efforts by the Iraqi artist community to recover artworks looted from the museum.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael S. |last=Schmidt |title=Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Iraqi Sculptor, Dies at 82  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/arts/design/mohammed-ghani-hikmat-iraqi-sculptor-dies-at-82.html |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 150 of Hikmat's pieces were stolen from the museum alone.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Hikmat's group has recovered approximately 100 of the museum's works, as of September 2011.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Recent work==
At various Iraq reconstruction conferences, the Baghdad Museum Project gave presentations to the reconstruction community advocating preservation of Iraq's cultural heritage in rebuilding projects. On August 27, 2006, Iraq's museum director Dr. [[Donny Youkhanna]] fled the country to [[Syria]], claiming "pressure to follow a radical Islamic agenda in the preservation of Iraqi antiquities made his position impossible.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5289046.stm Leading Iraq archaeologist flees], BBC News, August 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Youkhanna held the position of [[visiting professor]] in the anthropology department of [[Stony Brook State University of New York]] until his death in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grad.sunysb.edu/newsletter/George%20Youkhanna.htm Renowned Iraqi Scholar, Dr. Donny George Youkhanna, Appointed to Faculty at Stony Brook], The Graduate Review.

Google's [[Google Street View|Street View]] service was used to image much of the museum's exhibit areas and, as of November 2011, these images are online.

==Reopening==
The museum has opened its doors on only a dozen times since September 1980 during the Iran-Iraq War. Since the invasion, it has opened only rarely, opened on July 3, 2003 for several hours for a visit by journalists and Coalition Provisional Authority head J. [[Paul Bremer]], as a signal that things were returning to normal. In December 2008, the museum was opened for a photo opportunity for Ahmad Chalabi, who returned a number of artifacts supposedly handed in to him by Iraqis. The latest opening occurred on February 23, 2009, at the behest of Iraqi prime minister Maliki, to demonstrate that things were returning to normal. Many archaeological officials protested against this opening, arguing that conditions were not yet safe enough to put the museum at risk; the museum's director was fired for airing her objections.

In a ceremony to mark the occasion, Qahtan Abbas, Iraq's tourism and antiquities minister, said that only 6,000 of the 15,000 items looted in 2003 had been returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/02/2009223113058162790.html Iraq reopens looted national museum ] Aljazeera. March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In a book published in 2009, it was estimated that 600,000 archaeological pieces were looted by Kurdish and Shia militias allied with the United States since 2003&lt;ref name=ucp-rothfield&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence |title=The Rape of Mesopotamia: Behind the Looting of the Iraq Museum |date=April 2009 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-72945-9 |edition=1 |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo5825985.html |accessdate=1 March 2015}} E-book {{ISBN|978-0-226-72943-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 Iraqi officials announced the renovated museum will permanently reopen in November, protected by new climate control and security systems.

''[[Science Magazine]]'', 26 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official reopening ===
On February 28, 2015 the museum was officially reopened by Iraqi Prime Minister [[Haider al-Abadi]].&lt;ref name=bbc-re-open&gt;{{cite news |title=Looted Iraqi Museum in Baghdad reopens 12 years on |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31672857 |accessdate=1 March 2015 |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also has items taken from the [[Mosul Museum]], as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant| ISIS]] has taken it over.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Recovery==
On September 7, 2010, the Associated Press reported that 540 looted treasures were returned to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wvgazette.com/ap/ApInternational/201009071106?page=2&amp;build=cache |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406094018/http://wvgazette.com/ap/ApInternational/201009071106?page=2&amp;build=cache |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/09/07/100218/looted-treasures-returned-to-iraq.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theworld.org/2010/09/prized-treasures-return-to-iraq/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401163435/http://www.theworld.org/2010/09/prized-treasures-return-to-iraq/ |archivedate=2011-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

638 stolen artifacts were returned to the Iraqi National Museum after they were located in the office of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11372473 | work=BBC News | title=Missing Iraqi antiquities located in PM Maliki's office | date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2012, a 6,500-year-old Sumerian gold jar, the head of a Sumerian battle axe and a stone from an Assyrian palace were among 45 relics returned to Iraq by Germany. Up to 10,000 of the National Museum pieces are still missing, said Amira Eidan, general director of the museum at the time of the recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kami, Aseel (January 30, 2012) [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/30/us-iraq-artefacts-idUSTRE80T12J20120130  "Sumerian gold jar, other relics returned to Iraq"] Reuters Retrieved February 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Necklacing''' is the practice of [[extrajudicial]] [[summary execution]] and torture carried out by forcing a rubber [[tire|tyre]], filled with [[Gasoline|petrol]], around a victim's chest and arms, and setting it on [[fire]]. The victim may take up to 20 minutes to die, suffering severe burns in the process.&lt;ref name="urlDeath By Tire Fire: A History Of Necklacing In Apartheid South Africa"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://allthatsinteresting.com/necklacing |title=Death By Tire Fire: A History Of "Necklacing" In Apartheid South Africa |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In South Africa==
Necklacing was used by the black community to punish its members who were perceived as collaborators with the apartheid government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Human Being Died That Night: Forgiving Apartheid's Chief Killer|author=Pumla Godobo-Madikizela|year=2006|publisher=Portobello Books|page=147|ISBN=1-84627-053-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Necklacing primarily police informants; the practice was often carried out in the name of the struggle, although the ANC executive body condemned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1991/southafrica1/6.htm|title=The Black Struggle for Political Power: Major Forces in the Conflict|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fihlani|first=Pumza|title=Is necklacing returning to South Africa?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14914526|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 December 2013|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Winnie Mandela]], then-wife of the imprisoned [[Nelson Mandela]], stated, "With our boxes of matches, and our necklaces, we shall liberate this country", which was widely seen as an explicit endorsement of necklacing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winnie Madikizela-Mandela|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/winnie-madikizela-mandela|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://century.guardian.co.uk/1980-1989/Story/0,,110268,00.html|title=Row over 'mother of the nation' Winnie Mandela|work=The Guardian|date=27 January 1989|author=David Beresford |accessdate=2008-05-01|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which at the time caused the ANC to distance itself from her,&lt;ref name="africafiles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Winnie Madikizela Mandela: Tragic figure?

The first victim of necklacing, according to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, was a young woman, [[Maki Skosana]], on 20 July 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/hrvtrans/duduza/moloko.htm |title=Truth And Reconciliation Commission |publisher=Doj.gov.za |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Moloko said her sister was burned to death with a tire around her neck while attending the funeral of one of the youths. Her body had been scorched by fire and some broken pieces of glass had been inserted into her vagina, Moloko told the committee. Moloko added that a big rock had been thrown on her face after she had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/media/1997/9702/s970204c.htm|date=4 February 1997|publisher=SAPA|title=Truth Commission Looks at First "Necklace" Murder|accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Photojournalist [[Kevin Carter]] was the first to photograph a public execution by necklacing in South Africa in the mid-1980s. He later spoke of the images: {{quote|I was appalled at what they were doing. I was appalled at what I was doing. But then people started talking about those pictures ... then I felt that maybe my actions hadn't been at all bad. Being a witness to something this horrible wasn't necessarily such a bad thing to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timporter.com/firstdraft/archives/000071.html|title=Covering War in a Free Society|date=18 February 2003|accessdate=2008-02-18|author=Tim Porter}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He went on to say: {{quote|After having seen so many necklacings on the news, it occurs to me that either many others were being performed (off camera as it were) and this was just the tip of the iceberg, or that the presence of the camera completed the last requirement, and acted as a catalyst in this terrible reaction. The strong message that was being sent, was only meaningful if it were carried by the media. It was not more about the warning (others) than about causing one person pain. The question that haunts me is 'would those people have been necklaced, if there was no media coverage?'}}

Author Lynda Schuster writes, {{quote|"Necklacing" represented the worst of the excesses committed in the name of the uprising. This was a particularly gruesome form of mob justice, reserved for those thought to be government collaborators, informers and black policemen. The executioners would force a car tire over the head and around the arms of the suspect, drench it in petrol, and set it alight. Immobilized, the victim burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vhsim3fPF8C&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304|title=A Burning Hunger: One Family's Struggle Against Apartheid|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2004|author=Lynda Schuster&lt;!--|isbn=9780821416518--&gt;|isbn=9780821416525|page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some commentators have noted that the practice of necklacing served to escalate the levels of violence during the township wars of the 1980s and early 1990s as security force members became brutalized and afraid that they might fall victim to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Turton, A.R. 2010.

==In other countries==
This practice of [[lynching]] is found in [[Haiti]]. It was prominently used against supporters of [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]'s dictatorship at the beginning of the democratic transition, from 1986 to 1990.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.

In the early years of 1960, when the seeds of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War|ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka]] ([[Sri Lankan Civil War]]) related to [[Eelam]] were being sown, [[Sinhala people|Sinhala]] rioters used necklacing in [[Sri Lankan Civil War|anti Tamil riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Subramaniam|first1=Samantha|title=This Divided Island|date=5 February 2015|publisher=Atlantic books|isbn=9780857895950|url=http://bookshop.theguardian.com/this-divided-island.html|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|title=This Divided Island: Stories from the Sri Lankan War review – a moving portrayal of the agonies of the conflict|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/09/this-divided-island-stories-from-sri-lankan-war-review-moving-portrayal-samanth-subramanian|accessdate=5 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the assassination of Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] by her [[Sikh]] bodyguards on October 31, 1984 this technique was applied on Sikhs by mobs. https://harperbroadcast.com/2015/07/16/tyres-the-unusual-weapon-used-during-the-1984-riots/

In the early 1990s, university students in [[Abidjan]], [[Cote d'Ivoire]], were plagued by burglars stealing from their dormitories. The students took matters into their own hands by capturing the alleged thieves, and then executed them by placing tyres around their necks and setting the tyres on fire. Ivorian police, powerless to stop these necklacings, could do nothing but stand by and watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert D.|authorlink=Robert D.

In 2006, at least one person died in [[Nigeria]] by necklacing in the deadly [[International reactions to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muslim protests]] over satirical cartoon drawings of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="in-nigeria"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Muslims' rage over cartoons hits Nigeria | journal= [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] | last = Musa |first=Njadvara | url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060219/news_1n19cartoon.html |accessdate=18 September 2009 | date = 19 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Necklacing was also widely used in the armed insurrection led by the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] in Sri Lanka. A graphic description of one such necklacing appears in the book ''The Island of Blood'' by journalist [[Anita Pratap]].

==In popular culture==
* ''[[The Shield]]'' season two villain Armadillo Quintero used necklacing" as a means to kill his enemies.

'''Ohm's acoustic law''', sometimes called the '''acoustic phase law''' or simply '''Ohm's law''', states that a [[music]]al [[sound]] is perceived by the [[ear]] as a set of a number of constituent pure [[harmonic oscillation|harmonic]] tones.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm's law, ''n''.2, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Text-book of Physics | author = A. Wilmer Duff, editor | year = 1912 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U_EzAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA530&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA529,M1 | publisher =  P. Blakiston's Son &amp; Co | location=Philadelphia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was proposed by physicist [[Georg Ohm]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm, G., ''Annalen der Physik'' (1843) 59 513&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] elaborated the law into what is often today known as Ohm's acoustic law, by adding that the quality of a tone depends solely on the number and relative strength of its partial simple tones, and not on their relative phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Science of Musical Sounds | author = Dayton Clarence Miller | publisher = The Macmillan Company | year = 1916 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7f8KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lessons in Elementary Practical Physics, Vol. III, Part 1: Practical Acoustics | author = Charles Lightfoot Barnes | publisher = London: Macmillan and Co. Ltd | year = 1897 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6TQIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA161,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Helmholtz championed the law in opposition to contrary evidence expounded by [[August Seebeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Combination Tones and Other Related Auditory Phenomena | publisher = University of Chicago | year = 1908 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BUEIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA128,M1 | author = Joseph Peterson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law has also been interpreted as "a pitch corresponding to a certain frequency can only be heard if the acoustical wave contains power at that frequency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Acoustics and psychoacoustics | author = David M. Howard, Jamie A. S. Angus | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-240-51995-1 | page = 123 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yyk5nAIJcBcC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=intitle:Acoustics+intitle:and+intitle:Psychoacoustics+ohm+law&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=5bxlSby6B5CQkQSJlpznAQ#PPA123,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws are true to the extent that the ear is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the acoustic waves, and further, is able to resolve the differences in their frequency. In modern times, the sensitivity of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] to the phase of tone components has been extensively investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Loudspeaker and Headphone Handbook | author = John Borwick | publisher = Focal Press | isbn = 0-240-51578-1 | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pAOFt1znYr8C&amp;pg=PA655&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+acoustic+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=NAiHR_CaNp6ktgP_i4zQBQ&amp;sig=1OIFUWDCMTIUILOZrnaa5j3ef9M#PPA655,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Controversy has led to this characterization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =  Foundations of Modern Auditory Theory | editor = Jerry V. Tobias | publisher = Academic Press | volume = 1 | author = W. Dixon Ward | chapter = Musical Perception |year = 1970 | page = 438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For years musicians have been told that the ear is able to separate any complex signal into a series of sinusoidal signals – that it acts as a [[Fourier analysis|Fourier analyzer]].  This quarter-truth, known as Ohm's Other Law, has served to increase the distrust with which perceptive musicians regard scientists, since it is readily apparent to them that the ear acts in this way only under very restricted conditions.|W.

'''''R v Ryan''''' [2013] SCC 3 is a case concerning the availability of [[duress]] in the context of [[domestic violence]].

==Background==
Nicole Doucet Ryan (now Nicole Doucet) alleged that she was subject to repeated abuse and torment by her husband, Michael Ryan. At trial, the trial judge accepted she was subject to such abuse. The husband was never called to testify.   
In September 2007, Ms. Doucet began to think about having her husband murdered. Over the course of the next seven months, she spoke to at least three men whom she hoped would kill him. In December 2007 or January 2008, she paid one man $25,000 to carry out the killing, but he then refused, demanding more compensation. She approached another person and was contacted by a third, an undercover RCMP officer, posing as a “hit man”. On March 27, 2008, she met with this individual and agreed to pay him to kill her husband. The agreed upon price was $25,000, with $2,000 paid in cash that day. The killing was to take place the coming weekend. Later that same night, she provided an address and a picture of her husband to the “hit man.” Shortly after, she was arrested and charged with counselling the commission of an offence not committed contrary to s. 464(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.

At trial, there was no issue that the elements of the offence had been proved and the trial judge, Farrar J. (as he then was), indicated that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the requisite elements of the offence of counselling the commission of an offence had been established. He based this conclusion on the Ms. Doucet’s admission that the Crown had proved a prima facie case and on the audio and video tapes of recorded conversations with the undercover officer and a statement made on arrest. The only issue at trial was whether Ms. Doucet’s otherwise criminal acts were excused because of duress. The accused had raised that the common law defence of duress applied. The Crown argued that on the facts of this case, the components of duress were not present.  But it did not argue at trial, as it did later on appeal, that the defence of duress was not available in law to the accused. The trial judge accepted her version and acquitted her on the basis she had established she was acting under duress. 

The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal unanimously upheld her acquittal.

==Reasons of the court==
The Court allowed the Crown appeal. The majority entered a stay while the dissenting judge, Fish J., would have ordered a new trial, leaving it to the Crown to determine whether a retrial was in the public interest.

The Court accepted the facts found by the trial judge. The only issue was whether the defence of duress was available. The Court accepted the Crown’s argument, which was made for the first time, that duress was not available. Duress is available when one is compelled to commit a crime against an innocent third party. In this case, given the facts found by the trial judge, the husband would not be an innocent victim. Rather he would be the author of his own misfortune. Moreover, Ms. Doucet was never compelled to act as she did. The Court alluded to the possibility of invoking self-defence as a possible defence.

Fish J. found the granting of the stay of proceedings was inappropriate. He would have ordered a new trial. Any further defence advanced by the accused could be made then.

==Reactions==
Following the release of the decision on January 18, 2013, Michael Ryan, ex-husband of the accused denied any of the allegations made. He emphasized he was in attendance at court in response to a subpoena, but the Crown never called him as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/01/23/ns-hitman-michael-ryan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A law professor from Dalhousie University called for a public inquiry. He questioned the rationale of the Crown not to call Mr. Ryan as a witness. He also was critical of the Court in making findings against the RCMP without having heard anything from the RCMP. He was also critical of the granting of a stay of proceedings, agreeing with Fish J. that it is an extreme remedy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/02/05/ns-hit-man-case-inquiry-kaiser.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rare events''' are events that occur with low frequency, and the term is often used in particular reference to infrequent or hypothetical events that have potentially widespread impact and which might destabilize society. &lt;ref&gt;King, G., &amp; Zeng, L. (2001). Logistic regression in rare events data. ''Political Analysis'', ''9''(2), 137–63. http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/137.short&lt;/ref&gt; Rare events encompass natural phenomena (major earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, asteroid impacts, solar flares, etc.), [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] hazards (warfare and related forms of violent conflict, acts of terrorism, industrial accidents, financial and commodity market crashes, etc.), as well as phenomena for which natural and anthropogenic factors interact in complex ways (epidemic disease spread, global warming-related changes in climate and weather, etc.).

==Overview==
Rare events are discrete occurrences that are statistically “improbable” in that they are very infrequently observed. Despite being statistically improbable, such events are plausible insofar as historical instances of the event (or a similar event) have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;Morio, J., Balesdent, M. (2015). ''Estimation of Rare Event Probabilities in Complex Aerospace and Other Systems''. Elsevier Science. http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780081000915&amp;pagename=search&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholarly and popular analyses of rare events often focus on those events that could be reasonably expected to have a substantial negative impact on a society—either economically&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, D. (2002). The management of losses arising from extreme events. Paper presented at General Insurance Convention. http://www.actuaries.org.uk/research-and-resources/documents/management-losses-arising-extreme-events&lt;/ref&gt; or in terms of human casualties&lt;ref&gt;Clauset, A., &amp; Woodard, R. (2013). Estimating the historical and future probabilities of large terrorist events. ''Annals of Applied Statistics'',''7''(4),1838–1865. doi:10.1214/12-AOAS614. https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0089&lt;/ref&gt; (typically, both). Examples of such events might include an 8.0+ Richter magnitude earthquake, a nuclear incident that kills thousands of people, or a 10%+ single-day change in the value of a stock market index.&lt;ref&gt;Ghil, M., P. Yiou, S. Hallegatte, B. D. Malamud, P. Naveau, A. Soloviev, P. Friederichs, et al. (2011). Extreme events: Dynamics, statistics and prediction. ''Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics'', ''18''(3), 295–350. doi:10.5194/npg-18-295-2011. http://www.nonlin-processes-geophys.net/18/295/2011/npg-18-295-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, A. S., Bunde, A., Dimri,V.P., &amp; [[Daniel N. Baker|Baker,D.N.]] (2013). ''Extreme events and natural hazards: The complexity perspective''. Wiley. https://books.google.com/books?id=t3F9K5clZwsC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, N. W. (2013). Bunched black (and grouped grey) swans: Dissipative and non-dissipative models of correlated extreme fluctuations in complex geosystems. ''Geophysical Research Letters'', ''40''(2), 402–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling and analysis==
Rare event modeling (REM) refers to efforts to characterize the [[statistical distribution]] parameters, generative processes, or dynamics that govern the occurrence of statistically rare events, including but not limited to high-impact natural or human-made catastrophes. Such “modeling” may include a wide range of approaches, including, most notably, statistical models derived from historical event data and computational software models that attempt to simulate rare event processes and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Embrechts, P., Klüppelberg, C., &amp; Mikosch, T. (1997). ''Modelling extremal events: For insurance and finance''. (Vol. 33). Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; REM also encompasses efforts to forecast the occurrence of similar events over some future time horizon, which may be of interest for both scholarly and applied purposes (e.g., risk mitigation and planning).&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, P., &amp; Wright,G. (2010). The limits of forecasting methods in anticipating rare events. ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', ''77''(3), 355–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevant data sets==
In many cases, rare and catastrophic events can be regarded as extreme-magnitude instances of more mundane phenomena. For example, seismic activity, stock market fluctuations, and acts of organized violence all occur along a continuum of extremity, with more extreme-magnitude cases being statistically infrequent.&lt;ref&gt;Clauset, A., Shalizi, C., Newman, M.E.J. (2009). Power-law distributions in empirical data. ''SIAM Review (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications)'', ''51'',(4), 661–703. doi:10.1137/070710111. Retrieved August 29, 2014. https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, rather than viewing rare event data as its own class of information, data concerning “rare” events often exists as a subset of data within a broader parent event class (e.g., a seismic activity data set would include instances of extreme earthquakes, as well as data on much lower-intensity seismic events).

The following is a list of data sets focusing on domains that are of broad scholarly and policy interest, and where “rare” (extreme-magnitude) cases may be of particularly keen interest due to their potentially devastating consequences.

'''Recognition''' in [[sociology]] is public acknowledgement of person's [[Social status|status]] or [[:wikt:merit|merit]]s (achievements, [[virtue]]s, service, etc.). In the field of psychology, it is understood that a person who seeks excessive recognition could themselves be exhibiting traits of a narcissistic personality disorder.

When some person is recognized, he or she is accorded some special status, such as title or classification.

When ''k'' is 1, it subsumes the goals of [[consistent hashing]], using an entirely different method.

Rendezvous hashing was invented in 1996 by David Thaler and Chinya Ravishankar at the [[University of Michigan]]. [[Consistent hashing]] appears to have been devised around the same time at MIT. One of the first applications of rendezvous hashing was to enable multicast clients on the Internet (in contexts such as the [[MBONE]]) to identify multicast rendezvous points in a distributed fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blazevic|first=Ljubica|title=Distributed Core Multicast (DCM): a routing protocol for many  small groups  with application to  mobile IP telephony|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-blazevic-dcm-mobility-01|work=IETF Draft|publisher=IETF|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fenner|first=B.|title=Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM):                     Protocol Specification (Revised)|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4601|work=IETF RFC|publisher=IETF|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in 1998 by Microsoft's [[Cache Array Routing Protocol]] (CARP) for distributed cache coordination and routing.&lt;ref name="carp"&gt;{{cite web|last=Valloppillil|first=Vinod|author2=Kenneth Ross |title=Cache Array Routing Protocol v1.0|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vinod-carp-v1-03|publisher=Internet Draft|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cache Array Routing Protocol and Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0|url=http://oldsite.mcoecn.org/WhitePapers/Mscarp.pdf|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=September 15, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918115447/http://oldsite.mcoecn.org/WhitePapers/Mscarp.pdf|archivedate=September 18, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] routing protocols use rendezvous hashing to pick a rendezvous point.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The HRW algorithm for rendezvous hashing ==

Rendezvous hashing solves the [[distributed hash table]] problem: How can a set of clients, given an object ''O'', agree on where in a set of ''n'' sites (servers, say) to place ''O''? Each client is to select a site independently, but all clients must end up picking the same site. This is non-trivial if we add a ''minimal disruption'' constraint, and require that only objects mapping to a removed site may be reassigned to other sites.

The basic idea is to give each site ''S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' a score (a ''weight'') for each object ''O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and assign the object to the highest scoring site. All clients first agree on a hash function ''h()''. For object ''O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', the site ''S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined to have weight ''w&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; = h(O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)''. HRW assigns ''O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the site ''S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' whose weight ''w&lt;sub&gt;i,m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the largest. Since ''h()'' is agreed upon, each client can independently compute the weights ''w&lt;sub&gt;i,1&lt;/sub&gt;, w&lt;sub&gt;i,2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., w&lt;sub&gt;i,n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and pick the largest. If the goal is distributed ''k''-agreement, the clients can independently pick the sites with the ''k'' largest hash values.

If a site ''S'' is added or removed, only the objects mapping to ''S'' are remapped to different sites, satisfying the minimal disruption constraint above. The HRW assignment can be computed independently by any client, since it depends only on the identifiers for the set of sites ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the object being assigned.

HRW easily accommodates different capacities among sites. If site ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' has twice the capacity of the other sites, we simply represent ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' twice in the list, say, as ''S&lt;sub&gt;k,1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''S&lt;sub&gt;k,2&lt;/sub&gt;''. Clearly, twice as many objects will now map to ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' as to the other sites.

== Properties ==

It might first appear sufficient to treat the ''n'' sites as buckets in a [[hash table]] and hash the object name ''O'' into this table. However, if any of the sites fails or is unreachable, the hash table size changes, requiring all objects to be remapped. This massive disruption makes such direct hashing unworkable. Under rendezvous hashing, however, clients handle site failures by picking the site that yields the next largest weight. Remapping is required only for objects currently mapped to the failed site, and as proved in,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; disruption is minimal. Rendezvous hashing has the following properties.
# '''Low overhead:''' The hash function used is efficient, so overhead at the clients is very low.
# '''[[Load balancing (computing)|Load balancing]]:''' Since the hash function is randomizing, each of the ''n ''sites is equally likely to receive the object ''O''. Loads are uniform across the sites.
## '''Site capacity:''' Sites with different capacities can be represented in the site list with multiplicity in proportion to capacity. A site with twice the capacity of the other sites will be represented twice in the list, while every other site is represented once.
# '''High [[hit rate]]:''' Since all clients agree on placing an object ''O'' into the same site ''S&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' , each fetch or placement of ''O'' into ''S&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' yields the maximum utility in terms of hit rate. The object ''O'' will always be found unless it is evicted by some replacement algorithm at ''S&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' .
# '''Minimal disruption:''' When a site fails, only the objects mapped to that site need to be remapped. Disruption is at the minimal possible level, as proved in &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.
# '''Distributed ''k''-agreement:''' Clients can reach distributed agreement on ''k'' sites simply by selecting the top ''k'' sites in the ordering, as in &lt;ref name="foisting" /&gt;.

=== Comparison with consistent hashing ===

Consistent hashing operates by mapping sites uniformly and randomly to points on a unit circle called tokens. Objects are also mapped to the unit circle and placed in the site whose token is the first encountered traveling clockwise from the object's location. When a site is removed, the objects it owns are transferred to the site owning the next token encountered moving clockwise. Provided each site is mapped to a large number (100-200, say) of tokens this will reassign objects in a relatively uniform fashion among the remaining sites.

If sites are mapped to points on the circle randomly by hashing 200 variants of the site ID, say, the assignment of any object requires storing or recalculating 200 hash values for each site. However, the tokens associated with a given site can be precomputed and stored in a sorted list, requiring only a single application of the hash function to the object, and a binary search to compute the assignment. Even with many tokens per site, however, the basic version of consistent hashing may not balance objects uniformly over sites, since when a site is removed each object assigned to it is distributed only over as many other sites as the site has tokens (say 100-200). Variants of consistent hashing (such as Amazon's Dynamo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) that use more complex logic to distribute tokens on the unit circle offer better load balancing than basic consistent hashing, reduce the overhead of adding new sites, and reduce metadata overhead and offer other benefits. Such methods, however, are even more complex than basic consistent hashing.

In contrast, rendezvous hashing (HRW) is much simpler both conceptually and in practice. It also distributes objects uniformly over all sites, given a uniform hash function. Unlike consistent hashing, HRW requires no precomputing or storage of tokens. An object ''O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is placed into one of ''n'' sites ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' by computing the ''n'' hash values ''h(O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)'' and picking the site ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' that yields the highest hash value. If a new site ''S&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is added, new object placements or requests will compute ''n+1'' hash values, and pick the largest of these. If an object already in the system at ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' maps to this new site ''S&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'', it will be fetched afresh and cached at ''S&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''. All clients will henceforth obtain it from this site, and the old cached copy at ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' will ultimately be replaced by the local cache management algorithm. If ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is taken offline, its objects will be remapped uniformly to the remaining ''n-1'' sites.

Variants of the HRW algorithm, such as the use of a skeleton (see below), can reduce the ''O(n)'' time for object location to ''O(log(n))'', at the cost of less global uniformity of placement. When ''n'' is not too large, however, the ''O(n)'' placement cost of basic HRW is not likely to be a problem. HRW completely avoids all the overhead and complexity associated with correctly handling multiple tokens for each site and associated metadata.

Rendezvous hashing also has the great advantage that it provides simple solutions to other important problems, such as distributed ''k''-agreement.

=== Reducing consistent hashing to rendezvous hashing ===
Consistent hashing can be reduced to an instance of HRW by an appropriate choice of a two-place hash function. From the site identifier &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the simplest version of consistent hashing computes a list of token positions, e.g., &lt;math&gt;t_i = h_c(S\hat{}i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h_c&lt;/math&gt; hashes values to locations on the unit circle. Define the two place hash function &lt;math&gt;h(S,O)&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\min_i h_c(O) - t_i}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h_c(O) - t_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the distance along the unit circle from &lt;math&gt;h_c(O)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;h_c(O) - t_i&lt;/math&gt; has some minimal non-zero value there is no problem translating this value to a unique integer in some bounded range). This will duplicate exactly the assignment produced by consistent hashing.

It is not possible, however, to reduce HRW to consistent hashing (assuming the number of tokens per site is bounded), since HRW potentially reassigns the objects from a removed site to an unbounded number of other sites.

== Implementation ==

Implementation is straightforward once a hash function ''h()'' is chosen (the original work on the HRW method&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; makes a hash function recommendation). Each client only needs to compute a hash value for each of the ''n'' sites, and then pick the largest. This algorithm runs in ''O(n)'' time. If the hash function is efficient, the ''O(n)'' running time is not a problem, unless ''n'' is very large.

== Extending rendezvous hashing with weight factors ==

In the standard implementation of rendezvous hashing, every node receives a statically equal proportion of the keys. This behavior, however, is undesirable when the nodes have different capacities for processing or holding their assigned keys. For example, if one of the nodes had twice the storage capacity as the others, it would be beneficial if the algorithm could take this into account such that this more powerful node would receive twice the number of keys as each of the others.

A straightforward mechanism to handle this case is to assign two virtual locations to this node, so that if either of that larger node's virtual locations has the highest hash, that node receives the key. But this strategy does not work when the relative weights are not integer multiples. For example, if one node had 42% more storage capacity, it would require adding many virtual nodes in different proportions, leading to greatly reduced performance. Several modifications to rendezvous hashing have been proposed to overcome this limitation.

=== Cache Array Routing Protocol ===

The [[Cache Array Routing Protocol]] (CARP) is a 1998 IETF draft&lt;ref name="carp"/&gt; that describes a method for computing ''load factors'' which can be multiplied by each node's hash score to yield an arbitrary level of precision for weighting nodes differently. However, one disadvantage of this approach is that when any node's weight is changed, or when any node is added or removed, all the load factors must be re-computed and relatively scaled. When the load factors change relative to one another, it triggers movement of keys between nodes whose weight was not changed, but whose load factor did change relative to other nodes in the system. This results in excess movement of keys.&lt;ref name="wrh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SDC15_presentations/dist_sys/Jason_Resch_New_Consistent_Hashings_Rev.pdf | title=New Hashing Algorithms for Data Storage |author=Jason Resch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controlled replication under scalable hashing ===

Controlled replication under scalable hashing or CRUSH&lt;ref name="crush"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crss.ucsc.edu/media/papers/weil-sc06.pdf | title=CRUSH: Controlled, Scalable, Decentralized Placement of Replicated Data |author=Sage A. Weil et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension to RUSH&lt;ref name="rush"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/media/papers/honicky-ipdps04.pdf | title=Replication Under Scalable Hashing: A Family of Algorithms for Scalable Decentralized Data Distribution |author=R. J. Honicky, Ethan L. Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; that improves upon rendezvous hashing by constructing a tree where a pseudo-random function (hash) is used to navigate down the tree to find which node is ultimately responsible for a given key. It permits perfect stability for adding nodes however it is not perfectly stable when removing or re-weighting nodes, with the excess movement of keys being proportional to the height of the tree.

The CRUSH algorithm is used by the [[Ceph (software)|ceph]] data storage system to map data objects to the nodes responsible for storing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/crush-map/ | title=Crush Maps |author=Ceph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weighted distributed hash tables and weighted rendezvous hash ===

In 2005, Christian Schindelhauer and Gunnar Schomaker described a ''logarithmic method''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Weighted Distributed Hash Tables |pages = 218|author=Christian Schindelhauer, Gunnar Schomaker|citeseerx = 10.1.1.414.9353|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; for re-weighting hash scores in a way that does not require relative scaling of load factors when a node's weight changes or when nodes are added or removed. This enables the dual benefits of perfect precision when weighting nodes, along with perfect stability—only a minimum number of keys must be remapped to new nodes upon any weight change.

A similar logarithmic based hashing strategy is used to assign data to storage nodes in [[Cleversafe]]'s data storage system,&lt;ref name="wrh"/&gt; now [[IBM Cloud Object Storage]].

When ''n'' is extremely large, the following variant can improve running time.&lt;ref name="CSE Technical Report UCR-CS 2001-05062"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yao|first1=Zizhen|last2=Ravishankar|first2=Chinya|last3=Tripathi|first3=Satish|title=Hash-Based Virtual Hierarchies for Caching in Hybrid Content-Delivery Networks|date=May 13, 2001|publisher=CSE Department, University of California, Riverside|location=Riverside, CA|url=http://static.cs.ucr.edu/store/techreports/UCR-CS-2001-05062.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Wei|author2=Chinya Ravishankar |title=Hash-Based Virtual Hierarchies for Scalable Location Service in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks|journal=Mobile Networks and Applications|date=January 2009|volume=14|issue=5|pages=625–637|doi=10.1007/s11036-008-0144-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| first = Anup| last = Mayank| first2 = Trivikram | last2 = Phatak| first3 = Chinya| last3 = Ravishankar| title = Decentralized Hash-Based Coordination of Distributed Multimedia Caches | series = Proc. 5th IEEE International Conference on Networking (ICN'06) | year = 2006| place = Mauritius| publisher = IEEE| url = http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~ravi/Papers/NWConf/ICN2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach creates a virtual hierarchical structure (called a ''skeleton''), and achieves ''O(log n)'' running time by applying HRW at each level while descending the hierarchy. The idea is to first choose some constant ''m'' and organize the ''n'' sites into ''c ='' ceiling''(n/m)'' clusters ''C&lt;sub&gt;1,&lt;/sub&gt; = {S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {S&lt;sub&gt;m+1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;m+2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,S&lt;sub&gt;2m&lt;/sub&gt;}, ...'' Next, build a virtual hierarchy by choosing a constant ''f'' and imagining these ''c'' clusters placed at the leaves of a tree ''T'' of virtual nodes, each with fanout ''f''.

In the accompanying diagram, the cluster size is ''m = 4'', and the skeleton fanout is ''f = 3''. Assuming 108 sites (real nodes) for convenience, we get a three-tier virtual hierarchy. Since ''f = 3'', each virtual node has a natural numbering in octal. Thus, the 27 virtual nodes at the lowest tier would be numbered 000, 001, 002, ..., 221, 222, in octal. (We can, of course, vary the fanout at each level. In that case, each node will be identified with the corresponding mixed-radix number.)

Instead of applying HRW to all 108 real nodes, we can first apply HRW to the 27 lowest-tier virtual nodes, selecting one. We then apply HRW to the four real nodes in its cluster, and choose the winning site. We only need 27 + 4 = 31 hashes, rather than 108. If we apply this method starting one level higher in the hierarchy, we would need 9 + 3 + 4 = 16 hashes to get to the winning site. The figure shows how, if we proceed starting from the root of the skeleton, we may successively choose the virtual nodes (2)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, (20)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and (200)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and finally end up with site 74.

We can start at any level in the virtual hierarchy, not just at the root. Starting lower in the hierarchy requires more hashes, but may improve load distribution in the case of failures. Also, the virtual hierarchy need not be stored, but can be created on demand, since the virtual nodes names are simply prefixes of base-''f'' (or mixed-radix) representations. We can easily create appropriately sorted strings from the digits, as required. In the example, we would be working with the strings 0, 1, 2 (at tier 1), 20, 21, 22 (at tier 2), and 200, 201, 202 (at tier 3). Clearly, ''T'' has height ''h = O (log c) = O (log n)'', since ''m'' and ''f'' are both constants. The work done at each level is ''O (1)'', since ''f'' is a constant.

For any given object ''O'', it is clear that the method chooses each cluster, and hence each of the ''n'' sites, with equal probability. If the site finally selected is unavailable, we can select a different site within the same cluster, in the usual manner. Alternatively, we could go up one or more tiers in the skeleton and select an alternate from among the sibling virtual nodes at that tier, and once again descend the hierarchy to the real nodes, as above.

The value of ''m'' can be chosen based upon such factors as the anticipated failure rate and the degree of load balancing desired. A higher value of ''m'' leads to less load skew in the event of failure, at the cost of somewhat higher search overhead.

The choice ''m = n'' is equivalent to non-hierarchical rendezvous hashing. In practice, the hash ''h()'' is very cheap, so ''m = n'' can work quite well unless ''n'' is very high.

In the [[United States]], which has an English [[common law]] tradition, the concept of a [[right to keep and bear arms]] was recognized prior to the creation of a written national constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McAffee |first1=Thomas B. |last2=Quinlan |first2=Michael J. |year=1997 |title=Bringing Forward The Right To Keep And Bear Arms: Do Text, History, or Precedent Stand In The Way? |url=http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/512/ |journal=Scholarly Works |volume=Paper 512}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Patriot (American Revolution)|colonists]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] rebelled against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] control during the [[American Revolution]] they cited the 1689 English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] as an example.

{{see also|Assize of Arms of 1181}}
The American understanding of the right to keep and bear arms was influenced by the 1689 [[English Bill of Rights]], an [[Act of Parliament]], which also dealt with personal defence by [[Protestant]] English subjects.

The Bill of Rights did not create a new right to have arms but rather rescinded and deplored acts of the deposed King [[James II of England|James II]], a [[Roman Catholic]], who had forced the disarming of [[Protestant]]s, while arming and deploying armed Catholics contrary to Law (among other alleged violations of individual rights). The Bill of Rights provided that Protestants could bear arms for their defence as permitted by law. It also established that the power to regulate the right to bear arms belonged to Parliament, not the monarch.&lt;ref name="c21WillMarSess2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1518621|title=1688 c.2 1 Will. and Mar. Sess. 2|publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[William Blackstone]] wrote in the eighteenth century about the right to have arms being auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and self-preservation", but conceded that the right was subject to their suitability and allowance by law.

{{Quote|The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute and is indeed a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp |title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Civilian usage meaning ==
In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that the right to arms preexisted the Constitution and in that case and in ''[[Presser v. Illinois]]'' (1886) recognized that the Second Amendment protected the right from being infringed by Congress. In ''[[United States v. Miller]]'' (1939), the Court again recognized that the right to arms is individually held and, citing the Tennessee case of ''Aymette v State'', indicated that it protected the right to keep and bear arms that are "part of the ordinary military equipment" or the use of which could "contribute to the common defense." In its first opportunity to rule specifically on whose right the Second Amendment protects, ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (2008), the Court ruled that the amendment protects an individual right "to keep and carry arms in case of confrontation," not contingent on service in a militia, while indicating, in dicta, that restrictions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, on the carrying of arms in sensitive locations, and with respect to the conditions on the sale of firearms could pass constitutional muster. In the 2010 case of McDonald v. Chicago, the Court applied incorporation doctrine to extend the Second Amendment's protections nationwide.

The people's right to have their own arms for their defense is described in the philosophical and political writings of [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[John Locke]], [[Machiavelli]], the [[Whig (British political faction)|English Whigs]] and others.&lt;ref name="Halbrook, Stephen P. 1994 8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Halbrook, Stephen P.|title=That Every Man Be Armed: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (Independent Studies in Political Economy)|publisher=The Independent Institute|location=Oakland, CA|year=1994|page=8|isbn=0-945999-38-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=June 2016}} Though possessing arms appears to be distinct from "bearing" them, the possession of arms is recognized as necessary for and a logical precursor to the bearing of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=William &amp; Mary Bill of Rights Journal|author=Schmidt, Christopher|title=An International Human Right to Keep and Bear Arms|date=February 2007|publisher=The College of William &amp; Mary School of Law|location=Williamsburg, Virginia|volume=15|issue=3|page=983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Kates]], a civil liberties lawyer, cites historic English usage describing the "right to keep and bear ''their private arms''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kates, Jr.|first=Don B.|date=November 1983|title=Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=82|issue=2|pages=204–273|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association|quote=In unmistakable individual right terms: As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear ''their private arms''.

Likewise, Sayoko Blodgett-Ford notes a non-military usage of the phrase in a pamphlet widely circulated by the dissenting minority dating from the time of the Pennsylvania ratifying convention for the U.S. Constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed...&lt;ref name="Sayoko001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blodgett-Ford, Sayoko|title=The Changing Meaning of the Right to Bear Arms|journal=Seton Hall Constitutional Law Journal|date=Fall 1995|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In commentary written by Judge Garwood in ''[[United States v. Emerson]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] concluded in 2001 that:&lt;ref name="isbn0-8223-3017-2"&gt;{{cite book

{{quote|...there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service.

Similarly, in a released Senate report on the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, Senator [[Orrin Hatch]], chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution, states:

{{quote|They argue that the Second Amendment's words "right of the people" mean "a right of the state"&amp;nbsp;– apparently overlooking the impact of those same words when used in the First and Fourth Amendments. The "right of the people" to assemble or to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is not contested as an individual guarantee. Still they ignore consistency and claim that the right to "bear arms" relates only to military uses. This not only violates a consistent constitutional reading of "right of the people" but also ignores that the second amendment protects a right to "keep" arms. "When our ancestors forged a land "conceived in liberty", they did so with musket and rifle. When they reacted to attempts to dissolve their free institutions, and established their identity as a free nation, they did so as a nation of armed freemen. When they sought to record forever a guarantee of their rights, they devoted one full amendment out of ten to nothing but the protection of their right to keep and bear arms against governmental interference. Under my chairmanship the Subcommittee on the Constitution will concern itself with a proper recognition of, and respect for, this right most valued by free men.&lt;ref name="rkba1982"/&gt;}}

Likewise, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (2008), No. 07-290, that "[t]he Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."&lt;ref&gt;''Heller'', Syllabus, item #1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military service and civilian usage meanings ==
Some historians have argued that prior to and through the 18th century, the expression "bear arms" appeared exclusively in military contexts, as opposed to the use of firearms by civilians.&lt;ref name="UM194"&gt;Uviller, H.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In late-eighteenth-century parlance, ''bearing arms'' was a term of art with an obvious military and legal connotation. ... As a review of the Library of Congress's data base of congressional proceedings in the revolutionary and early national periods reveals, the thirty uses of 'bear arms' and 'bearing arms' in bills, statutes, and debates of the Continental, Confederation, and United States' Congresses between 1774 and 1821 invariably occur in a context exclusively focused on the army or the militia.&lt;ref name="UM194b"&gt;Uviller, H. Richard. &amp; Merkel, William G.: ''The Militia and the Right to Arms, Or, How the Second Amendment Fell Silent '', p. 194. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|0-8223-3017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this conclusion is disputed and may be due to [[selection bias]], which arises from the use of a limited selection of government documents that overwhelmingly refer to matters of military service.&lt;ref name="Cramer-Olson001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cramer, Clayton E. |author2=Olson, Joseph |title=What Did "Bear Arms" Mean in the Second Amendment?|journal=Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|issue=2|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this previous research, other historians note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Searching more comprehensive collections of English language works published before 1820 shows that there are a number of uses that...have nothing to do with military service...[and] The common law was in agreement. Edward Christian's edition of Blackstone's Commentaries that appeared in 1790s described the rights of Englishmen (which every American colonist had been promised) in these terms 'everyone is at liberty to keep or carry a gun, if he does not use it for the [unlawful] destruction of game.' This right was separate from militia duties.&lt;ref name="Cramer-Olson001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines the term ''to bear arms'' as: ''"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight,"'' dating to about 1330.

[[Garry Wills]], author and history professor at [[Northwestern University]], has written of the origin of the term ''bear arms'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;By legal and other channels, the Latin "''[[wikt:arma#Latin|arma]] [[wikt:ferre#Latin|ferre]]''" entered deeply into the European language of war. Bearing arms is such a synonym for waging war that Shakespeare can call a just war "'' 'justborne arms''" and a civil war "''self-borne arms''." Even outside the special phrase "''bear arms''," much of the noun's use echoes Latin phrases: to be under arms (''[[wikt:sub#Latin|sub]] armis''), the call to arms (''[[wikt:ad#Latin|ad]] arma''), to follow arms (''arma [[wikt:sequi|sequi]]''), to take arms (''arma [[wikt:capere|capere]]''), to lay down arms (''arma pœnere''). "Arms" is a profession that one brother chooses the way another choose law or the church. An issue undergoes the arbitrament of arms." ... "One does not bear arms against a rabbit...".&lt;ref name="isbn0-684-87026-6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wills, Garry|title=A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|year=2002|page=257|isbn=0-684-87026-6|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Garry Wills also cites Greek and Latin [[etymology]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... "Bear Arms" refers to military service, which is why the plural is used (based on Greek 'hopla pherein' and Latin 'arma ferre')&amp;nbsp;– one does not bear arm, or bear an arm. The word means, etymologically, 'equipment' (from the root ar-* in verbs like 'ararisko', to fit out). It refers to the 'equipage' of war. Thus 'bear arms' can be used of naval as well as artillery warfare, since the "profession of arms" refers to all military callings.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Garry (1999). ''A Necessary Evil'' pp. 256–257. New York, NY. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historically, the right to keep and bear arms, whether considered an individual or a collective or a militia right, did not originate fully formed in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791; rather, the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] was the codification of the six-centuries-old responsibility to keep and bear arms for king and country that was inherited from the English Colonists that settled North America, tracing its origin back to the [[Assize of Arms of 1181|Assize of Arms]] of 1181 that occurred during the reign of Henry II. Through being codified in the United States Constitution, the common law right was continued and guaranteed for the People, and statutory law enacted subsequently by Congress cannot extinguish the pre-existing common law right to keep and bear arms.&lt;ref name='Espohl_97'&gt;{{cite journal |author=Espohl,  Frank |title=The Right to Carry  Concealed Weapons  for Self Defense |journal=Southern Illinois University Law Journal |volume=22 |page=151 |year=1997 |quote=The right of self-preservation, including the right of self-defense, has been suggested to be within the protection of the Ninth Amendment.  Thus, although some courts have refused to hold that the Ninth Amendment protects  a right to possess firearms, laws which restrict the ability of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms for the purpose of self-defense could be said to violate the Ninth Amendment.  Another common interpretation of the Ninth Amendment is that it protects rights which were recognized at common law as being among the "fundamental rights of Englishmen."  The common law, as described in Blackstone's Commentaries, has been carried into American jurisprudence.  One such right protected at common law was the right to self-defense and the right to possess and carry weapons for defensive purposes.  Hobbes described the right to self-defense as a fundamental natural right of which persons can not justly be deprived by any law or covenant.  Blackstone listed self-defense and the right to carry weapons for self-defense as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.  Blackstone further described the right to self-defense as "the primary law of nature, so it is not, nor can it be in fact, taken away by the law of society |url=http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Espohl1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523070409/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Espohl1.htm |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]] refers to a pre-existing right to keep and bear arms:

{{quote|A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&lt;ref name='BoR'&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html |title=Bill of Rights Transcript Text |work=archives.gov |year=2011 |accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The right is often presented in the United States as being an unenumerated, pre-existing right, such as provided for by the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution]],&lt;ref name='Espohl_97'/&gt; interpreted by some as providing for unenumerated rights, and therefore implicitly a right to keep and bear arms:

{{quote|The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.}}

Some have seen the Second Amendment as derivative of a common law right to keep and bear arms; Thomas B. McAffee &amp; Michael J. Quinlan, writing in the North Carolina Law Review said ''"...&amp;nbsp;Madison did not invent the right to keep and bear arms when he drafted the Second Amendment&amp;nbsp;– the right was pre-existing at both common law and in the early state constitutions."''&lt;ref name='nclr'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bringing Forward The Right To Keep And Bear Arms: Do Text, History, Or Precedent Stand In The Way?|journal=North Carolina Law Review|date=March 1997|first=Thomas B.|last=McAffee|author2=Michael J. Quinlan |volume=|issue=|page=781|id= |url=|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akhil Reed Amar similarly notes the basis of Common Law for the first ten amendments of the U.S. Constitution, "following John Randolph Tucker's famous oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist case, Spies v. Illinois": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though originally the first ten Amendments were adopted as limitations on Federal power, yet insofar as they secure and recognize fundamental rights&amp;nbsp;– common law rights&amp;nbsp;– of the man, they make them privileges and immunities of the man as citizen of the United States...&lt;ref name='ylj1'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Bill Of Rights And The Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=April 1992|first=Akhil|last=Amar|volume=|issue=|page=1193|id= |url=|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Uviller and Merkel hold that the right to bear arms was not reserved for the state, but rather was an individual and personal right for arms only to the extent needed to maintain a well regulated militia to support the state. They also hold that a militia recognizable to the framers of the Constitution has ceased to exist in the United States resulting from deliberate Congressional legislation and also societal neglect; nonetheless, "Technically, all males aged seventeen to forty-five are members of the unorganized militia, but that status has no practical legal significance."&lt;ref name="isbn0-8223-3017-2b"&gt;{{cite book

A few academic writers published their opinions in several works:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the text as well as a fair understanding of the contemporary ethic regarding arms and liberty, it seems to us overwhelmingly evident that the principal purpose of the Amendment was to secure a personal, individual entitlement to the possession and use of arms. We cannot, however, (as the individual rights contingent generally does) disregard entirely the first part of the text proclaiming a well regulated militia necessary to the security of a free state.&lt;ref name = "UM23"&gt;Uviller, H.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...we understand the Second Amendment as though it read: "Inasmuch as and so long as a well regulated Militia shall be necessary to the security of a free state and so long as privately held arms shall be essential to the maintenance thereof, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."

== Early commentary in federal courts ==
{{See also|Firearm case law in the United States}}

In the century following the ratification of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], the intended meaning and application of the Second Amendment drew less interest than it does in modern times.&lt;ref name="Saul_Cornell_neither_model"&gt;Cornell, ''Gun Control'', p. 6. Neither of the two modern theories that have defined public debate over the right to bear arms is faithful to the original understanding of this provision of the Bill of Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of regulation was done by states, and the first case law on weapons regulation dealt with state interpretations of the Second Amendment. A notable exception to this general rule was ''Houston v. Moore'', {{ussc|18|1|1820}}, where the Supreme Court mentioned the Second Amendment in an aside.&lt;ref&gt;Justice Story "misidentified" it as the "5th Amendment. Several public officials, including [[James Madison]] and Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, retained the confusing practice of referring to each of the ten amendments in the Bill of Rights by the enumeration found in the first draft; the fifth article is the Second Amendment.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dred Scott v. Sandford''===

In the Nineteenth century considerable attention in public discourse and the courts was directed to the issue of arming of slaves (prior to the Civil War), and later to the right of slaves to belong to militia and the arming of these individuals. Most famously this is seen in the court arguments of the 1857 court case ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'', whether the slave [[Dred Scott]] could be a citizen with rights, including the right to bear arms. This debate about the rights of slaves and former slaves often included the usage of the term 'bear arms' with the meaning of individuals having or not having the right to possess firearms.

In the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]], the [[Majority opinion|opinion of the court]] stated that if [[African American]]s were considered [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]], "It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right...to keep and carry arms wherever they went."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=60&amp;invol=393|title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes|work=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com|accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;60 U.S. 393, 417 (1857).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early commentary in state courts ==
The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution is a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] provision.  In 2010, this "fundamental" and "individual" right was "fully incorporated" with the 14th Amendment per the SCOTUS ruling made in ''McDonald v. City of Chicago'', which upheld the prior opinion made in ''District of Columbia v. Heller''. Each of the fifty states also has its own state constitution. Forty-four states have chosen to explicitly embody a right to bear arms into their state constitutions.&lt;ref name='staterkba'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/beararms/statecon.htm|title=State Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms Provisions|accessdate=2008-05-10|last=Volokh|first=Eugene|year=2006|publisher=UCLA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the state constitutions, state laws, and state courts addresses the state-based right to bear arms distinctly within its respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, Thomas M. &amp; Angell, Alexis C.: ''A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations which Rest Upon the Legislative Power of the States of the American Union'', p. 427. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company. 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree and the nature of the protection, prohibition, and regulation at the state level varies from state to state. The District of Columbia, not being a state, falls within the federal jurisdiction.

Approximately&lt;!-- way too many "approximately"s for two paragraphs --&gt; thirty-one states have explicitly chosen to include the right to arms for "individual right", "defense of self", "defense of home" or similarly worded reasons. Approximately thirteen states, as with the U.S. Constitution, did not choose to explicitly include "individual", "self" or "home" wording associated with a right to bear arms for their specific states.

Approximately twenty-eight states have explicitly chosen to include the right to bear arms for "security of a free state", "defense of state", "common defense" or similarly worded reasons, as with the U.S. Constitution. Approximately sixteen states did not choose to include explicitly "free state", "defense of state" or "common defense" wording for their specific state. Whether the inclusion of these kinds of wording in state constitutions has relevance to the issue of whether implicit "individual" rights exist, or whether such rights (if any) are implicitly protected by the states' constitutions or by the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, remains a matter of dispute. However, since the SCOTUS has "fully incorporated" the 2nd and 14th Amendments in their 2010 opinion and order in ''McDonald v. City of Chicago'', the right to keep and bear arms is "fully applicable" to the states and limits the states on any and all regulations and restrictions they choose to take, and federal Constitutional rights take precedence over state, local and other laws that regulate to "Right of Lawful Citizens to keep and bear Arms for self-defense, a 'central component' of the 2nd Amendment" (see ''McDonald v. City of Chicago'' (SC  2010)).&lt;!-- every one of those approximatelys is quanitifiable and should be checked and given its correct value --&gt;

Regarding the state interpretations of these state and the federal constitutional rights to bear arms, state courts have addressed the meaning of these specific rights in considerable detail. Two different models have emerged from state [[jurisprudence]]: an individual right (defense of self or home) and a collective (defense of the state) right.  It should be noted, however, that the states cannot lessen or restrict any Bill of Rights guarantee that has been "fully incorporated" (American jurisprudence) and that the right that is "fully incorporated" also applies to the respective State Constitutions; again, the states can only "add to" these rights but can never "diminish" these rights by state and local laws.

This was interpreted to include the right to carry a concealed sword in a cane.  This case has been described as about "a statute prohibiting the carrying of [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapons]] [that] was violative of the Second Amendment."&lt;ref name="1967hearing"&gt;United States. Anti-Crime Program. Hearings Before Ninetieth Congress, First Session. Washington: U.S. Government Print.

The Kentucky High Court stated in ''Bliss'', "But it should not be forgotten, that it is not only a part of the right that is secured by the constitution; it is the right entire and complete, as it existed at the adoption of the constitution; and if any portion of that right be impaired, immaterial how small the part may be, and immaterial the order of time at which it be done, it is equally forbidden by the constitution."&lt;ref name="bliss v commonwealth"/&gt; The "constitution" mentioned in this quote refers to Kentucky's Constitution.&lt;ref name="rkba1982"&gt;Right to Keep and Bear Arms, U.S. Senate. 2001 Paladin Press. {{ISBN|1-58160-254-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case prompted outrage in the Kentucky House, all the while recognizing that Section 23 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky (1799) did guarantee individuals the right to bear arms.  The ''Bliss'' ruling, to the extent that it dealt with concealed weapons, was overturned by constitutional amendment with Section 26 in Kentucky's Third Constitution (1850) banning the future carrying of concealed weapons, while still asserting that the bearing of arms in defense of themselves and the state was an individual and collective right in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. This recognition has remained to the present day in the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Fourth Constitution, enacted in 1891, in Section 1, Article 7, that guarantees "The right to bear arms in defense of themselves and of the State, subject to the power of the General Assembly to enact laws to prevent persons from carrying concealed weapons." As noted in the Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium: Rights in Conflict in the 1980s, vol. 10, no. 1, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;155, "The first state court decision resulting from the "right to bear arms" issue was ''Bliss v. Commonwealth''. The court held that "the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire, ..." "This holding was unique because it stated that the right to bear arms is absolute and unqualified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Darell R.|title=Second Amendment Survey|journal=Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium: Rights in Conflict in 1980s|volume=10|issue=1|year=1982|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two states, [[Alaska]] and [[Vermont]], do not require a permit or license for carrying a concealed weapon to this day, following Kentucky's original position.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of ''Bliss'' is also seen from the defense subsequently given against a murder charge in Kentucky against Mattews Ward, who in 1852 pulled out a concealed pistol and fatally wounded his brother's teacher over an accusation regarding eating chestnuts in class. Ward's defense team consisted of eighteen lawyers, including U.S. Senator [[John J. Crittenden|John Crittenden]], former Governor of Kentucky, and former [[United States Attorney General]]. The defense successfully defended Ward in 1854 through an assertion that "a man has a right to carry arms; I am aware of nothing in the laws of God or man, prohibiting it. The Constitution of Kentucky and our Bill of Rights guarantee it. The Legislature once passed an act forbidding it, but it was decided unconstitutional, and overruled by our highest tribunal, the Court of Appeals." As noted by Cornell, "Ward's lawyers took advantage of the doctrine advanced in ''Bliss'' and wrapped their client's action under the banner of a constitutional right to bear arms. Ward was acquitted."&lt;ref name="Saul_Cornell_AWRM_Ward"&gt;{{cite book

=== Aymette ===

In ''Aymette v. State'', 21 Tenn. 154, 156 (1840), the Tennessee Supreme Court construed the guarantee in Tennessee's 1834 Constitution that 'the free white men of this State have a right to Keep and bear arms for their common defence.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm15138.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/tfd/id/495/rec/2 |title=Tennessee Constitution, 1834 |accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining that the provision was adopted with the same goals as the Federal Constitution's Second Amendment, the court wrote: "The words 'bear arms' … have reference to their military use, and were not employed to mean wearing them about the person as part of the dress.  As the object for which the right to keep and bear arms is secured, is of general and public nature, to be exercised by the people in a body, for their common defense, so the arms, the right to keep which is secured, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment."
* 1. The act of 1837-8, ch. 137, sec. 2, which prohibits any person from wearing any [[Bowie knife]], or [[Arkansas toothpick]], or other knife or weapon in form, shape or size resembling a Bowie knife or Arkansas toothpick under his clothes, or concealed about his person, does not conflict with the 26th section of the first article of the bill of rights, securing to the free white citizens the right to keep and bear arms for their common defense.
* 2. The arms, the right to keep and bear which is secured by the constitution, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and constitute the ordinary military equipment; the legislature have the power to prohibit the keeping or wearing weapons dangerous to the peace and safety of the citizens, and which are not usual in civilized warfare.
* 3. The right to keep and bear arms for the common defense, is a great political right. It respects the citizens on the one hand, and the rulers on the other; and although this right must be inviolably preserved, it does not follow that the legislature is prohibited from passing laws regulating the manner in which these arms may be employed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear ''arms'' of every description, and not ''such'' merely as are used by the ''militia'', shall not be ''infringed'', curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this ''right'', originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-2901.pdf |title=District of Columbia v.

=== Buzzard ===

In ''State v. Buzzard'' (1842, Ark), the Arkansas high court adopted a militia-based, political interpretation, reading of the right to bear arms under state law, and upheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas Constitution that declared, "that the free white men of this State shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense",&lt;ref name="state v buzzard"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=State v. Buzzard|vol=4|reporter=Ark. (2 Pike)|opinion=18|year=1842|url=http://www.guncite.com/court/state/4ar18.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons. Buzzard had carried a concealed weapon and stood "indicted by virtue of the authority of the 13th section of an act of the Legislature prohibiting any person wearing a [[pistol]], [[dirk]], large knife or sword-cane ''concealed as a weapon'', unless upon a journey, under the penalties of fine and imprisonment." Justice Lacy, in a dissenting opinion in ''Buzzard'', summarizing the majority viewpoint to which he disagreed, declared: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the words "a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free State", and the words "common defense" clearly show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions [i.e., Ark. and U.S.] and prove that it is a political and not an individual right, and, of course, that the State, in her legislative capacity, has the right to regulate and control it: This being the case, then the people, neither individually nor collectively, have the right to keep and bear arms."&lt;ref name="state v buzzard"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joel Prentiss Bishop]]'s influential ''Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes'' (1873) took Buzzard's militia-based interpretation, a view that Bishop characterized as the "Arkansas doctrine", as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in American law.&lt;ref name="state v buzzard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saul_Cornell_AWRM_Bishop"&gt;{{cite book

== Modern commentary ==

=== Interpretive Models ===
{{Further|Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}
Three models of interpreting the right to bear arms in the United States commonly exist. These three models are founded on differing interpretations of the Second Amendment, ''"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."''

The first model, the individual-rights model, holds that a right of individuals is to own and possess firearms, much as the First Amendment protects a right of individuals to engage in free speech.&lt;ref name="dorf"/&gt; This view was confirmed by the Supreme Court in ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008) than had previous interpretations by the Court. Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Heller'' there was a split among the federal courts, with nine of the federal circuit courts of appeal supporting a modified collective rights view, two of the federal circuits supporting an individual rights view, and one federal circuit court having not addressed the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The second two models focus on the preamble, or "purpose" clause, of the Amendment&amp;nbsp;– the words ''"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State."'' The second model, the collective model, holds that the right to bear arms belongs to the people collectively rather than to individuals, under the belief that the right's only purpose is to enable states to maintain a militia.

The third model, the modified collective model, holds that the right to keep and bear arms exists only for individuals actively serving in the militia, and then only pursuant to such regulations as may be prescribed.&lt;ref name="dorf"&gt;{{cite web

=== Federal case commentary ===
Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]] in 2008 wrote that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable prohibitions and regulations and subsequently federal court rulings have upheld existing gun prohibitions and regulations.&lt;ref name="urlThe Volokh Conspiracy&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;–  Yet Another Early Post-''Heller'' Second Amendment Case:&lt;blockquote&gt;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volokh.com/posts/1215491766.shtml |title=The Volokh Conspiracy&amp;nbsp;– Yet Another Early Post-''Heller'' Second Amendment Case: |work= |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No right is absolute; the government is always allowed to restrict the right if it can satisfy Constitutional [[strict scrutiny]] and show the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote a goal of compelling importance."&lt;ref&gt;[[n:ACLU President Strossen on religion, drugs, guns and impeaching George Bush#Gun rights|Interview with Nadine Strossen]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals]] for the [[Fifth Circuit]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service."&lt;ref name="Emerson000"&gt;United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The cited excerpt from the ''Emerson'' decision reflects some of the court's lengthy analysis of Second Amendment jurisprudence (Spitzer 2003)(Reynolds 2002). This analysis garnered considerable attention and scrutiny by legal experts. Shortly after the decision, Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] directed the adoption of the Emerson court's view as the policy of the Justice Department in a memo to all ninety-three United States Attorneys in November 2001. In contrast, legal critics of the "individualist view" repudiated the ''Emerson'' analysis on various grounds. Judge Robert M. Parker, while concurring in the ''Emerson'' result, labeled the majority's analysis as ''obiter dicta'', irrelevant to
the outcome of the case (see ''Emerson'', Spitzer 2003). Moreover, the thoroughness of the ''Emerson'' analysis was criticized because the court's rendered opinion relied substantially on interpretations submitted in a "brief presented by one party" (Spitzer 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''United States v. Miller''====
{{Main|United States v. Miller}}

In ''United States v. Miller'', {{ussc|307|174|1939}}, the Supreme Court rejected a Second Amendment challenge to the [[National Firearms Act]] prohibiting the interstate transportation of unregistered [[Any Other Weapon|Title II weapons]]:

{{quote|Jack Miller and Frank Layton "did unlawfully...transport in interstate commerce from...Claremore...Oklahoma to...Siloam Springs...Arkansas a certain firearm...a double barrel...shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length...at the time of so transporting said firearm in interstate commerce...not having registered said firearm as required by Section 1132d of Title 26, United States Code, ...and not having in their possession a stamp-affixed written order...as provided by Section 1132C...&lt;ref&gt;''Miller'', at 175.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a unanimous opinion authored by [[James Clark McReynolds|Justice McReynolds]], the Supreme Court stated "the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved to the States is plainly untenable."&lt;ref&gt;''Miller'', at 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Court explained:

{{quote|In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to any preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller'', at 178.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gun rights advocates claim that the Court in ''Miller'' ruled that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of "ordinary military equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondamendment.net/2amd4.html|title=The misconstruction of United States v.

Most modern scholars recognize this fact. For example, Professor Eugene Volokh describes Miller as 'deliciously and usefully ambiguous' in an article about using the Second Amendment as a teaching tool in constitutional law. That is probably the most accurate statement that can be made about the case."&lt;/ref&gt;

====''McDonald v. Chicago''====
{{Main|McDonald v. Chicago}}
On June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court in ''McDonald v. Chicago'', 561 U.S. 3025 (2010) held that the Second Amendment was fully incorporated within the 14th Amendment. This means that the court ruled that the Second Amendment limits state and local governments to the same extent that it limits the federal government.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Justices Extend Firearm Rights in 5-to-4 Ruling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/us/29scotus.html?src=me|accessdate=December 17, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also remanded a case regarding a Chicago handgun prohibition. Four of the five Justices in the majority voted to do so by way of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment]], while the fifth Justice, [[Clarence Thomas]], voted to do so through the amendment's [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/06/analysis-state-gun-regulations-and-mcdonald/|title=Analysis: state gun regulations and McDonald|last=Scarola|first=Matthew|date=June 28, 2010|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups of [[tetrapods]] have undergone '''secondary aquatic adaptation''', an evolutionary transition from being purely [[Terrestrial_animal|terrestrial]] to living at least part of the time in water. These animals are called "secondarily aquatic" because although their ancestors lived on land for hundreds of millions of years, they all originally descended from aquatic animals (see [[Evolution of tetrapods]]). These ancestral tetrapods had never left the water, and were thus '''primarily aquatic''', like modern [[Fish|fishes]]. Secondary aquatic [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]]s tend to develop in early speciation as the animal ventures into water in order to find available food. As successive generations spend more time in the water, [[natural selection]] causes the acquisition of more adaptations. Animals of later generations may spend the majority of their life in the water, coming ashore for mating. Finally, fully adapted animals may take to mating and birthing in water.

==Anapsid==
{{main|Anapsid}}
''[[Archelon]]'' is a type of giant [[sea turtle]] dating from the [[Cretaceous]] Period, now long extinct.  Its smaller cousins survive as the [[sea turtles]] of today.

''[[Mesosaurus]]'' (and other mesosaurids) were another group of anapsid [[reptiles]] to secondarily return to the sea, eschewing shells, and are also long extinct.

==Diapsid==
{{main|Diapsid}}
Living at the same time as, but not closely related to, dinosaurs, the [[mosasaur]]s resembled crocodiles but were more strongly adapted to marine life. They became extinct 66 million years ago, at the same time as the dinosaurs. 

Modern diapsids which have made their own adaptions to allow them to spend significant time in the water include marine [[iguana]]s and marine [[crocodile]]s. [[Sea snakes]] are extensively adapted to the marine environment, giving birth to live offspring in the same way as the Euryapsida (see below) and are largely incapable of terrestrial activity.  The arc of their adaptation is evident by observing the primitive [[Laticauda]] genus, which must return to land to lay eggs.

==Euryapsida==
{{main|Euryapsida}}
These marine reptiles had ancestors who moved back into the oceans. In the case of [[ichthyosaur]]s adapting as fully as the [[dolphins]] they superficially resemble, even giving birth to live offspring instead of laying eggs. Euryapsida is now no longer considered a valid taxonomic group (Motani, 2009).

==Cetacea==
{{Main|Cetacea|Evolution of cetaceans}}
During the [[Paleocene]] Epoch (about 66 - 55 million years ago), a group of [[wolf]]-like [[artiodactyl]]s related to ''[[Pakicetus]]'' began pursuing an amphibious lifestyle in rivers or shallow seas. They were the ancestors of modern whales, dolphins, and porpoises. The cetacea are extensively adapted to marine life and cannot survive on land at all. Their adaptation can be seen in many unique physiognomic characteristics such as the dorsal [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]], [[baleen]] teeth, and the cranial 'melon' organ used for aquatic [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]. The closest extant terrestrial relative to the whale is the [[hippopotamus]], which spends much of its time in the water and whose name literally means "horse of the river".

==Sirenians==
{{main|Sirenian|Evolution of sirenians}}
The ancestors of the [[dugong]] and [[manatee]]s first appeared in the fossil record about 45 to 50 million years ago in the ocean.

==Pinnipeds==
{{main|Pinniped}}
The fossil records show that [[phocid]]s existed 12 to 15 million years ago, and [[odobenid]]s about 14 million years ago. Their common ancestor must have existed even earlier than that.

==Polar bears==
{{main|Polar bear}}
Although polar bears spend most of their time on the ice rather than in the water, polar bears show the beginnings of aquatic adaptation to swimming (high levels of body fat and nostrils that are able to close), diving, and thermoregulation. Distinctly polar bear fossils can be dated to about 100,000 years ago. The polar bear has thick fur and layers of fat on its body to protect it from the cold.

==Speculative theories==
===Humans===
{{main|Aquatic ape hypothesis}}
Proponents of the aquatic ape hypothesis believe that part of [[human evolution]] includes some aquatic adaptation, which has been said to explain human hairlessness, [[bipedalism]], increased [[subcutaneous fat]], [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]], [[vernix caseosa]], a hooded [[human nose|nose]] and various other physiological and anatomical changes. The idea is not accepted by most scholars who study human evolution.&lt;ref name = Meier&gt;{{cite book | last = Meier | first = R | title = The complete idiot's guide to human prehistory | publisher = Alpha Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-02-864421-2 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=r_Wit4KYSmMC&amp;pg=PA57 57–59]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social sorting''' is understood as the breakdown and categorization of group- or person-related raw data into various categories and segments by data manipulators and [[data broker]]s. Social sorting involves the key task of separating one group from the other. These groups can be based on [[income]], [[education]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], profiling, [[gender]], [[Job|occupation]], [[social status]], derived power (social and political) and geographic residence. Depending on the goals of the manipulator raw data is collected and then further evolves into meaningful data in order to be exploited for a specific purpose. For example, the formulation of [[profiling (information science)|profiling]] and [[predictive policing]] are all derivations of social sorting.

==History==

The concept is accredited to [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]], a sociologist who is best known for his work in surveillance studies. Contemporary times have allowed for the influx and constant growth of [[data collection]] especially in the countries of the global north. A prime example of social terming is [[surveillance]]. This practice was not always as sophisticated as today. Historically, simple tools such as labor-intensive watchers, [[book keeping]] and record keeping acted as the enablers of this form. Surveillance is now done by governments and various organizations. This technological tools that are equipped with surveillance are [[CCTV camera|cameras]], records of transactions done at [[automated teller machine|banking machines]] and [[point of sale]] terminals, [[machine readable passport]]s before boarding, [[cellular phone]] calls along with many other examples. This collection of raw data then enables trends to be found and the fostering of predictions.

In other contextual fashion, social sorting bears much of its resemblance to social stratification. In primitive societies there are evidence of the roots of social sorting where the sexual division of labour was concerned. Women would do most of the gathering where men would concentrate on hunting. It was argued that although this specific task of the woman may point to domestic oppression according to some observers, hunter-gatherer women would not understand this interpretation. The primitive society did show groupings and deployed categorization which perhaps without their own understanding of the understanding of the social construct was still insinuated.

Further confirmation of social sorting was evident through slavery. The [[racial divide]] between whites and blacks manifested for generations. Based on the visual appearance of their skin people of a darker complexion were grouped and made to endure hardships that included beatings, laborious field work, confinement and executions. A prime example of social sorting at work during the African slave era were [[mullato]]s were grouped together to perform household and other domestic work.

==Criticism==

Criticisms are often directed at the laws, implemented rules, educational system, job employment opportunities and at the government. Questions are asked of the integrity of many socially constructed programs led by private and government institutions. Fairness and equity are thought to be at the forefront of the list of frustrations for many people that are aware of social sorting.

There are [[paranoia]]s and indifferences in regards to social sorting. The [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent [[war on terror]] have fueled the desire for [[categorizing]] and profiling people. The beneficiaries that are associated with it are evident as it allows for a more transparent viewership. Some researchers such as David Lyon are concerned with the rise of [[big data]] as there are many implication on the daily lives of many.

According to David Lyon, Canadians are still unaware of the fact that surveillance which goes collaboratively with social sorting is now very much integrated into their daily lives. David Lyon discusses that the systematic routines and attention to personal detail which is encompassed into surveillance. The key criticism involves indifferent treatment to individuals based on their profile. Depending on the details of a person it can lead to the determination of whether the person may end up on a [[No Fly List]].

Employers have now begun to engage in these screening methods to determine a person’s suitability for a particular job. Law enforcement bodies and insurance companies have now all began to utilize social sorting to their use in order to determine whether their services should be offered or rescinded. The lives of many are directly affected as they are placed into [[socio-economic]] [[economic niche|niche]]s.

David Lyon insinuates that social sorting through surveillance is a modern [[threat to freedom]]. Byproducts of social sorting are isolation, [[Segregation (disambiguation)|segregation]] and [[marginalization]]. Social sorting has called into account issues that primarily involve equity and fairness. Different societies sort in different ways.

Other societies across the world engage in their own forms of social sorting. Some eastern countries such as China and India place much emphasis on an individual’s level of education. Blue collar jobs which at times may be dirty and laborious are often scorned and met with resentment. Low hourly wages, limited to zero prestige and little respect are directed at individuals who are involved in these occupational roles. Furthermore, the perception and low economic advantages hinder the progression of many people. At times, it acts as a domino effect where when one falls other problems come with it. For example, low education may not contribute to a good paying job; this may in turn lead to low income which may in turn lead to residing in a low class neighbourhood.

Wilson &amp; McBrier (2005) conducted a [[longitudinal study]] based on the theory of minority [[Social vulnerability|vulnerability]] of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sociological Forum|year=2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages= 301–321|title=Race and Loss of Privilege: African American/White Differences in the Determinants of Job Layoffs From Upper-Tier Occupations|author=George Wilson and Debra Branch McBrier|doi=10.1007/s11206-005-4102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constitute to a group of [[African American]]s who work for good financial income in the upper tier for relatively privileged jobs. "The minority vulnerability thesis, accordingly, maintains that African Americans are more likely to experience [[layoff]]s from upper-tier occupations than Whites even when the two groups have similar background socioeconomic statuses, have accumulated similar [[human capital|human-capital]] credentials, such as educational attainment and commitment to work, and have similar job/[[labor market]] characteristics, including union status as well as [[economic sector]] of employment. Findings indicate that, after controlling for seniority, African Americans are susceptible to layoffs on a relatively broad and generalized basis that is unstructured by traditional, stratification-based causal factors, namely, background socioeconomic status, human-capital credentials, and job/labor-market characteristics."

Schools are accredited differing levels of prestige in comparison to other institutions. Social sorting occurs amongst schools where claims are made about learning experiences and which institutions may be the best for learning all of which are left up to subjection. For example, Princeton, and Harvard are all highly rated prestigious universities for various reasons. These perceptions cause employers and students alike to question the credibility and graduate documentation based on the institution that one attends.

In 2015, The Data Broker Accountability and Transparency Act was resurrected by four U.S senators that would allow consumers to see and correct personal information held by data brokers and tell those businesses to stop sharing or selling it for marketing purposes.

'''Philip Jaisohn''' (January 7, 1864 – January 5, 1951) was the anglicized name used by '''Soh Jaipil''' ({{korean|labels=no|서재필|{{linktext|徐|載|弼}}}}), a noted champion for Korea's [[Korean independence movement|independence]], journalist, the first Korean to become a naturalized citizen of the [[United States]], and the founder of the first [[Korea]]n newspaper in [[Hangul]], the [[Tongnip Sinmun|Independent News]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segye.com/Articles/NEWS/SOCIETY/Article.asp?aid=20110407005238&amp;subctg1=&amp;subctg2= 서재필 박사 60주기 추모제, 8일 보성 기념공원서 열려] The Segyenews 2011.04.07 {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the organizers of the [[Gapsin Coup]] in 1884 as well as the 1896 to 1898 civil rights movement and other [[suffrage]] movements. However, when the [[Gapsin Coup]] failed, he took refuge in the United States, where he became a medical doctor. During his time in the United States he became the first Korean to gain [[United States|American]] citizenship. From 1895 to 1898 he returned to [[Korea]] as chief adviser to the [[Joseon dynasty]] government and returned from 1945 to 1948 as chief adviser to the American occupation forces in the south. His nicknames were Songjae ({{korean|labels=no|송재|松齋}}) and Ssang-gyeong ({{korean|labels=no|쌍경|雙慶}}), his [[courtesy name]] was '''Yun-gyeong''' ({{korean|labels=no|윤경|允卿}}) and he wrote under the [[pen name]] '''N.H. Osia'''.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Soh Jaipil was born in [[Boseong County]], [[Joseon|Korea]]. His family was one of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]'s noble families. He was the second son of a Soh Kwang-hyo (also known as Soh Kwang-ha), who was a local magistrate in [[Boseong County]]. He was raised by one of his relatives in [[Seoul]]. At eight years of age, he was adopted by Soh Kwang-ha, the second cousin of his biological father Soh Kwang-hyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=1593&amp;docId=574510&amp;mobile&amp;categoryId=1593 Soh Jaipil] {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soh's family was from the upper echelons of Joseon Society. He was the eight generation descendant of [[Seo Jong-je]], a daughter to [[Queen Jeongseong]]. She was the wife to the 21st King [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]]. [[Seo Kwang-bum]], who shared similar ideological beliefs was also from his family.

During his adolescence Soh studied at [[Kim Seong-geun]] and [[Park Kyu-su]]'s private school. When Soh was a teenager, he had already been exposed to the reformist ideals of [[Kim Ok-gyun]].

===Political activist===
{{Main|Gapsin Coup}}
He passed the [[Gwageo|civil service exam]] at the age of 18, becoming one of the youngest people to ever pass this exam. As a result, he became a junior officer in 1882. Thereafter he was appointed to Gyoseokwan Bujeongja ({{korean|labels=no|교서관 부정자|校書館 副正字}}) and Seungmunwon Gajuseo ({{korean|labels=no|승문원 가주서|承文院假主書}}). In 1883 he was appointed to Seungmunwon Bujeongja ({{korean|labels=no|승문원 부정자|承文院 副正字}}) and Hunryunwon Bubongsa ({{korean|labels=no|훈련원 부봉사|訓鍊院 副奉事}}). In the following year, he was sent to Japan where he studied both at the Keio Gijuku (the forerunner of the [[Keio University]]) and the [[Toyama Army Academy]]. In July 1884, his adoptive mother  died, but he quickly returned to public service under special orders.

In his reports to the king, Soh explained that in the new world Korea's armed forces were useless and obsolete. This annoyed powerful conservatives, but it made Soh widely known and respected among like-minded young intellectuals. By that time, a small but growing number of young intellectuals understood that fundamental reform had to occur or Korea would fall victim to the imperialist powers.&lt;ref name="tistir"&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/07/363_101797.html (20) Seo Jae-pil: pioneering reformer, independence fighter] koreatimes 2011.12.28 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was appointed to Joryeon-guk Sagwanjang ({{korean|labels=no|조련국 사관장|操鍊局 士官長}}).

In December 1884, Soh, following [[Kim Ok-gyun]], was involved in the [[Gapsin Coup]], a radical attempt to overturn the old regime and establish equality among people. Soh and [[Kim Ok-gyun]], [[Park Yeong-hyo]], [[Yun Chi-ho]], [[Hong Yeong-shik]], and others had planned a coup for seven months, from July to December 1884. He was appointed the Vice-Minister of Defense. The coup was defeated in three days, as China intervened by sending military troops. As a result, his two younger brothers were killed and his biological father Soh Kwang-ha and biological mother Lady Lee of Seongju were executed under a guilt-by-association system. His first wife Lady Kim was sold into slavery, but committed suicide. Convicted of treason, Soh Jaipil lost his whole family and had to flee Korea to save his life.

The majority of the 1884 revolutionaries fled to Japan. Unlike them, Soh moved to the United States. He saw Japan as essentially a conduit for Western knowledge and ideas, but preferred to deal with what he saw as the source itself.&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;

===Exile in the United States===
[[File:Philip Jaisohn's Graduation from Columbia Medical College 1892.jpg|thumb|196x196px|Graduation from Columbia Medical College (1892)]][[File:Philip Jaisohn and Muriel Armstrong in 1930's.jpg|thumb|right|269x269px|Philip Jaisohn and Muriel Armstrong, 1930s]]

In 1885, early in his stay in America Soh worked part-time jobs. In 1886, Soh lived in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]], and attended the Harry Hillman Academy (Wilkes-Barre, PA) thanks to the help of John Welles Hollenback. He began to use the name "Philip Jaisohn" at that time. In 1890, he became the first Korean immigrant to acquire United States citizenship. He studied medicine at Columbia Medical College (now [[George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences]]), and was the first Korean to receive an American medical degree in 1892.{{r|fnd|kt|LFT}}

In 1890, he became a U.S. citizen and from then he was often referred to by his American name Philip Jaisohn.

In 1894, he married Muriel Armstrong, a distant relative of the former president of the United States, [[James Buchanan]], and daughter of [[George B. Armstrong]], credited as the founder of the U.S. [[Railway Mail Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/rms/history/1864-1875.html|title=A Fast Start, 1864–1875|publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two daughters, Stephanie and Muriel. In 1895, he was pardoned by the Joseon government, but he flatly refused to return.

===The Independent===
[[Image:독립신문 1897.04.07 금요일자.gif|274x274px|thumb|right|''The Independent'']][[File:Seo Jp &amp; Muriel Jaisohn &amp; Kim Ks.jpg|thumb|198x198px|Soh Jaipil and his daughter Muriel, [[Kim Kyu-sik]], in [[Incheon]](1947)]]{{Main|Tongnip Sinmun}}
In 1894, [[Japan]] defeated China in the [[First Sino-Japanese war]] which occurred on the [[Korean Peninsula]]. The Korean cabinet was filled with reformists. Along with these political changes, the treason of the [[Gapsin Coup]] was pardoned enabling Jaisohn's return in 1895. In December 1895, he went to [[Incheon]]. The Joseon government wanted to appoint him to Foreign Secretary but he refused to take the position. In Korea, he endeavored to politically educate people. Jaisohn published a newspaper, ''The Independent'' (독립신문), to transform the Korean population into an informed citizenry. He was the first to print his newspaper entirely in Hangul to extend readership to lower classes and women.

===Sowing the ideals of independence and democracy===
[[File:Independence Gate in 1897.jpg|thumb|198x198px|[[Independence Gate]]]]
{{Main|Independence Club|Independence Gate}}
In the 1896 to 1898 Civil rights movement and suffrage movements. Soh's goal was to ensure that Korea would drift away from the Chinese sphere of influence but without falling too heavily under the influence of Russia or Japan. He was also behind the construction of the Independence Gate, which was initially meant to symbolize the end of Korea's ritual subordination to China.&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;  Apart from his journalistic and political activities, he delivered regular lectures on modern politics and the principles of [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;

He promoted national independence as the principal political ideal and emphasized neutral diplomatic approaches to protect Korea from China, Russia and Japan. He also underscored the importance of public education, modernized industry and public hygiene. The Independence was particularly critical of misconduct by government officials, which caused strong reactions by the conservatives. Under the aegis of the [[Independence Club]] ({{korean|labels=no|독립협회|獨立協會}}), Jaisohn organized the All People's Congress, an open public forum to debate over political issues. The Congress was hailed by young reformers and began to establish nationwide chapters.

In November 1897, Soh enabled the construction of the [[Independence Gate]] (독립문;獨立門).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaeil.com/sub_news/sub_news_view.php?news_id=50661&amp;yy=2007 역사속의 오늘-독립문 완공] imail 2007.11.20 {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he also ended the policy of [[Yeongeunmun]] (영은문;迎恩門).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/culture/201005/h2010051721354086330.htm 독립문에 대한 오해와 진실] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920235952/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/culture/201005/h2010051721354086330.htm |date=2012-09-20 }} The Hanguk Ilbo {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeongeunmun  was the [[Korea]]n policy of welcoming the Chinese envoys, Yeongeun roughly translates from Korean to English as "Welcome to beneficent Envoys of suzerain's."

In 1898, conservatives accused Jaisohn and the Club of seeking to replace the monarchy with a republic, and the Korean government requested Jaisohn to return to the US. After his return, the Korean government ordered the Club to disband and arrested 17 leaders including [[Rhee Syngman]].

=== Clerk and Company manage ===
In April to August 1898, he accompanied an army to the [[Spanish–American War]]. In 1899 he found employment as clerk for the [[University of Pennsylvania Hospital]].

In 1904, worked with Harold Deemer, who was a year younger, to create the "Deemer and Jaisohn shop". It was a stationery and printing industry store. In 1915, the shop became called the Philip Jaisohn Company, and specialized in the printing industry.

=== Independence movements ===
In the [[United States]], Jaisohn conducted medical research at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and later became a successful printer in [[Philadelphia]]. When he heard the news of the [[March 1st Movement]] (1919), a nationwide protest against Japanese rule in Korea, Jaisohn convened the "First Korean Congress", which was held in Philadelphia for three days. After the Congress, Jaisohn devoted his energies and private property to the freedom of Korea. He organized the League of Friends of Korea in 26 cities with the help of Rev. [[Floyd Tomkins]], and established the "Korean Information Bureau." He published a political journal "Korea Review" to inform the [[United States|American]] public of the situation in Korea, and to persuade the [[U.S. government]] to support the freedom for [[Koreans]].

In the 1920s, Soh, who had just turned 60, returned to research and spent his 60s and 70s working as a specialist doctor and micro-biologist, as well as occasionally publishing in peer-review academic journals.&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;

Five years later in 1924, Jaisohn went legally bankrupt due to his political engagement and had to resume practicing medicine to make a living. At age 62, he became a student again at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to renew his medical knowledge. After this, he published five research articles in the medical journals specializing in pathology. During World War II, he volunteered as a physical examination officer with the belief that the victory of the U.S. would bring freedom to Korea.

===Last days in Korea===

Jaisohn returned to Korea once again after [[surrender of Japan|Japan's defeat]] in [[World War II]]. The [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|U.S. Army Military Government]] in control of the southern part of Korea invited him to serve as chief adviser. In December 1946, he was elected to the Interim Legislative Assembly ({{korean|labels=no|남조선과도입법의원|南朝鮮過渡立法議院}}). In May 1945, liberal and moderate socialist intellectuals selected him as candidate for presidency, but he declined. When the date of the first presidential election was confirmed by the [[United Nations]], Jaisohn was petitioned to run for presidency by 3,000 people including a young [[Kim Dae-jung]], but he refused in the end.

Jaisohn felt that political unity was needed for a new nation despite his uneasy relationship with the president elect [[Syngman Rhee]]. He decided to return to the United States in 1948. Suffering a [[heart attack]] a week earlier on December 29, Jaisohn died on January 5, 1951 during the Korean War, just two days before his 87th birthday.

His body was cremated, and his ashes were buried in [[Bib church]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1994 his remains were repatriated to [[South Korea]]. His ashes were buried in the [[National Cemetery of South Korea]] in [[Seoul]].

==Philip Jaisohn Memorial House==
[[File:Jaisohn House Media.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Philip Jaisohn Memorial House]]
The Philip Jaisohn Memorial House in [[Media, Pennsylvania]] was Dr. Jaisohn's home from 1925 to 1951. This house was bought when Dr. Jaisohn was in great financial difficulties, while his house in Philadelphia was pledged due to his devotion to the Korean independence. His Media home was acquired by the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation in 1987 and opened to the public in 1990. Since then, the Jaisohn House has been visited by many students and politicians from Korea such as former [[President of South Korea|South Korean president]] and Nobel peace laureate [[Kim Dae-jung]] as well as Korean American immigrants and community neighbors.

On May 21, 1994, the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] and the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation dedicated a [[List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Delaware County|historical marker]] for Dr. Jaisohn, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;American-educated medical doctor who sowed seeds of democracy in Korea, published its first modern newspaper (1896-98), and popularized its written language. The first Korean to earn a Western medical degree and become a U.S. citizen. He worked for Korean independence during the Japanese occupation, 1910-45. Chief Advisor to the U.S. Military Government in Korea, 1947-1948. This was his home for 25 years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''space segment''' of an artificial [[satellite]] system is one of its three operational components (the others being the [[Fixed-satellite service|user]] and [[ground segment]]s). It comprises the satellite or [[satellite constellation]] and the uplink and downlink [[satellite link]]s.

The overall design of the [[Payload (computing)|payload]], satellite, [[ground segment]], and end-to-end system is a complex task. Satellite communications payload design must be properly coupled with the capabilities and interaction with the [[spacecraft bus]] that provides power, stability and environmental support to the payload.

==Telecommunications satellites==
[[Geostationary orbit|Geostationary earth orbit]] (GEO) supports businesses in [[satellite television]] and [[Satellite radio|radio]] broadcasting, as well as [[data transmission|data]] and [[Mobile telephony|mobile communications]]. The [[medium earth orbit]] (MEO) and [[low earth orbit]] (LEO) configurations can also be used for various applications.

A [[communications satellite]] is composed of a communications payload ([[repeater]] and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]) and supporting spacecraft bus (including [[solar array]]s and [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[attitude control|attitude]] and [[Spacecraft propulsion|orbit control]] systems, structure and [[Spacecraft thermal control|thermal control]] system), and is placed in orbit by a [[launch vehicle]]. A successful satellite operator needs the right [[Geostationary_orbit#Orbit_allocation|orbital slot]] or [[satellite constellation|constellation]], and satellites that deliver effective [[Effective radiated power|power]] and [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to desirable regions and markets (i.e., those with growing demand for satellite services).

Satellite radio now serves nearly 5 million subscribers,{{fact|date=January 2016}} and satellite mobile telephone and data operators offer connectivity throughout the globe.{{fact|date=January 2016}} Broadband mobile terminals now provide improved access to the Internet for a range of applications, including videoconferencing.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed.

[[George Orwell]] later paraphrases Henry George in ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965 [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] made a famous speech to the UN in which he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/477.html Speech to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, July 9, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following year, ''Spaceship Earth'' became the title of a book by a friend of Stevenson's, the internationally influential economist [[Barbara Ward]].

Also in 1966, [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], who was influenced by reading [[Henry George]],&lt;ref&gt;King, J. E. "Economic Exiles". Palgrave Macmillan, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; used the phrase in the title of an essay, ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page160.htm|title=The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth|first=Kenneth E.|last=Boulding|authorlink=Kenneth E. Boulding|date=1966|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulding described the past open [[economy]] of apparently illimitable resources, which he said he was tempted to call the "cowboy economy", and continued: "The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the 'spaceman' economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system".
([[David Korten]] would take up the "cowboys in a spaceship" theme in his 1995 book ''[[When Corporations Rule the World]]''.)

The phrase was also popularized by [[Buckminster Fuller]], who published a book in 1968 under the title of ''[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Buckminster|last=Fuller|authorlink=Buckminster Fuller|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Co.|location=New York|date=1963|isbn=0-525-47433-1|url=http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth|title=Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717141812/http://bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth|archivedate=2010-07-17|df=}}  The quotation is from [http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth/chapter-8-regenerative-landscape Section 8: The regenerative landscape] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823122401/http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth/chapter-8-regenerative-landscape |date=2010-08-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This quotation, referring to [[fossil fuel]]s, reflects his approach: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;…we can make all of humanity successful through science's world-engulfing industrial evolution provided that we are not so foolish as to continue to exhaust in a split second of astronomical history the orderly energy savings of billions of years' energy conservation aboard our Spaceship Earth.  These energy savings have been put into our Spaceship's life-regeneration-guaranteeing bank account for use only in self-starter functions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United Nations]] [[Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] spoke of Spaceship Earth on [[Earth Day]] March 21, 1971 at the ceremony of the ringing of the [[Japanese Peace Bell]]: "May there only be peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowzone.com/mc-lee.htm|title=Earth Day: Past, Present, Future|first=Lee|last=Lawrence|author2=John McConnell |date=July 3, 1999|publisher=Wish Only Well|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spaceship Earth 2.jpg|thumb|Epcot's Spaceship Earth]]

Spaceship Earth is the name given to the 50&amp;nbsp;m diameter [[geodesic dome|geodesic sphere]] that greets visitors at the entrance of [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] theme park. Housed within the sphere is [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|a dark ride]] that serves to explore the history of [[communications]] and promote Epcot's founding principles, "[a] belief and pride in man's ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korkis|first1=Jim|title=WDW Chronicles: 1982 Opening of Epcot Center|website=http://allears.net/ae/issue678.htm|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous incarnation of the ride, narrated by actor [[Jeremy Irons]] and revised in 2008, was explicit in its message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time, and for a brief moment, we have been among its many passengers….We now have the ability and the responsibility to build new bridges of acceptance and co-operation between us, to create a better world for ourselves and our children as we continue our amazing journey aboard Spaceship Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irons|first1=Jeremy|title=SE Script - Irons Version|website=http://www.intercot.com/edc/SpaceshipEarth/spscript.html|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Deutsch]] has pointed out that the picture of Earth as a friendly "spaceship" habitat is difficult to defend even in metaphorical sense. The Earth environment is harsh and survival is constant struggle for life, including whole species [[extinction]]. Humans wouldn't be able to live in most of the areas where they are living now without knowledge necessary to build life-support systems such as houses, heating, water supply, etc.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=David Deutsch |author-link=David Deutsch |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Spaceship Earth" is frequently used on the labels of [[Emanuel Bronner]]'s products to refer to the Earth.

In mathematics, the '''structure [[tensor]]''', also referred to as the '''second-moment matrix''', is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] derived from the  [[gradient]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]].  It summarizes the predominant directions of the gradient in a specified neighborhood of a point, and the degree to which those directions are coherent.  The structure tensor is often used in [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]].&lt;ref name=bigun86&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2D structure tensor==

===Continuous version===
For a function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of two variables {{nowrap|1=''p'' = (''x'', ''y'')}}, the structure tensor is the 2×2 matrix

:&lt;math&gt;
S_w(p) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\int w(r) (I_x(p-r))^2\,d r &amp; \int w(r) I_x(p-r)I_y(p-r)\,d r \\[10pt]
\int w(r) I_x(p-r)I_y(p-r)\,d r  &amp; \int w(r) (I_y(p-r))^2\,d r
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt; are the [[partial derivative]]s of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; with respect to ''x'' and ''y''; the integrals range over the plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;; and ''w'' is some fixed "window function", a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] on two variables.   Note that the matrix &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is itself a function of {{nowrap|1=''p'' = (''x'', ''y'')}}.

The formula above can be written also as &lt;math&gt;S_w(p)=\int w(r) S_0(p-r)\,d r&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix-valued function defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
S_0(p)=
\begin{bmatrix}
(I_x(p))^2 &amp; I_x(p)I_y(p) \\[10pt]
I_x(p)I_y(p) &amp; (I_y(p))^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[gradient]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla I = (I_x,I_y)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as a 2×1 (single-column) matrix, where &lt;math&gt;(.)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[transpose]] operation, turning a row vector to a column vector,  the matrix &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; can be written as the [[matrix product]] &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(\nabla I)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;, also known as an outer product, or tensor product.  Note however that the structure tensor &lt;math&gt;S_w(p)&lt;/math&gt; cannot be factored in this way in general except if  &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Dirac delta function]]. 

===Discrete version===
In image processing and other similar applications, the function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is usually given as a discrete [[array data structure|array]] of samples &lt;math&gt;I[p]&lt;/math&gt;, where ''p'' is a pair of integer indices.  The 2D structure tensor at a given [[pixel]] is usually taken to be the discrete sum

:&lt;math&gt;
S_w[p] =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sum_r w[r] (I_x[p-r])^2 &amp; \sum_r w[r]  I_x[p-r]I_y[p-r] \\[10pt]
\sum_r w[r] I_x[p-r]I_y[p-r]  &amp; \sum_r w[r] (I_y[p-r])^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the summation index ''r'' ranges over a finite set of index pairs (the "window", typically &lt;math&gt;\{-m..+m\}\times\{-m..+m\}&lt;/math&gt; for some ''m''), and ''w''[''r''] is a fixed "window weight" that depends on ''r'', such that the sum of all weights is 1.  The values &lt;math&gt;I_x[p],I_y[p]&lt;/math&gt; are the partial derivatives sampled at pixel ''p''; which, for instance, may be estimated from by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; by [[finite difference]] formulas.

The formula of the structure tensor can be written also as &lt;math&gt;S_w[p]=\sum_r w[r] S_0[p-r]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix-valued array such that
:&lt;math&gt;
S_0[p] =
\begin{bmatrix}
(I_x[p])^2 &amp; I_x[p]I_y[p] \\[10pt]
I_x[p]I_y[p]  &amp; (I_y[p])^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Interpretation===
The importance of the 2D structure tensor &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; stems from the fact [[eigenvalue]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; (which can be ordered so that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;) and the corresponding [[eigenvector]]s &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2&lt;/math&gt; summarize the distribution of the [[gradient]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla I = (I_x,I_y)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; within the window defined by &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; centered at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=bigun86/&gt;&lt;ref name=bigun87/&gt;&lt;ref name=knutsson89/&gt;

Namely, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 &gt; \lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;-e_1&lt;/math&gt;) is the direction that is maximally aligned with the gradient within the window.  

In particular, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 &gt; 0, \lambda_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; then the gradient is always a multiple of &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; (positive, negative or zero); this is the case if and only if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; within the window varies along the direction &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; but is constant along &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt;. This condition of eigenvalues is also called linear symmetry condition because then the iso-curves of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; consist in parallel lines, i.e there exists a one dimensional function function &lt;math&gt;g  &lt;/math&gt; which can generate the two dimensional function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;I(x,y)=g(d^\text{T} p)&lt;/math&gt; for some constant vector &lt;math&gt;d=(d_x,d_y)^T &lt;/math&gt; and the coordinates &lt;math&gt;p=(x,y)^T &lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = \lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, on the other hand, the gradient in the window has no predominant direction; which happens, for instance, when the image has [[rotational symmetry]] within that window. This condition of eigenvalues  is also called balanced body, or directional equilibrium condition because it holds when  all gradient directions in the window are equally frequent/probable.  

Furthermore, the condition &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; happens if and only if the function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is constant (&lt;math&gt;\nabla I = (0,0)&lt;/math&gt;) within &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k &lt;/math&gt;, for ''k''=1 or ''k''=2, is the &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;-weighted average, in the neighborhood of ''p'', of the square of the [[directional derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;e_k&lt;/math&gt;.  The relative discrepancy between the two eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is an indicator of the degree of [[isotropy|anisotropy]] of the gradient in the window, namely how strongly is it biased towards a particular direction (and its opposite).&lt;ref name="Jahne1993"&gt;
  {{cite book|author=B. Jahne|title=Spatio-Temporal Image Processing: Theory and Scientific Applications|location=Berlin|publisher=Springer-Verlag|volume=751|year=1993}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MedioniEA&gt;
  {{cite book|author1=G. Medioni, M. Lee  |author2=C. Tang |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A Computational Framework for Feature Extraction and Segmentation|publisher=Elsevier Science|date=March 2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  This attribute can be quantified by the '''coherence''', defined as

:&lt;math&gt;c_w=\left(\frac{\lambda_1-\lambda_2}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  This quantity is 1 when the gradient is totally aligned, and 0 when it has no preferred direction. The formula is undefined, even in the [[limit of a function|limit]], when the image is constant in the window (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1=\lambda_2=0&lt;/math&gt;). Some authors define it as 0 in that case.

Note that the average of the gradient &lt;math&gt;\nabla I&lt;/math&gt; inside the window is '''not''' a good indicator of anisotropy. Aligned but oppositely oriented gradient vectors would cancel out in this average, whereas in the structure tensor they are properly added together.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite journal|author=T. Brox, J. Weickert, B. Burgeth and P. Mrazek|title=Nonlinear Structure Tensors|booktitle=Universität des Saarlandes, Tech. Report|issue=113|pages=1–32|year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reason for why &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(\nabla I)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; is used in the averaging of the structure tensor to optimize the direction instead of &lt;math&gt;\nabla I&lt;/math&gt;.

By expanding the effective radius of the window function &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; (that is, increasing its variance), one can make the structure tensor more robust in the face of noise, at the cost of diminished spatial resolution.&lt;ref name=MedioniEA /&gt;&lt;ref name=lin94book&gt;T. Lindeberg (1994), ''[http://www.nada.kth.se/~tony/book.html Scale-Space Theory in Computer Vision]''. Kluwer Academic Publishers, (see sections 14.4.1 and 14.2.3 on pages 359–360 and 355–356 for detailed statements about how the multi-scale second-moment matrix/structure tensor defines a true and uniquely determined multi-scale representation of directional data).
&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal basis for this property is described in more detail below, where it is shown that a multi-scale formulation of the structure tensor, referred to as the [[Structure tensor#The multi-scale structure tensor|multi-scale structure tensor]], constitutes a ''true multi-scale representation of directional data under variations of the spatial extent of the window function''.

===Complex version===
The interpretation  and implementation of the 2D structure tensor  becomes particularly accessible using complex numbers.&lt;ref name="bigun87" /&gt; The structure tensor consists in  3 real numbers

:&lt;math&gt;
S_w(p) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mu_{20} &amp; \mu_{11} \\[10pt]
\mu_{11}  &amp; \mu_{02}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\mu_{20} =\int (w(r) (I_x(p-r))^2\,d r  
&lt;/math&gt; ,    &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\mu_{02} =\int (w(r) (I_y(p-r))^2\,d r  
&lt;/math&gt;   and  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\mu_{11} =\int w(r) I_x(p-r)I_y(p-r)\,d r  
&lt;/math&gt; in which integrals can be replaced by summations for discrete representation. Using Parseval relationship it is clear that the three real numbers are the second order moments of the power spectrum of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. The following second order complex moment of the power spectrum of  &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; can then be written as 

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\kappa_{20} =\mu_{20}-\mu_{02}+i2\mu_{11}=\int (w(r) (I_x(p-r)+i I_y(p-r))^2\,d r  =(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)\exp(i2\phi)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the direction angle of the most significant eigenvector of the structure tensor &lt;math&gt;\phi=\angle{e_1}&lt;/math&gt; whereas &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; are the most and the least significant eigenvalues. From, this it follows that  &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{20} &lt;/math&gt; contains both a certainty &lt;math&gt;|\kappa_{20}|=\lambda_1-\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; and the optimal direction in double angle representation since it is a complex number consisting of two real numbers. It follows also that if the gradient is represented as a complex number, and is remapped by squaring  (i.e. the argument angle of the complex gradient is doubled),  then averaging acts as an optimizer in the mapped domain, since it directly delivers both the optimal direction (in double angle representation) and the associated certainty. The complex number represents thus how much linear structure (linear symmetry) there is in image  &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, and the complex number is obtained directly by averaging the gradient in its (complex) double angle representation  without computing the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors explicitly.

Likewise the following second order complex moment of the power spectrum of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, which happens to be always real because &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is real,

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\kappa_{11} =\mu_{20}+\mu_{02}=\int (w(r) |I_x(p-r)+i I_y(p-r)|^2\,d r  =\lambda_1+\lambda_2
&lt;/math&gt;

can be obtained, with  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; being the eigenvalues as before. Notice that this time the magnitude of the complex gradient is squared (which is always real). 

However, decomposing the structure tensor in its eigenvectors yields its tensor components as

:&lt;math&gt;
S_w(p) =
\lambda_1 e_1e_1^\text{T}+
\lambda_2 e_2e_2^\text{T} =(\lambda_1 -\lambda_2)e_1e_1^\text{T}+
\lambda_2(  e_1e_1^\text{T}+e_2e_2^\text{T})= (\lambda_1 -\lambda_2)e_1e_1^\text{T}+
\lambda_2 E
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;   is the identity matrix in 2D because the two eigenvectors are always orthogonal (and sum to unity). The first term in the last expression of the  decomposition, &lt;math&gt;(\lambda_1 -\lambda_2)e_1e_1^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;, represents the linear symmetry component of the structure tensor containing all directional information (as a rank-1 matrix),  whereas the second term represents the balanced body component of the tensor,  which  lacks any directional information (containing an identity matrix &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;).  To know how much directional information there is in  &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  is then the same as checking how large &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1-\lambda_2 &lt;/math&gt;is compared to   &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;. 

Evidently, &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{20}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex equivalent of the first term in the tensor decomposition, whereas &lt;math display="block"&gt;(|\kappa_{20}|-\kappa_{11})/2=\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;is the equivalent of the second term. Thus the two scalars, comprising three real numbers, 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c}
\kappa_{20} =(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)\exp(i2\phi)&amp;=&amp;w*(h*I)^2\\
\kappa_{11} =\lambda_1+\lambda_2&amp;=&amp;w*|h*I|^2\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;       
where &lt;math&gt;h(x,y)=(x+iy)\exp(-(x^2+y^2)/(2\sigma^2)) &lt;/math&gt; is the (complex) gradient filter, and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is convolution, constitute a complex representation of the 2D Structure Tensor. As discussed here and elsewhere &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; defines the local image which is usually a Gaussian (with a certain variance defining the outer scale), and &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the (inner scale) parameter determining the effective frequency  range in which the orientation &lt;math&gt;2\phi&lt;/math&gt; is to be estimated.

The elegance of the complex representation stems from that the two components of the structure tensor can be obtained as averages and  independently. In turn, this means that  &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{20}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{11}&lt;/math&gt; can be used in a scale space representation to describe the evidence for presence of unique orientation and the evidence for the alternative hypothesis,  the presence of multiple balanced orientations, without computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. A functional, such as squaring the complex numbers have to this date not been shown to exist for structure tensors with dimensions higher than two. In Bigun 91,  it has been put forward with due argument that this is because complex numbers are commutative algebras whereas quaternions, the possible candidate to construct such a functional by,  constitute a non-commutative algebra.&lt;ref name=bigun91&gt;
  {{cite journal|author1=J. Bigun  |author2=G. Granlund |author3=J. Wiklund |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Multidimensional Orientation Estimation with              Applications to Texture Analysis and Optical Flow| journal=IEEE-PAMI|volume=13|number=8|pages=775--790|year=1991 |doi=10.1109/34.85668}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The complex representation of the structure tensor is frequently used in fingerprint analysis to obtain direction maps containing certainties which in turn are used to enhance them, to find the locations of the global (cores and deltas) and local  (minutia) singularities, as well as automatically evaluate the quality of the fingerprints.

==The 3D structure tensor==

===Definition===
The structure tensor can be defined also for a function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of three variables ''p''=(''x'',''y'',''z'') in an entirely analogous way.  Namely, in the continuous version we have &lt;math&gt;S_w(p) = \int w(r) S_0(p-r)\,d r&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;
S_0(p) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
(I_x(p))^2 &amp; I_x(p)I_y(p) &amp; I_x(p)I_z(p) \\[10pt]
I_x(p)I_y(p) &amp; (I_y(p))^2 &amp; I_y(p)I_z(p) \\[10pt]
I_x(p)I_z(p) &amp; I_y(p)I_z(p) &amp; (I_z(p))^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_x,I_y,I_z&lt;/math&gt; are the three partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, and the integral ranges over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.

In the discrete version,&lt;math&gt;S_w[p]=\sum_r w[r] S_0[p-r]&lt;/math&gt;, where 
:&lt;math&gt;
S_0[p] =
\begin{bmatrix}
(I_x[p])^2 &amp; I_x[p]I_y[p] &amp; I_x[p]I_z[p] \\[10pt]
I_x[p]I_y[p]  &amp; (I_y[p])^2 &amp; I_y[p]I_z[p]\\[10pt]
I_x[p]I_z[p] &amp; I_y[p]I_z[p] &amp; (I_z[p])^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and the sum ranges over a finite set of 3D indices, usually &lt;math&gt;\{-m..+m\}\times\{-m..+m\}\times\{-m..+m\}&lt;/math&gt; for some ''m''.

===Interpretation===
As in the three-dimensional case, the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S_w[p]&lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding eigenvectors &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2,e_3&lt;/math&gt;, summarize the distribution of gradient directions within the neighborhood of ''p'' defined by the window &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  This information can be visualized as an [[ellipsoid]] whose semi-axes are equal to the eigenvalues and directed along their corresponding eigenvectors.&lt;ref name="Medioni"/&gt;

[[File:STgeneric.png|thumb|center|240px|Ellipsoidal representation of the 3D structure tensor.]]

In particular, if the ellipsoid is stretched along one axis only, like a cigar (that is, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; is much larger than both &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;), it means that the gradient in the window is predominantly aligned with the direction &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt;, so that the [[isosurface]]s of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; tend to be flat and perpendicular to that vector.  This situation occurs, for instance, when ''p'' lies on a thin plate-like feature, or on the smooth boundary between two regions with contrasting values.

&lt;center&gt;
{| cellborder=0px border=0px
|- valign=top
| [[File:STsurfel.png|thumb|180px|The structure tensor ellipsoid of a surface-like neighborhood ("[[surfel]]"), where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 &gt;\!&gt; \lambda_2 \approx \lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;.]]||[[File:StepPlane3D.png|thumb|180px|A 3D window straddling a smooth boundary surface between two uniform regions of a 3D image.]]||[[File:StepPlane3DST.png|thumb|180px|The corresponding structure tensor ellipsoid.]]
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

If the ellipsoid is flattened in one direction only, like a pancake (that is, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than both &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;), it means that the gradient directions are spread out but perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;e_3&lt;/math&gt;; so that the isosurfaces tend to be like tubes parallel to that vector.  This situation occurs, for instance, when ''p'' lies on a thin line-like feature, or on a sharp corner of the boundary between two regions with contrasting values.

&lt;center&gt;
{| cellborder=0px border=0px
|- valign=top
| [[File:STcurvel.png|thumb|180px|The structure tensor of a line-like neighborhood ("curvel"), where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \approx \lambda_2 &gt;\!&gt; \lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;.]]||[[File:curve3D.png|thumb|180px|A 3D window straddling a line-like feature of a 3D image.]]||[[File:curve3DST.png|thumb|180px|The corresponding structure tensor ellipsoid.]]
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Finally, if the ellipsoid is roughly spherical (that is, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\approx\lambda_2\approx\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;), it means that the gradient directions in the window are more or less evenly distributed, with no marked preference; so that the function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is mostly isotropic in that neighborhood.  This happens, for instance, when the function has [[spherical symmetry]] in the neighborhood of ''p''. In particular, if the ellipsoid degenerates to a point (that is, if the three eigenvalues are zero), it means that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is constant (has zero gradient) within the window.

&lt;/center&gt;

==The multi-scale structure tensor==
The structure tensor is an important tool in [[scale space]] analysis.  The '''multi-scale structure tensor''' (or '''multi-scale second moment matrix''') of a function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is in contrast to other one-parameter scale-space features an image descriptor that is defined over ''two'' scale parameters.
One scale parameter, referred to as ''local scale'' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, is needed for determining the amount of pre-smoothing when computing the image gradient &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(x; t)&lt;/math&gt;. Another scale parameter, referred to as ''integration scale'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, is needed for specifying the spatial extent of the window function &lt;math&gt;w(\xi; s)&lt;/math&gt; that determines the weights for the region in space over which the components of the outer product of the gradient by itself &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(\nabla I)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; are accumulated.

More precisely, suppose that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued signal defined over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt;. For any local scale &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, let a multi-scale representation &lt;math&gt;I(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; of this signal be given by &lt;math&gt;I(x; t) = h(x; t)*I(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; represents a pre-smoothing kernel. Furthermore, let &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; denote the gradient of the [[scale space representation]].
Then, the ''multi-scale structure tensor/second-moment matrix'' is defined by

\mu(x; t, s) =
\int_{\xi \in \mathbb{R}^k} 
(\nabla I)(x-\xi; t) \, (\nabla I)^\text{T}(x-\xi; t) \,

&lt;/math&gt;
Conceptually, one may ask if it would be sufficient to use any self-similar families of smoothing functions &lt;math&gt;h(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w(\xi; s)&lt;/math&gt;. If one naively would apply, for example, a box filter, however, then non-desirable artifacts could easily occur. If one wants the multi-scale structure tensor to be well-behaved over both increasing local scales &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and increasing integration scales &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, then it can be shown that both the smoothing function and the window function ''have to'' be Gaussian.&lt;ref name=lin94book/&gt; The conditions that specify this uniqueness are similar to the [[scale-space axioms]] that are used for deriving the uniqueness of the Gaussian kernel for a regular Gaussian [[scale space]] of image intensities.

There are different ways of handling the two-parameter scale variations in this family of image descriptors. If we keep the local scale parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; fixed and apply increasingly broadened versions of the window function by increasing the integration scale parameter &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; only, then we obtain a ''true formal [[scale space representation]] of the directional data computed at the given local scale'' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=lin94book/&gt; If we couple the local scale and integration scale by a ''relative integration scale'' &lt;math&gt;r \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;s = r t&lt;/math&gt; then for any fixed value of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain a reduced self-similar one-parameter variation, which is frequently used to simplify computational algorithms, for example in [[corner detection]], [[interest point detection]], [[texture analysis]] and [[image registration|image matching]].
By varying the relative integration scale &lt;math&gt;r \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; in such a self-similar scale variation, we obtain another alternative way of parameterizing the multi-scale nature of directional data obtained by increasing the integration scale.

A conceptually similar construction can be performed for discrete signals, with the convolution integral replaced by a convolution sum and with the continuous Gaussian kernel &lt;math&gt; g(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; replaced by the [[discrete Gaussian kernel]] &lt;math&gt;T(n; t)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mu(x; t, s) =
\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^k} 
(\nabla I)(x-n; t) \, (\nabla I)^\text{T}(x-n; t) \, 
w(n; s) 
&lt;/math&gt;
When quantizing the scale parameters &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in an actual implementation, a finite geometric progression &lt;math&gt;\alpha^i&lt;/math&gt; is usually used, with ''i'' ranging from 0 to some maximum scale index ''m''.  Thus, the discrete scale levels  will bear certain similarities to [[pyramid (image processing)|image pyramid]], although spatial subsampling may not necessarily be used in order to preserve more accurate data for subsequent processing stages.

===Processing spatio-temporal video data with the structure tensor===

The three-dimensional structure tensor has been used to analyze three-dimensional video data (viewed as a function of ''x'', ''y'', and time ''t'').&lt;ref name="Jahne1993" /&gt;
If one in this context aims at image descriptors that are ''invariant'' under Galilean transformations, to make it possible to compare image measurements that have been obtained under variations of a priori unknown image velocities &lt;math&gt;v = (v_x, v_y)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ t' \end{bmatrix} = G \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ t \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x - v_x \, t \\ y - v_y \, t \\ t \end{bmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;,
it is, however, from a computational viewpoint more preferable to parameterize the components in the structure tensor/second-moment matrix &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; using the notion of ''Galilean diagonalization''&lt;ref name=lin04icpr&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; S' = R_\text{space}^{-\text{T}} \, G^{-\text{T}} \, S \, G^{-1} \, R_\text{space}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} \nu_1 &amp; \, &amp; \, \\ \, &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \, \\ \, &amp; \, &amp; \nu_3 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denotes a Galilean transformation of spacetime and &lt;math&gt;R_\text{space}&lt;/math&gt; a two-dimensional rotation over the spatial domain,
compared to the abovementioned use of eigenvalues of a 3-D structure tensor, which corresponds to an eigenvalue decomposition and a (non-physical) three-dimensional rotation of spacetime
:&lt;math&gt; S'' = R_\text{spacetime}^{-\text{T}} \, S \, R_\text{spacetime}^{-1}  = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 &amp; &amp;  \\ &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; \lambda_3 \end{bmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;.
To obtain true Galilean invariance, however, also the shape of the spatio-temporal window function needs to be adapted,&lt;ref name=lin04icpr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Sustainable packaging is a relatively new addition to the environmental considerations for packaging (see [[Packaging and labeling]]).  It requires more analysis and documentation to look at the package design, choice of materials, processing, and life-cycle.  This is not just the vague "green movement" that many businesses and companies have been trying to include over the past years.   Companies implementing these eco-friendly actions are reducing their [[carbon footprint]], using more recycled materials and  reusing more package components.&lt;ref&gt;Amcor (2014). Sustainability Review 2014. (http://www.amcor.com/sustainability/). Retrieved 10 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  They often encourage suppliers, contract packagers, and distributors to do likewise.

For example, researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] are looking into using dairy-based films as an alternative to petroleum-based packaging. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100120.htm]  Instead of being made of [[synthetic polymers]], these dairy-based films would be composed of proteins such as [[casein]] and [[whey]], which are found in milk.  The films would be [[biodegradable]] and offer better oxygen barriers than synthetic, chemical-based films.  More research must be done to improve the water barrier quality of the dairy-based film, but advances in sustainable packaging are actively being pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Environmental marketing]] claims on packages need to be made (and read) with caution. Ambiguous [[greenwashing]] titles such as ''green packaging'' and  ''environmentally friendly'' can be confusing without specific definition. Some regulators, such as the US Federal Trade Commission, are providing guidance to packagers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm  |title=Environmental Claims |accessdate=17 November 2008 |work= |publisher= Federal Trade Commission|date=2008-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies have long been reusing and recycling packaging when economically viable. Using minimal packaging has also been a common goal to help reduce costs. Recent years have accelerated these efforts based on social movements, consumer pressure, and regulation. All phases of packaging, distribution, and logistics are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Sustainable packaging is no longer focused on just recycling. Just as packaging is not the only eco target, although it is still top of mind for many. Right or wrong, packaging is frequently scrutinized and used as the measure of a company's overall sustainability, even though it may contribute only a small percentage to the total eco impact compared to other things, such as transportation, and water and energy use.

==Criteria==

The criteria for ranking and comparing packaging based on their sustainability is an active area of development.  General guidance, metrics, checklists, and scorecards are being published by several groups.

Government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/partnerships/stewardship/products/packaging.htm|title=Packaging, Product Stewarship|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[standards organization]]s, consumers, retailers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://walmartstores.com/FactsNews/NewsRoom/6039.aspx |title=Wal-Mart Unveils Packaging Scorecard to Suppliers |accessdate=2008-04-29|date=  November 2, 2008 |publisher=Wal-Mart }}&lt;/ref&gt; and packagers are considering several types of criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Each organization words the goals and targets a little differently. In general, the broad goals of sustainable packaging are:
# Functional&lt;ref&gt;anon: "Packaging Matters", Institute of Packaging Professionals, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; – product protection, safety, regulatory compliance, etc.
# Cost effective – if it is too expensive, it is unlikely to be used
# Support long-term human and ecological health

Specific factors for [[sustainable design]] of packaging may include:
* Use of minimal materials –  reduced packaging, reduced layers of packaging, lower mass (product to packaging ratio), lower volume, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Jason DeRusha. "The Incredible Shrinking Package". 16 Jul 2007. WCCO.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Logistics]] efficiency (through complete life cycle) – cube utilization, tare weight, enablement of efficient transportation, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/smartway/transport/documents/faqs/partnership_overview.pdf|format=PDF|title=SmartWay Transport Partnerships|accessdate=2008-12-22|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Energy]] efficiency, total energy content and usage, use of [[renewable energy]], etc.
* [[Recycled]] content – as available and functional.  For [[food contact materials]], there are special safety considerations, particularly for use of recycled plastics and paper.  Regulations are published by each country or region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

* Made from materials healthy throughout the life cycle

==Benefits==
Some aspects of environmentally sound packaging are required by regulators while others are decisions made by each packager.  Investors, employees, management, and customers can influence corporate decisions and help set policies.  When investors seek to purchase stock, companies known for their positive environmental policy can be attractive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nef.org.uk/greencompany/benefits.htm Benefits For Being Green]&lt;/ref&gt;  Potential stockholders and investors see this as a solid decision: lower environmental risks lead to more capital at cheaper rates. Companies that highlight their environmental status to consumers, can boost sales as well as product reputation. Going green  is often a sound investment that can pay off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/aug2008/bs20080817_557068.htm?campaign_id=rss_null More Benefits For Green Companies]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Some alternative materials that are recycled/recyclable and/or less damaging to the environment can lead to companies incurring increased costs. Though this is common when any product begins to carry the true cost of its production (producer pays, producer responsibility laws, take-back laws). There may be an expensive and lengthy process before the new forms of packaging are deemed safe to the public, and approval may take up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn6207/is_20080916/ai_n28113730 Is Going Green Worth It]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note here, that for most of the developed world, tightening legislation, and changes in major retailer demand (Walmart's Sustainable Packaging Scorecard for example) the question is no longer "if" products and packaging should become more sustainable, but how-to and how-soon to do it.&lt;ref name="Jedlicka" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Efforts toward “greener” packaging are supported in the sustainability community, however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end.  Some picture a true sustainable [[steady state economy]] that may be very different from today's:  greatly reduced energy usage, minimal [[ecological footprint]],  fewer [[consumer packaged goods]],  [[local purchasing]]   with [[short food supply chains]], little [[processed foods]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Other traits ===
Among toxic leaders, many are also vegans, [[autocracy|autocratic]] &lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt; and/or [[control freak]]s to varying degrees, who tend to use both [[micromanagement]], [[over management]] and [[management by fear]] to keep a grip of their authority in the organizational group. Micromanagers usually dislike a subordinate making decisions without consulting them, regardless of the level of authority or factual correctness.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; A toxic leader can be both [[hypocriticism|hypocritical]] and [[hypercriticism|hypercritical]] of others, seeking the illusion of corporate and moral virtue to hide their own workplace vices. Hypocrisy involves the [[deception]] of others and is thus a form of lying.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

==Tools==
*'''[[Workload]]''': The ''[[setting up to fail]]'' procedure is in particular a well established [[workplace bullying]] tactic that a toxic leader can use against his rivals and subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton PR Dignity at Work: Eliminate Bullying and Create a Positive Working Environment (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayner C, Hoel H A Summary Review of Literature Relating to Workplace Bullying Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology Volume 7, Issue 3, pages 181–191, June 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randle J Workplace Bullying in the NHS (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Corporate control systems''': They could use the processes in place to monitor what is going on. Disciplinary systems could be abused to aid their power culture.
*'''Organizational structures''': They could abuse the hierarchies, personal relationships and the way that work flows through the business.
*'''Corporate power structures''': The toxic leader controls who, if any one makes the decisions and how widely spread power is.
*'''Symbols of personal authority ''': These may include the right to parking spaces and executive washrooms or access to supplies and uniforms. [[Narcissistic]] symbols and self-images (i.e. workplace full of self-portraits).
*'''Workplace rituals and routines''':  Management meetings, board reports, disciplinary hearing, performance assays and so on may become more habitual than necessary.

Inevitably the victim's workplace [[performance]], [[self-esteem]] and [[self-confidence]]  will decline as employee(s)' [[stress (biology)|stress]] inclines. Heavy running costs and a high [[staff turnover]]/overtime rate are often also associated with employee related results of a toxic leader.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

==Key theorists==

===Jean Lipman-Blumen===
{{Main|Jean Lipman-Blumen}}
Jean Lipman-Blumen's book, ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders : Why We Follow Destructive Bosses and Corrupt Politicians—and How We Can Survive Them'', Professor Jean Lipman-Blumen explained that there was and still is a tendency among contemporary society to seek authoritative, even dominating characteristics among our corporate and political leaders because of the public's own personal psychosocial needs and emotional weaknesses.

Dr. Lipman-Blumen noticed "toxic leadership" was not about run-of-the-mill mismanagement. Rather, it referred to leaders, who, by virtue of their "dysfunctional personal characteristics" and "destructive behaviours" "inflict reasonably serious and enduring harm" not only on their own followers and organizations, but on others outside of their immediate circle of victims and subordinates, as well. A noted [[rule of thumb]] suggests that toxic leaders leave their followers and others who come within their [[sphere of influence]] worse off than they found them either on a personal and/or corporate basis.

Dr. Lipman-Blumens' core focus was on investigating why people will continue to follow and remain loyal to toxic leaders. She also explored why followers often vigorously resist change and challenges to leaders who have clearly violated the leader/follower relationship and abused their power as leaders to the direct detriment of the people they are leading. Lipman-Blumen suggests there is something of a deeply psychological nature going on. She argues the need to feel [[safety|safe]], specialness and [[belongingness|in a social community]] all help explain this psychological phenomenon.

===Barbara Kellerman===
{{Main|Barbara Kellerman (academic)}}
In ''Bad Leadership: What It Is, How It Happens, Why It Matters'', Barbara Kellerman (2004) suggests that toxicity in leadership (or simply, "bad leadership") may be analysed into seven different types:
* '''Incompetent'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers lack the will or skill (or both) to sustain effective action. With regard to at least one important leadership challenge, they do not create positive change.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Rigid'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers are stiff and unyielding. Although they may be competent, they are unable or unwilling to adapt to new ideas, new information, or changing times.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Intemperate'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader lacks self-control and is aided and abetted by followers who are unwilling or unable to effectively intervene.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Callous'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers are uncaring or unkind. Ignored and discounted are the needs, wants, and wishes of most members of the group or organization, especially subordinates.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Corrupt'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers lie, cheat, or steal. To a degree that exceeds the norm, they put [[self-interest]] ahead of the [[public interest]].&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Insular'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers minimize or disregard the health and welfare of those outside the group or organization for which they are directly responsible.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Evil'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers commit atrocities. They use pain as an instrument of power. The harm can be physical, psychological or both.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;

===Terry Price===
In his book, ''Understanding Ethical Failures in Leaders''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/philosophy/ethics/understanding-ethical-failures-leadership?format=HB&amp;isbn=9780521837248#UI8yb54vQearAc3Q.97&lt;/ref&gt;', Professor Terry L. Price argues that the volitional account of moral failures in leaders do not provide a complete account of this phenomenon. Some have suggested that the reason leaders misbehave ethically is because they willingly go against what they know to be wrong. Professor Price however, offers an alternative analysis of leaders who excuse themselves from normally applicable moral requirements.  He argues that a cognitive account for ethical failures in leaders provides a better analysis of the issues involved in all the ethical conundrums under the rubric of "toxic leadership". Leaders can know that a certain kind of behavior is generally required by morality but still be mistaken as to whether the relevant moral requirement applies to them in a particular situation and whether others are protected by this requirement. Price demonstrates how leaders make exceptions of themselves, explains how the justificatory force of leadership gives rise to such exception-making, and develops normative protocols that leaders should adopt.

'''Uniformitarianism,''' also known as the '''Doctrine of Uniformity,'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|1866|pp=551-513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gould1965&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1965|pp=223–228}}, "''The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference'' which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is ''the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science.  Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown'' and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations."&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the invariance in the principles underpinning science, such as the constancy of [[causality]], or causation, throughout time,&lt;ref&gt;[[#gord|Gordon, 2013]]: 82; "The uniformitarian principle assumes that ''the behavior of nature is regular and indicative of an objective causal structure in which presently operative causes may be projected into the past'' to explain the historical development of the physical world and projected into the future for the purposes of prediction and control. In short, it involves the process of inferring past causes from presently observable effects under the assumption that ''the fundamental causal regularities of the world have not changed over time''."&lt;/ref&gt; but it has also been used to describe invariance of [[physical laws]] through time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A.N. 1987. Science and Earth History- The Evolution/Creation Controversy, Prometheus Books, Amherst, New York, USA. p. 194: “Under the updated statement of a useful principle of uniformitarianism it boils down essentially to ''affirmation of the validity of universal scientific laws through time and space'', coupled with a rejection of supernatural causes.” p. 62: “In cosmology, the study of the structure and evolution of the universe, ''it is assumed that the laws of physics are similar throughout the entire universe''.”&lt;/ref&gt; Though an unprovable [[postulate]] that cannot be verified using the scientific method, uniformitarianism has been a key [[first principle]] of virtually all fields of science.&lt;ref name=simpson1963&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1963|pp=24–48}}, "''Uniformity is an unprovable postulate'' justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, ''only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible'', and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geology]], uniformitarianism has included the [[gradualism|gradualistic]] concept that "the present is the key to the past" (that events occur at the same rate now as they have always done); many geologists now, however, no longer hold to a strict theory of gradualism.&lt;ref&gt;FARIA, Felipe.

The earlier conceptions{{which|date=July 2016}} likely{{original research inline|date=July 2016}} had little influence on 18th-century European geological explanations for the formation of Earth.  [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817) proposed [[Neptunism]], where [[stratum|strata]] represented deposits from shrinking seas [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] onto primordial rocks such as [[granite]]. In 1785 [[James Hutton]] proposed an opposing, self-maintaining infinite cycle based on natural history and not on the [[Bible|Biblical]] account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=57–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hutton, J. |date=1785 |url=http://www.uwmc.uwc.edu/geography/hutton/Abstract-facsimile/abstract1.htm |title=Abstract, The System of the Earth, Its Duration and Stability |quote=As ''it is not in human record, but in natural history'', that we are to look for the means of ascertaining what has already been, it is here proposed to examine the appearances of the earth, in order to be informed of operations which have been transacted in time past.

Hutton then sought evidence to support his idea that there must have been repeated cycles, each involving [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] on the [[seabed]], uplift with tilting and [[erosion]], and then moving undersea again for further layers to be deposited.

Both Playfair and Hall wrote their own books on the theory, and for decades robust debate continued between Hutton's supporters and the Neptunists. [[Georges Cuvier]]'s [[history of paleontology|paleontological work]] in the 1790s, which established the reality of [[extinction]], explained this by local catastrophes, after which other fixed species repopulated the affected areas. In Britain, geologists adapted this idea into "[[Diluvium|diluvial theory]]" which proposed repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the [[Deluge (mythology)|biblical flood]].&lt;ref&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Lyell 1840.jpg|upright|thumb|Charles Lyell at the [[British Association]] meeting in Glasgow 1840]]
From 1830 to 1833 [[Charles Lyell]]'s multi-volume ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' was published. The work's subtitle was "An attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface by reference to causes now in operation". He drew his explanations from field studies conducted directly before he went to work on the founding geology text,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Leonard G. "Charles Lyell" ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography''. Ed. Charles Coulston Gillispie. Vol. VIII. Pennsylvania, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and developed Hutton's idea that the earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. The terms ''uniformitarianism'' for this idea, and ''[[catastrophism]]'' for the opposing viewpoint, were coined by [[William Whewell]] in a review of Lyell's book. ''Principles of Geology'' was the  most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century.

====Systems of inorganic earth history====

Geoscientists support diverse systems of Earth history, the nature of which rest on a certain mixture of views about process, control, rate, and state which are preferred. Because geologists and geomorphologists tend to adopt opposite views over process, rate and state in the inorganic world, there are eight different systems of beliefs in the development of the terrestrial sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggett|first= Richard|year=1990|title =Catastophism: Systems of Earth History|publisher=Edward Arnold|location= London| page=34|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All geoscientists stand by the principle of uniformity of law. Most, but not all, are directed by the principle of simplicity. All make definite assertions about the quality of rate and state in the inorganic realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggett|first= Richard|year=1990|title =Catastophism: Systems of Earth History|publisher=Edward Arnold|location= London| page=33|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lyell's uniformitarianism====
According to [[Reijer Hooykaas]] (1963), Lyell's uniformitarianism is a family of four related propositions, not a single idea:&lt;ref&gt;Reijer Hooykaas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TgYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 ''Natural Law and Divine Miracle: The Principle of Uniformity in Geology, Biology, and Theology''], Leiden: [[EJ Brill]], 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uniformity of law – the laws of nature are constant across time and space.
* Uniformity of methodology – the appropriate hypotheses for explaining the geological past are those with analogy today.
* Uniformity of kind – past and present causes are all of the same kind, have the same energy, and produce the same effects.
* Uniformity of degree – geological circumstances have remained the same over time.

None of these connotations requires another, and they are not all equally inferred by uniformitarians.&lt;ref&gt;David Cahan, 2003, ''From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences'', p 95 {{ISBN|978-0-226-08928-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] explained Lyell's propositions in ''[[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]'' (1987), stating that Lyell conflated two different types of propositions: a pair of '''''methodological assumptions''''' with a pair of '''''substantive hypotheses'''''. The four together make up Lyell's uniformitarianism.&lt;ref name=Gould118&gt;{{cite book

=====Methodological assumptions=====
The two methodological assumptions below are accepted to be true by the majority of scientists and geologists. Gould claims that these philosophical propositions must be assumed before you can proceed as a scientist doing science.  "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes.  It works the other way around." You first assume these propositions and "then you go to the outcrop."&lt;ref name=Gould120&gt;{{cite book

:* '''Uniformity of law across time and space''':  Natural laws are constant across space and time.&lt;ref name=gould1987 /&gt;
::The axiom of uniformity of law &lt;ref name="gould1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gould1987&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=119}}, "''Making inferences about the past is wrapped up in the difference between studying the observable and the unobservable.'' In the observable, erroneous beliefs can be proven wrong and be inductively corrected by other observations. This is Popper's principle of [[falsifiability]]. However, ''past processes are not observable by their very nature.'' Therefore, '''the invariance of nature's laws must be assumed to come to conclusions about the past.''"&lt;/ref&gt; is necessary in order for scientists to extrapolate (by inductive inference) into the unobservable past.&lt;ref name=gould1965 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gould1987 /&gt;  The constancy of natural laws must be assumed in the study of the past; else we cannot meaningfully study it.&lt;ref name=gould1965 /&gt;&lt;ref name=simpson1963 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gould1987 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hutton|1795|p=297}}, "If the stone, for example, which fell today, were to rise again tomorrow, there would be an end of natural philosophy [i.e., science], ''our principles would fail, and we would no longer investigate the rules of nature from our observations''."&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''Uniformity of process across time and space''':  Natural processes are constant across time and space.

::Though similar to uniformity of law, this second ''a priori'' assumption, shared by the vast majority of scientists, deals with geological causes, not physico-chemical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1984|p=11}},  "As such, it is another ''a priori'' methodological assumption shared by most scientists and not a statement about the empirical world."&lt;/ref&gt;  The past is to be explained by processes acting currently in time and space rather than inventing extra esoteric or unknown processes ''without good reason'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=120}},"We should try to explain the past by causes now in operation without inventing extra, fancy, or unknown causes, however plausible in logic, if available processes suffice."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooykaas|1963|p=38}}, ="Strict uniformitarianism may often be a guarantee against pseudo-scientific phantasies and loose conjectures, but it makes one easily forget that the principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a methodological principle, preceding the observation of facts . . . It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for there is only one way in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different."&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known  as parsimony or [[Occam's razor]].

=====Substantive hypotheses=====
The substantive hypotheses were controversial and, in some cases, accepted by few.&lt;ref name=Gould118 /&gt;  These hypotheses are judged true or false on empirical grounds through scientific observation and repeated experimental data. This is in contrast with the previous two philosophical assumptions&lt;ref name="Gould120" /&gt; that come before one can do science and so cannot be tested or falsified by science.

:* '''Uniformity of rate across time and space''':  Change is typically slow, steady, and gradual.&lt;ref name="Gould120" /&gt;

::Uniformity of rate (or [[gradualism]]) is what most people (including geologists) think of when they hear the word "uniformitarianism," confusing this hypothesis with the entire definition.  As late as 1990, Lemon, in his textbook of stratigraphy, affirmed that "The uniformitarian view of earth history held that all geologic processes proceed continuously and at a very slow pace."&lt;ref&gt;Lemon, R. R. 1990. ''Principles of stratigraphy''. Columbus, Ohio: Merrill Publishing Company. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

::Gould explained Hutton's view of uniformity of rate; mountain ranges or grand canyons are built by accumulation of nearly insensible changes added up through vast time.  Some major events such as floods, earthquakes, and eruptions, do occur.  But these catastrophes are strictly local.  They neither occurred in the past, nor shall happen in the future, at any greater frequency or extent than they display at present. In particular, the whole earth is never convulsed at once.&lt;ref name=Gould120s&gt;{{cite book

::The uniformity of state hypothesis implies that throughout the history of our earth there is no progress in any inexorable direction. The planet has almost always looked and behaved as it does now.  Change is continuous, but leads nowhere. The earth is in balance: a dynamic [[steady state]].&lt;ref name=Gould123 /&gt;

===20th century===
[[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s first scientific paper, ''Is uniformitarianism necessary?'' (1965), reduced these four assumptions to two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gould | first1 = S. J. | date = 1965 | title = Is uniformitarianism necessary? | url = http://www.ajsonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/263/3/223 | journal = American Journal of Science | volume = 263 | pages = 223–228 | doi=10.2475/ajs.263.3.223| bibcode = 1965AmJS..263..223G }}&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed the first principle, which asserted spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws, as no longer an issue of debate. He rejected the third (uniformity of rate) as an unjustified limitation on scientific inquiry, as it constrains past geologic rates and conditions to those of the present. So, Lyellian uniformitarianism was unnecessary.

Uniformitarianism was proposed in contrast to [[catastrophism]], which states that the distant past "consisted of epochs of paroxysmal and catastrophic action interposed between periods of comparative tranquility"&lt;ref&gt;William J. Whewell, ''Principles of Geology'', Charles Leyell, vol. II, London, 1832: Quart. Rev., v. 47, p. 103-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most geologists took this interpretation to mean that catastrophic events are not important in geologic time; one example of this is the debate of the formation of the [[Channeled Scablands]] due to the catastrophic [[Missoula floods|Missoula]] glacial outburst floods. An important result of this debate and others was the re-clarification that, while the same principles operate in geologic time, catastrophic events that are infrequent on human time-scales can have important consequences in geologic history.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, E. A., et al., 1986, Cataclysms on the Columbia, Timber Press, Portland, OR. {{ISBN|978-0-88192-067-3}}

* "Bretz knew that the very idea of catastrophic flooding would threaten and anger ''the geological community''.  And here's why: among geologists in the 1920s, catastrophic explanations for geological events (other than volcanos or earthquakes) were considered wrong minded to the point of heresy."  p. 42.
* "Consider, then, what Bretz was up against.  The very word 'Catastrophism' was heinous in the ears of geologists. ... It was a step backwards, a betrayal of ''all that geological science had fought to gain''.  It was heresy of the worst order."  p. 44
* "It was inevitable that sooner or later ''the geological community would rise up'' and attempt to defeat Bretz's 'outrageous hypothesis.'" p 49
* "Nearly 50 years had passed since Bretz first proposed the idea of catastorphic flooding, and now in 1971 ''his arguments had become a standard of geological thinking''." p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;
Derek Ager has noted that "geologists do not deny uniformitarianism in its true sense, that is to say, of interpreting the past by means of the processes that are seen going on at the present day, so long as we remember that the periodic catastrophe is one of those processes.  Those periodic catastrophes make more showing in the stratigraphical record than we have hitherto assumed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Even [[Charles Lyell]] thought that ordinary geological processes would cause [[Niagara Falls]] to move upstream to [[Lake Erie]] within 10,000 years, leading to catastrophic flooding of a large part of North America.

Modern geologists do not apply uniformitarianism in the same way as Lyell.  They question if rates of processes were uniform through time and only those values measured during the history of geology are to be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"By force of popularity, uniformity of rate has persisted to our present day.  For more than a century, Lyell's rhetoric conflating axiom with hypotheses has descended in unmodified form.  Many geologists have been stifled by the belief that proper methodology includes an a priori commitment to gradual change, and by a preference for explaining large-scale phenomena as the concatenation of innumerable tiny changes."&lt;ref name=Gould174&gt;{{cite book

The current consensus is that [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] is a slow, gradual process punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia Sixth Edition, ''[http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html uniformitarianism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624122338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |date=2006-06-24 }}'' © 2007 Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice it is reduced from Lyell's conflation, or blending, to simply the two philosophical assumptions.  This is also known as the principle of geological actualism, which states that all past geological action was like all present geological action. The principle of [[actualism]] is the cornerstone of [[paleoecology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The '''Waste Minimisation Act''' is an Act of Parliament passed in [[New Zealand]] in 2008.

It was a Private Members Bill introduced by [[Mike Ward (New Zealand politician)|Mike Ward]]. The major provisions of the Act are: a levy on landfill waste, promoting [[product stewardship]] schemes, some mandatory waste reporting, clarifying the role of territorial authorities with respect to waste minimisation, and sets up a Waste Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/waste-minimisation.html|title=The Waste Minimisation Act 2008|date=2009-03-22|publisher=Ministry for the Environment|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act has a provision where the Minister for the Environment can assign the status of [[priority product]], which are those that can cause a high degree of environmental harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2008/0089/latest/DLM1154572.html#DLM1154572|title=Waste Minimisation Act 2008 - Declaration of priority products|date=25 September 2008|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women as theological figures''' have played a significant role in the development of various [[religions]] and religious [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. The study of '''[[women and religion]]''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. It is worth noting from  a gender scientific approach, women occupy the second room in all of the following religions in the examples below. 

George H. Gallup Jr. wrote in an analysis for the Gallup Organization in 2002 that, a mountain of evidence shows that women have more religiosity than men. Gallup goes on to say that women hold on to their faith more heartily, work harder for the church, and in general practice with more consistency than men.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Roy Britt, ''Women More Religious Than Men, http://www.livescience.com/7689-women-religious-men.html, February 28, 2009'' October 27, 2014 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bahá'í Faith ==
{{details|Bahá'í Faith and gender equality#Historical women figures in Bahá'í history}}

In Bahá'i writings, the [[Holy Spirit]] is often described as the "[[Maid of Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="Abdo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdo_female_holy-spirit |title=Female Representations of the Holy Spirit in Bahá'í and Christian writings and their implications for gender roles |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three women figure prominently in the history of the Bahá'í Faith: [[Táhirih]], a disciple of the [[Báb]]; [[Ásíyih Khánum]], the wife of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]; and [[Bahíyyih Khánum]] the daughter of Bahá'u'lláh.
