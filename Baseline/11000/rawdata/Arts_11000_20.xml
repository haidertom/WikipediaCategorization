'''Amate''' ({{lang-es|amate}} {{IPA-es|aˈmate|}} from {{lang-nah|āmatl}} {{IPA-nah|ˈaːmat͡ɬ|}}) is a type of bark [[paper]] that has been manufactured in [[Mexico]] since the [[Mesoamerican chronology|precontact times]]. It was used primarily to [[Maya codices|create codices]].

Amate paper was extensively produced and used for both communication, records, and ritual during the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]]; however, after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]], its production was mostly banned and replaced by European paper. Amate paper production never completely died, nor did the rituals associated with it. It remained strongest in the rugged, remote mountainous areas of northern [[Puebla]] and northern [[Veracruz]] states. Spiritual leaders in the small village of [[San Pablito, Puebla]] were described as producing paper with "magical" properties. Foreign academics began studying this ritual use of amate in the mid-20th century, and the [[Otomi people]] of the area began producing the paper commercially. Otomi craftspeople began selling it in cities such as [[Mexico City]], where the paper was revived by [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] painters in [[Guerrero]] to create "new" indigenous craft, which was then promoted by the Mexican government.

Through this and other innovations, amate paper is one of the most widely available [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexican indigenous handicrafts]], sold both nationally and abroad. Nahua paintings of the paper, which is also called "amate," receive the most attention, but Otomi paper makers have also received attention not only for the paper itself but for crafts made with it such as elaborate [[Papercutting|cut-outs]].

==History==
Amate [[paper]] has a long history. This history is not only because the raw materials for its manufacture have persisted but also that the manufacture, distribution and uses have adapted to the needs and restrictions of various epochs. This history can be roughly divided into three periods: the pre-Hispanic period, the Spanish colonial period to the 20th century, and from the latter 20th century to the present, marked by the paper's use as a commodity.&lt;ref name="lopez808"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 8, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Hispanic period===

The development of paper in [[Mesoamerica]] parallels that of China and Egypt, which used rice and [[papyrus]] respectively.&lt;ref name="curativo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Papel amate, arte curativo |author= Lizeth Gómez De Anda  |url= http://www.razon.com.mx/spip.php?article29277 |newspaper= La Razón |location=Mexico City |date=September 30, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Amate paper, curative art }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known exactly where or when [[papermaking]] began in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="lopez0207"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 2-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicontepec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=661 |title=El Papel Amate Entre los Nahuas de Chicontepec |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Amate paper among the Nahuas of Chicontepec |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309150849/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=661 |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known amate paper dates back to 75 CE. It was discovered at the site of [[Huitzilapa]], Jalisco. Huitzilapa is a [[shaft tomb culture]] site located northwest of [[Tequila Volcano]] near the town of [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco|Magdalena]]. The crumpled piece of paper was found in the southern chamber of the site's shaft tomb, possibly associated with a male scribe. Rather than being produced from ''[[Trema micrantha]]'', from which modern amate is made, the amate found at Huitzilapa is made from ''[[Ficus tecolutensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Benz et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Iconography (in stone) dating from the period contains depictions of items thought to be paper. For example, Monument 52 from the [[Olmec]] site of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] illustrates an individual adorned with ear pennants of folded paper.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller and Taube (1993, p. 131)&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known surviving book made from amate paper may be the [[Grolier Codex]], which [[Michael D. Coe]] and other researchers have asserted is authentic and dated to the 12th-13th century CE.&lt;ref name="newitz ars technica"&gt;Annalee Newitz (12 September 2016). "[https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/confirmed-mysterious-ancient-maya-book-grolier-codex-is-genuine/ Confirmed: Mysterious ancient Maya book, Grolier Codex, is genuine: 900 year-old astronomy guide is oldest known book written in the Americas]." ''[http://arstechnica.co.uk/ Ars Technica]''. Accessed 12 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments from the 1940s to the 1970s have centered on a time of 300 CE of the use of bark clothing by the Maya people. Ethnolinguistic studies lead to the names of two villages in Maya territory that relate the use of bark paper, Excachaché ("place where white bark trusses are smoothed") and Yokzachuún ("over the white paper"). Anthropologist Marion mentions that in [[Lacandones Region|Lacandones]], in [[Chiapas]], the Maya were still manufacturing and using bark clothing in the 1980s. For these reason, it was probably the Maya who first propagated knowledge about bark-paper-making and spread it throughout southern Mexico, [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[Honduras]], and [[El Salvador]], when it was at its height in the pre-classic period.&lt;ref name="lopez81"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="papiro"&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2008 |title= Amate y Papiro… un diálogo histórico |trans-title=Amate and Papyrus… a historic dialogue |journal= National Geographic en español |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |url= http://ngenespanol.com/2008/05/amate-y-papiro%E2%80%A6-un-dialogo-historico-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according researcher [[Hans Lenz]], this Maya paper was likely not the amate paper known in later Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; The [[Mayan language]] word for book is ''hun'' {{IPA-myn|hun|}}.&lt;ref name="boot" &gt;Boot, E. (2002). ''[http://www.mesoweb.com/resources/vocabulary/vocabulary.pdf A Preliminary Classic Maya-English / English-Classic Maya Vocabulary of Hieroglyphic Readings]''. Leiden University, the Netherlands. Retrieved September 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amate paper was used most extensively during the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] Empire.&lt;ref name="lopez80"&gt;López Binnqüist, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was manufactured in over 40 villages in territory controlled by the [[Aztecs]] and then handed over as tribute by the conquered peoples. This amounted to about 480,000 sheets annually. Most of the production was concentrated in the modern state of [[Morelos]], where [[Ficus]] trees are abundant because of the climate.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez90"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was assigned to the royal sector, to be used as gifts on special occasions or as rewards for warriors. It was also sent to the religious elites for ritual purposes. The last share was allotted to royal scribes for the writing of codices and other records.&lt;ref name="lopez89"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the paper's manufacture in the pre-Hispanic period. Stone beaters dating from the 6th century CE have been found, and these tools are most often found where amate trees grow. Most are made of volcanic stone with some made of marble and granite. They are usually rectangular or circular with grooves on one or both sides to macerate the fibers. These beaters are still used by [[Otomi people|Otomi]] artisans, and almost all are volcanic, with an additional groove added on the side to help hold the stone. According to some early Spanish accounts, the bark was left overnight in water to soak, after which the finer inner fibers were separated from coarser outer fibers and pounded into flat sheets. But it is not known who did the work, or how the labor was divided.&lt;ref name="lopez121122"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tribute item, amate was assigned to the royal sector because it was not considered to be a commodity. This paper was related to power and religion, the way through which the [[Aztec]]s imposed and justified their dominance in Mesoamerica. As tribute, it represented a transaction between the dominant groups and the dominated villages. In the second phase, the paper used by the royal authorities and priests for sacred and political purposes was a way to empower and frequently register all the other sumptuary exclusive things.&lt;ref name="lopez115"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Amate paper was created as part of a line of technologies to satisfy the human need to express and communicate. It was preceded by stone, clay and leather to transmit knowledge first in the form of pictures, and later with the [[Olmec]]s and Maya through a form of [[Maya script|hieroglyphic writing]].&lt;ref name="lopez81"/&gt; Bark paper had important advantages as it is easier to obtain than animal skins and was easier to work than other fibers. It could be bent, shirred, glued and melded for specific finishing touches and for decoration. Two more advantages stimulated the extensive use of bark paper: its light weight and its ease of transport, which translated into great savings in time, space and labor when compared with other raw materials.&lt;ref name="lopez83"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aztec era, paper retained its importance as a writing surface, especially in the production of chronicles and the keeping of records such as inventories and accounting. Codices were converted into "books" by folding into an accordion pattern. Of the approximately 500 surviving codices, about 16 date to before the conquest and are made of bark paper. These include the [[Dresden Codex]] from the Yucatán, the [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer Codex]] from the [[Mixteca]] region and the [[Borgia Codex]] from [[Oaxaca]].&lt;ref name="lopez84"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

However, paper also had a sacred aspect and was used in rituals along with other items such as incense, [[copal]], [[Agave americana|maguey]] thorns and rubber.&lt;ref name="lopez84"/&gt; For ceremonial and religious events, bark paper was used in various ways: as decorations used in fertility rituals, yiataztli, a kind of bag, and as an amatetéuitl, a badge used to symbolize a prisoner's soul after sacrifice. It was also used to dress idols, priests and sacrifice victims in forms of crowns, stoles, plumes, wigs, trusses and bracelets. Paper items such as flags, skeletons and very long papers, up to the length of a man, were used as offerings, often by burning them.&lt;ref name="lopez86"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; Another important paper item for rituals was paper cut in the form of long flags or trapezoids and painted with black rubber spots to depict the characteristic of the god being honored. At a certain time of year, these were also used to ask for rain. At this time, the papers were colored blue with plumage at the spearhead.&lt;ref name="lopez87"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period to 20th century===
When the Spanish arrived, they noted the production of codices and paper, which was also made from maguey and palm fibers as well as bark. It was specifically noted by Pedro Mártir de Anglería.&lt;ref name="lopez82"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], indigenous paper, especially bark paper lost its value as a tribute item not only because the Spanish preferred European paper but also because bark paper's connection to indigenous religion caused it to be banned.&lt;ref name="lopez90"/&gt; The justification for the banning of amate was that it was used for magic and witchcraft.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; This was part of the Spaniard's efforts to mass convert the indigenous to Catholicism, which included the mass burning of codices, which contained most of the native history as well as cultural and natural knowledge.&lt;ref name=lopez80/&gt;

Only 16 of 500 surviving codices were written before the Conquest. The other, post-conquest books were written on bark paper although a few were written on European paper, cotton, or animal hides. They were largely the work of missionaries, such as [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], who were interested in recording the history and knowledge of the indigenous people. Some of the important codices of this type include [[Codex Sierra]], [[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis|Codex La Cruz Badiano]] and [[Codex Florentino]]. The [[Codex Mendoza|Codex Mendocino]] was commissioned by viceroy [[Antonio de Mendoza]] in 1525 to learn about the tribute system and other indigenous practices to be adapted to Spanish rule. However, it is on European paper.&lt;ref name="lopez9192"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bark paper was banned, it did not completely disappear. In the early colonial period, there was a shortage of European paper, which made it necessary to use the indigenous version on occasion.&lt;ref name="lopez9192"/&gt; During the evangelization process, amate, along with a paste made from corn canes was appropriated by missionaries to create Christian images, mostly in the 16th and 17th century.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tierra"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-papel-de-la-tierra-en-el-tiempo.html |author=Beatriz M. Oliver Vega |title= El papel de la tierra en el tiempo |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title="Earth" paper over time |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, among the indigenous, paper continued to be made clandestinely for ritual purposes. In 1569, friar Diego de Mendoza observed several indigenous carrying offerings of paper, copal and woven mats to the lakes inside the [[Nevado de Toluca]] volcano as offerings.&lt;ref name="tierra"/&gt; The most successful at keeping paper making traditions alive were certain indigenous groups living in the [[La Huasteca]], [[Ixhuatlán del Café, Veracruz|Ixhuatlán]] and [[Chicontepec de Tejada|Chicontepec]] in the north of Veracruz and some villages in Hidalgo. The only records of bark paper making after the early 1800s refer to these areas.&lt;ref name="lopez80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez9394"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these areas are dominated by the Otomi and the area's ruggedness and isolation from central Spanish authority allowed small villages to keep small quantities of paper in production. In fact, this clandestine nature helped it to survive as a way to defy Spanish culture and reaffirm identity.&lt;ref name="lopez115"/&gt;

===Latter 20th century to the present===
[[File:Aztec calendar on Amate.jpg|thumb|The [[Aztec calendar stone]] painted on amate]]
[[File:CitlalliArreguinGarros02.jpg|thumb|Painting on amate by Citlalli Arreguín in an exhibit at [[Garros Galería]], Mexico City]]
By the mid-20th century, the knowledge of making amate paper was kept alive only in a few small towns in the rugged mountains of Puebla and Veracruz states, such as San Pablito, an Otomi village and Chicontepec, a Nahua village.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez94"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly strong in San Pablito in Puebla as many of the villages around it believed this paper has special power when used in rituals.&lt;ref name="lopez9497"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 94-97&lt;/ref&gt; The making of paper here until the 1960s was strictly the purview of the [[shaman]]s, who kept the process secret, making paper primarily to be used for cutting gods and other figures for ritual. However, these shamans came into contact with anthropologists, learning of the interest that people on the outside had for their paper and their culture.&lt;ref name="lopez104"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 104&lt;/ref&gt; But although the ritual cutting of paper remained important for the Otomi people of northern Puebla, the use of amate paper was declining, with industrial paper or tissue paper replacing amate paper in rituals.&lt;ref name="lopez103115105"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 103, 115, 105&lt;/ref&gt; One stimulus for amate's commercialization was the shamans' growing realization of the commercial value of the paper; they began to sell cutouts of bark paper figures on a small scale in Mexico City along with other Otomi handcrafts.&lt;ref name="lopez104"/&gt;

What the sale of these figures did was to make the bark paper a commodity. The paper was not sacred until and unless a shaman cut it as part of a ritual. The making of the paper and non ritualistic cutting did not interfere with the ritual aspects of paper in general. This allowed a product formerly reserved only for ritual to become something with market value as well. It also allowed the making of paper to become open to the population of San Pablito and not only to shamans.&lt;ref name="lopez10311580"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 103, 115, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most amate paper is sold as the backing for paintings made by [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] artists from [[Guerrero]] state. There are various stories as to how painting on bark paper came about but they are divided between whether it was a Nahua or an Otomi idea. However, it is known that both Nahua and Otomi sold crafts at the Bazar del Sábado in [[San Ángel]] in [[Mexico City]] in the 1960s. The Otomi were selling paper and other crafts and the Nahua were selling their traditionally painted pottery.&lt;ref name="lopez106"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="extinguirse"&gt;{{cite news |title= A punto de extinguirse, el árbol del amate en San Pablito Pahuatlán: Libertad Mora |author= Tania Damián Jiménez |url= http://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/2010/10/13/puebla/eco304.ph|newspaper= La Jornada del Orienta |location=Puebla |date=October 13, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=A the point of extinction:the amate árbol in San Pablio Pahuatlán:Libertad Mora }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nahua transferred many of their pottery painting designs onto amate paper, which is easier to transport and sell.&lt;ref name="lopez105"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 105&lt;/ref&gt; The Nahua called the paintings by their word for bark paper, which is "amatl." Today, the word is applied to all crafts which use the paper. The new painting form found great demand from the start, and at first, the Nahua would buy almost all of the Otomi's paper production. Painting on bark paper quickly spread to various villages in Guerrero and by the end of the 1960s, became the most important economic activity in eight Nahua villages [[Ameyaltepec]], [[Oapan]], [[Ahuahuapan]], [[Ahuelican]], [[Analco]], [[San Juan Tetelcingo]], [[Xalitla]] and [[Maxela]]. (page 106)  Each Nahua village has its own painting styles developed from the tradition of painting ceramics, and this allowed works to be classified.&lt;ref name="lopez105" /&gt;

The rise of amate paper occurred during a time when government policies towards rural indigenous people and their crafts were changing, with the latter being encourage especially to help develop the tourism industry.&lt;ref name="lopez106"/&gt; [[FONART]] became part of the consolidation of distribution efforts for amate paper.  Much of this involved buying all of the Otomi production of bark paper to ensure that the Nahua would have sufficient supplies. Although this intervention lasted for only about two years, it was crucial for developing sales of amate crafts in national and international markets.&lt;ref name="lopez107"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, while the Nahua are still the principle buyers of Otomi amate paper, the Otomi have since branched out into different types of paper and have developed some of their own products to sell. Today, amate paper is one of the most widely distributed Mexican handcrafts nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name="lopez105"/&gt; It has received artistic and academic attention at both levels as well. In 2006, an annual event called the Encuentro de Arte in Papel Amate was begun in the village, which includes events such as processions, [[Danza de los Voladores de Papantla|Dance of the Voladors]], [[Huapango]] music and more. The main event is the exhibition of works by various artists such as [[Francisco Toledo]], Sergio Hernández, Gabriel Macotela, Gustavo MOnrroy, Cecilio Sánchez, Nicolás de Jesús, David Correa, Héctor Montiel, José Montiel, Laura Montiel, Santiago Regalado Juan Manuel de la Rosa, Ester González, Alejandra Palma Padilla, Nicéforo Hurbieta Moreles, Jorge Lozano and Alfonso García Tellez.&lt;ref name="pahuatlan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Pahuatlán: Una historia en papel amate  |author= Ernesto Romero   |url=http://www.periodicodigital.com.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14283&amp;Itemid=67  |newspaper= Periodico Digital |location=Puebla |date=April 13, 2007 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pahuatlán:history in amate paper }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular]] and the Egyptian embassy in Mexico held an exhibition in 2008 on amate and [[papyrus]] with over sixty objects on display comparing the two ancient traditions.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt; One of the most noted artists in the medium is shaman Alfonso Margarito García Téllez, who has exhibited his work in museums such as the [[San Pedro Museo de Arte]] in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].&lt;ref name="exhiben"&gt;{{cite news |title= Exhiben el uso curativo del papel amate en el pueblo de San Pablito Pahuatlán |author= Paula Carrizosa |url= http://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/2010/12/06/puebla/cul212.php |newspaper= El Sur de Acapulco |location=Acapulco |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Pablito==
While amate is made in a few small villages in northern Puebla, northern Veracruz and southern [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo state]], only [[San Pablito, Puebla|San Pablito in Puebla]] manufactures the paper commercially.&lt;ref name="lopez0207"/&gt; San Pablito is a village in the municipality of [[Pahuatlán]] located in the [[Sierra Norte de Puebla]]. [[Tulancingo]], Hidalgo is the closest urban center. The area is very mountainous and the village itself is on the side of a mountain called the Cerro del Brujo.&lt;ref name="tierra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt; The making of the paper is the primary economic activity of the community and has alleviated poverty in the village. Before the villagers only had very small houses made of wood, but now they have much larger houses made of block.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt; The paper makers here guard the process greatly and will sever contact with anyone seeking to replicate their work.&lt;ref name="lopez148"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing income to the paper makers themselves the craft has been employing an increasing number of people to harvest bark, over an area which now extends over 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt; The village manufactures large quantities of paper, still using mostly pre-Hispanic technology and various tree species for raw material. About half of this paper production is still sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez10"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper making has not only brought money into the Otomi population of the community but political clout as well. It is now the most important community economically in the municipality of Pahuatlán, and the last three municipal governments have been headed by an Otomi, which had not happened before.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez9"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the paper making is done by women. One reason for this is that many men still migrate out of the community to work, mostly to the United States. These two sources of income are combined in many households in San Pablito.&lt;ref name="lopez105" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez146"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 146&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic problems of the late 2000s cut sales by about half forcing more to migrate out for work. Before the crisis, the inhabitants of the village were making two thousand sheets per day.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;

==Ritual use==
While the paper has been commercialized in San Pablito, it has not lost its ritual character here or in other areas such as [[Texcatepec]] and [[Chicontepec de Tejada|Chicontepec]], where it is still made for ritual purposes.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; In these communities, the making and ritual use of paper is similar. Figures are cut from light or dark paper, which each figure and each color having significance. There are two types of paper. Light or white paper is used for images of gods or humans. Dark paper is connected with evil characters or sorcery.&lt;ref name="lopez99101"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 99–101&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicontepec, the light paper is made from [[mulberry]] trees, and the dark paper is made from classic amate or fig trees. The older the tree the darker the paper.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;

Ritual paper acquires a sacred value only when [[shaman]]s cut it ritually.&lt;ref name="lopez116"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 116&lt;/ref&gt; The cutting technique is most important, not necessarily artistic although many have aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; In San Pablito, the cut outs are of gods or supernatural beings related to the indigenous worldview, but never of Catholic figures. Most of the time, the cut out ceremonies relate to petitions such as good crops and health, although as agriculture declines in importance economically, petitions for health and protection have become more important. One particularly popular ceremony is related to young men who have returned from working abroad.&lt;ref name="lopez99101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez116"/&gt; In Chicontepec, there are cut outs related to gods or spirits linked to natural phenomena such as lightning, rain, mountains, mangos seeds and more, with those cut from dark paper called "devils" or represent evil spirits. However, figures can also represent people living or dead.  Those made of light paper represent good spirits and people who make promises. Female figures are distinguished by locks of hair. Some figures have four arms and two heads in profile, and other have the head and tail of an animal. Those with shoes represent mestizos or bad people who have died in fights, accidents or by drowning, also women who have died in childbirth or children who disrespect their parents. Those without shoes represent indigenous people or good people who have died in sickness or old age. Bad spirits represented in dark paper are burned ceremoniously in order to end their bad influence. Those in light paper are kept as [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;

The origin of the use of these cut outs is not known. It may extend back to the pre Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]] invention, after the Spanish destroyed all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the cut outs do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of cut outs.&lt;ref name="lopez101102"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some cut out figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. Cut outs made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual. These cut outs are also not exactly the same as those made for ritual, with changes made in order to keep the ritual aspect separate.&lt;ref name="lopez116"/&gt;

In San Pablito, the making and cutting of paper is not restricted to shamans, as the rest of the villagers may engage in this. However, only shamans may do paper cutting rituals and the exact techniques of paper making is guarded by the residents of the village from outsiders.&lt;ref name="lopez105"/&gt; The best known shaman related to cut out ritual is Alfonso García Téllez of San Pablito.&lt;ref name="curativo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tributo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=166 |title= Tributo a las deidades |first= Luis Alberto |last= Martínez Álvarez |date=April 24, 2009 |publisher=State of Puebla |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Tribute to the gods |accessdate=April 15, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110521160510/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=166| archivedate= 21 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly states that the cutting rituals are not witchcraft, but rather a way to honor the spirits of the natural world and a way to help those who have died, along with their families.&lt;ref name="exhiben"/&gt;  García Téllez also creates cut out books about the various Otomi deities, which he has not only sold but also exhibited at museums such as the [[San Pedro Museo de Arte]] in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].&lt;ref name="exhiben"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tributo"/&gt;

==Amate products==
[[File:AmatePaperCutOutMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Otomi amate paper cut out on display at the Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City]]
While amate paper is one of a number of paper crafts of Mexico, along with [[papel picado]], [[papier-mâché]]  (such as Judas figures, [[alebrije]]s or decorative items such as strands of [[chili pepper]]s called [[ristra]]s). However, amate paper has been made as a commodity only since the 1960s. Prior to that time, it was made for mostly ritual purposes.&lt;ref name="lopez808"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bercovitch"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2621-the-mexican-art-forms-of-ristras-papel-amate-and-papel-picado |title= The Mexican art forms of ristras, papel amate and papel picado |author=Helen Bercovitch |date=June 2001 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of amate paper has been as the base for the creation of other products based both in traditional [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexican handcraft]] designs and more modern uses. Because of the product's versatility, both [[Otomi people|Otomi]] artisans and others have developed a number of variations to satisfy the tastes a various handcraft consumers.&lt;ref name="lopez827111"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 80, 2-7, 111&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper is sold plain, dyed in a variety of colors and decorated with items such as dried leaves and flowers.  Although the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] people of [[Guerrero]] remain the principal buyers of Otomi paper,&lt;ref name="lopez135"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; other wholesale buyers  have used it to create products such as lampshades, notebooks,  furniture covers, wallpaper, fancy stationery and  more.&lt;ref name="lopez1710111114"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 2-7,10,111, 114&lt;/ref&gt;  The Otomi themselves have innovated by creating paper products such as envelopes, book separators, invitation cards as well as cut out figures mostly based on traditional ritual designs. The Otomi have also established two categories of paper, standard quality and that produced for the high-end market, geared to well known Nahua artists and other artists that prize the paper's qualities. This is leading to a number of paper makers to be individually recognized like master craftsmen in other fields.&lt;ref name="lopez111142"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 111, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The Otomi paper makers generally sell their production to a limited number of wholesalers, because of limited Spanish skills and contact with the outside. This means about ten wholesalers controlling the distribution of about half of all Otomi production.&lt;ref name="lopez135"/&gt; These wholesalers, as well as artisans such as the Nahua who use the paper as the basis of their own work, have many more contacts and as a result, retail sales of the product are wide-ranging and varied both within Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name="lopez10"/&gt; Amate paper products are still sold on the streets and markets in Mexico, much as commercialization of the produce began in the 20th century, often in venues that cater to tourists.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt; However, through wholesalers, the paper also ends up in handicraft stores, open bazaars, specialty shops and the Internet. Much of it is used to create paintings, and the finest of these have been exhibited in both national and international museums and galleries.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez10"/&gt; The paper is sold retail in the town to tourists as well as in shops in cities such as [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]], [[Tijuana]], Mexico City, [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]], [[Monterrey]] and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]. It is also exported to the United States, especially to [[Miami]].&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;

However, about fifty percent of all Otomi paper production is still done in standard 40&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm size and sold to Nahua painters from Guerrero, the market segment which made the mass commercialization of the product possible.&lt;ref name="lopez111135142"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 111, 135, 142 105&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy percent of all the craft production of these Otomi and Nahuas is sold on the national market with about thirty percent reaching the international market.&lt;ref name="lopez142"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 142&lt;/ref&gt; As most amate paper is sold as the backing for these paintings, so many consumers assume the Nahua produce the paper as well.&lt;ref name="lopez112"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The amate paper paintings are a combination of Nahua and Otomi traditions. The Otomi produce the paper, and the Nahua have transferred and adapted painting traditions associated with ceramics  to the paper. The [[Nahuatl]] word "amate" is applied to both the paper and the paintings done on the paper. Each Nahua village has its own painting style  which was developed for ceramics, originally commercialized in [[Acapulco]] and other tourist areas as early as the 1940s. The adaption of this painting to amate paper came in the 1960s and quickly spread to various villages until it became the primary economic activity in eight Nahua villages in Guerrero, Ameyaltepec, Oapan, Ahuahuapan, Ahuelican, Analco, San Juan Tetelcingo, Xalitla and Maxela.&lt;ref name="lopez105106"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is that it evokes Mexico's pre-Columbian past in addition to the customary designs painted on it.&lt;ref name="lopez109"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of these paintings led to the Nahuas buying just about all of the Otomis' paper production in that decade. It also attracted the attention of the government, which was taking an interest in indigenous crafts and promoting them to tourists. The FONART agency became involved for two years, buying Otomi paper to make sure that the Nahua had sufficient supplies for painting. This was crucial for the development of national and international markets for the paintings and the paper.&lt;ref name="lopez105106"/&gt; It also worked to validate the "new" craft as legitimate, using symbols of past and present minority peoples as part of Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="lopez109"/&gt;

The paintings started with and still mostly based on traditional designs from pottery although there has been innovation since then. Painted designs began focusing on birds and flowers on the paper. Experimentation led to landscape painting, especially scenes related to rural life such as farming, fishing, weddings, funerals and religious festivals. It even has included the painting of picture frames.&lt;ref name="lopez110"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 110&lt;/ref&gt; Some painters have become famous in their own right for their work. Painter [[Nicolás de Jesús]], from Ameyaltepec has gained international recognition for his paintings, exhibiting abroad in countries such as France, Germany, England and Italy. His works generally touch on themes such as death, oppression of indigenous peoples and various references to popular culture in his local community.&lt;ref name="rosado"&gt;{{cite news |title= El arte en amate, tradición olmeca que continúan indígenas de Guerrero y Puebla |author= Xavier Rosado |url= http://www.suracapulco.com.mx/anterior/2002/diciembre/03/pag2.htm |newspaper= El Sur de Acapulco |location=Acapulco |date=December 3, 2002 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Art in amate, Olmec tradition that the indigenous of Guerrero and Puebla continue }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have innovated ways to speed up the work, such as using [[silk-screen]] techniques to make multiple copies.&lt;ref name="lopez125"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nahua paintings remain the most important craft form related to amate paper, the Otomi have adopted their elaborate cut out figures to the commercial market as well. This began with shamans creating booklets with miniature cut outs of gods with handwritten explanations. Eventually, these began to sell and this success led to their commercialization in markets in Mexico City, were the Otomi connected with the Nahua in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="lopez105"/&gt; The Otomi still sell cut outs in traditional designs, but have also experimented with newer designs, paper sizes, colors and types of paper.&lt;ref name="lopez112" /&gt; These cut outs include depictions of various gods, especially those related to beans, coffee, corn, pineapples, tomatoes and rain. However, these cut outs are not 100% authentic, with exact replicas still reserved to shamans for ritual purposes. Innovation has included the development of books, and cut outs of suns, flowers, birds, abstract designs from traditional beadwork and even [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]] hearts with painted flowers. Most cut outs are made of one type of paper, then glued onto a contrasting background. Their sizes range from miniatures in booklets to sizes large enough to frame and hang like a painting.&lt;ref name="lopez113"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 113&lt;/ref&gt;  The production and sale of these paper products have brought tourism to San Pablito, mostly from Hidalgo, Puebla and Mexico City, but some come from the far north and south of Mexico and even from abroad.&lt;ref name="lopez138"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 138&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been some minor innovations, amate paper is still made using the same basic process that was used in the pre Hispanic period.&lt;ref name="lopez123124"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; The process begins with obtaining the bark for its fiber. Traditionally, these are from trees of the fig ([[Ficus]]) family as this bark is the easiest to process. Some large Ficus trees are considered sacred and can be found surrounded with candles and offering of cut amate paper.&lt;ref name="lopez9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="floema"&gt;{{Cite report |title=El uso del floema secundario en la elaboración de papel amate |url=http://www.izt.uam.mx/contactos/n69ne/papel.pdf |author=Alejandro Quintanar-Isáis |author2=Citlalli López Binnqüist |author3=Marie Vander Meeren |year=2008 |publisher=1Depto. de Biolog´ıa, UAM-I, Centro de Investigaciones Tropicales, Universidad Veracruzana, Instituto Nacional de Antropolog´ıa e Historia |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |docket= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522171508/http://www.izt.uam.mx/contactos/n69ne/papel.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=yes |date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary species used include ''[[Ficus cotinifolia|F. cotinifolia]],'' ''[[Ficus padifolia|F. padifolia]]'' and ''[[Ficus petiolaris|F. petiolaris]]'', the classic amate tree, along with several non-ficus species such as [[Morus celtidifolia]], Citrus [[anurantifolia]] and [[Heliocarpos Donnell-Smithii Rose]].&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tierra"/&gt; However, the taxonomical identification of trees used for amate paper production is not exact, leading estimates of wild supplies inaccurate.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez17"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; The softer inner bark is preferred but other parts are used as well.&lt;ref name="floema"/&gt; Outer bark and bark from ficus trees tend to make darker paper and inner bark and mulberry bark tends to make lighter paper. Bark is best cut in the spring when it is new, which does less damage. It also is less damaging to take bark from older ficus trees as this bark tends to peel off more easily.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="floema"/&gt; The commercialization of the product has meant that a wider range of area needs to be searched for appropriate trees. This has specialized the harvesting of bark to mostly people from outside San Pablito, with only a few paper makers harvesting their own bark.&lt;ref name="lopez123"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 123&lt;/ref&gt; These bark collectors generally come to the village at the end of the week, but numbers of harvesters and amount of bark can vary greatly, depending on the time of year and other factors.&lt;ref name="lopez8"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; The paper makers generally buy the bark fresh then dry it for storage. After drying, the bark can be conserved for about a year.&lt;ref name="lopez125"/&gt;

From the beginning of commercialization, the making of a paper brought in most of the village's population into the process in one way or another. However, in the 1980s, many men in the area began to leave as migrant workers, mostly to the United States, sending remittances home. This then became the main source of income to San Pablito, and made paper making not only secondary, but mostly done by women.&lt;ref name="lopez123125"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 123,125&lt;/ref&gt; The basic equipment used are stones to beat the fibers, wooden boards and pans to boil the bark. All of these come from sources outside San Pablito. The stones come from [[Tlaxcala]]. The boards come from two nearby villages of Zoyotla and Honey and the boiling pans are obtained by local hardware stores from [[Tulancingo]].&lt;ref name="lopez130"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre Hispanic period, the bark was first soaked for a day or more to soften it before it was worked. An innovation documented from at least the 20th century is to boil the bark instead, which is faster. To shorten the boiling time, ashes or [[lime (material)|lime]] were introduced into the water, later replaced by industrial [[caustic soda]]. With the last ingredient, the actual boiling time is between three and six hours, although with set up the process takes anywhere from half to a full day. It can only be done during certain weather conditions (dry days) and it requires constant attention. The amount boiled at one time ranges from 60 to 90&amp;nbsp;kg with 3.5&amp;nbsp;kg of caustic soda. The bark needs to be stirred constantly. After boiling, the bark is then rinsed in clean water.&lt;ref name="lopez124125"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

The softened fibers are kept in water until they are processed. This needs to be done as quickly as possible so that they do not rot.&lt;ref name="lopez124127"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 124, 127&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, [[chlorine]] bleach may be added to either lighten the paper entirely or to create a mix of shades to create a marbled effect. This step has become necessary due to the lack of naturally light bark fibers.&lt;ref name="lopez126"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; If the paper is to be colored, strong industrial dyes are used. These can vary from purple, red, green or pink, whatever the demand is.&lt;ref name="lopez127"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden boards are sized to the paper being made. They are rubbed with soap so that the fibers do not stick. The fibers are arranged on wooden boards and beaten together into a thin flat mass. The best paper is made with long fibers arranged in a grid pattern to fit the board. Lesser quality paper is made from short masses arranged more haphazardly, but still beaten to the same effect.&lt;ref name="lopez8124127"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 8, 124, 127&lt;/ref&gt; This maceration process liberates soluble carbohydrates that are in the cavities of the cell fibers and act as a kind of glue. The Ficus tree bark contains a high quantity of this substance allowing to make for firm  but flexible paper.&lt;ref name="floema"/&gt; During the process, the stones are kept moist to keep the paper from sticking to it. The finished flat mass is then usually smoothed over with rounded orange peels. If there are any gaps after the maceration process, these are usually filled in by gluing small pieces of paper.&lt;ref name="lopez12129"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 12, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Remaining on their boards, the pounded sheets are taken outside to dry. Drying times vary due to weather conditions. On dry and sunny days, this can take an hour or two, but in humid conditions it can take days.&lt;ref name="lopez124128"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 124, 128&lt;/ref&gt; If the dried sheets are to be sold wholesale, they are then simply bundled. If to be sold retail, the edges are then trimmed with a blade.&lt;ref name="lopez129"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The production process in San Pablito  has mostly evolved to make paper as quickly as possible, with labor being divided and specialized and new tools and ingredients added towards this end.&lt;ref name="lopez117"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 117&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all production facilities are family based, but the level of organization varies. Most paper making is done inside the home by those who are dedicated to it either full or part-time.  If the paper is made only part-time, then the work is done sporadically and usually only by women and children. A more recent phenomenon is the development of large workshops which hire artisans to do the work, supervised by the family which owns the enterprise. These are often established by families who have invested money sent home by migrant worker into materials and equipment.&lt;ref name="lopez131132"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 131-132&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the production of all these facilities is plain sheet of 40&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm, but the larger workshops make the greatest variety of products including giant sheets of 1.2 by 2.4 meters in size.&lt;ref name="lopez129132"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 129,132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological concerns ==
The commercialization of amate paper has had negative environmental effects. In pre-Hispanic times, bark was taken only from the branches of adult trees, allowing for regeneration.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt; [[Ficus]] trees should be optimally no younger than 25 years old before cutting. At that age the bark almost peels off by itself and does less damage to the tree. Other trees such as mulberry do not have to mature as much.&lt;ref name="rosado"/&gt;  The pressure to provide large quantities of bark means that it is taken from younger trees as well.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt; This is negatively affecting the ecosystem of northern Puebla and forcing harvesters to take bark from other species as well as from a wider range, moving into areas such as [[Tlaxco Municipality, Puebla|Tlaxco]].&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nuevatec"&gt;{{cite press release |title= Nueva tecnología, garantiza producción sustentable de Papel Amate en la Sierra Norte de Puebla |publisher=[[FONART]] |date=April 6, 2011 |url= http://www.fonart.gob.mx/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=142 |language=Spanish |trans-title=New technology guarantees sustainable production of Amate paper in the Sierra Norte de Puebla |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the introduction of caustic soda and other industrial chemicals into the process, which not only gets into the environment and water supply, can also directly poison artisans who do not handle it properly.&lt;ref name="nuevatec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonart"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fonart.gob.mx/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113:produccion-sustentable-de-papel-amate&amp;catid=37:noticias-de-portada&amp;Itemid=113 |title= Investigación interinstitucional garantiza producción sustentable de papel amate |year=2010 |publisher=[[FONART]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Inter-institutional research guarantees sustainable production of amate paper |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías]] (FONART), the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]]-Iztapalapa, the [[Universidad Veracruzana]] and the [[Instituto de Artesanías e Industrias Populares]] de Puebla have been working on ways to make amate paper making more sustainable. One aspect is to manage the collection of bark. Another is to find a substitute for caustic soda to soften and prepare the fibers without losing quality. Not only is the soda polluting, it has had negative effects on artisans' health. As of 2010, the group has reported advances in its investigations such as ways of including new types of bark from other species.&lt;ref name="nuevatec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avanza"&gt;{{cite news |title= Avanza producción sustentable de papel amate en San Pablito |author= Ángel A.

In addition, the [[Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropología Social]] (CIESAS) is urging a reforestation plan in order to implement a more sustainable supply of bark.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;

'''Andrew Vicari''' (born Andrea Antonio Giovanni Vaccari, 20 April 1932 – 3 October 2016) was a Welsh painter working in France, who established a career painting portraits of prominent people. Despite being largely unknown in his own country, {{As of|2004|lc=on}} Vicari was Britain's richest living painter,{{cn|date=October 2016}} and at one time Britain 18th richest person.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37540601|title=Andrew Vicari the 'painter of kings' dies, aged 84|date=3 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Vicari was born in [[Port Talbot]], Wales, in 1932&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/tributes-as-saudi-royal-artist-andrew-vicari-dies-at-home-in-wales/story-29773349-detail/story.html "Tributes as Saudi royal artist Andrew Vicari dies at home in Wales"], ''South Wales Evening Post'', 3 October 2016.

He later attended [[Neath Grammar School|Neath Grammar School for Boys]]. Aged 12 he won the Gold Medal for Painting at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|Wales National Eisteddfod]].&lt;ref name="king of painters" /&gt; Between 1950 and 1952 he studied painting at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] at [[University College London]] (UCL) under [[William Coldstream]] and occasionally [[Lucian Freud]] as teachers. He had initially been refused a place at the Slade and was only admitted when someone dropped out.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Career==
After only two years, in 1952, Vicari left the Slade without completing his diploma course and went to Florence.  He stayed there and in Rome for two years before returning 'penniless' to the UK&lt;ref&gt; Mills, John ''Which Yet Survive.  Impressions of Friends, Family and Encounters'', Quartet Books, London 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.  He then began working in London as a portrait painter and in 1961 a large show of his work was put on in the former Debenhams showroom near Leicester Square financed by the band leader and impresario [[Jack Hylton]]. Eschewing modern trends, he remained a figurative artist working in oil. His work is appreciated worldwide, especially in the [[Middle East]] where three museums are solely dedicated to his work.

In 1974, Vicari was appointed as the official painter to the [[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] and [[Government of Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="king of painters" /&gt; In the following decades, he painted many portraits of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]] as well as scenes of [[Riyadh]] and [[Bedouin]] life. It is largely due to this patronage that Vicari owed his financial success and in 2011 earned him the title "The Rembrandt of Riyadh" from ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Vicari-t.html|title=The Rembrandt of Riyadh|date=27 January 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he sold a collection of 125 paintings of the [[First Gulf War]] to Prince Khaled for £17 million.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Vicari lived and worked at his studio outside [[Nice]], France, although he also owned apartments in Riyadh and Monte Carlo.

In 2006 his fortune was valued at £92 million by the [[Sunday Times Rich List|''Sunday Times'' Rich List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,20590,00.html|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, however, it was reported that Vicari had filed for bankruptcy and had been in poor health.&lt;ref name="WMail bankruptcy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner |first=Robin |title=Andrew Vicari now in bankruptcy proceedings |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/andrew-vicari-now-bankruptcy-proceedings-7989223 |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |date=24 October 2014 |page=5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005123530/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/andrew-vicari-now-bankruptcy-proceedings-7989223 |archivedate=5 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Annunciation''''' is a 1603-1605 painting by [[El Greco]], produced as part of a contract to provide four paintings for the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad in [[Illescas, Toledo]], where it still hangs, with three others from the same set (''[[The Virgin of Charity (El Greco)|Charity]]'', ''[[Coronation of the Virgin (El Greco, Illescas)|Coronation of the Virgin]]'' and ''[[Nativity (El Greco)|Nativity]]''), whilst the fifth is now in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] (''[[Marriage of the Virgin (El Greco)|Marriage of the Virgin]]'').

It is a simplification of the composition used by the artist for the ''Annunciation'' on the [[Doña María de Aragón Altarpiece]].

[[File:Thessaloniki Arch and tomb of Galerius.jpg|thumb|360px|The Arch of Galerius and the Rotunda (with a post added minaret), 299-303 AD]]

The '''Arch of Galerius''' ([[Greek language|Gr.]]: Αψίδα&amp;#32;του&amp;#32;Γαλερίου) or '''Kamara''' ([[Greek language|Gr.]]: Καμάρα) and the '''Rotunda''' (Ροτόντα) are neighbouring early 4th-century AD monuments in the city of [[Thessaloniki]], in the region of [[Central Macedonia]] in northern [[Greece]].

==History==
[[Image:Saint George Rotunda reconstruction.jpg|thumb|left|Rotunda and Arch of Galerius complex reconstruction]]
[[File:Brána římského vojevůdce Galeria v Soluni.jpg|thumb|The arch in 1913]]
[[File:Galeriusarch.jpg|thumb|Close view]]

The 4th-century [[Roman Emperor]] [[Galerius]] commissioned these two structures as elements of an imperial precinct linked to his Thessaloniki palace. [[Archeologists]] have found substantial remains of the palace to the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;The palace of Galerius was built on a massive scale using primarily local materials. It may have been built over the destruction layer of a fire that cleared an area. Expansive areas of mosaic are preserved in several areas. A structure linked to the palace and called the Octagonal Room is at the southwest end of the excavated area at 40°37'48.53"N, 22°56'55.99"E; thought at one point to be a [[mausoleum]], it may have been a monumental entryway to the palace. Beside the palace to the northeast was a [[hippodrome]].&lt;/ref&gt; These three monumental structures were connected by a road that ran through the arch, which rose above the major east-west road of the city.

At the crux of the major axes of the city, the Arch of Galerius emphasized the power of the emperor and linked the monumental structures with the fabric of 4th-century Thessaloniki. The arch was composed of a masonry core faced with [[marble]] sculptural panels celebrating a victory over the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]]. About two-thirds the arch is preserved.

The Rotunda was a massive circular structure with a masonry core that had an [[oculus]] like the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. It has gone through multiple periods of use and modification as a polytheist temple, a Christian basilica, a Muslim mosque, and again a Christian church (and archaeological site). A minaret is preserved from its use as a mosque, and ancient remains are exposed on its southern side.

==Location and description of the Arch==
[[File:ΑΨΙΔΑ ΓΑΛΕΡΙΟΥ 2.jpg|thumb|260px|left|The Arch of Galerius]]

The Arch of Galerius stands on what is now the intersection of ''Egnatia'' &amp; ''Dimitriou Gounari'' streets. The arch was built in 298 to 299 AD and dedicated in 303 AD to celebrate the victory of the [[tetrarchy|tetrarch]] [[Galerius]] over the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]] at the [[Battle of Satala (298)|Battle of Satala]] and capture{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} of their capital [[Ctesiphon]] in 298.&lt;ref&gt;At this point Galerius was a ''Caesar'' (subordinate emperor); he became one of the two ''Augusti'' (head emperors) in 305 AD, when [[Diocletian]] abdicated.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was an octopylon (eight-pillared gateway) forming a triple arch that was built of a rubble masonry core faced first with brick and then with marble panels with sculptural relief. The central arched opening was 9.7 m wide and 12.5 m high, and the secondary openings on other side were 4.8 m wide and 6.5 m high. The central arch spanned the portion of the '' [[Via Egnatia]]'' (primary Roman road from Dyrrhacium to [[Byzantium]]) that passed through the city as a [[Decumanus Maximus|''Decumanus'']] (east-west major street). A road connecting the Rotunda (125m northeast) with the Palace complex (235m southwest) passed through the arch along its long axis.

Only the northwestern three of the eight pillars and parts of the [[masonry]] cores of the arches above survive: i.e., the entire eastern side (4 pillars) and the southernmost one of the western pillars are lost.&lt;ref&gt;The other parts of the structure were destroyed at an unknown date, probably during one of many [[earthquake]]s, which have damaged Thessaloniki throughout its history.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive consolidation with modern brick has been performed on the exposed masonry cores to protect the monument. The two pillars flanking the central arched passageway retain their sculpted [[marble]] slabs, which depict the wars of Galerius against the Persians in broadly panegyric terms.

===Sculptural program of the Arch===
[[Image:Arch-of-Galerius-1.jpg|thumb|left|Galerius (L) attacks Narses (R)]]
[[Image:Arch of Galerius (sacrifice).jpg|thumb|The imperial family at the sacrifice of thanksgiving.]]
[[Image:Arch-of-Galerius-2.jpg|thumb|The tetrarchs arrayed in unison with a ''Victoria'' holding a victory wreath to the ''Augusti''.]]

Understanding of the sculptural program of the arch is limited by the loss of the majority of the marble panels, but the remains give an impression of the whole. Four vertically stacked registers of sculpted decoration were carved on each pillar, each separated by elaborate moldings. A label for the [[Tigris River]] indicates that there were likely labels on other representations as the builders deemed necessary. Artistic license was taken in the representations, for instance, the Caesar Galerius is shown in personal combat with the Sassanid Shah Narses in one of the panels; although they never met in battle.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} On the arch a mounted Galerius attacks a similarly mounted Narses with a lance as an eagle bearing a victory wreath in its talons approaches Galerius. The Caesar sits securely on his rearing horse, while the Persian king appears nearly unhorsed. Terrified Persians cower under the hooves of the Caesar's horse in the chaos of battle. The panel expresses the power of the Caesar Galerius.

The relief of the imperial family conjoined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving owes its distant prototype to the Augustan reliefs on the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'' in Rome.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Galerius' wife, Diocletian's daughter Valeria, is shown at his side, helping authenticate his connection to his predecessor. Here as elsewhere all the faces have been carefully chiselled off, whether as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' or in later cultural intolerance of images.

In another panel, the tetrarchs are all arrayed in the toga as a ''Victoria'' holds a victory wreath out to the heads of the two ''Augusti''. A third panel celebrates the unity of the [[tetrarchy]], with a depiction of the tetrarchs standing together; the depersonalized manner in which the tetrarchs are portrayed is reminiscent of the schematic statues of the tetrarchs in porphyry at [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in Venice.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Only Galerius is dressed in armor, and he makes the offering upon the altar.

What remains of the arch asserts the glory of the tetrarchy and the prominence of Galerius within that system. The arch celebrates the Roman Empire as part of Galerius’ victory over the Sassanid king.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Galerius is also pictured on his horse at the right, while attacking a Sassanid guard.

==Rotunda of Galerius==

===Location and description of the Rotunda===
[[File:THES-Rotonde St-Georges plan.png|thumb|left|Plan]]

The Rotunda of Galerius is 125m northeast of the Arch of Galerius at 40°37'59.77"N, 22°57'9.77"E. It is also known (by its consecration and use) as the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox]] Church of ''[[Saint George|Agios Georgios]]'', and is informally called the Church of the Rotunda (or simply ''The Rotunda'').

The cylindrical structure was built in 306 AD on the orders of the tetrarch [[Galerius]], who was thought to have intended it to be his [[mausoleum]]. It was more likely intended as a temple; it is not known to what god it would have been dedicated, probably [[Zeus]].

The Rotunda has a diameter of 24.5 m. Its walls are more than 6 m thick, which is why it has withstood Thessaloniki's earthquakes. The walls are interrupted by eight rectangular bays, with the west bay forming the entrance. A flat brick dome, 30 m high at the peak, crowns the cylindrical structure. In its original design, the dome of the Rotunda had an ''[[oculus]]'', as does the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.

===Uses of the Rotunda===
[[Image:Rotunda of Galerius (February 2009).jpg|thumb|240px|left|The altar view of the Rotunda of Galerius, initially a Mausoleum of Roman Emperor Galerius, later a Christian church, and then a mosque. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and some days of the year functions as a church]]
[[File:Thessalonikki, Greece 5 Rotunda 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Entrance, close view]]
[[File:Abside 00311.JPG|thumb|200px|The inside view of the altar, with the remaining wall paintings]]

After Galerius's death in 311, he was buried at [[Gamzigrad]] ([[Felix Romuliana]]) near [[Zajecar]], [[Serbia]]. The Rotunda stood empty for several years until the Emperor [[Constantine I]] ordered its conversion into a Christian church in 326. The church was embellished with very high quality [[mosaics]]. Only fragments have survived of the original decoration, for example, a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.

The building was used as a church (''Church of Asomaton or Archangelon'') for over 1,200 years until the city fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. In 1590 it was converted into a [[mosque]], called the Mosque of Suleyman Hortaji Effendi, and a [[minaret]] was added to the structure. It was used as a mosque until 1912, when the Greeks captured the city during the [[Balkan War]]. Greek Orthodox officials reconsecrated the structure as a church, and they left the minaret. The structure was damaged during an earthquake in 1978 but was subsequently restored. {{As of|2004}}, the minaret was still being stabilized with scaffolding. The building is now a historical monument under the [[Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities]] of the [[Greek Ministry of Culture]], although the Greek Orthodox Church has access to the monument for various festivities some days of the year (as St. George Church).

The Rotunda is the oldest of Thessaloniki's churches. Some Greek publications claim it is the oldest Christian church in the world, although there are competitors for that title. It is the most important surviving example of a church from the early Christian period of the Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11186">'''Associated American Artists''' ('''AAA''') was an [[Art museum|art gallery]] [[New York City|in New York City that was established in 1934 and]] [[New York City|ceased operation in 2000.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art for Every Home: Associated American Artists 1934-2000|last=Seaton, ed.|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Myers, ed.|first2=Jane|last3=Windisch, ed.|first3=Gail|publisher=Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art, Kansas State University|year=2015|isbn=978-0-300-21579-3|location=Manhattan, Kansas|pages=11|nopp=|oclc=910009711}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gallery marketed art to the [[middle class|middle and upper-middle class]]es, first in the form of affordable prints and later in home furnishings and accessories, and played a significant role in the growth of art as an industry.

==Beginnings==
Associated American Artists was begun by [[Reeves Lewenthal]].  Lewenthal's first job was as a reporter for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' but he quickly expanded into artists' agent, working as a publicist for British artist [[Douglas Chandor]].  By the 1930s Lewenthal had a clientele of 35 groups including the [[National Academy of Design]] and the [[Beaux-Arts Institute of Design]].  Realizing the limited possibilities in selling high-priced art to high-class dealers, and the correspondingly huge potential in marketing affordable art to the much larger middle classes, he left his [[public relations]] work to try his hand at this new business model.

[[Lithography|Print]]s being relatively cheap to produce, Lewenthal decided to focus on that medium.  Before the 1930s, fine-art prints were usually [[special edition|limited edition]]s which sold for $10–$50.  During the [[Great Depression]] the [[Federal Art Project]] had resulted in hundreds of thousands of prints, but these were distributed free (mostly to schools) thus the artists made no profits from print sales. Lewenthal's idea was to combine quality, affordability, and profit.  In 1934 he met with several well-known American artists, including [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and proposed hiring them to produce lithographs which he would then sell to middle-class buyers for $5 apiece plus $2 per frame, paying the artist $200 per [[edition (printmaking)|edition]].  At the same time, [[corporation]]s began hiring famous artists to work on [[advertising campaign]]s – [[Dole Pineapple]], for example, hired artist [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] to "create pictorial links between pineapple juice and tropical romance".&lt;ref&gt;Doss, Erika.  "Catering to Consumerism: Associated American Artists and the Marketing of Modern Art, 1934-1958." ''Winterthur Portfolio,'' Vol. 26, No. 2/3. (Summer - Autumn, 1991), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;  This convergence of art, business, and consumerism was the perfect environment for Lewenthal's new Associated American Artists enterprise.

When Lewenthal [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]ed his first lithographs in 1934, the American economy was still limping towards recovery from the Depression; high-priced art was an impossible [[Luxury good|luxury]] for most people and the old galleries that had always supported artists were finding it difficult to broker their work. AAA was thus "an agent of economic salvation" for numerous American artists including [[Peggy Bacon]], [[Aaron Bohrod]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Luigi Lucioni]], and [[Grant Wood]], despite the fact that signing with AAA usually meant being fired from their higher-end gallery.

:''I knew the regionalists were popular because their names were in the art magazines all the time.  But they weren't popular enough, and they weren't making any money.  Why, when I first went to Tom Benton's New York apartment he was living in utter squalor.  I more or less rescued him.''&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fall of 1934 Lewenthal had contracts with fifty department stores to carry his "signed originals by America's great artists." &lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Populist appeal==
Lewenthal marketed his prints as educational resources, as a [[patriotism|patriotic]] choice, and as "art for the people" rather than "art for the wealthy."  In January 1935 AAA issued its first mail-order print catalogue; mail-order print sales will continue for the next forty-nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art for Every Home: Associated American Artists 1934-2000|last=Seaton, ed.|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Myers, ed.|first2=Jane|last3=Windisch, ed.|first3=Gail|publisher=Marianna Kistler Museum of Art, Kansas State University|year=2015|isbn=978-0-300-21579-3|location=Manhattan, Kansas|pages=15|oclc=909251636}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also placed advertisements in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and by promoting print collecting in terms of upward mobility—in the same way as buying Listerine ("The Dentifrice of the Rich," according to one ad campaign&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;), owning modern art raised one's life socially. AAA's success led them to open a 30,000-square-foot gallery at 711 Fifth Avenue in 1939 where they featured paintings and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art for Every Home: Associated American Artists 1934-2000|last=Seaton, ed.|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Myers, ed.|first2=Jane|last3=Windisch, ed.|first3=Gail|publisher=Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art, Kansas State University|year=2015|isbn=978-0-300-21579-3|location=Manhattan, Kansas|pages=15|oclc=909251636}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, AAA had 107 artists under contract and sold 62,374 lithographs, for a net income of $1 million per month.

In addition to its mainstream marketing strategy, AAA chose art and artists with [[populism|populist]] appeal.  [[Representationalism|Representational]] and [[Regionalism (art)|regional]] art made up the bulk of their lines; particularly popular were the works of Benton, Curry and Wood.  These artists avoided gritty realism and created positive images of an idealized, strong, capable America, a viewpoint which accorded well with the political environment of the [[New Deal]] and was in some senses [[therapy|therapeutic]] for the anxiety and weakness pervasive during and just after the Depression.  Typical of this was Benton's ''Plowing It Under'', released shortly after the federal government arranged the plowing under of millions of acres previously devoted to cotton production in order to increase farm revenue; Benton's work reassured the public that the government was working in the best interests of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialization of art==
The Regionalists by and large were in favor of businesses and advertising using their works, believing that fine art could raise the consciousness of business.  They did not fully realize how art figured into corporate [[brand management|branding]] and advertising in the minds of corporate planners, or consider that their art might be used to inspire confidence in a product.  They were soon to learn. Benton's original works for R.J. Reynolds' [[Lucky Strikes]], for example, showed black [[sharecropper]]s at work, but corporate headquarters were not interested in "Negroes doing what looked like old-time slave work."  They demanded pictures that showed not realism but idealism, leading Benton to complain that "Every time a patron dictates to an artist what is to be done, he doesn't get any art, he just gets a poor commercial job."&lt;ref&gt;Doss, pp. 158-159&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly, rather than deal with AAA and its artists, companies built in-house [[art department]]s that could produce art in the Regionalist style.  This appropriation of the regionalist/representational style culminated in the [[Propaganda in the United States#Government propaganda|propaganda posters of World War II]].

==Post-WWII==
The increasing association of regionalist and representational art with commercialism and advertising (and in some eyes, with [[fascism]]) contributed to its decreasing popularity and to the rise of [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] art after World War II.  When AAA opened galleries in [[Chicago]] and [[Beverly Hills]], it stocked them with modern works by American and—a first for AAA—European artists.  (When Lewenthal offered [[Jackson Pollock]] an art-for-business commission like those he had offered his artists in 1934, Pollock turned him down.)  In its [[press release]]s and articles AAA talked about exploring "new frontiers," "new trends" --  and made no mention of the $5 mail-order line and the artists who had helped it succeed twenty years earlier.  Thomas Hart Benton resigned from AAA in 1946.

AAA continued to find new ways to sell art, however, branching out into [[Stonelain]] porcelain, fabric, and housewares such as ashtrays, playing cards, and lamp shades as vehicles for work in abstract and other modern styles.  By the mid-1950s, Lewenthal was quoted as saying, "Today's artist is a designer, not an [[Ivory Tower]] tenant.  His is a field of practical creativity and every American room can become a showcase for his genius.".&lt;ref&gt;Article in ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Now, rather than bringing modern art to the masses, AAA was bringing mass consumer commodities into the world of art.

AAA was a victim of its own success in some ways.  Having been so successful, it was adopted as a model by other companies that began to compete with AAA—marketing fabric, for example, as "etching by the yard" or commissioning artists to do designs for lines of china or wallpaper.  [[Steubenville China]] marketed its "American Modern" line of place settings as "art translated into dinnerware." &lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958 Lewenthal took over management of Rust Craft Greeting Cards, handling all AAA's decorative arts lines, while [[Sylvan Cole]] took responsibility for the New York gallery and the fine art market.

In a strange reversal of its "market to the masses" philosophy, many early AAA prints which sold originally for $5 go to [[art collector]]s for thousands of dollars today.

'''Carlton Theatre Group''' (formerly '''Carlton Dramatic Society''') is an [[Amateur Dramatics]] group, based in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. 

The troupe was formed by a group of enthusiasts from [[Wimbledon Park]] and [[Southfields]] in 1927. These included [[Ghost hunting|ghosthunter]] and playwright Harry Price, who used the Society to perform his first play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Paul Tabori |title=Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-RWAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Carlton+Dramatic+Society%22&amp;dq=%22Carlton+Dramatic+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=60ZOVZ7gC4TP7gaG-YCIDA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA |year=1966 |page=22 |publisher=Living Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second World War]] its activities were suspended by the [[Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939]]. In 1946 the group returned to the stage in a production of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[And Then There Were None (play)|Ten Little Niggers]]'' (using the original title).

In 1963 the Society toured the major churches of South East England culminating in two nights at St Paul’s in [[Covent Garden]] and St Matthew’s in [[Slough]]. [[Prince Philip]] aware of the hype surrounding the production invited the society to perform the play in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle|St. George's Chapel]], [[Windsor Castle]]. This single performance was on [[Maundy Thursday]] and the entire [[British Royal Family]] were present for the [[Easter]] [[Spring Break|break]]. The cast was presented afterwards and the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] told the cast that she had been 'very moved'.

The Carlton celebrated its 80th birthday in 2007 with a 1920s themed party which was attended by over 100 members, past and present. The 85th birthday party will be held in May 2012.

The group continues to perform a wide range of plays around Wimbledon. They perform regularly at the [[New Wimbledon Studio Theatre]]. In recent years their repertoire has included [[Shakespeare]], [[Molière]], [[John Godber]], [[Ray Cooney]] alongside original works tackling contemporary issues. Active membership is around 50 adults.

The President of the Society is [[June Whitfield]]. The Chair is Kathie Arundell.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

[[Image:Thechildrenoflirduncan1914.jpg|thumb|''The Children of Lir'' (1914) by [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] ]]

The '''''Children of Lir''''' ({{lang-ga|Oidheadh chloinne Lir}}) is a legend from [[Irish mythology]]. It is a tale from the post-Christianisation period that mixes magical elements such as druidic wands and spells with a Christian message of faith bringing freedom from suffering.

==Naming and manuscripts==
Named in Irish as ''Oidheadh Chlainne Lir'', the tale is today often known simply as "The Children of Lir" but the title has also been rendered as ''The Tragic Story of the Children of Lir'' or ''The Fate of the Children of Lir'', or, from the earlier title ''Aided Chlainne Lir'', as ''The Violent Death of the Children of Lir''.{{sfn|MacKillop|2004|loc = Entry for ''Oidheadh Chlainne Lir''}}

In post 18th-century scholarship the tale has often been grouped with the ''Oidheadh chloinne Uisnigh'' ("The Fate of the Children of Uisnigh") and ''Oidheadh chloinne Tuireann'' ("The Fate of the Children of Tuireann") as the ''Trí truagha na sgéalaigheachta'', i.e. "The three sorrows of storytelling," also known as "The Three Sorrowful Tales of Erin."&lt;ref name="van1"&gt;{{citation| title = Oidheadh chloinne Lir| url =http://vanhamel.nl/codecs/Oidheadh_chloinne_Lir | work = vanhamel.nl }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|MacKillop|2004|loc =Entries for ''Oidheadh Chlainne Lir'', ''Trí Truagha na Sgéalaigheachta''}}  Scholar and folklorist [[Robin Flower]] has suggested that all three tales may have had a common author sometime in the 14th century, by someone in the circle of the [[Mac Fhirbhisigh]]s in north-west [[Connacht]].{{sfn|Breatnach|1999|p=1}}

Manuscripts containing early versions of the tales include MS 72.1.38 and MS 72.2.6 at the [[National Library of Scotland]], MS Egerton 164 at the [[British Library]], and MS 24 A 13, and MS E vi 4 at the library of the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref name="van1"/&gt;

==Summary==
[[Image:Ler swans Millar.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Lêr and the Swans'' by [[H. R. Millar|H.R. Millar]]'s (1905)]]
:''Based on {{harv|Duffy|1883|}} ; a point summary is given in {{harvnb|Duffy|1883|pp=xv-xvi}} Numerals refer to those in the point summary and in Duffy's text itself.''

The legendary historical setting of the story is the end of the dominion of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] in Ireland, and the corresponding rise of the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]].{{sfn|Duffy|1883|p=vii}}

[2-9] [[Bodb Derg]] was elected king of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], to the annoyance of Lir, who felt himself should have been chosen; Lir did not swear obedience to the new King, to the annoyance of those that elected him, causing strife, though Bodb sought to appease them. After some time Lir's wife died - to appease Lir, Bodb gave one of his daughters, Aoibh, to him in marriage - Lir agreed that he would yield the lordship, and form an alliance - ending the strike.

[10-13] Aoibh bore Lir four children: one girl, [[Fionnuala|Fionnghuala]], and three sons, [[Aed (god)|Aodh]] and twins, Fiachra and Conn. After the birth of the twins Aoibh died, causing great grief to Lir, though he was bolstered by his love for the four children. Bodb then sent another of his daughters, Aoife, to marry Lir, which he accepted happily. The children were a joy both to Lir and to Bodb.

[14-18] After a short while Aoife became jealous of the affection given to the four step children. Initially she feigned illness for around a year. One day she set out in her chariot with the four children, with design to kill them, and called her entourage to slay them, stating that because of them she had lost Lir's love, and promising them rich rewards. However they would not help, so she drew a sword, but was not able to follow through with the act. Next she took them to Loch Dairbhreach, and made to bathe - once in the water she cast a spell of metamorphosis to transform them in to four white swans.

[19-23] Fionnghuala rebuked her, stating that her magic power was not as great as that of their friends to undo the spell, and warned her of the revenge she would face - he asked her to set a limit on the time of the spell. She set a period of three hundred years as swan on ''Loch Dairbhreach'';&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Lake of the Oaks, [[Lough Derravaragh|Loch Derryvaragh]].{{harv|Duffy|1883|loc=note 29, p.84}}&lt;/ref&gt; three hundred more on ''Sruth na Maoilé'';&lt;ref group="n"&gt;''Sruth na Maoilé'' aka ''Sruthar na Maoilé Chinntiré'', the strong current near the [[Mull of Kintyre|Mull of Cantire]], see [[Straits of Moyle]].{{harv|Duffy|1883|loc=note 33 pp.84-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three hundred at ''Iorrus Domnann'' and ''Inis Gluairé''.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;''Iorrus Domnann'', now known as [[Erris]] in County Mayo; ''Inis Gluairé'', "Glory Island", in the Bay of Erris, County Mayo. {{harv|Duffy|1883|loc = note 34, 35, 36 p.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also foretold that by expiration of the period of the spell Lairgenn (the great-grandson of the King of Connacht), and Deoch (the great-granddaughter of the King of Munster) would be wed. Aoife relented a little and allowed the children to retain the power of speech, stating they would sing plaintive songs without equal, and that they would not be distressed by being in the forms of birds. Aoife the returned to court of Bodb -when he asked why the children were not with her she claimed Lir did not trust him with them, but Bodb was suspicious and sent messengers to Lir.

[24-32] On receiving the messenger Lir became sad, realising Aoifé had done some harmful act. He then set out, and at the shores of ''Loch Dairbhreach'' he encountered the swans singing with human voices. They told him of Aoife's evil act, and Lir and his people lamented, though that night they stayed and listened to the swan's song. Lir reached Bodb, and told him of Aoifé's treachery. Bodb cursed her, saying her suffering would be greater than the children's, and asked what the worst form of being was that she could imagine - Aoifé stated a Demon of the air was the worst, and on this Bodh struck her with a druid's wand, metamorphosing her into such a demon - she flew off and remained that way.

[33-45] Bodb and the people of the De Danann went to Loch Dairbhreach and listened to the swan's singing. Milesians came too, and the music calmed and delighted all who heard it. After three hundred years the time came for the swans to go north to the cold Sruth na Maoilé. At this time it was proclaimed that no swan should be killed in Erin. At the Maoilé a cruel storm separated them, and though they eventually re-united their time there was wretched, with extremes of cold and weather to contend with, but they could not leave, as it was their lot to stay in the waters there.

[46-52] Eventually the swans came across a company of the De Danann and of the Milesians who had been seeking them, led by Aodh and Fergus sons of Bodb - near the mouth of the Banna.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[River Bann]], {{harv|Duffy|1883|loc = note 51 p.87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The swans enquired and received good news about the De Danann, Lir, and Bodb. After the allotted time the swans then left for Iorrus Domhnann. There they encountered a young man who took an account of their adventures.

[53-55] One night at Iorrus the cold and weather became so intense that the waters froze, and their feet froze to the ice. Because of their suffering they pleaded to the "King of Heaven" to ease the plight of birds, and having and professing faith in a "true God, perfect, truly intelligent" their pleading was heard, and from then they were protected from storms and bad weather. Eventually the time allotted to Iorrus Domhnann passed and they decided to go to ''Sioth Fionnachaidh'', where Lir lived.

[56-61] However once there, they found it deserted, derelict, and overgrown. The next day they set off for ''Inis Gluairé'' - there many birds congregated around them at the lake. Eventually Saint Patrick and Christianity came to Ireland, and one day the holy man ''Mochaomhóg'' arrive at ''Inis Gluairé'' - the swans heard him ringing a bell calling matins, and became frightened at the sound. However Fionnghuala declared the sound of the bell would liberate them from the curse of the spell, and so they listened to it. When it finished they sang a song. The holy man heard their song, and discovered that it was swans that sang it. Speaking to them he asked if they were the Children of Lir, stating that he had travelled to that place for their sake.

[62-66] The swans put their trust in the holy man, and allowed him to bind them with silver chains. The birds felt no fatigue or distress in their situation in the company of the monk. Eventually the account of the swans reached Deoch, the wife of Lairgnen, the King of Connacht - she asked him to get the swans for her. He sent messenger's immediately but the monk Mochaomhóg refused, making Lairgnen angry. He went to Mochaimhóg himself, and attempted to grasp the swans, but on his touch the swan's feathers fell off revealing three very old men, and an old woman, all lean, and very bony. On this Lairgnen left.

[67-70] Fionnghuala asked the monk to baptise them and to bury each, stating he sensed they were close to death. They were baptised, then died, and were buried. Mochaomhóg was sad for them. That was the fate of the children of Lir.

'''Christian views on the [[classics]]''' have varied widely throughout history.

==Early period==
When Christianity at first appeared in [[Rome]], introduced by [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], the instruction of youth was largely confined to the basics of reading, writing and mathematics followed by the study of grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and history.  Much of the history was in verse; chief among which were the works of [[Horace]] and [[Virgil]]. Until the [[peace of the Church]], early in the fourth century, the value and use of classical studies were unquestioned. Converts to Christianity brought with them such mental cultivation as they had received while [[paganism|pagans]]. They used their knowledge of [[mythology]] and ancient traditions as a means of attacking paganism. [[Tertullian]] forbade Christians to teach, but admitted that school attendance by Christian pupils was unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De idolatria'', 10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnobius]],&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius, ''Adversus nationes'', II, 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lactantius]], and Cassianus&lt;ref&gt;Prudentius, ''Liber Peristephanon'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; were classical Christian teachers.&lt;ref&gt;De Rossi, ''Roma Sotterranea'', II, 810&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fourth century the value of secular literature began to be questioned by [[Bible|Biblical scholars]]. This opposition is condensed in the accepted translation, dating from [[Jerome]] from [[Psalm]] 70:15-16  ''Quoniam non cognovi litteraturam, introibo in potentias Domini; Domine memorabor justitiae tuae solius''. (Because I have not known learning I will enter into the powers of the LORD: O LORD I will be mindful of thy justice alone.[[Douay-Rheims]] 1899) The opposition between [[divine judgement]] and literature became gradually an accepted Christian idea.

Later persecution under [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] led Christian writers to express more definitely their views on the subject. It produced little effect in the West. However, [[Marius Victorinus]], one of the most distinguished professors in Rome, chose "to give up the idle talk of the school rather than the Word of God."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Confessions'', VIII, 5&lt;/ref&gt; Thenceforth, Christians studied more closely and more appreciatively their own literature, i.e., the Biblical writings. Jerome discovers therein a Horace, a [[Catullus]] and an [[Alcaeus of Messene|Alcaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Epistle 30''&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''De doctrina christiana'' Augustine shows how the Scriptures could be turned to account for the study of [[eloquence]]; he analyses periods of the prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and shows excellent examples of rhetorical figures in the Pauline Epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De doctrina christiana'', IV, 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; It would seem that the Church, therefore, ought to have given up the study of pagan literature. It did not do so. Augustine suggested his method only to those who wished to become priests, and even for these he did mean to make it obligatory. Men of less marked ability were to use the ordinary method of instruction. The ''De doctrina christiana'' was written in 427, at which time his advancing age and the increasing strictness of monastic life might have inclined Augustine to a rigorous solution. Jerome's scruples and the dream he relates in one of his letters are quite well known. In this dream he saw angels scourging him and saying: "Thou art not a Christian, thou art a Ciceronian."&lt;ref&gt;Paul, ''Epistle 25''&lt;/ref&gt; He finds fault with ecclesiastics who find too keen a pleasure in the reading of Virgil; he adds, nevertheless, that youths are indeed compelled to study him.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, ''Epistle 21''&lt;/ref&gt; In his quarrel with [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] he declares that he has not read the profane authors since he left school, "but I admit that I read them while there. Must I then drink the waters of [[Lethe]] that I may forget?"&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Adv. Ruf.'', I, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In defending himself the first figure that occurs to him is taken from mythology. What these eminent men desired was not so much the separation but the combination of the treasures of profane literature and of Christian truth. Jerome recalls the precept of [[Deuteronomy]]: "If you desire to marry a captive, you must first shave her head and eyebrows, shave the hair on her body and cut her nails, so must it be done with profane literature, after having removed all that was earthly and idolatrous, unite with her and make her fruitful for the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Epistle 83''&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine uses another Biblical allegory. For him, the Christian who seeks his knowledge in the pagan authors resembles the [[Israelite]]s who despoil the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] of their treasures in order to build the tabernacle of God. As to [[Ambrose]], he has no doubts whatever. He quotes quite freely from [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Virgil, and the ''Consolatio'' of [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus|Servius Sulpicius]]. He accepts the earlier view handed down from the Hebrew apologists to their Christian successors, viz., that whatever is good in the literature of antiquity comes from the Sacred Books. [[Pythagoras]] was a Jew or, at least, had read [[Moses]]. The pagan poets owe their flashes of wisdom to [[David]] and [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]. [[Tatian]], following earlier Jews had learnedly confirmed this view, and it recurs, more or less developed, in the other Christian apologists. In the West [[Minucius Felix]] gathered carefully into his ''Octavius'' whatever seemed to show harmony between the new doctrine and ancient learning. This was a convenient argument and served more than one purpose.

But this concession presupposed that pagan studies were subordinate to Christian truth, the "Hebraica veritas". In the second book of his ''[[De doctrina christiana]]'', Augustine explains how pagan classics lead to a more perfect apprehension of the Scriptures, and are indeed an introduction to them. In this sense Jerome, in a letter to Magnus, professor of eloquence at Rome, recommends the use of profane authors; profane literature is a captive.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Epistle 85''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, men neither dared nor were able to do without classical teaching. Rhetoric continued to inspire a kind of timid reverence. The [[panegyric|panegyrists]], for example, do not trouble themselves about the [[Roman Emperor|emperor's]] religion, but addressed him as pagans would a pagan and draw their literary embellishments from mythology. [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] himself did not dare to exclude pagan authors from the school. A professor like [[Ausonius]] pursued the same methods as his pagan predecessors. [[Magnus Felix Ennodius]], deacon of Milan under [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] and later Bishop of [[Pavia]], inveighed against the impious person who carried a statue of [[Minerva]] to a disorderly house, and himself under pretext of an "epithalamium" wrote light and trivial verses. It is true that Christian society at the time of the [[migration period|barbarian invasions]] repudiated mythology and ancient culture, but it did not venture to completely banish them. In the meantime the public schools of antiquity were gradually closed. Private teaching took their place but even that formed its pupils, e.g. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], according to the traditional method. Christian asceticism, however, developed a strong feeling against secular studies. As early as the fourth century [[Martin of Tours]] finds that men have better things to do than study. There are lettered monks at [[Lérins Abbey|Lérins]], but their scholarship is a relic of their early education, not acquired after their monastic profession. The [[Rule of Benedict]] prescribes reading, it is true, but only sacred reading. [[Gregory the Great]] condemns the study of literature so far as bishops are concerned. [[Isidore of Seville]] condenses all ancient culture into a few data gathered into his ''Origines'', just enough to prevent all further study in the original sources. [[Cassiodorus]] alone shows a far wider range and makes possible a deeper and broader study of letters. His encyclopedic grasp of human knowledge links him with the best literary tradition of pagan antiquity. He planned a close union of secular and sacred science whence ought to issue a complete and truly Christian method of teaching. Unfortunately the invasions of the barbarians followed and the ''Institutiones'' of Cassiodorus remained a mere project.

==Medieval period==
About the middle of the sixth century, the first indication of classical culture were seen in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and,  towards the close of the century, in [[Ireland]]. Irish scholars and then teachers, created a culture which the Anglo-Saxons developed. This culture placed literature and [[science]] at the service of [[theology]] and [[exegesis]]. They devoted themselves chiefly to grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics.

It is quite unlikely that manuscripts had been brought to Ireland between 350 and 450, to bring about a much later literary renaissance. The small ecclesiastical schools almost everywhere preserved elementary teaching, reading and writing. Irish scholarship went far beyond that.

During the sixth and seventh centuries, manuscripts were still being copied in continental Europe. The writing of this period is [[uncial]] or semi-uncial. Even after eliminating fifth- century manuscripts there still remains a fair number of manuscripts in this style of writing. We find among these works practical information: glossaries, treatises on [[surveying|land-surveying]], [[medicine]], the [[veterinary medicine|veterinary art]], [[jurisprudence|juridical]] commentaries.

On the other hand, the numerous ecclesiastical manuscripts prove the persistence of certain scholarly traditions. The continuations of sacred studies sufficed to bring about the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. It was likewise a purely ecclesiastical culture which the Irish brought back to the continent in the sixth and seventh centuries. The chief aim of these Irish monks was to preserve and develop religious life. When the scattered items of information are examined, especially the hagiological indications, their importance is peculiarly diminished, for the teaching in question generally concerns Scripture or theology. Even [[Columbanus]] does not seem to have organized literary studies in his monasteries. The Irish monks had a personal culture which they did not make any effort to diffuse, owing to the great distance between centers of learning. Moreover, the disciples of the Irish were men enamoured of ascetic mortification, who shunned an evil world and sought a life of prayer and penance. For such minds, beauty of language and verbal rhythm were frivolous attractions. The material equipment of the Irish religious establishments in Gaul scarcely admitted any other study than that of the Scriptures. Generally these establishments were but a group of huts surrounding a small chapel.

Thus, until [[Charlemagne]] and [[Alcuin]], intellectual life was confined to Great Britain and Ireland. It was revived in [[Gaul]] in the eighth century, when the classic Latin literature was again studied.  Pagan authors were read as secondary to Scripture and theology. Even towards the close of his life, Alcuin forbade his monks to read Virgil. [[Statius]] is the favourite poet, and, before long, [[Ovid]], whose licentiousness is glossed over by allegorical interpretation. Mediocre abstracts and compilations, products of academic decadence, appear among the books frequently read, e.g. [[Homerus latinus]] (''Ilias Latina''), [[Dictys]], [[Dares]], the distichs ascribed to [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]. Cicero is almost overlooked, and two distinct personages are made of Tullius and Cicero. There were a number of classical authors studied until the thirteenth century.

At the close of the twelfth century, in the early years of the University of Paris, the principal known authors are: Statius, Virgil, Lucian, Juvenal, Horace, Ovid (with exception of the erotic poems and the satires), Sallust, Cicero, Martial, Petronius (judged as combining useful information and dangerous passages), Symmachus, Solinus, Sidonius, Suetonius, Quintus Curtius, Justin (known as Trogus Pompeius), Livy, the two Senecas (including the tragedies), Donatus Priscian, Boethius, Quintilian, Euclid, and Ptolemy. In the thirteenth century the influence of Aristotle restricted the field of reading.

There are, however, a few real Humanists among the medieval writers. Einhard (770-840), Rabanus Maurus (776-856), the ablest scholar of his time, and Walafrid Strabo (809-849) are men of extensive and disinterested learning. Servatus Lupus, Abbot of Ferrières (805-862), in his quest for Latin manuscripts labours as zealously as any scholar of the fifteenth century. At a later period Latin literature is represented by Remigius of Auxerre (d. 908), Gerbert (later Pope Sylvester II d. 1003), Liutprand of Cremona (d. about 972), John of Salisbury (1110–1180), Vincent of Beauvais (d. 1264), and Roger Bacon (d. 1294).

Medieval Latin poetry drew its inspiration from Latin poetry. Among the imitations must be mentioned the works of Hroswitha (or Roswitha), Abbess of Gandersheim (close of the tenth century), whom Virgil, Prudentius, and Sedulius inspired to celebrate the acts of Otho the Great. She is of particular interest in the history of the survival of Latin literature, because of her comedies after the manner of Terence. It has been said that she wished to cause the pagan author to be totally forgotten. This statement is not reconcilable with her known simplicity of character. A certain facility in the dialogue and clearness of style do not offset the lack of ideas in her writings. They exhibit the fate of classical culture in the Middle Ages. Hroswitha imitates Terence, indeed but without understanding him, and in a ridiculous manner. The poems on actual life of Hugh of Orléans known as "Primas" or "[[Archpoet|Archipoeta]]" are far superior and betray genuine talent as well as an intelligent grasp of Horace.

&lt;!---probably should be merged with the above material---&gt;
During the Middle Ages the Church preserved secular literature by harboring and copying its works in monasteries, where valuable libraries existed as early as the ninth century:
*in Italy, at [[Monte Cassino]] (founded in 529), and at [[Bobbio]] founded in 612 by Columbanus);
*in Germany at [[Saint Gall]] (614), [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]] (794), [[Fulda]] (744), [[Lorsch]] (763), [[Hersfeld]] (768), [[Corvey]] (822), [[Hirschau]] (8430);
*in France at St. [[Martin of Tours]] (founded in 372, but later restored), Fleury or [[Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire]] (620), [[Ferrières Abbey|Ferrières]] (630), [[Corbie]] (662), [[Cluny]] (910).

The reforms of Cluny and later of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] were not favourable to studies. The chief aim of the reformers was to combat the secular spirit and re-establish strict religious observances. This influence is in harmony with the tendencies of scholasticism. Consequently, from the twelfth century and especially the thirteenth, the copying of manuscripts became a secular business, a source of gain. The following is a list of the most ancient or most useful manuscripts of the Latin classics for the Middle Ages:
*Eighth-ninth centuries: [[Cicero]]'s Orations, [[Horace]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Martial]].
*Ninth century: [[Terence]], [[Lucretius]], [[Cicero]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Ovid]], [[Lucan]], [[Valerius Maximus]], [[Columella]], [[Persius]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Quintus Curtius]], the [[Thebaid]] of [[Statius]], [[Silius Italicus]], [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Juvenal]], [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]], [[Florus]], [[Claudian]].
*Ninth-Tenth centuries: Persius, Quintus Curtius, [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], Cicero, Horace, Livy, [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], Lucan, the philosopher Seneca, [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], Martial, [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].
*Tenth century: Caesar [[Catullus]], Cicero, Sallust, [[Lio]], Ovid, Lucan, Persius, Quintus Curtius, Pliny the Elder, [[Quintilian]], Statius, Juvenal.
*Eleventh century: Caesar, Sallust, Livy, Ovid, Tacitus, [[Apuleius]].
*Thirteenth century: [[Cornelius Nepos]], [[Propertius]], [[Varro]], "De lingua latina".

This list is incomplete. An author like Quintus Curtius is represented by numerous manuscripts in every century. Another, like Lucretius, was not copied anew between the ninth century and the Renaissance. Moreover, it was customary to compile manuscripts of epitomes and anthologies, some of which have preserved the only extant fragments of ancient authors. The teaching of grammar was deficient. This may account for the backwardness of philological science in the Middle Ages. Latin grammar is reduced to an abridgment of Donatius, supplemented by the meagre commentaries of the teacher, and replaced since the thirteenth century by the "Doctrinale" of Alexander de Villedieu (de Villa Dei).

The  '''Church of Saint Joseph the Worker''' (Alcamo) is a [[Catholic]] Church located in [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

== Historical hints ==
On 3 February 1944 the [[Bishop of Mazara]], monsignor Salvatore Ballo, gave the permit to build this church, and they start works on 22 January 1945.

Thanks to the priest Bartolomeo Palumbo, it was founded in 1946 on a piece of land given by a lady and built after the plan of Giuseppe Russo, an engineer; it already became a [[parish]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="gui"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-castellammare Golfo p.82, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, the parson, Father Palumbo, founded the male and female Congregation of saint Joseph the Worker;  every year, on the 23rd January, they celebrated the festivity of Saint Joseph’s  Marriage, by taking part to the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], during which the married couples were blessed. 
Later both the congregations joined  the parish Association of [[Azione Cattolica]].&lt;ref name="con"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.190, Alcamo, Campo, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 he founded the male and female Congregations of Maria Santissima di Fatima: the scope was that of  solemnizing the month of May and the feast of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] on May 13, moreover they had to take part to the Mass on the first Saturday each month. 
They also joined the Associations of Azione Cattolica later.&lt;ref name="con"/&gt;

Saint Joseph the Worker is celebrated on May 1, in the district of ''San Ciusippuzzu''. Besides religious ceremonies and the [[procession]], there are musical and theatrical shows and bike races.

== Father Palumbo ==
[[File:Funerale_nel_Corso_VI_Aprile,_Alcamo.jpg|thumb|Corteo funebre di Padre Palumbo]]
Father Palumbo was born in Alcamo on 29 August 1915 and became a priest in 1941; he soon had the office of  Vicar Cooperator in the parishes of the [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Church of the Saints Paul and Bartholomew]], [[Church of the Holy Crucifix (or Saint Francis of Paola)]] and [[Church of the Holy Souls in Purgatory (Alcamo)|Church of the Holy Souls in Purgatory]]. He was also nominated as honorary [[Canon (priest)]] of the [[collegiate church]] of the [[Mother church (Alcamo)|Mother church]].

On bare feet,  with a cross on his hands and a great number of believers, on 30 April 1944 he went towards the quarter of ''Balatelle'' (a suburb at that time) on the piece of land which had been donated to him by Mrs. Annunziata Macaluso, the widow of the chemist doctor Fazio,&lt;ref name=Regi&gt;Vincenzo Regina: La chiesa parrocchiale di San Giuseppe in Alcamo; Grafiche Campo, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; put down the cross there and, since then, every Sunday he celebrated the Holy Mass on a makeshift altar.&lt;ref name=Papa&gt;Tommaso Papaː Memorie storiche del clero di Alcamo; ediz.Accademia di studi Cielo d'Alcamo, Alcamo, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;   

Until he stayed in seminary he was a great devotee of Saint Joseph: during the night he got up, kneeled and recited the [[rosary]] in honour of him, this prayer in dialect, very interesting also from the symbolical point of view:

''Scura stasira agghiorna dumani ''

''la pruvvidenza m’aviti a mannari''.&lt;ref name="sbe"&gt;http://win.lasberla.com/Cultura-trapani/2225-comunicazione-evento--della-traslazione-salma-sac-bartolomeo-palumbo-#.&lt;/ref&gt;

(It was a prayer asking for Providence from the Saint).
He asked for saint Joseph’s protection both for his family and the Church, then he put his project on the Saint’s hands.
In 1947 he succeeded in completing the basement below the Church and start celebrating Mass there.[4]

With his zeal and faith, Father Palumbo succeeded in dragging all the district and citizens to contribute to the costs for completing  the building of the Church by any type of offerings, even in kind  (wheat, eggs, legumes, flour, etc.). He used all these things, however, to help a lot of people in need  too; there are so many stories about his great goodness.&lt;ref name="sbe"/&gt;
He succeeded  also in creating a parish community very united and open to charity.

With the bishop’s bull of May 3, 1947, the Church was elevated to a parish and the following day the [[Bishop of Mazara del Vallo]], His  Excellency Monsignor Ballo, gave  father Palumbo the canonical possession.&lt;ref name=Papa/&gt;    
Father Palumbo's mother, signora Vita Rocca, had donated her dowry for the legal recognition of the Parish, which was given with the Decree of the President of Republic on 10 June 1948.&lt;ref name=Regi/&gt;

On 30 May he died, leaving his parish community and the whole town in anguish for his  untimely end: there were thousands of people at his [[funeral]].

He was buried in the old cemetery ''Cappuccini'' in Alcamo and, after the approval by His Excellency Mons. Alessandro Plotti, on 22 October 2013, by  popular demand of believers, his mortal remains were moved to his Church.&lt;ref name="sbe"/&gt;

== Description and works ==
The façade is elegant and in [[Romanesque style]]; the interior is with one nave and a coffered ceiling.&lt;ref name="gui"/&gt;

There are these works: :

*Wooden statue of saint Joseph with the [[Infant Jesus]] in his arms made by Giuseppe Di Caro, a sculptor from Palermo, in 1952. The mantle of the saint is covered with pure gold, and their clothes with silver.&lt;ref name="gui"/&gt;
*An Angel trumpet player and the Angel musician: both chromium-plated by [[Gino Patti]], the [[surrealist painter]] from Alcamo,&lt;ref name=Regi/&gt; on the walls behind the high altar
*Wooden statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], right altar, realized by Giuseppe Stuflesser from [[Ortisei]] ([[Bolzano]]) in 1949
*Statue of [[Christ the King]], left altar, realized by Luigi Santifaller in 1954. Below it there is the [[sarcophagus]] with the mortal remains of the [[Reverend]] Father Palumbo.

'''Commercial art''' is the art of [[creative services]], referring to [[art]] created for [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes, primarily [[advertising]]. Commercial art uses a variety of platforms (magazines, websites, apps, television, etc.) for viewers with the intent of promoting sale and interest of products, services, and ideas.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/commercial_art.html|title=What is Commercial Art?|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on the iconic image (pictorial representations that are recognized easily to members of a culture) to enhance recall and favorable recognition for a product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/879527515|title=Persuasion and influence in American life|last=C.|first=Woodward, Gary|others=Denton, Robert E., Jr.|isbn=9781478607892|edition= Seventh |location=Long Grove, Illinois|oclc=879527515}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a product could be a magazine ad promoting a new soda through complimentary colors, a catchy message, and appealing illustrative features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/articles/Commercial_Art_Professions_Job_Description_and_Information_About_Starting_a_Career_as_a_Commercial_Artist_or_Commercial_Designer.html|title=Commercial Artist: Job Description &amp; Career Information|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example could be promoting the prevention of global warming by encouraging people to walk or ride a bike instead of driving in an eye catching poster. It communicates something specific to an audience.

People can obtain training, certifications, and degrees that incorporate commercial arts in many exercises, activities, and programs.

==Skills of Commercial Art==
Commercial artists have the ability to organize information and knowledge of [[fine art]]s, [[Mental image|visualization]] and media in a way to reach an audience's attention. Some of these skills may include the following:&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Attention to detail
* Ability to communicate effectively
* Experience or skills in the fine arts (drawing, painting, photography, etc.)
* Knowledgeable of certain computer software programs (graphics, editing, etc.) and ability to use them
* [[Marketing]] skills
* [[Advertising]] skills
* Coordination skills
* [[Animation]] skills

==Genres==
Commercial art can include many genres of art and categories of art technique, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplicable.com/new/types-of-commercial-art|title=11 Types Of Commercial Art|website=Simplicable|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Commercial character design]]
* [[Illustration]]
* [[Graphic design]]
* [[Industrial design]]
* [[Motion graphic design]]
* [[Photography]]
* [[Television commercials]]
* [[Music video]]s
* [[Animation]]
* [[Computer art]]
* [[Fashion designer]]
* [[Store art]]
* [[Decorative arts|Decorative]] 
* Ornamental

== [[Consumerism]] within Commercial Art ==
Commercial art is art that is created for commercial purposes to promote services, products, and ideas to viewers.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2" /&gt; In the process of creating commercial art, an audience is taken into consideration when designing and/or forming the goods that are being advertised/promoted. An example of this can be seen in the recognized works of American painter and consumer ad designer, [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-warhol-andy-artworks.htm#pnt_1|title=Andy Warhol Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell]]'s soup and [[Coca-Cola]] bottles as everyday products of consumers, he recreated a visually stimulating design through [[pop art]] that advertises the products through consumption habits of consumers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Consumerism]] was present when [[pop art]] was popular. Pop art could contain mass cultural objects and/or [[Celebrity|celebrities]] ([[popular culture]] and [[mass media]]) to endorse markets and goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-pop-art.htm|title=Pop Art Movement, Artists and Major Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13369">'''Design optimization''' is an engineering design '''methodology''' using a mathematical formulation of a design problem to support selection of the optimal design among many alternatives. Design optimization involves the following stages:&lt;ref name="pyp2017"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://principlesofoptimaldesign.org/|title=Principles of Optimal Design: Modeling and Computation|last=Papalambros|first=Panos Y.|last2=Wilde|first2=Douglass J.|date=2017-01-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781316867457|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Variable (mathematics)|Variables]]: Describe the design alternatives  
# Objective: Elected functional combination of variables (to be maximized or minimized)  
# Constraints: Combination of Variables expressed as equalities or inequalities that must be satisfied for any acceptable design alternative
# Feasibility: Values for set of variables that satisfies all constraints and minimizes/maximizes Objective.

== Design optimization problem ==
{{Main|Optimization problem}}
The formal mathematical ([[Canonical form|standard form]]) statement of the design optimization problem is &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|title=Convex Optimization|last=Boyd|first=Stephen|last2=Boyd|first2=Stephen P.|last3=California)|first3=Stephen (Stanford University Boyd|last4=Vandenberghe|first4=Lieven|last5=Angeles)|first5=Lieven (University of California Vandenberghe, Los|date=2004-03-08|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521833783|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;{\operatorname{minimize}}&amp; &amp; f(x) \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to}
&amp; &amp;h_i(x) = 0, \quad i = 1, \dots,m_1 \\ 
&amp;&amp;&amp;g_j(x) \leq 0, \quad j = 1,\dots,m_2 \\
&amp;\operatorname{and}
&amp; &amp;x \in X \subseteq R^n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of ''n'' real-valued design variables &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''objective function''' 
* &lt;math&gt;h_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt;'''equality constraints''' 
* &lt;math&gt;g_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; '''inequality constraints''' 
* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a set constraint that includes additional restrictions on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; besides those implied by the equality and inequality constraints.

The problem formulation stated above is a convention called the ''negative null form'', since all constraint function are expressed as equalities and negative inequalities with zero on the right-hand side. This convention is used so that numerical algorithms developed to solve design optimization problems can assume a standard expression of the mathematical problem.

We can introduce the vector-valued functions

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;&amp;&amp;{h = (h_1,h_2,\dots,h_{m1})}\\
\operatorname{and}\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;{g = (g_1, g_2,\dots, g_{m2})}
\end{align}

&lt;/math&gt; '' ''

to rewrite the above statement in the compact expression

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;{\operatorname{minimize}}&amp; &amp; f(x) \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to}
&amp; &amp;h(x) = 0,\quad g(x) \leq 0,\quad x \in X \subseteq R^n\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We call &lt;math&gt;h, g&lt;/math&gt; the ''set'' or ''system of'' (''functional'') ''constraints'' and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the ''set constraint''.

== Application ==
Design optimization applies the methods of [[mathematical optimization]] to design problem formulations and it is sometimes used interchangeably with the term [[engineering optimization]].  When the objective function ''f'' is a [[Vector-valued function|vector]] rather than a [[Scalar field|scalar]], the problem becomes a [[multi-objective optimization]] one. If the design optimization problem has more than one mathematical solutions the methods of [[global optimization]] are used to identified the global optimum.

* Problem Identification
* Initial Problem Statement
* Analysis Models
* Optimal Design Model
* Model Transformation
* Local Iterative Techniques
* Global Verification
* Final Review

A detailed and rigorous description of the stages and practical applications with examples can be found in the book [http://www.cambridge.org/gh/academic/subjects/engineering/control-systems-and-optimization/principles-optimal-design-modeling-and-computation-3rd-edition?format=HB&amp;isbn=9781107132672#C3r6r6aLRe2bUoef.97 Principles of Optimal Design].

Practical design optimization problems are typically solved numerically and many [[:Category:Mathematical optimization software|optimization software]] exist in academic and commercial forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=wy5hBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=design+optimization+with+matlab+achille+messac&amp;ots=n9WXaRte_T&amp;sig=DVBwayB-6W1b2YyruSz6O2fMKAM#v=onepage&amp;q=design%20optimization%20with%20matlab%20achille%20messac&amp;f=false|title=Optimization in Practice with MATLAB®: For Engineering Students and Professionals|last=Messac|first=Achille|date=2015-03-19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316381373|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several domain-specific applications of design optimization posing their own specific challenges in formulating and solving the resulting problems; these include, [[shape optimization]], [[wing-shape optimization]], [[topology optimization]], [[architectural design optimization]], [[Power optimization (EDA)|power optimization]].

'''East European Comic Con''' is a [[speculative fiction]] [[Fan convention]] held annually in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. It is East Europe's most important event dedicated to fans of comics, animations, video games, as well as TV series and movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comic Con - the largest comic salon in the world, arrives in Bucharest next year |author= |url=http://adevarul.ro/news/bucuresti/comic-con--mai-mare-salon-banda-desenata-lume-ajunge-bucuresti-anul-viitor-1_50cf146c596d7200910d3d5a/index.html |newspaper=Adevarul |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

Visitors are able to attend and take part in contests, video screenings and special sessions with movie and comics celebrities, as well as purchase products specific for this type of event.

The most well-known contests are the [[Cosplay]] costume contest and a Quiz contest. The Cosplay costume contest has participants performing a short play while wearing the costume of a character from a comic, video game, animation or movie, while they imitate the character's gestures and behaviors. The quiz contest is focused on [[anime]], [[manga]], TV series, comics and video games. An important part of the event is represented by the PC and console video game exhibitors and competitions. EECC is the largest gaming event in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The most important event for Comics fans - Comic Con - Bucharest |author= |url=http://www.mediafax.ro/life-inedit/cel-mai-important-eveniment-dedicat-pasionatilor-de-benzi-desenate-comic-con-la-bucuresti-10396311 |newspaper=Mediafax |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

East European Comic Con started in the spring of 2013. At its first edition, EECC successfully gathered more than 9,000 “geeks”. It opened the door to some fruitful partnerships and friendships. For two days, fans could participate in a Cosplay contest, LOL Contest, Quiz Contest or Illustration contest, and they could talk to artists or see a different side of their favorite actors. Victor Drujiniu – artist for DC Comics and Dark House, and Remus Brezeanu – the artist of The End of Times of Bram&amp;Ben, and Puiu Manu – one of the best Romanian comics artist, were some of the 22 artists present at EECC 2013.

'''Eau de toilette''' ({{IPA-fr|o d(ə) twalɛt|lang}}) literally translated as '''toilet water''' (but more appropriately described as "grooming water") is a lightly scented [[eau de cologne|cologne]] used as a skin freshener.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/toilet+water The Free Dictionary definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/thesaurus/british/rose-water/rose-water_3/Perfume MacMillan Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/toilet-water|title=Definition of "toilet water"|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|In this context, "toilette"/"toilet" has its older meaning of [[personal grooming]]; the name predates [[toilet|the modern sense of "toilet"]], which was originally [[euphemism|euphemistic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James|authorlink=James Murray (lexicographer)|title=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=1st|chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/oedxaarch#page/n119/mode/1up|volume=Vol.10 Part 1: Ti–U|year=1926|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=108|chapter=toilet ''sb.'' §§7,9b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is also referred to as '''"aromatic waters"''' and has a high alcohol content.&lt;ref&gt;Cristiani, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually applied directly to the skin after bathing or shaving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proz.com/kudoz/english/cosmetics_beauty/2455435-toilet_water.html toilet water term meaning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquebottles.com/poch/15.html Distinguishing Colognes, Perfumes, Scents, &amp; Toilet Waters]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally composed of alcohol and various [[volatile oils]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally these products were named after a principal ingredient; some being geranium water, lavender water, lilac water, violet water, spirit of myrcia and 'eau de Bretfeld'.&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, eau de toilette was sometimes referred to as "toilet water".&lt;ref&gt;Lawless, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern perfumery, the term eau de toilette is generally used to describe the concentration of fragrance, with eau de toilette being weaker than [[Perfume|Eau de Parfum]] and stronger than [[Eau de Cologne]].&lt;ref name="BS Lacey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lacey|first1=Miriam|title=Fragrance Defined: Parfum vs. EDP vs. EDT vs. Cologne|url=http://www.bellasugar.com/Eau-de-Toilette-Eau-de-Parfum-Parfum-What-Mean-19193129|website=bellsugar.com|publisher=Bell Sugar|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GL 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aug 8 2010|title=What is the difference between eau de parfum and eau de toilette in perfumes and colognes?|url=http://www.gildedlife.com/2010/08/what-is-the-difference-between-eau-de-parfum-and-eau-de-toilette-in-perfumes-and-colognes/|website=gildedlife.com|publisher=Gilded Life|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eau de toilette is a weaker concentration of fragrance than pure perfume.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fettner, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of aromatic ingredients is typically as follows (ascending concentration):
* Splash and After shave: 1–3% [[aromatic compound]]s
* [[Eau de Cologne]] (EdC): Citrus type perfumes with about 2–6% perfume concentrate aromatic compounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cologne|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125986/cologne|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eau de Toilette (EdT): 5–15% (typical ~10%) aromatic compounds
* Eau de Parfum (EdP), Parfum de Toilette (PdT): 10–20% (typical ~15%) aromatic compounds. Sometimes listed as "eau de perfume" or "millésime".
* Perfume extract (Extrait): 15–40% ([[International Fragrance Association|IFRA]]: typical 20%) aromatic compounds

Perfume oils are often diluted with a solvent, though this is not always the case, and its necessity is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water. Perfume has a mixture of about 10–20% perfume oils mixed with alcohol (acting as a diffusing agent delivering the fragrant odor) and a trace of water. Colognes have about 3–5% perfume oil mixed with 80–90% alcohol with about 5 to 15 percent water in the mix. Originally, [[eau de cologne]] was a mixture of citrus oils from such fruits as lemons, oranges, tangerines, limes, and grapefruits. These were combined with such substances as lavender and [[neroli]] (orange-flower oil). Toilet water has the least amount of perfume oil mixture among the three main liquid "perfumery" categories. It has only about 2 to 8 percent of some type of perfume oil and 60–80% alcohol dispersent with water making up the difference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/perfume perfume]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom329"&gt;Groom, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Toilet waters are a less concentrated form of these above types of alcohol-based perfumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/eau+de+toilette ''eau de toil'' definition from the online Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/toilet+water Thesaurus online dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally cologne is usually made of citrus oils and fragrances, while toilet waters are not limited to this specification.&lt;ref&gt;Grolier, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Consumer reports'', pp. 409–411&lt;/ref&gt;

== History   ==
In the fourteenth century Hungarian Eau de toilette, predecessor of [[eau de cologne]], was produced.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary|Queen Elisabeth of Hungary]] (1305–1380) had created a fragrant oil mix with alcohol that evaporated slowly on her skin.&lt;ref name="Sherrow125"/&gt; [[Hungary Water]] was the first toilet water developed.&lt;ref name="Stoddart154"/&gt; This toilet water was called "eau de la reine de hongrie", and was based on rosemary.&lt;ref name="HistoryofPerfume"&gt;[http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html The History of Perfume] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208043220/http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html |date=2015-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

King of France [[Louis XIV]] (1638–1715) used a concoction of scents called "heavenly water" to perfume his shirts; It consisted of [[Agarwood|aloewood]], [[musk]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange flower]], [[rose water]] and other [[spice]]s.&lt;ref name="Sherrow125"&gt;Sherrow, p. 125 ''King Louis XIV (1638–1715) had his shirts scented with toilet water that included aloewood, rosewood, orangle flower, musk, and spices. The concoction was called "heavenly water" ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Eau de toilette were once considered restorative skin toners with medical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Better Nutrition magazine, Nov 1999, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hiss, pp. 918–919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; The journal [[Medical Record (journal)|Medical Record]] reported in 1905 that a toilet water spray restores energies lost in business, social, and domestic situations.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bclNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=perfume+%22toilet+water%22+define&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mId1TJbbMIGclgfV1-zJBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=perfume%20%22toilet%20water%22%20define&amp;f=false Interstate druggist, Volume 7, page 333]&lt;/ref&gt; During the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries a type of toilet water called "plague waters" was supposed to drive away the [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref name="Stoddart154"&gt;Stoddart, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=58687 Dictionary of Traded Goods and Commodities, 1550–1820 by Nancy Cox and Karin Dannehl]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fuglse Church''' is a parish church located some {{convert|13| km|abbr=on}} south of [[Maribo]] on the Danish island of [[Lolland]]. The original [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church was almost totally rebuilt in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style in the late 16th century. Standing prominently on a hilltop, the red-plastered building has a tall spire roofed in [[Wood shingle|shingles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historiskatlas.dk/Fuglse_kirke_(5894) "Fuglse kirke"], ''Historisk Atlas''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 5 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=natmus&gt;[http://www.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Maribo_0715-0734_01.pdf Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, "Fuglse Kirke"], ''Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8'', 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 715-734. {{da icon}} Retrieved 5 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The medieval church was originally dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|St Lawrence]] but after it was rebuilt in 1595 it was dedicated to the [[Holy Trinity]]. After the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]] it was owned by the Crown until it was transferred to the prefect [[Henning Ulrich von Lützow]] in 1689 who gained ownership of nearby [[Søholt]] the following year. It later came into the ownership of Raben Huitfeld Levetzau til Kærstrup (1835) and then Baron Gottlob Rosenkrantz until it gained independence in 1916.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

==Architecture==
The old Romanesque church fell into such a bad state of repair that it was almost completely rebuilt by Henning Gøye til Kærstrup og Søholt in 1595. Now in the Renaissance style, the church consists of a [[chancel]], [[nave]] and tower, with burial chapels to the north and south. Unusually, the north chapel is three-sided. More recently, a small porch was built on the west side of the tower. The chancel, nave and chapels are built of roughly-hued fieldstone with some brick while the tower is in red brick.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

==Interior==
The Renaissance triptych [[altarpiece]] (1610), partly reconstructed from an earlier five-winged Late-Gothic work, contains a copy of [[Jacob Jordaens]]' ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' from 1618. The [[pulpit]] ({{circa|1600}}) bears copies of [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s carved figures of Peter, Paul and John which were added later. There are epitaphs to Henning Ulrich von Lützow and his two wives at the entrance to the burial chapel on the north side of the nave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gravstenogepitafier.dk/fuglse3.htm "Fuglse kirke, Lolland.

[[Image:GaleriadelaRaza.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Galería de la Raza, January 1, 2007]]'''Galería de la Raza''' ('''GDLR''') is a [[non-profit]] [[art gallery]] and [[artist collective]] that serves the heavily [[Latino]] population of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|Mission District]]. GDLR mounts exhibitions, hosts [[poetry reading]]s, workshops, and celebrations, sells works of art, and sponsors youth and [[artist-in-residence]] programs. Exhibitions mounted at the Galería tend to feature the work of [[ethnic minority|minority]] and [[developing country]] artists and concern issues of ethnic history, identity, and social justice.

==History==
The Galería was founded by [[Chicano Movement]] artists [[Ralph Maradiaga]], Rupert García, Peter Rodriguez, Francisco X. Camplis, Gustavo Ramos Rivera, [[Carlos Loarca]], Manuel Villamor, Robert Gonzalez, [[Luis Cervantes]], Chuy Campusano, Rolando Castellón, and [[René Yañez]] in 1970 as a place for [[Mexican American]] and other Latino artists to show their work. It developed into a [[community art]]s center that painted many murals, sponsored youth programs, and gained national and international recognition for its commitment to serving underrepresented communities.

&lt;!-- removed copyvio content --&gt;

In the mid-nineties the ReGeneration Project was started to facilitate the involvement of the next generation of artists. ReGeneration provides emerging artists with exhibition and professional development opportunities as well as opportunity to help plan and manage of Galería activities. One of the most visible contributions of the ReGeneration Project is the updating of the temporary murals on the Bryant Street billboard. Through the new Digital Mural Project computer-generated images are created and displayed in lieu of the traditional painted murals.

==Programs and exhibitions==
Throughout its history, GDLR has given workshops in [[filmmaking]], [[animation]], [[mural]]ism, [[digital art]], and sponsored [[artists-in-residence]]. Important exhibitions have included "Cartelones del Cine Mexicano", which exposed [[Chicano art]]ists to the styles and techniques of Mexican commercial lithographers, "The Peter Rodriguez Collection of Santos from the Mexican Museum", an exhibition of early [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] [[santo (art)|santo]]s, and  "Low 'n Slow", a [[lowrider]]-themed exhibit.

GDLR was also instrumental in reviving the [[indigenous Mexican]] tradition of [[Day of the Dead]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and in popularizing the work of the Mexican artists [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[José Guadalupe Posada]] among movement activists.

[[File:AdesteFidelesLilyPhil.png|thumb|350px|[[Homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices. {{audio|Lilypond-screenshot-adeste.mid|Play}}]]

A '''hymn tune''' is the [[melody]] of a [[musical composition]] to which a [[hymn]] text is sung. Musically speaking, a hymn is generally understood to have [[four-part harmony|four-part (or more) harmony]], a fast [[harmonic rhythm]] (chords change frequently), and no [[refrain]] or chorus.

From the late sixteenth century in England and Scotland, when most people were not musically literate and learned melodies [[Rote learning|by rote]], it was a common practice to sing a new text to a hymn tune the singers already knew which had a suitable [[meter (hymn)|meter]] and character.

There are many hymn tunes which might fit a particular hymn:  a hymn in [[Long Metre]] might be sung to any hymn tune in Long Metre, but the tunes might be as different as those tunes that have been used for centuries with hymns such as ''[[Te lucis ante terminum]]'', on one hand, and an arrangement of the [[Calypso music|calypso]] tune used with ''[[Jamaica Farewell]]'', on the other.

==Hymnal editors==

Editors bring extensive knowledge of [[theology]], [[poetry]], and [[music]] to the process of compiling a new hymnal.   They seek texts that are capable of communicating complex theological concepts to lay people, and they strive to partner those texts to tunes which are singable by the non-professional [[musician]]s of a [[wikt:congregation|congregation]].  "Ideally, a hymn is set out in clear, unambiguous language.  Although it deals with profound thoughts, a hymn states them so simply and directly that 'he who runs may read' and understand.  Simplicity, which is the servant of clarity, is the first characteristic of hymnic expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | location = Nashville, TN

 | page = 17.
 | ISBN = 0-8054-6809-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When editors choose a text for the planned collection, it may already be paired to a [[Melody|tune]] that supports its meaning, catches its spirit, and allows for congregational participation.  This pairing may be used elsewhere, even ecumenically recognized, appearing in many other hymnals.  However, if a hymn has been linked to a tune the editors think is not the best partner for it, they can arrange a new pairing.  Partnerships of texts and tunes can give special attention to the interpretive opportunities in a text by providing artistic support of the message through its musical setting.  Editors must consider whether the important words in the text fall on [[Stress (music)|stressed notes]], whether climax points in the ideas correspond with musical climaxes, and whether the [[tempo]] for the music matches the style of the text.

==Pairing texts to tunes ==

Often the author of a text has not composed a setting of that text or otherwise paired the text to a particular tune.  It then becomes the editor's challenge to complement that text with a tune for [[publication]].  Where the [[Meter (hymn)|meter]] of a text is regular, editors can choose an existing tune of the meter that fits the text.  Often there is more than just one good possible partner available.  The editors may marry a text "X" to a tune they feel is best, with which it appears on the hymnal page, and they may also suggest singing text "X" to an alternative tune that appears elsewhere in the hymnal (sometimes with a different text).  If one refers to the hymnal's [[metrical index]], more possible tunes may be found, of the same meter, which might be used for singing text "X".

In ''The Anatomy of Hymnody'', Austin C. Lovelace explores the relevance of the meter to a text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Lovelace
 | first = Austin C.
 | title = The Anatomy of Hymnody

 | year = 1965
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A meter of few [[syllable]]s, perhaps with a [[trochaic]] stress pattern, fits best an exhortive or forceful declamation of ideas.  A stirring, motivating text will fit this meter well.  Using a more lyrical meter suggests a more expansive or introspective treatment of ideas.  An author may have superb ideas but may have chosen a meter which exhorts when it should be expansive, or is solid when it should be [[Introspection|introspective]].  In such cases the editor is challenged to achieve an overall fit which doesn't distract from the message of the text.

Editorial skills are evident in the complex credits of some hymns.  For the well-loved and great hymn, "[[All Creatures of Our God and King]]", the words were written by [[William Henry Draper (hymnwriter)|William H. Draper]] and first published in 1919, based on a 13th-century text by [[Francis of Assisi]], with further adaptations made in 1987.  It is wedded to the tune ''[[Lasst uns erfreuen]]'',  first printed in the ''Geistliches Kirchengesangbuch'', dated 1623, and is presented with a harmonization by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], dated 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some texts become associated with several tunes.  For different reasons, some tunes set numerous texts. Tunes which are very singable and easy for a [[local church|congregation]] to pick up, and do not have musical demands which would interfere with understanding and assimilating the ideas of a text, can be used to set two or three texts in a hymnal, when the editors see that as advantageous.  ''Wareham'' LM, melody William Knapp (1698–1768), alt., harm. ''Hymns Ancient and Modern'', 1875, after [[James Turle]] (1802–1882), sets three texts in ''Hymnal 1982''.  It has supported more than 20 texts in various hymnals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming===
The practice of naming hymn tunes developed to help identify a particular tune.  The name was chosen by the compiler of the tune book or hymnal or by the composer. The majority of names have a connection with the composer and many are place names. Most [[hymnals]] provide a hymn tune index by name (alphabetical) and a hymn tune index by meter.

In some instances a particular text and tune have an almost exclusive partnership with each other, such as [[Reginald Heber]]'s text "[[Holy, Holy, Holy|Holy, Holy, Holy!]]" and [[John Bacchus Dykes]]'s tune ''Nicaea''.  In other instances a text may be used with a variety of tunes, such as "[[O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing]]" sung to any of ''Lyngham'', ''Oxford New'', ''Arden'', ''Lydia'', ''Richmond'', ''Azmon'', or ''University''.  In yet other instances a tune may partner several texts, such as ''Dix'' for "[[As with Gladness Men of Old]]", "[[Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies]]", "[[God of Mercy, God of Grace]]",  "[[Lord, to You Immortal Praise]]", and "[[For the Beauty of the Earth]]".

By contrast, in Germany and Scandinavia, tune names were not typically used even when a hymn tune was used for more than one text. The custom in such cases was to use part of the first line of the first text with which the tune was associated as a name for the tune: for example ''Lasst Uns Erfreuen'' ("Let us rejoice" / [[All Creatures of Our God and King]]), ''Gelobt Sei Gott'' ("[May] God be praised" / [[Gelobt sei Gott im höchsten Thron|Good Christian men, rejoice and sing]]) and ''Was lebet, was schwebet'' ([[O Worship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness]]). Renaming of tunes occurs from time to time, when a tune is chosen to be printed in a hymnal. When chorales were introduced in England during the eighteenth century, these tunes were sometimes given English-style tune names.

The Ravenscroft Psalter of 1621 was the first English book which specified, by name, which tune should set each text.  This followed the procedure used for the first time in the 1616 Scottish Psalter. In this early time of defining [[Hymns and hymn tunes|text/tune marriages]], editors of different psalters were apt to use different names for the same tune.  For example, ''The French Tune'', in the Scottish Psalter (1564), was the same tune as ''Dundee'' in the Ravenscroft Psalter.&lt;ref name="routley1980"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common practice nowadays is for the composer of  a tune to name it.

==Performance==

Typically, worship services in churches and synagogues include hymns which are sung by the congregation, accompanied by organ, or piano, and/or sometimes by guitars or other instruments. Details of performance vary depending on the designated style of the service, or by the hymns themselves. Some hymns specify unison singing, and other hymns are sung in parts (usually soprano, alto, tenor, bass). It is common practice for a congregation to sing all the hymns in unison, but in some traditions part singing is encouraged.

Sometimes, especially on longer texts, variety in the performance is introduced.  Varied performance practices may include:

* varied [[Harmony|harmonization]] for a stanza
* [[descant]] added by sopranos, above the melody
* "[[Fauxbourdon]]" with the melody sung by tenors, and the harmonies sung by the other parts
* a [[modulation]] (usually for the last stanza) into the next higher key

Other possibilities for varied performance can be invited through explanation either in the service bulletin or through verbal instruction by the pastor or the minister of music. Combining some or all of these and can add interest to singing while enhancing the sense of the text.  For example:

* a stanza sung only by the choir
* a stanza sung only by the congregation
* a stanza sung only by men
* a stanza sung only by women
* a stanza sung only by the left half of the sanctuary
* a stanza sung only by the right half of the sanctuary, etc.

Some hymn tunes lend themselves to being sung in canon.

==History==

===Origins===
The [[Book of Psalms]] has sometimes been called the first hymn book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladden|first=Washington|title=Who Wrote the Bible?|year=2007|publisher=Echo Library|isbn=978-1-4068-6208-9|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Binder|first1=Abraham Wolf|last2=Heskes|first2=Irene|title=Studies in Jewish music: collected writings of A.W. Binder|year=1971|publisher=Bloch Publishing Co.|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delitzsch|first=Franz|title=Biblical commentary on the Psalms, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFktAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1871|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some psalms are headed with instructions relating to their musical performance, music to which they were "married," even though no music is included with the texts. [[Psalter]]s contained [[Metrical psalter|metrical versifications of the psalms]]. Using a regular meter, authors would translate the psalms into the vernacular, and create versions which could be set to music for the people to sing.

[[St. Paul]] encourages Christians to "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord" ({{bibleverse|Col.|3:16|KJV}}), "[s]peaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord." ({{bibleverse|Eph.|5:19|KJV}}). In 313 AD, the [[Emperor Constantine]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]], which "... gave the Christians the right to practice religion openly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title=Compton's Encyclopedia
 | publisher=F. E. Compton Co.
 | location=Chicago
 | volume=5
 | year=1968
 | page=548
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time the language of the people was Latin. Use of Latin continued in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] long after it ceased to be the vernacular. By the time of [[Martin Luther]] in the early 16th century, the singing was still in Latin but was done by choirs of priests and monks, although the choirs sometimes included a few lay musicians as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=Christian Hymns (Audio Book)
 | at=Part 3, "Reformation Hymnody"
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hymnals evolved from psalters, in that hymns are songs for the congregation and choir to sing, but go beyond metrical recasting of only psalm texts. In early hymnals, only texts were printed. By the mid 18th century, hymnal editors began marrying particular tunes, by name, to individual texts. A century later, in the 1861 (first) edition of the English ''[[Hymns Ancient and Modern]]'', for the first time, the music was printed with its text on the hymnal page. Many marriages from that book became and remain ecumenically endorsed, including those where a tune was composed and appeared in print for the first time in that 1861 edition. [[Reginald Heber|Heber]]'s text, "[[Holy, Holy, Holy]]" had first appeared in ''Selection of Psalms and Hymns for the Parish Church of Banbury'', 3rd edition, 1826. ''Nicaea'' (1861) was written by [[J. B. Dykes]] to set it "for the first edition of ''Hymns A &amp; M''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===The Reformation===

As part of his efforts at reform, after Martin Luther prepared a version of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in Latin, he prepared [[Deutsche Messe|a version in German]], adapting parts of the liturgical texts of the Mass as [[chorale]]s in the vernacular which could be sung and understood by the congregation. Luther arranged the music for some of these by adapting the music of existing [[plainsong]] melodies; he set other texts to newly composed tunes composed by others, or by himself. An example of the latter is the tune he composed for his German paraphrase of [[Psalm 46]], "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" ("[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]"). [[Nicholas Temperley]] wrote in ''The Hymn Tune Index'' that Luther "wished his congregations to take part in the singing, but
in general they failed to do so" and "It was the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], or 'Reformed', branches of Protestantism
that succeeded in establishing congregation hymn singing in worship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Luther (1483–1546) posted his theses against Roman Church practices, particularly "indulgences", in 1517, which signalled the start of the Reformation, "...but six or seven years passed after the inception of his Reformation before he gave his thought to hymns.... Luther wished to refine the worship of the Church by excluding what he thought were needless complications while retaining, through the use of music, the essential spirit of Christian devotion as enshrined in the church's tradition.... The year 1524 saw the first official Luther hymnals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Luther wanted the congregation to participate in singing, with German texts sung to tunes straightforward enough for ordinary people to sing. "Luther himself wrote many new religious texts to be used with well-known German folk songs. ''Vom Himmel hoch'' is one of these."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Luther was a gifted and well-trained musician. He composed and found hymn tunes which were accessible for ordinary people to sing, and "... at the same time he encouraged church choirs to continue the tradition of polyphonic motets within the Lutheran Mass. He used various textures and styles of music in ways which were most appropriate and effective for each."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Doran
 | title=The Hymnal 1982 Companion
 | page=21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Luther also adapted the music of existing plainsong melodies as hymn tunes. Families enjoyed singing hymns in parts in their homes, for the family's enjoyment and edification, but unison singing was the custom in church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | at=Section 3: the Age of Luther
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformed Church and the (French) [[Genevan Psalter]] were the result of work by [[John Calvin]] (1509–1564). His profound reverence for the biblical text "...caused him to insist that public praise in church should be confined to the language of the Bible, adapted to the minimum extent required for congregational singing. He was "... the architect of the tradition of metrical psalmody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | page=28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Calvin heard Lutheran hymn singing while he served Minister of the Reformed Church of Strasbourg (1538–41). In fact, Routley says, "[M]etrical psalmody was really born [in Strasbourg] rather than in Geneva."&lt;ref name="routleyp29"&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | page=29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Clement Marot (c. 1497–1544) was a French Court poet in Strassbourg, who had begun setting psalms in metrical versions before Calvin met him. Although Marot remained a Catholic, Calvin included Marot's psalm versions in the Psalter. The first Genevan Psalter, 1542, contained six psalms by Calvin and 30 by Marot.&lt;ref name="routleyp29"/&gt;
The Genevan Psalter of 1562 contained all 150 psalms, and included the works of Calvin's successor, Theodore de Beza (1509–1565).

Calvin did not approve of free religious texts (hymns) for use in church; the Bible was the only source of texts he approved ([[exclusive psalmody]]). Calvin endorsed only singing of metrical psalm texts, only in unison, only ''a cappella'', with no harmonization and no accompanying instruments of any kind. Tunes for the metrical psalm versions came from several men, including Louis Bourgeois (c. 1501 – c. 1561), and Claude Goudemil (c. 1525–1572). There were 110 different meters used for the texts in Calvin's Psalter, and 125 different tunes to set them. The music was very difficult; the long tunes were hard for ordinary people to grasp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | at=Section 5, The Psalmody of Calvin's Geneva
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But later adaptations (and simplifications) of these tunes have added to current day hymn tunes repertoire.

===English hymnody===
The earliest English [[psalter]]s included a few tunes in regular meters, which could be used to sing all the psalms in the psalter. Which tune was sung was determined by the fit of the meter. The ''[[Ravenscroft Psalter]]'' of 1621 was the first English book which "married," specified by name, which tune should set each text.&lt;ref name="routley1980"/&gt;
In that early time of defining text/tune marriages, editors of different psalters sometimes used different names for the same tune. For example, ''The French Tune'', in the ''[[Scottish Psalter]]'' (1564), is the same tune as ''Dundee'' in the ''Ravenscroft Psalter''.

Routley states that metrical psalmody was actually the first English Protestant hymnody. [[English Reformation|England's Reformation]] began when King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] separated the English church from the Catholic Church in Rome in 1532. King Henry's heir was King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], who ascended to the throne in 1547. Thomas Sternhold (d. 1549), Groom of the Royal Wardrobe at the end of Henry VIII's reign and during Edward VI's, "...began metricizing psalms for the edification of the young new king (ten years old when he came to the throne in 1547: sixteen when he died in 1553)." Sternhold's work paralleled Marot's efforts in the French Court; Sternhold's "...strong puritan strain moved him to replace with sacred songs the trivial secular music that was the Court's normal entertainment; this led him to versify certain Psalms in the ballad metre that would enable them to be sung to tunes already known." (''Forest Green'', ''Kingsfold'', etc.). The ballad meter, "which Sternhold used very nearly without variation," had 4 iambic lines of 14 syllables, which breaks down to 8686 8686 (our Double Common Meter DCM or CMD). Also, a simpler "half length" tune evolved, now described as common meter (CM = 8686). The English aimed at a Psalter of all 150 psalms, virtually all in ballad meter. Sternhold started the task, writing a total of 37 by the time he died, when John Hopkins took over the work. .... In the year of [Sternhold's] death, a little book without music containing 44 psalms was published, of which 36 were by Sternhold and eight by his collaborator John Hopkins (d. 1570).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | page=35
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress on the Psalter was interrupted when King Edward died in 1553, and his elder half sister [[Mary I of England|Mary]] ("Bloody Mary") became queen. She tried to reinstate Catholicism as the State religion. Churchmen whose lives were threatened fled to the Continent, some ending up in Geneva, where they encountered the 1551 Genevan Psalter and the congregational singing which it supported. When Elizabeth I ascended the throne after her sister's death in 1558, the exiled churchmen returned to England, bringing them an Anglo-Genevan Psalter containing all the psalms plus a few tunes to set them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | pages=36–37
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
along with their desire to add congregational singing to church services. At that point work continued with the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter, adding psalms to it from the Anglo-Genevan Psalter. The Complete Psalter was published in 1562 by John Daye. "It is at this point important to remember that all these versions of the Psalter, up to and including 1562, were published for private use. There was not, by 1562, strictly a 'Church of England' that could authorize the use of it in church." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | page=38
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The question of "authorization" of the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter for use in church services is discussed at length in John Julian's ''Dictionary of Hymnology''; actually, the psalter was used in church whether it was ever officially authorized or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"Few books have had so long a career of influence. With the growing Puritanism psalm-singing came to be esteemed the most divine part of God's public service." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Later developments===

Books did not print the music with hymns in hymnals, until the middle 19th century. Tunes were printed separately in tune books. Some of those printed in America in the 19th century (for example, Lowell Mason's, or George Root's) use four staff systems. The tune name, but no composer credit, appears above each tune. The melody of the tune appears in the tenor (fauxbourdon), often with the first stanza words, printed above the tenor staff.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

During the decade 1791–1800, more than 8,000 hymn tunes were printed in [[Great Britain]] and between 7,000 and 8,000 were printed in the United States; during the decade 1801–1810, about 11,000 hymn tunes were printed in Great Britain, while more than 15,000 were printed in the United States. The total number of hymn tunes published with English-language texts in publications from 1535 up to and including 1820 is recorded as 159,123.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Many early hymnals were published in editions which contained only texts. The early [[Methodism|Methodist movement]] provides an example. The co-founders, [[John Wesley]] and his brother [[Charles Wesley]], published several text-only collections, culminating in ''A Collection of Hymns, for the Use of the People Called Methodists'', in 1780. John Wesley published [[tune book]]s separately, culminating in ''Sacred Harmony'', in 1780. In 1786, with the fifth edition of the text-only ''Collection,'' Wesley indicated at the head of each hymn the tune to which he intended it to be sung. Among the tunes in ''Sacred Harmony'' that are still in use are ''Derby'', ''Helmsley'', and ''Savannah''. Accompanists to hymn singing had a tune book, a volume which a collection of tunes, most without words, the exception being the occasional lyric when underlay of words to the music was ambiguous. An example of this was ''The Bristol Tune Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Alfred|year=1891|title=The Bristol Tune Book|edition=Third|location=London, UK, New York, NY|publisher=Novello, Ewer &amp; Co.|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more people became musically literate, it became more common to print the melody, or both melody and harmony in hymnals. Contemporary practice in the U.S. and Canada is to print hymn tunes so that lyrics underlie the music; the more common practice in the UK is to print the hymn tunes on one page, and the hymn text either below, or on facing pages.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Among twentieth-century developments was the publishing of ''The [[English Hymnal]]'' in 1906 under the music editorship of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. More recently, ethnic hymns and tunes have been included, descants have been added for some hymns, freer song-like styles have been accepted, and accompaniments by guitar and/or other instruments have been notated.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10530">The '''Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) Singapore''' is the curatorial division of [[LASALLE College of the Arts]], dedicated to supporting innovative and emerging creative practices. Focusing on [[art]] and [[design]] from the present, it provides an active site for contemporary [[culture]] in [[Singapore]]. It comprises five galleries that span a total of 1,500 square metres, one of the largest spaces devoted to contemporary art in Singapore. It engages local and international audiences in critical viewing and discussion through a diverse programme of exhibitions, projects, publications and events.

The ICA Singapore provides a cultural and educational tool for students and the wider public to advance their knowledge and appreciation of the contemporary local, regional and international arts.

==History==
The Dr Earl Lu Gallery was established by LASALLE College of the Arts in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yap|first1=June|title=A Brief History of the Singapore Visual Arts Scene|journal=Singapore's Visual Artists|date=2016|volume=Singapore: National Arts Council.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of a major contribution of artworks by [[philanthropist]] and artist Dr [[Earl Lu]], it presented exhibitions of traditional and contemporary arts, often with a focus on practices from [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yap|first1=June|title=A Brief History of the Singapore Visual Arts Scene|journal=Singapore's Visual Artists|date=2016|volume=Singapore: National Arts Council.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 to 2004, under the directorship of Binghui Huangfu, the gallery worked closely with LASALLE’s Contemporary Asian Art Centre, a research facility directed by T.K. Sabapathy that sought to advance knowledge and collaboration between artists across Asia through dialogue, research and publications. In 2004, Dr Earl Lu Gallery was renamed the '''Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore''' and repositioned as a centre of Singapore and international contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Eugene|title=Art in Singapore and the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore|journal=Perspectives|date=July 2007|volume=Hong Kong: Asia Art Archive|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/31|accessdate=18 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128050814/http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/31|archivedate=28 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the institute moved along with LASALLE College of the Arts from the Goodman Road campus to a new campus on McNally Street, where it is based today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LASALLE College of the Arts|url=http://www.mimoa.eu/projects/Singapore/Singapore/LASALLE%20college%20of%20the%20arts/?abvar3|website=Mimoa: Mi Modern Architecture|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

In February 2016, two items that were part of the group show "Fault-lines: Disparate and desperate intimacies" were removed from artist [[Loo Zihan]]'s installation "Queer objects: An archive for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Jian Xuan|last = Lee|authorlink = |coauthors = |title = Sex objects removed from art show|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/sex-objects-removed-from-art-show|work = The Straits Times|date = 16 February 2016|accessdate = 16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action was agreed after discussion between ICA Singapore staff, curator Wong Binghao, and Loo Zihan, and was due to the nature of the objects, which could potentially be considered offensive to some members of the public. The items were a penis sheath and a butt plug. The ICA Singapore, curator and artist emphasised that the decision was taken to make the exhibition accessible to all, including students of the LASALLE College of the Arts, half of whom are under 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Facebook|url = http://www.facebook.com/ICASgalleries/notifications/?section=activity_feed&amp;subsection=mention&amp;target_story=S%3A_I100000600513049%3A1228728023823870|website = www.facebook.com|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rete ferroviaria Libia Italiana.png|thumb|right|The five railways in Italian Libya.]]

'''Italian Libya Railways''' was a group of small railways built in the [[History of Libya as Italian colony|Italian colony of Libya]] between the two World Wars.

==History==
The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] built in [[Italian Libya]] nearly 400&amp;nbsp;km of railways with {{track gauge|950mm|lk=on|al=on}} gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orsomax.com/OEA/OEAvillaggi3.htm |title=Orsomax OEA villaggi |publisher=Orsomax.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The Italian authorities decided to give priority to the construction of [[road]]s in Libya when [[Benito Mussolini]] took control of the Italian colonies. After 1926 no more railways were made in Libya, but during [[World War II]] the need of railways transport to the front during the war in the frontier with [[History of Egypt under the British|British Egypt]] changed this approach.

In spring 1941 the Italian government started the construction of a new railway between Tripoli and [[Benghazi]], but by the end of 1942 all was stopped because of the Italian defeat in north Africa: only 18&amp;nbsp;km were done in Cirenaica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gips.unisi.it/files/wp18.pdf Le ferrovie coloniali italiane in Libia (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722063813/http://www.gips.unisi.it/files/wp18.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
In Libya the first locomotives were the [[steam locomotives]] R.401 and R.301, but the most successful were the R.302 produced in [[northern Italy]].

==Railways==
There were only five small railways:

1) Tripoli-Zuara (118&amp;nbsp;km):

The '''LGBTQ and Leather Cultural District''' is a cultural district in [[San Francisco]]'s [[South of Market, San Francisco|South of Market]] (SOMA) neighborhood commemorating the history and culture of the [[leather subculture]] active in the area for approximately half a century. The [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] established the district in June, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabatini |first=Joshua |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-expands-cultural-districts-include-somas-gay-leather-community/ |title=SF expands cultural districts to include SoMa’s gay and leather community - by j_sabatini - May 1, 2018 - The San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |date=2018 |accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ribbon cutting was held outside [[The Stud (bar)|The Stud]] on 9th St., the city's oldest gay bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/06/21/leather-community-celebrates-designated-district-at-this-years-sf-pride/ |title=Leather Community Celebrates Designated District At This Year’s SF Pride « CBS San Francisco |publisher=Sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com |date=2018-05-24 |accessdate=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabatini |first=Joshua |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-expands-cultural-districts-include-somas-gay-leather-community/ |title=SF expands cultural districts to include SoMa’s gay and leather community - by j_sabatini - May 1, 2018 - The San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |date=2018-05-01 |accessdate=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is bounded approximately by Howard St. on the northwest, 7th St. on the northeast, I-80 on the east and US 101 on the south. There is also an exclave between 5th and 6th streets, Harrison and Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by AdminSFLD |url=http://leatheralliance.org/sfleatherdistrict/2018/05/30/map-of-district/ |title=Map of District – Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District |publisher=Leatheralliance.org |date=2018-05-30 |accessdate=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the [[San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley]], which opened in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/ringold-alleys-leather-memoir.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paull |first=Laura |url=https://www.jweekly.com/2018/06/21/honoring-gay-leather-culture-with-art-installation-in-soma-alleyway/ |title=Honoring gay leather culture with art installation in SoMa alleyway – J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the district is to "honor and commemorate the people, places and institutions that gave South of Market its distinctive culture and appeal, and would also help protect the remaining businesses and spaces, and sustain the people who live, work and recreate there."&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-10kqxOWKt0tnx6fgnZRD3Kk0T7yJF4kbnu4BxFDNM/ "Introduction to the Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District Project", Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District Project, June 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy''''' ({{lang-fr|L'Espion Turc}}) is an eight-volume collection of fictional letters claiming to have been written by an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] spy named "Mahmut",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2007/01/25/stuart/|title=Herbivore vs. carnivore|first=Laura|last=Miller|date=2007-01-25|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the French court of [[Louis XIV]].

==Authorship and publication==
[[File:Giovanni-Paolo-Marana-Espion-turc MG 9430.tif|thumb|Tome 4. Portrait of Mahomet "The impostor"]]

It is agreed that the first volume of this work was written by [[Giovanni Paolo Marana]] (1642-1693), a [[Genoa|Genoese]] political refugee to the French court of [[Louis XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, ''A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture'', page 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ballaster207"&gt;Rosalind Ballaster, 2005, ''Fables of the East: selected tales, 1662-1785'',  page 207&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume (102 letters) was published in several parts between 1684 and 1686 in both Italian and in a French translation.&lt;ref name="Betts"&gt;C. J. Betts, 1984, ''Early deism in France'', pages 97-8&lt;/ref&gt; They were translated by [[William Bradshaw (writer)|William Bradshaw]] into English in 1687 under the supervision of [[Robert Midgley]] who owned the copyright of the work.&lt;ref name="Ballaster207"/&gt; The remaining seven volumes appeared first in English between 1691 and 1694, prefaced with a letter claiming that they were translated from a discovered Italian manuscript.&lt;ref name="Ballaster207"/&gt; A French edition of the last seven volumes (with the first) was published in 1696-7 and asserting that it was a translation from the English.&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"&gt;Rosalind Ballaster, 2005, ''Fables of the East: selected tales, 1662-1785'', page 208&lt;/ref&gt; The eight volumes contain 644 letters.&lt;ref name="Betts"/&gt;

There has long been a controversy as to the authorship of the volumes subsequent to Marana's first. They have been attributed to many writers, most notably Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw who produced the English translation.&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Backscheider58"&gt;Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, ''A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture'', page 58&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the similarities between the letters, and the stylistic coherence of the whole series, the likeliest author is Marana himself.&lt;ref name="Betts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosalind Ballaster 2005, page 145"&gt;Rosalind Ballaster, 2005, ''Fabulous orients: fictions of the East in England, 1662-1785'', page 145&lt;/ref&gt; Marana may have had difficulty in getting the later volumes published in France and turned to England to secure their continuing appearance.&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"/&gt;

The work was popular throughout the 18th century and went through fifteen complete editions by 1801.&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"/&gt; [[Daniel Defoe]] was attracted to the deist rationalist sympathies of the purported spy; his ''Continuation of Turkish Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy in Paris'' (1718) extended the narrator's account from 1687 to 1693.&lt;ref name="Rosalind Ballaster 2005, page 145"/&gt;

==Content==
The volumes contain fictional letters written by one "Mahmut the Arabian."&lt;ref&gt;Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, ''A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture'', page 56&lt;/ref&gt; The letters cover the period of 1637 to 1682 in France, from the last years of the Regency of [[Anne of Austria]] and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] through the long reign of Louis XIV and his minister [[Cardinal Mazarin]].&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"/&gt; The Letters form a rambling journal of gossip on current politics and satire on society.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Pike Conant, 2009, ''The Oriental Tale in England in the Eighteenth Century'', page 158&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmut sends reports from [[Paris]] to [[Constantinople]] on politics and current events in France, but corresponds privately on other subjects including religion, and adds stories and anecdotes for diversion.&lt;ref name="Betts"/&gt; His observations range from those on political figures such as Richelieu and Mazarin to speculations on the status of women, advice about state policy, and major interventions in controversies about religious doctrine and their consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, ''A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture'', page 61&lt;/ref&gt; His political position in the letters changes from that of liberal [[Catholic]] to that of a rationalistic [[Deism|Deist]].&lt;ref name="Backscheider58"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18939">[[File:Hüfthose.jpg|thumb|right|A woman wearing a [[cropped top]] that bares the midriff]]In [[fashion]], the '''midriff''' is the human [[abdomen]]. The midriff is exposed when wearing a [[crop top]] or some forms of swimwear. The [[choli]]s worn by [[India]]n women exposes a thin section of midriff, usually 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vimla Menon|title=The modest saree has come full circle|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/columns/article315759.ece|accessdate=15 May 2015|publisher=The Indian Express|date=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
"Midriff" is an old term in the English language, coming into use before 1000 AD.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Midriff "Midriff", Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In Old English it was written as "midhrif", with the old word "hrif" literally meaning stomach;&lt;ref name="etymology"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=midriff "Midriff, the Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; in Middle English it was "mydryf".&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt; The word fell into obsolescence after the 18th century.

The word was revived in 1941 by the fashion industry,&lt;ref name="etymology" /&gt; partly to avoid use of the word "belly" which genteel women considered undesirable in reference to their bodies, as it has connotations of [[obesity]]. ("Belly" was a word which was forbidden to be used in films by the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Office]] censors. In the 1933 film ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', for instance, in the song ''[[Shuffle Off to Buffalo]]'', [[Una Merkel]] is about to sing the lyric "with a shotgun at her belly", but stops after the "B" of "belly" and sings "tummy" instead.)

== Culture and history ==

=== Western culture ===

==== 1930s–1970s ====
[[File:Young women of Naples in swimsuit, Italy 1948.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 1948 photo of [[Italians|Italian]] women in midriff-baring bikinis.]]In some cultures, exposure of the midriff is socially discouraged or even banned, and the [[Western culture]] has historically been hesitant in the use of midriff-baring styles. [[Bill Blass]] commented, "It is too difficult. Women will much more readily wear bare-back or plunging-neckline styles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BERNADINE MORRIS|title=Baring Midriffs: A Little, a Lot or Not?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/30/news/baring-midriffs-a-little-a-lot-or-not.html|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 30, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced to fashion in 1932 by [[Madeleine Vionnet]] when she offered an evening gown with strategically cut openings at the waist. Women's [[swimwear]] of  the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured similar designs of midriff-baring suits and tops. However, midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public.&lt;ref name="girl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh|title=Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide Volume 1 of Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 9780313339097|page=702|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=cheerleader+midriff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_wyAT--XCoTprQeL5NTrBQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=midriff&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, exposure of the female midriff and [[navel]] was widely brought into everyday Western women's fashion in the 1960s' [[sexual revolution]] and later with the popularity of [[Halterneck|halter]]s, [[tube top]]s and [[crop top]]s in the 1970s. The [[cheerleading]] style fashions developing largely from the styles originating with the [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]] in the early 1970s also played a crucial role for the popularity of midriff fashion at middle and high schools.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tim Delaney, Tim Madigan|title=Sports: Why People Love Them!|year=2009|publisher=University Press of America|isbn= 9780761844891|page=248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_leJMTGB3OoC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=cheerleader+midriff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_wyAT--XCoTprQeL5NTrBQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=midriff&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1980s–1990s ====
During the 1980s, pop star [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] appeared in bare midriff looks in her performances and music videos, which helped in spreading this fashion widely.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Julia Baird|title=What happened to Madonna|url=http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/what-happened-to-madonna-20120330-1w2s0.html|accessdate=8 April 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the bare midriff continued well due to [[Low-rise (fashion)|low-rise]] fashion which started in the early 1990s when the British magazine ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' in its March 1993 issue cover featured [[Kate Moss]] in [[low-rise jeans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ziUAAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=New+York+Magazine%E2%80%8E+Navel&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Navel Mauvers |work=New York Magazine |date=10 May 1993 |page=26 |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the wide acceptance of navel display in Western societies, [[navel piercing]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hRHUOxramGEC&amp;dq=navel+ring+saree&amp;q=navel#v=snippet&amp;q=navel&amp;f=false Designing Clothes - Culture and Organization of the Fashion Industry - Veronica Manlow]&lt;/ref&gt; and navel [[tattoos]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=if6_kBbJlCcC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=drew+barrymore+navel+tattoo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1PVtTs7zJYHegQeBwY2tAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=navel&amp;f=false Rhetorics of display - Lawrence J.

One way of showing the midriff that has proved popular with designers is simply fastening a jacket or vest at the neckline and letting it fall freely. When the wearer moves there is a flash of skin, but nothing startling. Fashion designer [[Carolina Herrera (fashion designer)|Carolina Herrera]] told, "''the midriff doesn't have to be completely bare; a veil of chiffon over the midriff can look intriguing.''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BERNADINE MORRIS|title=Boldly or Demurely, The Midriff Bares Itself|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/15/news/boldly-or-demurely-the-midriff-bares-itself.html?src=pm|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 15, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In US schools ===
Beginning in the late 1940s, school dress codes in the [[United States]] started to ban bare midriffs.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt; Even today, many American [[secondary school]]s have dress codes dating back to the 1970s against attire that leaves the midriff exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erin Shannon and Justin Graeber|title=VIDEO: School dress codes being tested by warm weather|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/bridgewater/news/x586822468/VIDEO-School-dress-codes-being-tested-by-warm-weather#axzz1rTDd9gK4|work=GateHouse News Service|publisher=Wicked Local|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a test that some schools apply is to have the student raise her arms if it is suspected that her shirt will expose her midriff. Although more tolerated with younger girls, older female students, especially those over 18 years of age, can be disciplined for exposing their navels on school campuses. As an example, the dress code of the [[Sherman Independent School District]] in Texas requires that "there must be no exposure of the midriff area or undergarments. The midriff area must not be seen while bending over, while standing, raising arms, and stretching."&lt;ref name="sherman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntxe-news.com/artman/publish/article_48025.shtml |title=Sherman Hih School Dress Code}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, East Valley High School in [[Spokane Valley, Washington]] specified guidelines about inappropriate clothing in the school's student planner and handbook which includes "clothing that reveals the midriff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Virginia deLeon|title=Some schools draw the line below navel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mWVWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jfIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5403,3078187&amp;dq=navel+sexual&amp;hl=en|accessdate=12 April 2012|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=Sep 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Board of Education of [[Meriden, Connecticut]], brought a dress code that banned shirts, blouses that expose the top of the shoulders, [[haltertop]]s, [[Spaghetti strap|spaghetti tops]], and any clothing that exposed the waist, midriff or hips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin J.

[[File:Ameesha Patel still4.jpg|thumb|Indian actress [[Amisha Patel]] posing in a [[Gagra choli]] that bares the midriff]]
Indian women have traditionally worn [[sari]]s that bare the midriff, especially [[South India]]n women.&lt;ref name= Roshan&gt;Alkazi, Roshan (1983) "Ancient Indian costume", Art Heritage;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Ghurye&gt;Ghurye (1951) "Indian costume", Popular book depot (Bombay)&lt;/ref&gt; The gap on the midriff between sari and the choli presented the elegance of a woman’s graceful sway of her [[Gait (human)|gait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D K Havanoor|title=The endangered sari|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/235022/endangered-sari.html|accessdate=18 March 2012|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible cultural justification is that in ancient Indian tradition, the navel of the God Vishnu the Protector is considered to be the center of the universe and the source of life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=doQLZ21CGScC&amp;dq=indian+sculpture+Navel&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Principles of composition in Hindu sculpture: cave temple period - Alice Boner].&lt;/ref&gt; From his navel a new world of the future emerges. This has been depicted in many ancient Indian sculptures as a lotus emerging from the navel on which God Brahma the Creator is seated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=clUmKaWRFTkC&amp;dq=indian+sculpture+Navel&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700 - Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Pratapaditya Pal].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fvKVDxcJoUC&amp;vq=Navel&amp;dq=natya+shastra+Navel&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Indian Sculpture: 700-1800 - Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Pratapaditya Pal].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this the midriff is set to be left bare in a sari. Another reason could be the hot [[tropical]] climate of India. Rathi Vinay Jha, director general of the Fashion Design Council of India told, "''The bare midriff keeps you cool''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't tell Liz, but the sari's so out|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/24/clothes.india|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sari adapts to a woman's body, rather than defining it, allowing for pregnancy and otherwise expanding girth. And in a culture where having enough to eat is not a given, rolls of fat around the midriff are a sign of prestige, rather than indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suzy Menkes|title=RUNWAYS; Naked Came The Midriff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/style/runways-naked-came-the-midriff.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 29, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr.Torsekar, a [[paediatrician]] from India who works in [[Toledo, Ohio]], once told, "''It maybe hard for American women to imagine going to work with an exposed midriff, but for Indian women, the midriff is considered no more suggestive than the forearm.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tahree Lane|title=Sari|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=80BPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lgMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6996,1885944&amp;dq=sari+choli&amp;hl=en|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=Mar 22, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Indian communities that take midriff in their stride include the women from Rajasthan who leave the midriff exposed while wearing [[Gagra choli|Ghagra Cholis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W7c8TBQhoAIC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=lehenga+saree&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=J1VjTvuNEZTUgAfvvuGsCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Social Science a Textbook in History for Class IX as per New Syllabus - FK Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; However, these women often cover their heads with a [[Dupatta]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lsai4v554d8C&amp;dq=lehenga+saree&amp;q=lehenga#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false India - R.I.C. Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; and even cover their faces in front of strangers, which enforces the belief that midriff-baring in India has a symbolic, almost mystical, association with birth and life and that the display is meant to emphasise the centrality of nature in the nurture role.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;Beck, Brenda. (1976) The Symbolic Merger of Body, Space, and Cosmos in Hindu Tamil Nadu. Contributions to Indian Sociology 10(2): 213-43.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of it, some Indian philosophers gave opposition to exposing midriff in saris. They considered it to be a symbol of adultery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=Ci7KTfzgD823tgeLgZ3fBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=eFoOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=fashion+expose+saree&amp;q=midriff#search_anchor Sarvajna: the omniscient poet of Karnataka - Basavaraj Naikar].&lt;/ref&gt; The only ornament accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the midriff region are the [[waist chain]]s. They are considered to be a part of bridal [[jewellery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FOoCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=waist+chain+sari&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=975uTo-dD9PG0AHD4MWACg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sari%20chains&amp;f=false Indianapolis Monthly - Jun 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to modern fashion trends, along with saris, the midriff-revealing ghaghra cholis are also popular. Designer [[Manish Malhotra]]'s Fashion Week collections regularly highlight low [[Waistline (clothing)|waisted]] ghaghras accompanied by short cholis. Such ghagra cholis are more commonly worn by the [[Bollywood]] celebrities in films as well as in real life. For example, actress [[Malaika Arora Khan]] featured in midriff revealing ghagra choli without dupatta for the hit songs "[[Chaiyya Chaiyya]]" in [[Dil Se..]] (1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bollywood-actress-showing-navel/1/140291.html Top 10 Navels in Cinema - India Today]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Munni Badnam" in [[Dabangg]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bollywood-deepika-padukone-katrina-navel-look-is-new-cleavage-for-sexy-indian-women-and-re-emergence-of-sari/1/140273.html Rise of the Navel 'Bollywood navel fashion has led to re-emergence of sari' - India Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] a '''mortuary house''' is any purpose-built structure, often resembling a normal dwelling in many ways, in which a dead body is buried.

Proper treatment and placing of the dead has always been of great concern to people around the world. While choice of burial location and treatment of the corpse usually depend on beliefs and ritual standards within a specific cultural context, they are as well of a strategic nature. Burial decisions are affected by cultural norms regarding the deceased’s age, gender, vertical or horizontal status and by the relationship of people to places and other people. Ideas concerning proper burial also apply to those who have been defunct for quite some time. Dead bodies have been exhumed, reburied and desecrated in order to redefine – elevate or degrade – the status of their owners, construct new affiliations, rewrite history and to retrieve or construct social memory.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss-Krejci, E. (2004). Mortuary representations of the noble house - a cross-cultural comparison between collective tombs of the ancient maya and dynastic europe. Journal of Social Archaeology, 4(3), 368-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the laying to rest of the deceased, who is often surrounded with [[grave goods]], an earthwork called a [[kurgan]] in Russian or [[tumulus|barrow]] in English is raised over the house and the structure left sealed.

The term has parallels with Christian [[sepulchre]]s which contain only one burial. Mortuary houses differ from [[mortuary enclosure]]s in size, design and in the latter's capacity for multiple burials.

==Origin==
According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word [[mortuary]] derived in the early 14th century, from the word mortuarie, an Anglo-French word meaning "gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner"; from a Medieval Latin word mortuarium, a noun use of neuterof Late Latin adjective mortuarius "pertaining to the dead", from Latin mortuus, past participle of mori "to die". The meaning "place where bodies are kept temporarily" was first recorded in 1865, a euphemism for earlier deadhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{mortuary. (n.d.). Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved March 01, 2015, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mortuary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Philip Lieberman]] suggests that [[burial]] and [[mortuary]] housing may signify a "concern for the dead that transcends daily life."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Lieberman. (1991). Uniquely Human. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-92183-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice. Mortuary housing rituals can be detected back to the earliest days of human existence. Evidence suggests that the [[Neanderthals]] were the first [[Homo|human species]] to practice burial behavior and intentionally bury their dead, doing so in shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, John Noble (December 16, 2013). "Neanderthals and the Dead". New York Times. Retrieved December 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest undisputed [[homo sapiens|human]] burial, discovered so far, dates back 100,000 years.  Human skeletal remains stained with [[red ochre]] were discovered in the Skhul cave at [[Qafzeh]], Israel.

'''Egyptian Pyramids'''

Ancient Egypt is well known in their unique housing of the dead. The complex construction of chambers were both alluring and mysterious. The tombs represented as mortuary temples for the dead and the afterlife.

==Case Studies==
'''Ballyveelish, Co. Tipperary Ireland''' &lt;ref&gt;Doody, M. "An Early Bronze Age Burial At Ballyveelish, Co. Tipperary." Tipperary Historical Journal. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of a timber building was discovered by an archaeologist. From the circle of post holes and foundation trenches, the house was determined to be 7m x 5.1m. This structure was classified as a mortuary house, instead of dwelling, because of a lack of evidence of a hearth.

It is believed the mortuary house was built to serve a ceremonial function associated with the interment of human remains. Using [[radiocarbon dating]] it was determined this site was erected in the Bronze Age.

== Plot ==
The film's opening explains that in 1994 a [[web series]] called ''Murder'', which broadcast footage of actual deaths and acts of violence, appeared. After being active for four months, ''Murder'' was shut down by the authorities and had all of its content confiscated, though the website's host, a man known only as Balan, evaded capture. Now, years later, Balan has reemerged to share more clips that he has unearthed, while also offering commentary on people's obsession with death, the effect it has on them, and how accessible [[new media]] has made it. The series of videos is kicked off by Balan querying, "I ask you all... Why are you watching? Are you trying to find reality? Do you feel the need to be shocked? To witness something that human eyes shouldn't see? Murder is reality. Death comes when you least expect it. With what you are about to observe, you may question your own integrity. You will ask, could this happen to me? My answer to you is... Yes it can."

* '''Bludgeoning:''' A drunk Russian man accidentally beats his teenage son to death in front of the son's [[webcam]].
* '''The Heist:''' A restaurant's security system records a robbery committed by four gunmen, who shoot a cashier in the head and a fleeing customer in the back.
* '''The Cheat:''' In front of a stationary camera a man, Greg reminisces about how he met his wife, and about all of the good times that they shared, while a monitor in the background shows his wife having sex with someone else. The man leaves the room, and the monitor shows him barging in on his wife and her lover, hacking the former to death with an ax before cutting out her heart, which the wife had once said would always belong to him.
* '''S&amp;G:''' A parking lot security camera catches two people attacking a couple, beating the man with a baseball bat, and abducting the woman.
* '''Broadway Rob:''' The distorted home movie of a pedophile, Broadway Rob who forces two gagged boys, Shawn and Ben clad in only their socks and underwear to dance with him. Shawn tackles Rob, fatally strangling and stabbing him. Shawn and Ben flee, leaving Rob's dead body behind.
* '''Execution:''' A muffled black and white [[camcorder]] video of a hooded and masked group (possibly a [[cult]] or a gang) executing a man via decapitation in front of a woman, whom they taunt with the severed head before shooting her.
* '''ATM:''' A man is mugged and killed at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]].
* '''Autopsy:''' Japanese autopsy footage of a woman who was shot in the mouth, with the bullet exiting the top of her skull. The coroner eventually kicks the cameraman out due to his unprofessional antics and inattentiveness.
* '''Bullied:''' A trio of drunks use a camcorder to record themselves taking a man out into the woods under the pretense of initiating him into their group. The three bully and humiliate the man and, during a scuffle, one of them accidentally knocks him onto the knife another was holding. The trio panic and bicker, and the camera is dropped when a fight breaks out over whether they should go for help.
* '''Homecoming:''' A building security camera records two figures [[Garrote|garroting]] a man.
* '''Ransom:''' A deteriorated series of [[ransom]] videos depict three men brutalizing a [[Senate|senator's]] daughter, who eventually dies due to the severity of her injuries.

After the last clip, Balan delivers the closing statement, "You realize now it's everywhere. Death casts a shadow on all our faces. The new media shines light on dank crevasses, revealing moral decay and broken experiences that are better left beyond the pale. Goosebumps explode on my skin with every clip we watch. I feel it now more than ever. How do you feel?"

== Reception ==
Ryan Doom of [[JoBlo.com|Arrow in the Head]] gave ''Murder Collection V.1'' a 2/4 and wrote, "In the end, I think it's an interesting exercise, but I don't know if it makes it a good movie. This isn't the type of film that I suspect most viewers would revisit often, if at all. Instead, it's just an experiment that people will dig or not, depending on how much violence and gore they can stomach without a story for context. While it captivated me at times with certain segments, others seemed unnecessary or overdone. But maybe that's just me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/murder-collection-v1|title = ''Murder Collection V.1''|last = Doom|first = Ryan|publisher = Arrow in the Head|date = |website = joblo.com|accessdate = 25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horror News's Jay Alan praised the special effects, also calling the acting "convincingly believable for the most part" and writing, "As much as the film focuses on the graphic and dark nature of death, it also delves into the human psyche and personalities of the characters within the little given time shown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/30431/film-review-murder-collection-vol-1-2009/|title = Film Review: ''Murder Collection Vol. 1'' (2009)|last = Alan|first = Jay|publisher = Horror News|date = 2 November 2011|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[entertainment]], an '''origin story''' is an account or [[back-story]] revealing how a [[Character (arts)|character]] or group of people become a [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]], and it adds to the overall study of a [[narrative]], often giving reasons for their intentions.

In [[American comic book]]s, it also refers to how characters gained their [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s and/or the circumstances under which they became [[superhero]]es or [[supervillain]]s. In order to keep their characters current, comic book companies, as well as cartoon companies, game companies, children's show companies, and toy companies, frequently rewrite the origins of their oldest characters. This goes from adding details that do not contradict earlier facts to a totally new origin which makes it seem that it is an altogether different character.

A [[pourquoi story]], also dubbed an "origin story", is also used in [[mythology]], referring to narratives of how a world began, how creatures and plants came into existence, and why certain things in the cosmos have certain yet distinct qualities.

== Critical explorations of the origin story ==

In ''The Superhero Reader'' (nominated for a 2014 [[Eisner Award]] for Best Scholarly/Academic Work), edited by Charles Hatfield (Professor at University of Connecticut), Jeet Heer (Toronto-based journalist), and Dr. Kent Worcester (Professor of Political Science at [[Marymount Manhattan College]]), the editors write in "Section One: Historical Considerations":  "Almost all superheroes have an origin story: a bedrock account of the transformative events that set the protagonist apart from ordinary humanity. If not a prerequisite for the superhero genre, the origin... is certainly a prominent and popular trope that recurs so frequently as to offer clues to the nature of this narrative tradition. To read stories about destroyed worlds, murdered parents, genetic mutations, and mysterious power-giving wizards is to realize the degree to which the superhero genre is about transformation, about identity, about difference, and about the tension between psychological rigidity and a flexible and fluid sense of human nature. ... When surveying the superhero genre, preliminary questions often turn to the problem of roots." The book has a wealth of pertinent bibliographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hatfield, Charles|title= The Superhero Reader |location= Jackson, Mississippi |publisher= University Press of Mississippi |year= 2013 |page= 3 |ISBN= 9781617038068|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English professors Dr. Alex Romagnoli and Dr. Gian S. Pagnucci, of [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], discuss in their book ''Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature'' "the nature of superhero origin stories and how the writing of these origin stories helps make superhero narratives a unique literary genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Romagnoli |first1= Alex S. |last2= Pagnucci |first2= Gian S. |title= Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature |chapter= Introduction |location= Lanham, Maryland |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield#Scarecrow Books|Scarecrow Books]] |year= 2013 |page= 3 |ISBN= 0-810-89171-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they write, "Superheroes get very complicated when it comes to their histories, but one part of their stories remains forever constant and important. Even more than 'death' stories, [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]], event stories, and attire changes, origin stories are the core of superheroes' existences. Origins not only reflect the sociohistorical contexts in which heroes were created, but they also reflect a culture's understanding of what makes superheroes storytelling unique vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Romagnoli |first1= Alex S. |last2= Pagnucci |first2= Gian S. |title= Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature |chapter= 6. Superhero Storytelling |location= Lanham, Maryland |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield#Scarecrow Books|Scarecrow Books]] |year= 2013 |page= 109 |ISBN= 0-810-89171-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Romagnoli and Pagnucci go on to explain why the origin story is as important to the audience as to the generations of writers who continue heroic tales.

Dr. Randy Duncan (comics scholar and professor of communication, Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas) and Dr. Matthew J. Smith (Department of Communication, Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio) use the origin story of [[Spider-Man]] as an example of how a [[Character (arts)|character]] can be created by the persistence of a writer who has definite preferences in creating a character's personality, even if the publisher resists. "It is difficult to discern which is more often told: Spider-Man's origin or the tales told around that origin. All reveal fascinating aspects of a teenage loner fatefully 'bitten by a radioactive spider' to find himself with 'the proportionate strength and agility of an arachnid'." Duncan and Smith explain how [[Stan Lee]] butted heads with publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], who worried about an "ick factor," but Lee prevailed. "The entire Spider-Man concept resonates with the primary attributes of many genres and traditions," the authors say. "Like a heady puree of [Mary] Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'', Bob Kane's Batman, and Franz Kafka's ''Metamorphosis'', Spider-Man's origin invokes gothic and crime fiction motifs like the ostracized genius, doomed loved ones, the misuse or misfiring of science, the gritty noir city, the driven vigilante, and the fateful [[Uncanny|'return of the repressed']]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Randy |last2= Smith |first2= Matthew J. |title= Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= Greenwood Press |series= (Series: Greenwood icons) |year= 2013 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 684 |ISBN= 9780313399237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors proceed to investigate these various issues of the origin story.

[T]he death of Peter Parker's uncle powerfully shapes his hero ethos and his desire to fight crime. ... [Footnote 1] There are three notable differences between the film and the comic versions of the Spider-Man origin. The first is that in the comic, Peter Parker was not provoked in any way to allow the thief to escape (as he was in the film by the rude behavior of the promoter). The second is that in ''Amazing Fantasy #15'', Uncle Ben never utters the line "With great power comes great responsibility." Rather, this line is stated in the final narration. The third is that in the film, Uncle Ben is killed while waiting for Peter in the car, but in the comic, he's killed in a home invasion. Notably, in more recent issues of the comic, Uncle Ben's murder and the origin of the "great responsibility" line have been retroactively changed ("[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]") to fit with the movie version. |ISBN= 978-0-470-57560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Randy |last2= Smith |first2= Matthew J. |title= Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= Greenwood Press |series= (Series: Greenwood icons) |year= 2013 |volume= 1 |page= 684 |isbn= 9780313399237 |quote= In the final panel of his origin story, a devastated Spider-Man turns away from readers: 'a lean and silent figure' fades 'into the gathering darkness, aware at last that in this world, with great power must also come – great responsibility!'

A '''passage grave''' (sometimes hyphenated) or '''passage tomb''' consists of a narrow passage made of large stones and one or multiple burial chambers covered in earth or stone. The building of passage tombs was normally carried out with [[megalith]]s and smaller stones; they usually date from the [[Neolithic]] Age. Those with more than one chamber may have multiple sub-chambers leading off from the main burial chamber. One common layout, the [[cruciform passage grave]], is cross-shaped. Sometimes passage tombs are covered with a [[cairn]], especially those dating from later times. Not all passage graves have been found to contain evidence of human remains. One such example is [[Maeshowe]]. The Passage Tomb tradition is believed to have originated in the French region of Brittany. It was introduced to other regions such as Ireland by colonists from Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Alison|date=|title=Megaliths and Megalomania: An account and interpretation of the development of passage tombs in Ireland.|url=|journal=The Journal of Irish Archaeology|volume=3|pages=17–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passage tombs of the cairn type often have elaborate [[Corbel arch|corbelled roofs]] rather than simple slabs. [[Prehistoric art|Megalithic art]] has been identified carved into the stones at some sites. The passage itself, in a number of notable instances, is aligned in such a way that the sun shines into the passage at a significant point in the year, for example at sunrise on the [[solstice|winter solstice]] or at sunset on the [[equinox]].

[[image:Tustrup jaettestue.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tustrup-dysserne, the largest passage grave in Eastern [[Jutland]], is an example of [[Funnelbeaker culture]] circa 3200 BC.]]

In a 1961 survey of [[Irish Megalithic Tombs|megalithic tombs in Ireland]], Irish scholars Seán Ó Nualláin and [[Rúaidhrí de Valera]] describe four categories of megalithic tombs: [[court cairn]]s, portal [[dolmen]]s, [[wedge-shaped gallery grave]]s, and passage tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Ó Nualláin, Seán &amp; [[Rúaidhrí de Valera|De Valera, Rúaidhrí]] | year=1961 |title= Survey of the Megalithic Tombs of Ireland | publisher=Ordnance Survey (Ireland) | location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be one of the first uses of the term. It is likely that the writers borrowed from the Spanish term ''tumbas de corredor'', which is used for tombs in [[Cantabria]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. Of their list, only passage tombs appear to have widespread distribution throughout Europe.

Passage graves are distributed extensively in lands along the Atlantic seaboard of Europe. They are found in [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Scandinavia]], northern [[Germany]] and the [[Drenthe]] area of the [[Netherlands]]. They are also found in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], some parts of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and along the northern coast of [[Africa]]. The earliest passage tombs seem to take the form of small [[dolmen]]s. In [[Ireland]] and Britain, passage tombs are often found in large clusters, giving rise to the term passage tomb cemeteries. Many later passage tombs were constructed at the tops of hills or mountains, indicating that their builders intended them to be seen from a great distance.

{{Anarchism sidebar |History}}

'''Provo''' was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[counterculture]] [[cultural movement|movement]] in the mid-1960s that focused on provoking violent responses from authorities using non-violent bait. It was preceded by the [[nozem]] movement and followed by the [[hippie]] movement. Provo was founded, on 25 May 1965, by [[Robert Jasper Grootveld]], an anti-smoking activist, and the [[anarchists]] [[Roel van Duijn]] and Rob Stolk. The term was used for the movement as a whole and for individual members. Provo was officially disbanded on 13 May 1967.

==Beginnings==
The Provos are thought to have evolved out of the artist [[Robert Jasper Grootveld]]'s anti-smoking happenings in June 1964. The following year other groups appeared as a fusion of small groups of youths sympathetic with the [[Pacifism|pacifist]] ban-the-bomb movement. [[Roel van Duijn]] is thought to have been the group's theorist, influenced by [[anarchism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and the [[Marquis de Sade]].

The Provos borrowed their name from [[Wouter Buikhuisen]], who in a doctoral dissertation in 1965, talked about "young trouble-makers" as "provos", a word derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''provoceren'' meaning to provoke.

Bernhard de Vries states that the Provos comprised four groups of people:
*"The happeners": those managing happenings in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Antwerp]], combining non-violence with absurd humour to provoke the police. The police were regarded as "essential non-creative elements for a successful happening" and "co-happeners".
*"The [[beatnik]]s and [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipsters]]".
*"The thinkers": those publishing Provo ideas in magazines and pamphlets, including Provo, Revo, Eindelijk, and [[University of Amsterdam]] student weekly ''Propria Cures''.
*"The activists" or the "street Provos" who engaged in [[direct action]] with the intent to influence [[public opinion]].

[[Harry Mulisch]]'s book, ''Bericht aan de rattenkoning'' (''Message to the Rat King'', 1966), reflects upon the riots following the [[Telegraaf]]'s coverage on a worker's death in a protest:
{{quote|While their parents, seated on refrigerators and washing machines, watched TV with their left eyes, and their cars with their right eyes, a mixer in one hand and the ''Telegraaf'' in the other, the kids left Saturday evening for the [[Spui (Amsterdam)|Spui]] square.}}

==Magazine==
12 July 1965 the first ''Provo'' magazine was published. It contained the "Provo manifesto", written by [[Roel van Duijn]], and reprinted recipes for bombs from a nineteenth-century anarchist pamphlet. The magazine was eventually confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.macba.cat/en/roel-van-duyn-provo Provo Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217225427/http://www.macba.cat/en/roel-van-duyn-provo |date=2012-12-17 }}'' [[MACBA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Provo'' #12, the magazine was described as

&lt;blockquote&gt;a monthly sheet for [[anarchist]]s, provos, [[beatnik]]s, pleiners, scissors-grinders, jailbirds, simple simon stylites, magicians, [[pacifist]]s, potato-chip chaps, charlatans, philosophers, germ-carriers, grand masters of the queen's horse, happeners, [[vegetarian]]s, syndicalists, santy clauses, kindergarten teachers, agitators, [[pyromaniac]]s, assistant assistants, scratchers and [[Syphilis|syphilitics]], secret police, and other riff-raff. Provo has something against [[capitalism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], bureaucracy, [[militarism]], professionalism, dogmatism, and [[authoritarianism]]. Provo has to choose between desperation, resistance and submissive extinction. Provo calls for resistance wherever possible. Provo realises that it will lose in the end, but it cannot pass up the chance to make at least one more heartfelt attempt to provoke society. Provo regards anarchy as the inspirational source of resistance. Provo wants to revive anarchy and teach it to the young. Provo is an image.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Actions and ideas==
The Provos gained world prominence through its protests at the royal wedding of [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands]] and [[Claus von Amsberg]]. The [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch Royal Family]] was unpopular at the time, and [[Claus von Amsberg]] was thought to be unacceptable to many Dutch people because of his [[Hitlerjugend]] membership during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. The engagement was announced in June, and in July the Provos threw anti-monarchist pamphlets from a bridge into the royal boat.

In the run-up to the wedding Provo made up a fake speech, in which [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Queen Juliana]] declared she'd become anarchist and was negotiating a transition of power with Provo. The White Rumour Plan was put into action, as part of which wild rumours were spread in Amsterdam, including that the Provos were preparing to dump [[LSD]] in the city water supply. These rumours led the authorities to request 25,000 troops to help guard the parade route.

Dressed as ordinary citizens, the Provos managed to sneak sugar and [[nitrate]] [[smoke bomb]]s past the police. The first bombs went off just behind the palace as the procession started. Unable to identify the Provos, the police overreacted and the wedding turned into a [[public relations]] disaster. In the week after the wedding, the police attacked and beat patrons of a photo exhibition documenting police violence at the royal wedding. Following these events a number of well-known writers and intellectuals started requesting an independent investigation into police behavior.

==Provoking the police==
The Provos sought to provoke the police in non-violent ways, aiming to shatter the self-righteousness of the authorities. Led by Grootveld, the Provos began a disinformation campaign to demonstrate the establishment's complete ignorance on the subject of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. The Provos set out to get busted for "consuming" tea, hay, or herbs instead of marijuana. Grootveld and the artist [[Fred Wessels]] also opened the "Afrikaanse Druk Stoor," where they sold both real and fake marijuana.

==The White Plans==
The political wing of the Provos won a seat on the city council of [[Amsterdam]], and developed the "White Plans". The most famous of those is the "White Bicycle Plan", which aimed to improve Amsterdam's transport problem. Generally the plans sought to address social problems and make Amsterdam more liveable.

List of the White Plans:

* '''White Bicycle Plan''': initiated by [[Luud Schimmelpenninck]], the plan proposed the closing of central Amsterdam to all motorised traffic, including motorbikes, with the intention of improving public transport frequency by more than 40% and to save two million [[Dutch guilder|guilders]] per year. Taxis were accepted as semi-public transport, but would have to be electrically powered and have a maximum speed of 25 m.p.h. The Provos proposed one of the first [[bicycle sharing system]]s: the municipality would buy 20,000 white bikes per year, which were to be public property and free for everybody to use. After the plans were rejected by the city authorities, the Provos decided to go ahead anyway. They painted 50 bikes white and left them on streets for public use. The police impounded the bikes, as they violated municipal law forbidding citizens to leave bikes without locking them. After the bikes had been returned to the Provos, they equipped them all with combination locks and painted the combinations on the bicycles. (The song "[[My White Bicycle]]" by the English [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] rock band [[Tomorrow (band)|Tomorrow]], later covered by [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]] and by [[Nigel Planer]], was inspired by the White Bicycle plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/pink_fairies/tomorrow.html |title=Tomorrow|first=John C. |last=Alder|website=members.tripod.com|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/nazareth/ | title=UK Charts Nazareth | publisher=www.officialcharts.com | accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* '''White Chimney Plan''': proposed that air polluters be taxed and the chimneys of serious polluters be painted white.
* '''White Women Plan''': proposed a network of clinics offering advice and [[contraceptives]], mainly for the benefit of women and girls, and with the intention to reduce unwanted pregnancies. The plan was for girls of sixteen to be invited to visit the clinic, and advocated for schools to teach [[sex education]]. The White Women Plan also argued that it is irresponsible to enter marriage as a virgin.
* '''White Chicken Plan''': a proposal for the reorganization of the Amsterdam police (called "kip" in Dutch slang, meaning "chicken"). Under the plan, the police would be disarmed and placed under the jurisdiction of the [[gemeenteraad|municipal council]] rather than the [[burgemeester]] (mayor). Municipalities would then be able to democratically elect their own chief of police. The Provos intended for this revised structure to transform the police from guard to social worker.
* '''White Housing Plan''': sought to address Amsterdam's acute housing problem by banning speculation in house building, and by promoting the [[squatting]] of empty buildings. The plan envisioned ''Waterlooplein'' as an open-air market and advocated abandoning plans for a new town hall.
* '''White Kids Plan''': proposed shared parenting in groups of five couples. Parents would take turns to care for the group's children on a different day of the week.
* '''White Victim Plan''': proposed that anyone having caused death while driving would have to build a warning memorial on the site of the traffic collision by carving the victim's outline one inch deep into the pavement and filling it with [[Mortar (masonry)|white mortar]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/21cc/counterculture/assaultonculture/provo/provo.html |title=Provo|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''White Car Plan''': a car-sharing project proposed by ''Schimmelpennink'' featuring electric cars which could be used by the people. It was later realised in a limited fashion as the [[Witkar]] system from 1974 until 1986.

==End==
Tensions with the police peaked in June 1966, when the construction worker Jan Weggelaar died during a demonstration. A strike was called by construction workers and large numbers of workers and their sympathisers, including Provos, marched through Amsterdam. Demonstrators fought the police in the streets (on the Dam and Damrak) and attacked the offices and vehicles of ''De Telegraaf''.

At the same time, the Provos participated in left-wing student protests against the [[Vietnam War]]. Demonstrations were banned, resulting in an increase in their size and popularity. The police responded with increasing force, and by mid-1966 hundreds of arrests were made every week. Police brutality led to increasing sympathy for the Provos and the anti-war demonstrators among the general public. An official investigation into the crisis was opened.

These events eventually led to the dismissal of Amsterdam's police chief, H.&amp;nbsp;J. van der Molen, in 1966 and the resignation of mayor [[Gijsbert van Hall]] in 1967. After van Hall had been removed, Grootveld and Rob Stolk (printer of ''Provo'' magazine) decided to end Provo. Stolk said:
"Provo has to disappear because all the Great Men that made us big have gone", a reference to Provo's two arch-enemies, Van Hall and Van der Molen.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==After Provo==
Some members of the Provos continued in the anarchist ''[[Kabouters]]'', founded by [[Roel van Duijn]], and ex-Provos also re-appeared in the Dutch [[GreenLeft]], a green political party.

==Influence==
Many Provo groups emerged in other cities in both the Netherlands and Belgium, Italy, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provo-images.info/pamphlets.html|title=Provo Images|website=www.provo-images.info|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stockholm]] staged an anti-nuclear war [[happening]]/action under the name Provies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaltimes.it/archive/index.php?year=1967&amp;volume=IT-Volume-1&amp;issue=6&amp;item=IT_1967-01-16_B-IT-Volume-1_Iss-6_003|title=IT06 - International Times Archive|website=www.internationaltimes.it| date = 16 January 1967 |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[London]] a "Death and Rebirth of International Times" happening, after a police raid of the first UK underground paper, was seen as a Provo event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =   http://www.internationaltimes.it/archive/index.php?year=1967&amp;volume=IT-Volume-1&amp;issue=10&amp;item=IT_1967-03-13_B-IT-Volume-1_Iss-10_003 | title = IT10 - HALLUCINATIONS?

'''''Saint George and the Dragon''''' is a painting by [[Paolo Uccello]] dating from around 1470. It is on display in the [[National Gallery, London]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paolo-uccello-saint-george-and-the-dragon Paolo Uccelo | Saint George and the Dragon | NG6294], [[The National Gallery, London]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly housed in the [[Palais Lanckoroński]] in Vienna, belonging to Count Lanckoroński and sold by his son and heir Anton in 1959 through Mr Farago. The first mention of it being there is 1898.

Gothicizing tendencies in Paolo Uccello's art are nowhere  more apparent than in this painting. It shows a scene from the famous story of [[Saint George and the dragon]]. On the right George is spearing the beast, and on the left the princess is using her belt as a leash to take the dragon up to the town.

The eye in the storm gathering on the right of Saint George is lined up with his spear showing there has been divine intervention.

An earlier less dramatic version of the same subject by the Italian artist is in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris.  

The painting is used as the basis for the [[U. A. Fanthorpe]] poem, ''Not My Best Side'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.emory.edu/classes/paintings&amp;poems/uccello.html|title= Not My Best Side, U.A. Fanthrope|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher= Emory University|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may have served as inspiration for [[John Tenniel|Sir John Tenniel]]'s illustration of the [[Jabberwock]] in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin (1999) ''The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition''.

[[File:Dresden - Scenography, set construction and theatrical scenery - 2546.jpg|thumb|A scenic painter at work at the [[Semperoper]] in [[Dresden, Germany]]]]
'''Theatrical scenic painting''' includes wide-ranging disciplines, encompassing virtually the entire scope of [[painting]] and craft techniques. An experienced scenic painter (or scenic artist) will have skills in [[Landscape art|landscape]] painting, [[figurative painting]], [[trompe l'oeil]], and [[faux finishing]], and be versatile in different media such as [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]], [[Oil painting|oil]], and [[tempera]] paint. The painter might also be accomplished in three-dimensional skills such as [[Sculpture|sculpting]], [[Plaster of Paris|plasterering]] and [[gilding]].

The scenic painter takes direction from the theatre designer. In some cases designers paint their own designs.

The techniques and specialized knowledge of the scenic painter replicate an image to a larger scale from a designer's [[maquette]], perhaps with accompanying photographs, printouts and original research, and sometimes with paint and style samples.

== Scenic paint ==
'''Scenic paint''' has traditionally been mixed by the painter using pigment powder colour, a binder and a medium. The binder adheres the powder to itself and to the surface on which it is applied. The medium is a thinner which allows the paint to be worked more easily, disappearing as the paint dries. Today it is common to use brands of ready-made scenic paint, or pigment suspended in a medium to which a binder will be added.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2725">The '''Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008''', also known as S.2913, was a bill legislated by the [[United States Senate]] on April 24, 2008.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-2913|title=Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008 (2008; 110th Congress S. 2913) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored by [[Senator Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) with Senator [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Robert Bennett]] (R-UT) and Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-UT) as co-sponsors.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt; It was referred to a committee and then reported by the committee on May 15, 2008.

== Summary ==
The bill was designed to provide limitations on the judicial branch from remedying copyright infringement cases remedying [[orphan works]]. Orphan works are copyrighted works for which the copyright owners cannot be identified and contacted. The infringing party has to meet several limits though in order to avoid legal penalties: a.) the infringing party performed and documented a reasonably diligent search in good faith to locate and identify the copyright owner before using the work, but was unable to locate and identify the owner, b.) the infringing use of the work provided attribution to the owner of the copyright, if known.&lt;ref name="washingtonwatch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_SN_2913.html|title=S. 2913, The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008 - Washington Watch|work=washingtonwatch.com|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, it was to limit monetary compensation, to what was described to be a reasonable standard, for infringed work if the infringing party was unable to locate the owner of the work ("due diligence"). It prohibited reasonable compensation if the infringing party was a non-profit educational institution, museum, library, or archive, or a public broadcasting entity, had tried to locate and contact the copyright owner, as well as immediately removed the copyrighted material if the owners of the works request it.&lt;ref name="washingtonwatch.com"/&gt;

== Reason for non-passage==
Sessions of [[United States Congress|Congress]] last two years and any bills proposed in that session must be dealt with in that two-year span. At the end of each congressional session, according to the bylaws of passing legislation, bills and resolutions that are not passed are cleared from the books.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt; Discussion on the bill was stymied by Senators who had no interest in passing the bill.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[File:Voer_Kirke_(Rougsø)_Vest.JPG|thumb|Stilt tower with three arches of Voer Kirke, [[Norddjurs Kommune|Northern Djursland]], [[Denmark|DK]]]]
The '''Stilt tower''', in Danish "styltetårn", is a special type of Medieval church tower, concentrated in [[Djursland]] peninsula and neighbouring regions of [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Jutland]].

In this type, only the upper storey with the bells has four walls. The lower parts of such a tower are formed by one or three high arches. With one arch, the lower part of the tower, which is connected to the western gable of the [[nave (architecture)|nave]], is only open to the west. With three arches, the lower part is a high open hall.

Very few ''stilt towers'' were built after Gothic age, if 20th century constructions with a box for the bells on high pilars are kept out of regard. And very few stilt towers were built in the Middle Ages in distant regions, where the term is unknown.

The '''Royal Institute of British Architects Stirling Prize''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] prize for excellence in [[architecture]]. It is named after the architect [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], organised and awarded annually by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA). The RIBA Stirling Prize is presented to "the architects of the building that has made the greatest contribution to the evolution of architecture in the past year." The architects must be RIBA members. Until 2014 the building could be anywhere in the [[European Union]], but since 2015 has had to be in the UK. In the past the award has come with a £20,000 prize, but currently it carries no prize money.

The award was founded in 1996, and is considered to be the most prestigious architecture award in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is publicised as the architectural equivalent of the [[Booker Prize]] (literature) and [[Turner Prize]] (visual arts). The Stirling Prize replaced the RIBA Building of the Year Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/07/david-shalev-obituary|title=David Shalev obituary|author=Elain Harwood|date=7 March 2018|website=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stirling Prize is the highest profile architectural award in [[British culture]], and the presentation ceremony has previously been televised by [[Channel 4]]. It is currently sponsored by developer Almacantar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/almacantar-signs-three-year-deal-to-sponsor-riba-stirling-prize/8687331.article|title=Almacantar signs three-year deal to sponsor RIBA Stirling Prize|author=|date=|website=architectsjournal.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six shortlisted buildings are chosen from a long-list of buildings that have received a RIBA National Award. These awards are given to buildings showing "high architectural standards and substantial contribution to the local environment".

In addition to the RIBA Stirling Prize, five other awards are given to buildings on the long-list. In 2015 they consist of: the RIBA National Award, the RIBA Regional Award, the Manser Medal, the [[Stephen Lawrence]] Prize and the RIBA Client of the Year Award. For years prior to 1996, the award was known as the "Building of the Year Award".

In 2000, several [[architect]]s from [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] made claims of [[metropolitan bias]] after five out of seven designs [[shortlist]]ed by judges were located within [[London]]. Critics also described the list as "London-centric". The chairman representing the judges in the contest dismissed the claims, noting that the first Stirling Prize was awarded to a building in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alberge|first1=Dalya|title=Prize case of London bias, say architects|work=[[The Times]]|date=4 Nov 2000|location=London, England|page=9|via=Academic OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Creation of Adam''''' ({{Lang-it|'''Creazione di Adamo'''}}) is a [[fresco]] painting by [[Michelangelo]], which forms part of the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Sistine Chapel's ceiling]], painted c. 1508–1512. It illustrates the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Genesis creation narrative|creation narrative]] from the [[Book of Genesis]] in which [[God the Father#Christianity|God]] gives life to [[Adam]], the first [[man]]. The fresco is part of a complex iconographic scheme and is chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis.

The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of [[human|humanity.]] The painting has been reproduced in countless imitations and parodies.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/The-Measure-of-Genius-Michelangelos-Sistine-Chapel-at-500.html | title=The Measure of Genius | first=Jamie |last=Katz | date=10 April 2009 | work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian.com]] | accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pop&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bitrebels.com/geek/pop-culture-art-inspired-by-michelangelos-the-creation-of-adam | title=Pop Culture Art Inspired By Michelangelo's ''The Creation Of Adam'' | first=Nuno | last=Teixeira |work=bitrebels.com | accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo's ''Creation of Adam'' is one of the most replicated religious paintings of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://historylists.org/art/20-of-the-world%E2%80%99s-most-famous-art-pieces.html |title=20 of the World's Most Famous Art Pieces - History Lists |website=historylists.org |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Sistine Chapel ceiling}}
[[File:Vatican-ChapelleSixtine-Plafond.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]]; the work took approximately four years to complete (1508–1512)]]
In 1505, Michelangelo was invited back to Rome by the newly elected [[Pope Julius II]]. He was commissioned to build the [[Tomb of Pope Julius II|Pope's tomb]], which was to include forty statues and be finished in five years.

Under the patronage of the Pope, Michelangelo experienced constant interruptions to his work on the tomb in order to accomplish numerous other tasks. Although Michelangelo worked on the tomb for 40 years, it was never finished to his satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Goldcheider14"&gt;Goldscheider, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the [[San Pietro in Vincoli|Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli]] in Rome and is most famous for his central figure of ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]'', completed in 1516.&lt;ref name=Bartz134/&gt; Of the other statues intended for the tomb, two known as the ''[[Rebellious Slave]]'' and the ''[[Dying Slave]]'', are now in the [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]].&lt;ref name=Goldcheider14/&gt;

During the same period, Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which took approximately four years to complete (1508–1512).&lt;ref name=Bartz134&gt;Bartz and König, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Condivi's account, [[Bramante]], who was working on the building of  [[St Peter's Basilica]], resented Michelangelo's commission for the Pope's tomb and convinced the Pope to commission him in a medium with which he was unfamiliar, in order that he might fail at the task.&lt;ref&gt;Coughlan, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo was originally commissioned to paint the [[Twelve Apostles]] on the triangular pendentives that supported the ceiling, and cover the central part of the ceiling with ornament.&lt;ref name= Goldscheider12&gt;Goldscheider, pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo persuaded Pope Julius to give him a free hand and proposed a different and more complex scheme, representing the [[Genesis creation story|Creation]], the [[Fall of Man]], the Promise of Salvation through the prophets, and the [[genealogy of Christ]]. The work is part of a larger scheme of decoration within the chapel which represents much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name= Goldscheider12/&gt;

The composition stretches over 500 square metres of ceiling,&lt;ref&gt;Bartz and König, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and contains over 300 figures.&lt;ref name= Goldscheider12/&gt;  At its centre are nine episodes from the [[Book of Genesis]], divided into three groups: God's Creation of the Earth; God's Creation of Humankind and their fall from God's grace; and lastly, the state of Humanity as represented by [[Noah]] and his family. On the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of Jesus; seven [[prophet]]s of Israel and five [[Sibyl]]s, prophetic women of the Classical world.&lt;ref name= Goldscheider12/&gt;  Among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are ''The Creation of Adam'', ''[[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]'', the [[Deluge myth|''Deluge'']], the ''Prophet [[Jeremiah]]'' and the ''[[Cumaean Sibyl]]''.

==Composition==
[[Image:'Adam's Creation Sistine Chapel ceiling' by Michelangelo JBU33cut.jpg|right|600px]]
God is depicted as an elderly white-bearded man wrapped in a swirling cloak while Adam, on the lower left, is completely nude. God's right arm is outstretched to impart the spark of life from his own finger into that of Adam, whose left arm is extended in a pose mirroring God's, a reminder that man is created in the image and likeness of God ({{Bibleref2|Gen.|1:26|NRSV}}). Another point is that Adam's finger and God's finger are not touching. It gives the impression that God, the giver of life, is reaching out to Adam who has yet to receive it; they are not on "the same level" as would be two humans shaking hands, for instance.

Many hypotheses have been formulated regarding the identity and meaning of the twelve figures around God. According to an interpretation that was first proposed by the English art critic [[Walter Pater]] (1839 – 1894) and is now widely accepted, the person protected by God's left arm represents [[Eve]], due to the figure's feminine appearance and gaze towards Adam,&lt;ref name="Givens2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Givens |first=Terryl L. |authorlink=Terryl Givens |date=2009 |chapter=Prologue |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=nZNODwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=Prologue |title=When Souls Had Wings.

''The Creation of Adam'' is generally thought to depict the excerpt "God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him" ({{Bibleref2|Gen.|1:27|NASB}}). The inspiration for Michelangelo's treatment of the subject may come from a [[medieval]] [[hymn]], "[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]", which asks the 'finger of the paternal right hand' (''digitus paternae dexterae'') to give the faithful speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Hymni/VeniCreator.html Veni, Creator Spiritus / Come Holy Spirit, Creator Blest]. Preces-latinae.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Michelangelo's main source of inspiration for his Adam in his ''Creation of Adam'' may have been a [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] showing a nude [[Augustus|Augustus Caesar]] riding sidesaddle on a [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=Augustus+cameo+Capricorn&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=simg:CAQSlwEJGwdg-o1QHQkaiwELEKjU2AQaBAgACAMMCxCwjKcIGmIKYAgDEijbDq4EoQSdBPIEmAWfBZQMyg6KDPot2Cz2LdYs9S3XLPkt0yysNNokGjCdkvYlEVFK5y62noihfD2LNuTiYTQ8L9sSKoPkKJr2gtr0K7wWhossO7qKoQNfQPwgAwwLEI6u_1ggaCgoICAESBLELPQAM Cameo] on [[Google Images]].&lt;/ref&gt; This cameo is now at [[Alnwick Castle]], [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sutherland | first=Bruce | date=Winter 2013 | title=Cameo Appearances on the Sistine Ceiling | url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/sou.32.2.23292907 | journal=Source: Notes in the History of Art | volume=32 | issue=2 | page=14 | publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] | jstor=23292907}} Alnwick Castle is in Northumberland, not Northampton, as the captions state. The Duke of Northumberland who owns the cameos discussed in the article has expressed his appreciation in a letter to the author.&lt;/ref&gt; The cameo used to belong to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Domenico Grimani]] who lived in Rome while Michelangelo painted the ceiling. Evidence suggests that Michelangelo and Grimani were friends. This cameo offers an alternative theory for those scholars who have been dissatisfied with the theory that Michelangelo was mainly inspired by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s Adam in his ''Creation of Adam''.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, Bruce (Winter 2013). pp. 12–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Several hypotheses have been put forward about the meaning of ''The Creation of Adam'''s highly original composition, many of them taking Michelangelo's well-documented expertise in human anatomy as their starting point.

===Portrayal of the human brain===
In 1990, an [[Anderson, Indiana]] [[physician]] Frank  Meshberger noted in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' that the background figures and shapes portrayed behind the figure of God appeared to be an anatomically accurate picture of the [[human brain]].&lt;ref name=Meshberger&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Meshberger| first1=Frank Lynn|date=10 October 1990 |title=An Interpretation of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam Based on Neuroanatomy |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=264 |issue=14 |pages=1837–41 |publisher= |doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03450140059034|pmid=2205727 |pmc= |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=383532 |accessdate=24 September 2012}} [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1229086804171881877 Pdf]. [http://www.mentalhealthandillness.com/creation_fr.html Excerpt] on Mental Health &amp; Illness.com. Retrieved 21 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On close examination, borders in the painting correlate with major [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] of the [[telencephalon|cerebrum]] in the inner and outer surface of the brain, the [[brain stem]], the [[frontal lobe]], the basilar artery, the [[pituitary gland]] and the [[optic chiasm]].&lt;ref name=Meshberger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/michelangelos-secret-message-in-the-sistine-chapel-a-juxtaposition-of-god-and-the-human-brain/ | title=Michelangelo's secret message in the Sistine Chapel: A juxtaposition of God and the human brain | first=R. Douglas |last=Fields | date=27 May 2010 | work=[[Scientific American]] | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrayal of the birth process===
Alternatively, it has been observed that the red cloth around God has the shape of a human [[uterus]] (one art historian has called it a "uterine mantle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Adrian |editor-last=Stokes |editor-link=Adrian Stokes (critic) |title=Michelangelo. A study in the nature of art |url=https://books.google.com/?&amp;id=4QxTAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2013 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=MqRPAAAAMAAJ 1955] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-136-44293-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/?&amp;id=4QxTAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22uterine+mantle%22%22Creation+of+Adam%22 89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and that the scarf hanging out, coloured green, could be a newly cut [[umbilical cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruschini |first=Enrico |title=Masterpieces of the Vatican |url=https://books.google.com/?id=O7QzAQAAIAAJ |year=2004 |publisher=Edizioni Musei Vaticani |location=[[Vatican City]] |isbn=978-8-881-17088-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=O7QzAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22recently+an+American+gynaecologist,+observing+the+profile+of+the+red+mantle,+noted+an+outstanding+resemblance+to+the+human+uterus.+The+green+cord+trailing+below+the+mantle+corresponds+exactly+with+an+umbilical+cord+that+has+just+been+cut.%22 112]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a group of Italian researchers published on ''[[Mayo Clinic Proceedings]]'' an article where the images of the mantle and the postpartum uterus were overlapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Di Bella |first1=Stefano |title=The "Delivery" of Adam: A Medical Interpretation of Michelangelo |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196%2815%2900153-6/fulltext?mobileUi=0 |journal=[[Mayo Clinic Proceedings]] |date=2015 |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=505–508 |doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2015.02.007 |pmid=25841253}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Enrico Bruschini (2004), "This is an interesting hypothesis that presents the Creation scene as an idealised representation of the physical birth of man ("The Creation"). It explains the [[navel]] that appears on [[Adam]], which is at first perplexing because he was created, not born of a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Bruschini, Enrico (2004). p. [https://books.google.com/?id=O7QzAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22This+is+an+interesting+hypothesis+that+presents+the+Creation+scene+as+an+idealised+representation+of+the+physical+birth+of+man.+It+explains+the+navel+that+appears+on+Adam,+which+is+at+first+perplexing+because+he+was+created,+not+born+of+a+woman.%22 112].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Immaculate Conception''''' is a [[painting]] by Italian painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1696{{ndash}}1770). It represented the [[Immaculate Conception]], an idea taught by the [[Catholic Church]] stating that the [[Virgin Mary]] was conceived without [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/immaculateconception.shtml |title=Immaculate Conception}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was commissioned in 1767, at a time when the Immaculate Conception concept was already common in art despite still being developed by theologians.&lt;ref name="MetMusArt"/&gt; It was declared a [[dogma]] of the Catholic Church in 1854 by [[Pope Pius IX]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p122a3p2.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - "Conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary"|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the associated [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] celebrated on 8 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/immaculateconception.shtml |title=Christianity: Immaculate Conception |publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was one of seven altarpieces commissioned in March 1767 from Tiepolo by King [[Charles III of Spain]] for the [[Convent of San Pascual|Church of Saint Pascual]] in Aranjuez, then under construction. This was originally an [[Peter of Alcantara|Alcantarine]] ([[Franciscan]]) monastery that was later assigned to the [[Conceptionists|Conceptionist]] nuns. It depicts the [[Virgin Mary]],  surrounded by [[angel]]s and crowned with the [[circle of stars]].&lt;ref name="MetMusArt"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DoHKJZ7soKMC&amp;pg=PA246 |p=246 |title=Giambattista Tiepolo, 1696-1770 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1996 |isbn=9780870998126 |editor=Keith Christiansen}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is shown trampling a snake, representing her victory over the [[devil]]. The lilies and the rose are references to ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' ("enclosed garden"), and symbolize Mary's love, virginity and purity.

==Background==
[[Baroque art]] was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the [[Renaissance]]. Tiepolo's works, many of which are on an imposing scale, are also characterized by tension, exuberance, hedonism and intricate designs.{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}} Among Tiepolo's most popular works are mythological and religious themes conveying an atmosphere of grandeur and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tiep/hd_tiep.htm|title=Giovanni Battista Tiepolo |author= Christiansen, Keith |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiepolo's altarpieces were transferred to the adjoining convent soon after they were installed in the church. They were replaced by an identically themed set by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], whose [[neo-classicism]] was more to Charles III's taste. Finally ''The Immaculate Conception'' was transferred to the [[Prado Museum]] in 1827.&lt;ref name=Seydl/&gt;

==Painting==

The imposing Baroque style of the painting is meant to evoke emotion. It  was completed between 1767 and 1768. The depiction of the [[Madonna (art)|Virgin Mary]] is done according to traditional Christian iconography, and represents her [[Immaculate Conception]], free from original sin. Standard iconographic elements include the dove above her, the stars around her head, her position on the [[crescent]] moon with a snake crushed under her feet, her hands held together in prayer, and the obelisk on her right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~wcawley/corson/serpent.htm|title=The Serpent and Crescent Moon at Mary's Feet|author= Corson, Dorothy|publisher=[[Notre Dame University]]|accessdate= 13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Clayton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2010/05/tiepolos-immaculate-conception.html#.VpaHsE0V-Uk|title=Tiepolo's Immaculate Conception|author= Clayton, David|publisher=New Liturgical Movement|accessdate= 13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional [[iconography]] which accords to this theme include clouds, [[cherubs]], [[Lilium|lilies]] and a pink rose, flowers which are often associated with Mary. The dove above her head symbolizes the [[Holy Ghost]], while the rose and the lilies are her customary symbols, lilies representing her purity,  while the rose is the symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/rosarymarkings36.html Koehler, S.M., Rev.

The globe symbolizing the whole world, the crescent moon and the starry crown above her head are traditional symbols of the "woman clothed with the sun" (''Virgo in Sole'') described in [[Woman of the Apocalypse|Revelations 12:1-2]]. The crescent moon itself is an ancient symbol of chastity deriving from the Roman goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. Just as the moon derives its light from the sun, so Mary's special grace derives from the merits of Christ, her Son. The obelisk to her right also shimmers in the light of the sun and references traditional symbols of the Immaculate Conception associated with the [[Tower of David]] and the [[Ivory Tower]], evoking impregnability, virginity and purity.&lt;ref name= Prado/&gt; Mary is depicted as trampling a serpent holding an apple in its mouth, representing the  serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Original Sin]]. A  palm branch, and a mirror are seen under her feet. The palm branch signifies Mary's victory and exaltation, the mirror her purity.&lt;ref name= Prado/&gt;

Originating in Spain with [[Francisco Pacheco]], the popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Lady in Art'' by Katherine Lee Rawlings Jenner 2009 {{ISBN|1-103-32689-9}} pages 3-9&lt;/ref&gt; Tiepolo had painted an earlier version of the Immaculate Conception in 1734 for the Franciscan church of [[Santa Maria in Araceli (Vicenza)|Santa Maria in Araceli]] in [[Vicenza]]. That version depicted the Virgin Mary as a beautiful young girl in the manner already established by [[Guido Reni]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] following Pacheco. The painting is now in Vicenza's civic museum at the [[Palazzo Chiericati]].&lt;ref name= Christiansen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immaculate Conception|url=http://www.museicivicivicenza.it/en/mcp/opera.php/9680|publisher=[[Musei Civici Vicenza]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present version the depiction of Mary is rather more majestic and solemn in keeping with the [[Peter of Alcantara|Alcantarine]] tradition of austerity.&lt;ref name= Christiansen/&gt;

Tiepolo painted a set of five ''[[modelli]]'' for his altarpieces. These are now all at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] in London and are considered amongst his finest work. The ''modello'' for the ''Immaculate Conception'' differs from the final version in several respects. In the final version the figure of Mary occupies more space and lacks the muscular supporting angel on her left. That angel is thought to be a representation of the [[archangel Michael]] whose slaying of [[Lucifer#Lucifer as Satan or the devil|Lucifer]] prefigured Mary's role as an instrument of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]]. The angel is present in an oil sketch executed around the same time, now in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]], considered iconographically the most complex of Tiepolo's depictions of the Immaculate Conception. Note the triangular halo signifying the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name= Christiansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=NGI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A complex allegorical work by Tiepolo|url=http://storyscope7test.ssl.co.uk/objectstories/2449|publisher=Storyscope}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

The first edition of ''The Indian Story of an Author'' was published in July 2018 by Think Tank Books. 

==Synopsis==

The book was created out of the frustration of the author when he pitched one of his manuscripts (''[[God of the Sullied]]'') to the publishers in India only to face their rejections on unclear grounds. It only has one brief chapter that summarises the irony of getting published in India with manuscripts other than romance and chick-lit genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rejection the reason behind me creating my new book, says Gaurav Sharma|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/040818/rejection-is-the-reason-behind-creating-my-new-book-says-gaurav-sharm.html|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is intentionally left blank to express the exasperation of its author on behalf of all other aspiring writers. Sharma's 100 pager book is blank after 13 printed pages, connoting similar trend as seen during the [[The Emergency (India)|Indian emergency]] declared by the then prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] when many journalists including [[Ramnath Goenka]] left the editorial page of their respective newspapers blank, protesting against the censorship imposed on the press during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=द इंडियन स्टोरी ऑफ ऐन ऑथर: प्रतिरोध का मौन हथियार|url=https://www.outlookhindi.com/art-and-culture/review/the-indian-story-of-an-author-silence-weapon-of-resistance-29657|newspaper=Outlook|date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Story of an Author was well received in the media and is seen as a symbolic message from the author to all the aspiring writers about the complications of Indian publishing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My experiments with the truth of publishing, Gaurav Sharma's new book|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/jul/31/my-experiments-with-the-truth-of-publishing-gaurav-sharmas-new-book-1850861.html|newspaper=The New Indian Express|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Magpie on the Gallows''''' (German: '''''Die Elster auf dem Galgen''')'' is a 1568 [[oil painting|oil]]-on-[[panel painting|wood panel]] painting by the [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Netherlandish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]].

== Description ==
The painting shows a woodland clearing containing three peasants dancing to a [[bagpipes]], next to a [[gallows]] upon which a [[magpie]] is perched.  The gallows stands in the centre of the picture, dividing the painting in two, a [[Mannerist]] composition with the right side more "open" and left more "closed",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d_pZim9LVv8C&amp;pg=PA32 Early Netherlandish painting], Volume 4 of Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Cambridge University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0894680935}}, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; with the magpie close to the exact centre of the painting.  The gallows appears to form an "[[impossible object]]", similar to a [[Penrose triangle]], with the bases of the posts seemingly planted side by side, but with the right side of the cross-member receding into the distance, and contradictory lighting.

Another magpie sits on a rock at the base of the gallows, near the skull of an animal.  The only people occupy the left foreground: a man [[defecation|defecates]] in the shadows to the left, while others watch the three dancers.  To the right stands a cross with a [[watermill]] behind.  The background opens on to a view of a river valley, with a town to the left and castle on a rocky crag above, and a tower on a rock outcrop to the right, and distant hills and the sky beyond.  Behind the dancers rise two intertwined trees, a motif used by Bruegel in an earlier drawing of bears playing in a forest.  An impression of depth is given by the progression from dense brown tones dominating of the foreground, through green midtones in the middle distance, to light blues and greys for the background.

== Analysis ==
Bruegel's painting was created the year after [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]], arrived in the Netherlands, sent by the Spanish king, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] to suppress the [[Dutch Revolt]].  The gallows may represent the threat of execution of those preaching the new [[Protestant]] doctrine, and the painting may allude to several Netherlandish proverbs.  There is a direct allusion to the [[Netherlandish]] proverbs of dancing on the gallows or shitting on the gallows, meaning a [[Insult|mocking]] of the state.&lt;ref name=bonn/&gt;  It also alludes to the belief that magpies are [[gossips]], and that gossip leads to hangings.&lt;ref name=bonn&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c2kCz9aeeW4C&amp;pg=PA106 Painting life: the art of Pieter Bruegel, the Elder], Robert L. Bonn, 2006, {{ISBN|1-884092-12-8}}, p.106&lt;/ref&gt;  And that the way to the gallows leads through pleasant meadows.&lt;ref name=elst&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=moXS5pZGMnsC&amp;pg=PA121-IA3 The Last Flowering of the Middle Ages], Baron Joseph Van Der Elst, Kessinger Publishing, 2005, {{ISBN|1-4191-3806-5}}, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known why or for whom the picture was painted.  Its date of 1568 makes this painting one of Bruegel's last works before his death in 1569; indeed, perhaps his final work.&lt;ref name=bonn/&gt; Bruegel asked his wife to burn some of his pictures on his death, but told her to keep the Magpie on the Gallows for herself.&lt;ref name=elst/&gt;  It is now held by the [[Hessisches Landesmuseum]] in [[Darmstadt]].

'''''The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew''''' ({{lang-it|Martirio di San Matteo}}; 1599–1600) is a painting by the Italian master [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]]. It is located in the [[Contarelli Chapel]] of the church of the French congregation [[San Luigi dei Francesi]] in [[Rome]], where it hangs opposite ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of Saint Matthew]] ''and beside the altarpiece ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]'', both by Caravaggio. It was the first of the three to be installed in the chapel, in July 1600.

The painting shows the martyrdom of [[Saint Matthew]] the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]], author of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. According to tradition, the saint was killed on the orders of the king of Ethiopia while celebrating Mass at the altar. The king lusted after his own niece, and had been rebuked by Matthew, for the girl was a nun, and therefore the bride of Christ. Cardinal Contarelli, who had died several decades earlier, had laid down very explicitly what was to be shown: the saint being murdered by a soldier sent by the wicked king, some suitable architecture, and crowds of onlookers showing appropriate emotion. (See the article on the [[Contarelli Chapel]]). 

The commission (which, strictly speaking, was from his patron, Cardinal [[Francesco Maria Del Monte]], rather than from the church itself), caused Caravaggio considerable difficulty, as he had never painted so large a canvas, nor one with so many figures. X-rays reveal two separate attempts at the composition before the one we see today, with a general movement towards simplification through reduction in the number of figures, and reduction – ultimately elimination – of the architectural element.  

The figure in the background, about left-centre and behind the assassin, is a self-portrait by Caravaggio.

==Stages of painting==
The first version revealed by the x-rays is in the [[Mannerist]] style of the most admired artist in Rome at the time, [[Giuseppe Cesari]], with a crowd of small figures amidst massive architecture. It must have seemed static and distanced. The second version turned to [[Raphael]] for a model, adding a crowd of onlookers displaying fear and pity, including a woman who presumably represented the nun. This was in line with the crowded scene requested by Cardinal Contarelli and with the tenets of Mannerism, which demanded bodies and buildings defined by perspective and drawing, but Caravaggio had already developed a personal style in which bodies were defined by light and darkness and in which backgrounds were eliminated. 

At this point Caravaggio left off the ''Martydom'' and turned his attention to the companion piece, the ''Calling''. This drew on his own earlier genre-pieces, ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|Cardsharps]]'' and ''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|The Fortune Teller]]'', but writ large. Apparently re-inspired, or perhaps with renewed self-confidence, Caravaggio turned back to the ''Martydom'', but this time working in his own idiom. The third version dropped the architecture, reduced the number of actors, and moved the action closer to the viewer; more than this, it introduced the dramatic [[chiaroscuro]] which picks out the most important elements of the subject, in much the same way a spotlight picks out the action on a stage, but centuries before spotlights were imagined, and chose to represent the moment of greatest drama, as the murderer is about to plunge his sword into the fallen saint.  This is the version we see today, the action caught at the moment of highest drama, the bystanders reduced to supporting roles by the sharply selective light, the whole giving the impression of a moment seen as if in a lightning flash. 

==Analysis==
This painting marks the moment when the [[Mannerist]] orthodoxy of the late 16th century – rational, intellectual, perhaps a little artificial – gives way to the [[Baroque]]. It caused a sensation. [[Federico Zuccari]], one of the most eminent painters in [[Rome]] and a champion of Mannerism, came to see, and sniffed that it was nothing. But the younger artists were totally won over, and Caravaggio became suddenly the most famous artist in Rome.

It takes concentration to understand that the confused melee is a victory of sainthood. Saint Matthew appears to recoil as he falls  before the naked fury of his executioner, burning in the glare of light, who readies his sword to strike. Around the saint are persons showing varied emotions, as required by Contarelli: terror, awe, and consternation, while an angel holds out the palm of martyrdom. Confusion about the image can be alleviated by understanding that Matthew is not quailing in fear at the executioner's strike, instead he reaches for the angel's gift. The executioner's grasp and the angel's reach are two parallel paths. Only Matthew is privy to the angelic visitation. Viewed as such, this is a painting not about a moment of general terror, but the death of a saint as the personal handshake of the divine. Italian Baroque painting and sculpture of the time commonly depicted martyrdoms not as moments of fear, but as moments of joy or ecstasy, as in for example, [[Bernini]]'s [[Santa Bibiana (Bernini)|Santa Bibiana]].

One factor worth noting is that Caravaggio, unlike his Mannerist predecessors, has actually made a simple fact of early modern church architecture work in his favour: large cathedrals like Saint Peter's might be well lit, but small chapels like the Contarelli were not. They were, and are, dark and narrow. As Caravaggio's biographer Peter Robb puts it: "Anyone coming down the nave of San Luigi (the church which contains the chapel) would've seen the pale killer nudes looming out of the dark from a distance, in a space that seemed to open out of the wall into the church's real transept."

That said, the painting contains many references from [[Michelangelo]], Raphael and others, which critic John Gash ascribes not so much to a need to find appropriate poses as to a desire for "a quality of monumental grandeur akin to that of the [[High Renaissance]]." The figures of the saint and the horror-struck boy on the left, for example, are borrowed "to the extent of almost 'quoting' directly" from [[Titian]]'s altarpiece of ''[[The Martyrdom of St Peter the Martyr]]'' in [[Venice]].

The '''Tomb of Payava''' is a [[Lycia]]n tall rectangular free-standing barrel-vaulted stone [[sarcophagus]], and one of the most famous [[tombs at Xanthos|tombs of Xanthos]]. It was built in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]],{{sfn|Dusinberre|2013|page=196}} for Payava who was probably the ruler of [[Xanthos]], Lycia at the time, in around 360&amp;nbsp;BC. The tomb was discovered in 1838 and brought to England in 1844 by the explorer [[Sir Charles Fellows]]. He described it as a 'Gothic-formed Horse Tomb'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-tomb-of-payava-a-lykian-aristocrat/WwENKgUb2uNNfg |title=The tomb of Payava, a Lykian aristocrat |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity of the Payava tomb, and more generally the Lycian barrel-vaulted tombs of the 4th century BCE, with the Indian [[Chaitya]] architectural design (starting from circa 250 BCE with the [[Lomas Rishi]] caves in the [[Barabar caves|Barabar caves group]]) has also been remarked on. [[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]], in his ''" Illustrated Handbook of Architecture"'', while describing the very progressive evolution from wooden architecture to stone architecture in various ancient civilizations, has commented that "In India, the form and construction of the older Buddhist temples resemble so singularly these examples in Lycia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Illustrated Handbook of Architecture Being a Concise and Popular Account of the Different Styles of Architecture Prevailing in All Ages and All Countries by James Fergusson |date=1859 |publisher=J.

The Lycian tombs, dated to the 4th century BCE, are either free-standing or rock-cut barrel-vaulted sarcophagi, placed on a high base, with architectural features carved in stone to imitate wooden structures. There are [[:File:Lycian rock-cut tombs.jpg|numerous rock-cut equivalents]] to the free-standing structures. Both Greek and Persian influences can be seen in the reliefs sculpted on the sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;M. Caygill, The British Museum A-Z compani (London, The British Museum Press, 1999) E. Slatter, Xanthus: travels and discovery (London, Rubicon Press, 1994) A.H. Smith, A catalogue of sculpture in -1, vol. 2 (London, British Museum, 1900)&lt;/ref&gt; The structural similarities, down to many architectural details, with the [[Chaitya]]-type Indian Buddhist temple designs, such as the "same pointed form of roof, with a ridge", are further developed in ''The cave temples of India''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fergusson |first1=James |last2=Burgess |first2=James |title=The cave temples of India |date=1880 |publisher=London : Allen |page=120 |url=https://archive.org/details/cavetemplesofind00ferguoft/page/120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fergusson went on to suggest an "Indian connection", and some form of cultural transfer across the [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fergusson |first1=James |title=An historical inquiry into the true principles of beauty in art, more especially with reference to architecture |date=1849 |publisher=London, Longmans, Brown, Green, and Longmans |pages=316–320 |url=https://archive.org/details/anhistoricalinq00ferggoog/page/n349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the ancient transfer of Lycian designs for rock-cut monuments to India is considered as "quite probable".&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt;

The known Indian designs for the Chaityas only start from circa 250 BCE with the [[Lomas Rishi]] caves in the [[Barabar caves|Barabar caves group]], and therefore postdate the Xanthos barrel-vaulted tombs by at least one century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ching |first1=Francis D.

Art historian David Napier has also proposed a reverse relationship, claiming that the Payava tomb was a descendant of an ancient South Asian style, and that Payava may actually have been a [[Indo-Greek|Graeco-Indian]] named "Pallava".&lt;ref&gt;According to David Napier, author of ''Masks, Transformation, and Paradox'', "In the British Museum we find a Lycian building, the roof of which is clearly the descendant of an ancient South Asian style.", "For this is the so-called "Tomb of Payava" a Graeco-Indian Pallava if ever there was one." in "Masks and metaphysics in the ancient world: an anthropological view" in {{cite book |last1=Malik |first1=Subhash Chandra |last2=Arts |first2=Indira Gandhi National Centre for the |title=Mind, Man, and Mask |date=2001 |publisher=Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts |isbn=9788173051920 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QeCAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">'''Union of Soviet Writers''', '''USSR Union of Writers''', or  '''Soviet Union of Writers''' ({{lang-ru| Союз писателей СССР|translit=Soyuz Sovetstikh Pisatelei}}) was a [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|creative union]] of professional writers in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Garrard| first = John|author2=Carol Garrard | title = Inside the Soviet Writers' Union| page = xv | location = London| date = 1990| publisher = Tauris| isbn = 9781850432609}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1932 on the initiative of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] after disbanding a number of other writers' organizations: [[RAPP (organization)|RAPP]], [[Proletkult]], and [[VOAPP]].

The aim of the Union was to achieve Party and State control in the field of literature. For professional writers, membership of the Union became effectively obligatory, and non-members had much more limited opportunities for publication. The result was that exclusion from the Union meant a virtual ban on publication. In spite of this, the history of the Union of Writers also saw cases of voluntary self-exclusion from its cadre. Thus [[Vasily Aksenov]], [[Simeon Lipkin]] and [[Inna Lisnyanskaya]] left the Union of Writers in a show of solidarity following the exclusion of [[Victor Yerofeev]] and [[Yevgeni Anatolyevich Popov|Yevgeny Popov]] in punishment for self-publishing.

After the [[fall of Soviet Union]], the Union of Soviet Writers was divided into separate organizations for each of the [[Post-Soviet states]]. The Russian section was transformed into the ''[[Union of Russian Writers]]''.
