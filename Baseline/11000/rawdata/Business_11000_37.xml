'''Alexander Nesis''' (born December 19, 1962, [[Leningrad]], [[USSR]]) is the founder, president and CEO of the [[ICT Group (Russia)|ICT Group]], a private equity firm headquartered in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], which invests mainly in the [[finance]], [[precious metals]] and [[engineering]] sectors.

==Biography==
Born in Leningrad in 1962, Nesis studied [[radiochemistry]] at the prestigious Lensovet [[Leningrad Institute of Technology]]. After graduation he worked as master supervisor at the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Shipbuilding Yard]] (the largest and one of the oldest in Russia, est. 1856), which produced a variety of ships including nuclear icebreakers and submarines.&lt;ref name="Job"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orielresources.com/nonexecutive_209.asp |title=Alexander Nesis |publisher=Oriel Resources Ltd |accessdate=2012-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170618/http://www.orielresources.com/nonexecutive_209.asp |archivedate=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baltic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bz.ru/en/about.html|title=Baltiysky Zavod|publisher=Baltiysky Zavod Joint Stock Company|accessdate=2012-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510181548/http://www.bz.ru/en/about.html|archive-date=2012-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, Nesis left the shipyard to set out as an entrepreneur, opting to work for himself rather than for the state.&lt;ref name="Forbes Russians"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/75/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=75&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=SN3U&amp;datatype=Person|title= Russia's 100 Richest 2004|publisher=Forbes|year= 2004|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with a small group of business partners, he first concentrated on the production of materials derived from uranium deposits located in the deserts of [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/8612140/Billionaire-Alexander-Nesis-reveals-why-Polymetal-is-listing-in-London.html|title=Billionaire Alexander Nesis reveals why Polymetal is listing in London|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date= 2011-07-03|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the same group of entrepreneurs embarked upon a new venture to invest in the shipbuilding and metals industries.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2010"&gt;{{cite news|title= Forbes - The World's Billionaires|url= https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Alexander-Nesis_SN3U.html|work= [[Forbes]]|date= 2010-03-03|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, their company became known as the ICT Group. In the same year, having made his fortune, Nesis returned to the Baltic Shipbuilding Yards as its controlling shareholder and Head of Board of Directors.

==ICT Group==
{{main|ICT Group (Russia)}}
The ICT ('Investments, Construction, Technologies') Group, founded by Nesis in the early 1990s, is now one of the largest privately owned investment and industrial companies in [[Russia]]. It is headquartered in [[Moscow]] and has a large office in [[St. Petersburg]]. It invests in, develops and manages assets in wide range of industries, including the banking and financial industry, metals and [[mining]], precious metal production, heavy engineering, [[logistics]], [[construction]] and development.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

At present, the portfolio of assets under the Group's management includes such recognized leaders in their respective industries as NOMOS-BANK, Khanty-Mansi Bank, Polymetal and Tikhvin Freight Car Building Plant. The Group also holds large equity stakes in the potash producer Uralkali and Baltic Leasing.&lt;ref name="RBC Daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbcdaily.ru/2011/04/20/industry/562949980108028|title=RBC Daily|publisher=RBC Website|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's assets are located primarily in Russia, but it also has interests in Kazakhstan. According to ICT's website, the total value of its assets under management stands at $8 billion.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

== Business Approach ==
Nesis and the ICT Group's preferred business strategy is to set up a project and grow it until it can be run independently. ICT has been described as a kind of incubator, which holds on to investments while they are in the design or technical research stage before spinning them out separately when they have reached a critical mass.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt; In terms of engineering, he places a strong emphasis on the design stage: "If you make a mistake at the design stage, that's very difficult to repair. If you make a mistake at the construction page, it's easier to repair [...] it's very important to find the right technology solution."&lt;ref name="Metal Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/2868075/The-unassuming-billionaire-MB-meets-Polymetal-founder-Alexander-Nesis.html|title=The unassuming billionaire: MB meets Polymetal founder Alexander Nesis|publisher=Metal Bulletin|date= 2011-07-20|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate Governance Roles ==
*President of the ICT Group
*Nesis served as Chairman of the Board of Directors at OAO Baltiysky Zavod between 1993 and 1998 and 2002-2005
*Acted as General Director and a member of the Board of Directors at Polymetal, 1998–2003
*Serves as Member of the Board of Directors at OAO Uralkali, 2010–present

== Personal Wealth ==
As of March 2012, ''[[Forbes Magazine|Forbes]]'' put Nesis's personal wealth at approximately $3.1 billion, putting him at No.367 in its list of billionaires and making him No.31 in Russia.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2012"&gt;

[[File:1931.01.31 23 Andrussow Pilot Plant diagramm Herne Germany.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram from 1931 showing the Andrussow process]]
The '''Andrussow process''' is an industrial process for the production of [[hydrogen cyanide]] from [[methane]] and [[ammonia]] in the presence of [[oxygen]] and a [[platinum]] [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  1.5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →   HCN  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The process is based on a reaction that was discovered by [[Leonid Andrussow]] in 1927. In the following years he developed the process that is named after him. HCN is also produced in the [[BMA process]].

==Side reactions==
This reaction is very [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]]. The change of [[Standard enthalpy of formation|enthalpy]] of this reaction is equal to ''-481.06 kJ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first=Gyula | last=Deák | title=Menné reakcie v organickej chémii|year = 1980|publisher=Vydavateľstvo technickej a ekonomickej literatúry| location = Bratislava| page = 14|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[heat]] provided by the main reaction serves as a catalyst for other side reactions.
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

These side reactions can be reduced by only short exposures to the catalyst of the order of 0.0003s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pirie|first=J M|title=The Manufacture of Hydrocyanic Acid by the Andrussow Process|journal=Platinum Metals Rev.|year=1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=7–11|url=http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/pdf/pmr-v2-i1-007-011.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrés Soriano y Róxas was born on February 8, 1898, in [[San Miguel, Manila]], [[Philippines]]. His father, Don Eduardo Soriano y Sanz, was a Spanish engineer who migrated to Philippines in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batalla|first=Eric Vincent C.|title=Governance and Development of the Philippine Family Conglomerate: The Case of the Soriano Business Family, 1918-1998|journal=DLSU-University Research Coordination Office|year=2000|url=http://serp-p.pids.gov.ph/details.php?pid=4109&amp;param=|access-date=2013-08-29|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130829100748/http://serp-p.pids.gov.ph/details.php?pid=4109&amp;param=|archive-date=2013-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother, Doña Margarita Róxas de Ayala y Róxas, was the daughter of Pedro Pablo Róxas, and the granddaughter of Antonio de Ayala and Doña Margarita Róxas, progenitors of the prominent Róxas de Ayala and [[Zobel de Ayala family|Zóbel de Ayala]] clans.

'''Carapelli''' (Carapelli Firenze SpA) is an [[Italy|Italian]] food company, currently owned by [[Deoleo, S.A]], based in [[Tavarnelle Val di Pesa]], which is a small town in the [[Metropolitan City of Florence]], most famous for its extra virgin [[olive oil]]. The company was started as a home business in 1893 by Cesira and Costantino Carapelli. Other members of the Carapelli family joined the business and the company rapidly grew in size and popularity, to become the most modernised food company in Italy by the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Today, Carapelli Firenze SpA is the '''leading''' Italian extra virgin olive oil company (with brand such as '''Carapelli, Sasso, Maya''') where 30% of its production is exported in [[Europe]] and [[Americas|America]].

==History==
===1893: The Beginning===
On 23rd September 1893, the day of their wedding, 
Cesira &amp; Constantino Carapelli founded the family business with her dowry. With 300 lire the couple bought a warehouse in Montevarchi to trade in grain, oil and other agricultural produce

===1939-40: Post War===
On the eve of war, the Carapelli family set up the most modern wheat mill of the time just outside Florence, in Ponte a Ema. Right next to it they also built the first oil-pressing factory.
The war and bombardments that destroyed everything did little to curb their efforts and their will to succeed. Reconstruction started in Novoli, which was then open countryside and over the years, a plant was established.
===1995: Tavernelle===
Carapelli moves production to Tavarnelle Val di Pesa in the Chianti region.


===2001: Instituto Nutrizionale Carapelli===
The Instituto Nutrizionale Carapelli is a non-profit foundation for scientific research into the olive oil sector and the education and spreading of the awareness of the importance of a correct diet.

==Controversy==
In 2009, Carapelli filed and lost a lawsuit against a German journalist for publishing proof of bad quality and false labelling of Carapelli olive oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yoopress.com/en/winenews/wine-economypolitics/wine-lay-order/1605.Carapelli_scandal_Journalist_Andreas_Maerz_acquitted.html |website=Yoopress.com |title=Carapelli scandal: Journalist Andreas März acquitted |date=18 August 2009|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, when Carapelli's Extra Virgin Olive Oil the olive oils identified as mislabeled as Extra Virgin in a study by researchers at [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/research/files/oliveoilfinal071410updated.pdf|title=Tests indicate that imported "extra virgin"olive oil often fails international and USDA standards|date=July 2010|publisher=UC Davis Olive Center|access-date=2015-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226075252/http://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/research/files/oliveoilfinal071410updated.pdf#|archive-date=2015-02-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Carapelli were once again investigated by the Italian authorities and found guilty of passing off lower quality oil as extra virgin olive oil. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11988947/Italian-companies-investigated-for-passing-off-ordinary-olive-oil-as-extra-virgin.html|title=Italian olive oil scandal: seven top brands 'sold fake extra-virgin' |date=11 November 2015|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Carapelli responded to the accusations by stating that the news on the fake olive oil, that were based on a study made in 2010 by the University of California Davis Olive Center, were not true and that the study was completely discredited by the International Olive Council (IOC) through several statements (see statements in here &lt;ref&gt;http://deoleo.com/english-carapelli-official-statement-against-fake-olive-oil-news/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; , since the methodology used was not in line with the IOC standards.

'''Ceriani''', formerly '''Arces''', was an Italian company that designed and fabricated [[motorcycle]] frames and [[Suspension (motorcycle)|suspensions]]. The company was founded by Arturo Ceriani in 1951.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Arces is an acronym derived from '''A'''rturo '''Ce'''riani [[Società a Responsabilità Limitata|'''S'''.r.l.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U_taRN9B4HIC&amp;pg=PA70 |page=70 |title= Motorbike Suspensions: Modern design and optimisation |first1=  Dario |last1= Croccolo|first2= Massimiliano |last2= Agostinis |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year= 2013 |ISBN=9781447151494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European motorcycle industry, it was common for many smaller parts companies to exist, each responsible for creating individual parts to later be assembled into a complete motorcycle.  Within a few years of its creation, Ceriani's company was able to successfully make a name for itself by manufacturing components noted for their quality and vision.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1964, under the leadership of Arturo's son Enrico Ceriani, the companies operations were expanded.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Enrico accelerated the expansion by moving the company to a new and more modern plant in [[Samarate]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} From 1964 the company was known within the industry as ARCES (an acronym of ARturo CEriani Samarate) but the [[brand identity]] was maintained and the company continued to be known as Ceriani by [[consumer]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

A central development in the new plant was the creation of a team that was dedicated to studying and designing new solutions for the suspension systems and frames of [[Motorcycle racing|competition motorcycles]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the late 1960s, Ceriani began to produce an innovative new type of fork slider made of a light [[alloy]] for use in competition and a revolutionary type of telescopic hydraulic suspension that was originally used on [[motocross]] bikes but was later applied to [[types of motorcycle#Street|street motorcycles]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The demand for the new suspension was so high that ARCES output had doubled compared to the year before.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}  The new technology exploded onto the market and by 1972 Ceriani had sold 100,000 suspension units, 30,000 to competition motorcycles and 70,000 to consumer street bikes. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the late 1970s, Ceriani experienced a rapid and unexpected decline during the overall crisis in the European manufacturing sector due to increased demand that stressed the capabilities of smaller companies.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Other companies were able to successfully adapt and fill the [[niche market|niche]] of competition motorcycle parts manufacturing that was left vacant by Ceriani's inability to effectively meet rising [[demand]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Ceriani was not able to recover to the changing market and their plant closed down in 1980.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The prestigious Ceriani [[brand name]] was bought in 1997 by Italian motorcycle parts maker [[Paioli]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''Hayden Kho Jr.''' (born May 20, 1980) is a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] cosmetic doctor, entrepreneur, actor and model.

==Biography==

At the age of 16, Kho started his career in ramp [[Model (person)|modeling]] while pursuing a degree in [[medical technology]]. This stint brought him to places like New York City, Singapore, Korea and Japan. Following the footsteps of his father, Hayden Kho, Sr, he earned his degree in Medicine and Surgery from the [[University of Santo Tomas]]. He completed his internship at the [[Makati Medical Center]] where he held the position of President of the Medical Interns. Kho also completed his training in anti-aging medicine through the European Anti-Aging Medicine Society (Paris). In Manila, Kho practiced specific cosmetic dermatology and surgery procedures under the organization of the Belo Medical Group, owned by [[Vicki Belo]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 2007, Kho started appearing on Philippine national television as an actor. His career in show business was interrupted when it was reported that Kho had tried to commit suicide in December 2008. In 2009, sex videos of himself with other local and foreign celebrities were distributed over the internet without his knowledge and consent. Shortly thereafter, Kho was brought to a senate hearing and was tried publicly on national television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/video/42403/24oras/hayden-kho-katrina-halili-attend-senate-hearing|title=Hayden Kho, Katrina Halili attend Senate hearing|work=gmanetwork.com|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This saga lasted for years and resulted to criminal and civil cases filed against Kho by one of the involved parties, Filipina actress [[Katrina Halili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Thomas|title=Philippines gripped by actress's affair with Doctor Hunk|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/5400332/Philippines-gripped-by-actresss-affair-with-Doctor-Hunk.html|work=The Telegraph|date=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]] tagged this controversy as the most controversial sex scandal in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/none/sex-scandals-asia-139410|title=Asia's top 5 celebrity sex scandals - CNN Travel|work=cnn.com|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine Board of Medicine revoked Kho's license to practice medicine and cited unethical behavior as the basis for his expulsion from the medical society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/entertainment/hayden-kho-loses-appeal-to-regain-medical-license/|title=Hayden Kho loses medical license for good|work=interaksyon.com|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year, Kho tried to commit suicide for the second time.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

In 2013, Kho met with Christian philosopher and apologist [[Ravi Zacharias]] in a serendipitous event hosted by some leaders of the [[Christ Commission Fellowship]] (CCF) in Manila and later became a devoted [[Christianity|Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/2014/05/25/1326835/after-two-suicide-attempts-hayden-kho-finds-meaning-newfound|title=After two suicide attempts, Hayden Kho finds meaning in newfound spirituality|first=Wilson Lee|last=Flores|work=philstar.com|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is being mentored by Zacharias and by the CCF movement founder, Pastor Peter Tan-Chi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/160603/the-new-hayden-kho-jr-im-not-yet-where-i-want-to-be-but-im-no-longer-who-i-used-to-be/comment-page-5?PageSpeed=noscript|title=The new Hayden Kho Jr: I’m not yet where I want to be, but I’m no longer who I used to be|first=Alex Y.|last=Vergara|work=inquirer.net|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9520">'''Institute of Corporate Directors''' ('''ICD''') is primarily an institute of, for and by corporate directors established in the [[Philippines]]. It is made up mainly of individuals and [[reputational agent]]s committed to the professional practice of corporate directorship in line with global principles of modern [[corporate governance]].

==About ICD==

It is a non-stock, not-for-profit organization working in close partnership with other business, government and civil society organizations. As an independent and autonomous institute, it is open to working with others in the pursuit of systemic corporate governance reforms by networking with various institutes all over East Asia to enrich Director Education and share best practices in corporate governance.

ICD certifies those who have qualified as '''Fellows''' of the Institute. It caters to the continuing professional needs of its Fellows by setting standards for the professional practice of corporate directorship. It conducts advocacy programs designed to foster good governance and responsible citizenship.

ICD is active in conducting research and developing training materials for corporate directors and other professionals committed to the practice of modern corporate governance.  It offers training programs that promote the knowledge, skills, and values demanded by modern corporate governance. Thus, ICD regularly conducts the C'''orporate Governance Orientation Course (CGOP)''' as well as other programs on related subjects. Its flagship program is the '''Professional Directors Program (PDP)''', which is the first step towards becoming a Fellow of the Institute.

As an added service, ICD assists in the formulation and implementation of corporate governance improvement programs among organizations by facilitating institutional '''Governance Retreats''' for boards. ICD also assists in the formulation and implementation of corporate governance improvement programs in specific boards where its members serve. This includes the creation of Board and Director '''Performance Evaluation Systems''', '''Continuing Education Programs''', and the like.

Another of ICD's important contributions is the development of the annual '''Corporate Governance Scorecards'''.

ICD is a major player in Philippine corporate governance reform initiatives working closely with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, The Global Corporate Governance Forum, and International Corporate Governance Network on improving actual boardroom practices: moving away from principles into actual practices.

It works closely with key regulators with direct immediate interest in corporate governance: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Insurance Commission.

It is a founding member of the Institutes of Directors in East Asia Network (IDEA.Net).

==Corporate Governance Scorecard Project==

ICD proposed the Corporate Governance Scorecard Project (CG-Sc) as an East Asian regional initiative to:
* promote transparency and accountability, and the general practice of Good Corporate Governance, and
* provide a standard method for measurement, ranking and progress tracking of Corporate Governance practices.

Through the Institutes of Directors in East Asia (IDEA.net) and with the Thai Institute of Directors (IoD) volunteering to take charge of moving the initiative forward, five East Asian economies - namely Thailand, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and the Philippines  - adopted this project.

Since 2005, the CG Scorecard created by ICD has been uniquely tailored in order to incorporate specific needs of the Philippines’ local corporate setting. In doing so, the ICD and its fellow proponents hope to promote corporate governance awareness in various business sectors.

The [[Center for International Private Enterprise]] (CIPE) in Washington, D.C., a private organization which promotes market-enterprise among developing nations through business reforms is instrumental in the funding of this project.

==Performance Governance System==

ICD has launched Performance Governance System (PGS), modified and adopted from Kaplan and Norton's [[Balanced Scorecard]], to promote higher standards of corporate governance practices within institutions. Through the systematized framework, complemented by a carefully designed and tailor-made support service, the PGS aims to help institutional partners achieve higher levels of business performance driven by a properly functioning governance mechanism and centered on strategy formulation and strategy execution. The end goal is to sustain the promotion of a governance culture at al levels, founded upon ethics and social responsibility, which positively impacts the use of corporate strategy to achieve breakthrough performance.

The four phases:
*1. Initiation

==Training programs==

'''Corporate Governance Orientation Program (CGOP)'''

The Institute of Corporate Directors offers a one-day Orientation Course once every quarter. A preparatory course for the Professional Directors Program (PDP), the discussions and structured learning in this one-day interactive program will examine the responsibilities of directors and the collective role of the board, and explore pointers for performance as practical tools to make the board work more effectively. Designed to familiarize directors and top management with Corporate Governance in the Philippine setting, this course focuses on: the principles of Good Governance, Best Practices, and Finance. An additional half-day session on Audit, Risk, and Governance Committees is made available especially for individuals in the banking or financial sector. Exclusive runs are also conducted for companies that require more customized sessions.

'''Professional Directors Program (PDP)'''

The PDP is an intensive 5-day course which includes an orientation course (the Corporate Governance Orientation Program (CGOP)), plus whole day, interactive sessions on: Strategy, Policy, Monitoring, and Accountability. This program, which seeks to provide a deeper appreciation of the demands of professional directorship, is offered once every quarter. ICD accredits corporate directors committed to enhancing the long-term value of the corporation they serve through the observance of corporate governance principles, ethics and social responsibility. The PDP is the first step towards becoming a Fellow of the Institute.

'''Board Retreat'''

For Boards who seek to systematically plot their course towards the fourth phase of the PGS (Institutionalization), this 2-3 day working session is aimed at "roadmapping" and developing clear action programs that are geared towards bringing the corporation’s governance system to international standards. This completes the first phase (Initiation) and helps the company to transition to the second phase of the Performance Governance System (Compliance.)

'''Specialized Modules and Working Sessions'''

Specialized courses on Audit Committees, Risk Management Committees, Governance Committees, Corporate Secretaries, Compliance Officers, Financial Numeracy for Directors, and the like are offered. Customized courses on governance and professional directorship are likewise available for individuals, corporations, organizations and groups.

==Services==

'''Performance Evaluation System'''

The ICD provides advice and technical assistance in the development and implementation of Performance Evaluation Systems, mainly for the Board and its committees, tailored to the needs and specifications of the client.

'''CG Scorecard Result Presentations'''

The Corporate Governance Scorecard Project provides a standard against which companies can measure their practices. Board presentations allow the directors to see which particular areas need improvement and how best to implement the appropriate reforms. The ICD has also launched two related programs: Raising the Scores and Broadening Participation. These support ICD’s goal of increasing the number of participating companies as well as helping companies improve their practices and as a corollary, improve their scores.

'''Board Advisory and Consultation'''

The ICD may also serve as advisor or consultant for various purposes or issues related to corporate governance.

==Other activities==

The ICD regularly conducts:
*Monthly Roundtables
*ICD Annual Dinner
*ICD Annual Working Session

'''William Jackson "Jack" Pitney''' (January 5, 1963 &amp;ndash; August 26, 2010) was an American marketing executive with [[BMW]] as vice president of marketing, where he played a major role in convincing company leadership to go ahead with distribution of the [[Mini (marque)|MINI]] in the United States, despite concerns that car buyers there would not buy cars that small given the popularity of [[sport utility vehicle]]s.

Pitney was born in 1963 in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and earned his undergraduate degree from [[Occidental College]], where he majored in political science. He worked in the public relations and advertising field, and was hired in 1988 by the [[Grey Global Group|GCI Group]], where he worked on a 1990 advertising campaign for [[Infiniti]]. At [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] he worked on the [[Mazda North American Operations|Mazda Motor of America]] account and later was hired by Mazda as its manager of corporate communications.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Grimes, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/business/media/28pitney.html "Jack Pitney, Who Made Much of the MINI, Dies at 47"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 27, 2010. Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitney was hired by BMW of North America in 1995 as head of corporate communications, where he developed advertising campaigns for its high-performance vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.detnews.com/article/20100827/AUTO01/8270423/1361/BMW-mourns-loss-of-Jack-Pitney "BMW mourns loss of Jack Pitney"], ''[[The Detroit News]]'', August 27, 2010. Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; BMW developed the Mini in 2001 as a successor to the original [[Mini]], which enjoyed a cult following in the 1960s. BMW executives were reluctant to market the car in the United States, presuming that car buyers in that country would be unlikely to purchase a car so small given the widespread prevalence of SUVs.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; In 2001, Pitney was named as general manager for the Mini line.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/17/business/executive-changes-470759.html "EXECUTIVE CHANGES"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 17, 2001. Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The company agreed to market the car in the U.S. with very low expectations, but Pitney developed a marketing campaign together with [[Crispin Porter + Bogusky]] that used [[viral marketing]] on the web and featured billboards promoting the car under the catchphrases "The SUV Backlash Officially Starts Now" and "0% Body Fat". By the March 2002 American launch date for the Mini, 53% of people were aware of the brand and 50,000 people had expressed potential interest on the company's website in buying the car.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

The Mini was positioned at a higher price than many comparably sized vehicles, but was promoted as a car that could be accessorized by its owners.&lt;ref name=SLObit&gt;Perone, Joseph R.

Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognized as one of the few car division heads to come from the advertising side of the business ''[[Automotive News]]'' selected Pitney as one of its two Marketers of the Year in January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-96556480.html "MINI marketing chief proves them wrong; A marketer of the year helps car surpass sales expectations"], ''[[Automotive News]]'', January 13, 2003. Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual sales reached 30,000, exceeding initial projections by 50%.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The success of the MINI earned Pitney a promotion to Vice President of Marketing, where he was responsible for multiple launches including the new [[BMW 1 Series]], the [[BMW X6]], the [[BMW 7 Series]], the [[BMW Z4]], [[BMW diesel engines]], and the [[BMW 5 Series]].

As of September 1, 2010, he was supposed to assume the post of Vice President of BMW's Eastern region, where he would have overseen the 93 dealerships on the [[East Coast of the United States]], including the many centered in the [[New York metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==Death==
A resident of [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]], Pitney died at age 47 on August 26, 2010, when the tractor he was riding while on vacation at his farm in [[Durham, New York]] overturned on him while pulling out a tree stump.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He was found by officers of the [[Greene County, New York]] Sheriff's Department trapped underneath the tractor and was pronounced dead at the scene.&lt;ref name=SLObit/&gt; He was survived by his wife and five children.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''Jacob Fegth''' (also spelled '''Feght''') (born 18 September 1761 at Tangen, Drammen, died 2 October 1834 at Tangen, Drammen) was a Norwegian timber merchant and ship-owner, and one of the largest timber merchants of [[Drammen]] in the early 19th century.

He was the son of [[wig]]maker Christian Nicolay Fegth (1722–1766) from [[Halden|Frederikshald]], whose family was probably of Dutch origin (the family name might derive from the river [[Vecht (Utrecht)|Vecht]]).

The townhouse ''Feghtgården'' was built for him in 1806, designed by architect [[Christian Staalberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historieboka.no/Modules/historiebok_tidsepoke_tema_artikkel.aspx?ObjectType=Article&amp;Article.ID=2750&amp;Category.ID=1511 «Staalberg, Christian – arkitekt for sin tid»], ''Historieboka.no''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1808, he bought the estate Stormoen outside Drammen. He owned several sawmills, a distillery, ships and other properties in Drammen. By the early 19th century, he had become Drammen's third largest timber merchant.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson, Odd, ''Drammen : en norsk østlandsbys utviklingshistorie'', Vol. 2, pp. 461–462, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; He was also Public Guardian (''overformynder'') of [[Strømsø]] from 1802 to 1807. He was one the around fifty prominent private citizens in Norway who contributed funds to the establishment of the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]]; he contributed 5,000 [[Norwegian rigsdaler]].&lt;ref&gt;Per Otto Borgen (2004). "Jacob Fegth," in: ''[[Drammen byleksikon]]'' (2nd ed.), ed.

He was the father-in-law of ship owner and estate owner Anders Juel (1787–1852), ship's captain and privateer [[Bent Salvesen]] (1787–1820) and ship owner Mathias Andreas Holst (1793–1849). He has descendants with names including Fegth, Juel, Salvesen, Holst, [[Paus]], Høeg, Prytz, Browne, Kapteijn, [[Løvenskiold]], Wessel, and other names.

The '''James H. Doolittle Award''' is an honor presented annually by the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]]. It is an award for "outstanding accomplishment in technical management or engineering achievement in aerospace technology". The award consists of a perpetual trophy on permanent display at SETP headquarters, and a smaller replica presented to the recipient. It is named after [[Jimmy Doolittle|General James Doolittle]], famous for the [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo during World War II.&lt;ref name=Criteria&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setp.org/criteria/james-h-doolittle-award.html |title=James H. Doolittle Award Criteria |publisher=Setp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doolittle Trophy is a [[bronze]] form melding an aerodynamic shape, a stylized spacecraft, and a winged human figure. The aerodynamic shape stands for the scientists and engineers who provide technological breakthroughs. The spacecraft represents continued growth of the  aerospace industry. The human figure represents the pilot who guides the test effort to reach its goals. A [[helmet]] and [[goggles]] rest on the base of the trophy symbolizing the tools of the early test pilot and Jimmy Doolittle himself. Plaques bearing the name of each honoree are mounted around the sides of the [[teak]] base.&lt;ref name=SETP_56th&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title=SETP 56th Awards Banquet Program |publisher=Society of Experimental Test Pilots |location=Lancaster, California |date=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Criswick''' (born December 1, 1963) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] entrepreneur focused on [[Mobile Entertainment|mobile entertainment]] and [[mobile software]].

== Biography ==
After receiving his [[electrical engineering]] degree from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1986, Criswick worked as a [[software engineer]] for the space hardware maker Canadian Astronautics (purchased by [[EMS Technologies]]). In the early 1990s, Criswick studied space physics at [[York University]] and after obtaining his [[Master's degree]], he worked at an [[observatory]] in [[Utah]]. In 1991 he spent the summer in [[Toulouse]], [[France]] at the [[International Space University]], immersed in a multidisciplinary program of study centered on [[space technology]].

In 1997, Criswick was contracted by [[Nortel|Nortel Networks]] to source an [[Internet browser]] that was agile enough to work on a [[mobile device]]. When he discovered there was nothing compatible on the market, he and fellow engineer Bob Tennant asked to let them build a browser from scratch. Nortel agreed to fund the project, but by the end of 1997, Criswick and Tennant had decided to form their own company, Beduin Communications. Nortel became Beduin's first customer, paying $120,000 for a license to use the technology and in 1998, Beduin Communications' personal [[Java (programming language)|Java]] browser technology was purchased by [[Sun Microsystems]] for $20 million U.S. in stock (which subsequently more than tripled in value). In 2001, he co-founded Rove Mobile (previously known as Idokorro Mobile and Planetfred), a company that specializes in [[network administration]] and [[remote desktop software|remote access]] solutions for [[handheld devices]].

In 2002 he co-founded Magmic Games, a [[smartphone]] game publisher of which he is currently CEO. He also runs a number of Web media companies under the moniker Smoke Labs and is the owner of The Mercury Lounge in [[Ottawa]]. He was a co-founder of [[Zucotto Wireless]], a company which designed chips for wireless devices.

The [[Asteroid belt|main-belt]] [[asteroid]] named [[29348 Criswick]], discovered in 1995 by [[David D. Balam]], is named after him.

He has signed up for one of [[Virgin Galactic]]'s trips to space, which brought him coverage in [[The Globe and Mail]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Trevisan |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Three, two, one - commence bragging.

'''Jollibee''' is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] multinational chain of [[fast food restaurant]]s owned by [[Jollibee Foods Corporation]] (JFC). As of April 2018, JFC had a total of about 1,200 Jollibee outlets worldwide.&lt;ref name=Europe&gt;{{cite news|title=Jollibee lands in Europe|url=http://malaya.com.ph/business-news/living/jollibee-lands-europe|accessdate=6 April 2018|work=Malaya Business Insights|date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with presence in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Hong Kong, North America, Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/blockbuster-lines-greet-jollibees-first-store-opening-in-milan-italy/|title=Blockbuster lines greet Jollibee’s first store opening in Milan, Italy |website=Businessmirror.com.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7540914/jollibee-london-asian-kfc-chicken-joy/|title=Epic 18-HOUR queues as opening of 'Asian KFC' 🐔 shop Jollibee sparks huge crowds in London|date=2018-10-20|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1975, [[Tony Tan (entrepreneur)|Tony Tan Caktiong]] and  his family opened a [[Magnolia (brand)|Magnolia]] [[ice cream parlor]] in [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]].&lt;ref name=Marketing&gt;{{Cite book|last=Go |first=Josiah |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Fundamentals of Marketing: In The Philippine Setting |year=2001 |publisher=Design Plus |location=Quezon road, [[Philippines]] |isbn=971-91860-5-4  | pages =1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JollibeeMilestonesHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jollibee.com.ph/about-us#milestones-history|title=About Us «  Jollibee Foods Corporation|website=Jollibee.com.ph|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outlet later began offering hot meals and sandwiches upon request from customers. When the food items became more popular than ice cream, the family decided to convert the ice cream parlor into a [[fast food restaurant]] which became the first Jollibee outlet in 1978.&lt;ref name="wipo"&gt;{{cite news|title=From Ice Cream Parlor to Fast Food Empire: Tony Tan Caktiong’s Story|url=http://www.wipo.int/ipadvantage/en/details.jsp?id=2531|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=WIPO|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Management consultant Manuel C. Lumba advised the family on the change in strategy.&lt;ref name=Marketing/&gt;

The company that would be managing the chain of fast food, Jollibee Foods Corporation was incorporated in January 1978.{{refn|The JFC states that its date of incorporation was on January 28, 1978&lt;ref name="jfc2012"&gt;{{cite journal|title=2012 Annual Report|page=3|url=http://www.jollibee.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2012-Annual-Report.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2017|publisher=Jollibee Foods Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] list the date of incorporation as January 11, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Information - Jollibee Foods Corporation|url=http://edge.pse.com.ph/companyInformation/form.do?cmpy_id=86|website=Philippine Stock Exchange|publisher=Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc.|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"|name="incorporation"}} By the end of that year, there were seven branches in Metro Manila. The first franchised outlet of Jollibee opened in [[Santa Cruz, Manila]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=milestonesasof2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones &amp; History|url=http://www.jollibee.com.ph/about-us/milestones-history/|website=Jollibee.com.ph|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jollibee experienced rapid growth. It was able to withstand the entry of [[McDonald's]] in the Philippines in 1981 by focusing on the specific tastes of the Filipino market, which differed from the American fast food company.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news|title=Acquired tastes|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21685465-tenacious-filipino-burger-chain-tries-different-way-conquer-world-acquired-tastes|accessdate=12 January 2016|publisher=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Jollibee store overseas opened in Taiwan in 1986 which is now closed.&lt;ref name=milestone/&gt; Jollibee continued to expand and set up outlets both within the country and abroad.

Jollibee, a large anthropomorphic bee mascot dressed in a blazer, shirt, and chef's hat introduced by the brand in 1980.&lt;ref name="milestoneoct2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestone &amp; History|url=http://www.jollibee.com.ph/about-us/milestones-history/|publisher=Jollibee|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mascot Jollibee was designed to epitomize Filipino optimism. Tony Tan, chairman and founder has compared the mascot's character to the Filipino [[Working class|working folk]] reasoning that the bee "hops around and produces sweet things for life, and is happy even though it is busy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A busy bee in the hamburger hive|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1011021/|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=The Economist|date=28 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jollitown''===
{{main article|Jollitown}}
On April 13, 2008, a children's television program called ''Jollitown'' was launched. The timing was chosen to highlight Jollibee's 30th anniversary. Jollibee and his friends: Yum the scientist, Twirlie the star performer, Hetty the cheerleader and Popo the gym coach are the stars of the show, which airs Sundays, 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. or 8:00 on [[GMA Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aguilar|first=Dheza Marie|date=May 17, 2008|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/The-Jollibee-gang-hits-television/artikulo/35340/|title=The Jollibee gang hits television|publisher=[[Manila Standard Today]]|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, 2011, ''Jollitown'' moved to [[ABS-CBN]] for its 4th and 5th season every Sunday at 9 am (every Sunday). On July 20, 2013, the show moved back to [[GMA Network]] for The Jollitown Kids Show or Jollitown Season 6 until it ended on October 12, which spanned for almost 5 years.

[[File:Gurgel BR-800.JPG|thumb|280px|right|&lt;center&gt;Gurgel BR-800&lt;center&gt;]]
'''João Augusto Conrado do Amaral Gurgel''' (1926–2009) was a [[Brazil]]ian businessman. In 1969, he decided to start a very small factory, producing small cars. Early models were fiberglass bodies installed on Volkswagen Beetle (fusca) chassis and machinery. Gurgel introduced Brazil's first domestically designed car, the BR-800, but went out of business in the 1990s. João do Amaral Gurgel was known as João Gurgel. He was the founder of [[Gurgel]]. His complete name was João Augusto Conrado do Amaral Gurgel(3).

==Bankruptcy==
The real cause of João Gurgel's bankruptcy was very bad commercial decisions,  with new policies by the Brazilian government from March 1990. While under total protectionism (1969-1989), Gurgel had prosperity, having as much an important part of Brazilian jeep's market. In the late 1980s, then Brazilian president José Sarney granted very big loan (without guarantees) to Gurgel, from a Brazilian state bank. He also got a special and very low level of value tax to his small car, the [[Gurgel BR-800]].(1)

The end for Gurgel began when president Fernando Collor went to office in March, 1990. Collor opened the Brazilian car market to foreign cars. Even though the import tax was 85%, the Gurgel Carajás was more expensive than Lada Niva, an SUV from then Soviet Union. The Gurgel's SUV's went out of the market. The last [[Gurgel Carajás]] was produced in January, 1991. In 1990, [[Fernando Collor]] also reduced the IPI (a Brazilian value tax) of Uno Mille to 20% and sent the same level of tax to Gurgel BR-800.(1)

==Comparisons==
By any measure, Fiat's Uno Mille, a 1000cc car, was more powerful and spacious than Gurgel BR-800. The price of both models was then similar. BR-800's sales dropped to almost nothing in 1990. In 1992, Gurgel launched a car based on Gurgel BR-800, the Gurgel Supermini. Like its similar model, the Supermini's sales were very low. Fernando Collor refused to grant a loan (without guarantees) of about US$80,000,000 from BNDES to Gurgel. Even so, Gurgel got two loans; both of them from state's governments. One from BEC (then bank of Brazilian state of Ceará) and other loan from Banespa - then bank of Brazilian state of São Paulo. Again, both loans didn't have any guarantee. Even with these generous loans, the Gurgel's sales remained very small. In fact they fell unstoptable between 1990 and 1993. Just about 1,500 Supermini Gurgel's cars were produced, in 1992 and 1993.(1)

In 1995, Gurgel's final bankruptcy was decreed. Gurgel's assets were less than 3% of its debt. In fact, Gurgel's assets were not even enough to pay its former workers. The Brazilian site http://www.gurgelbrasil.com/GURGEL-Jornal-do-Carro_PAG1.htm claims that Gurgel's debt was about US$1,200,000,000. Between 1969 and 1993, Gurgel launched about 12 new vehicles. One of them was the first Brazilian electric car in commercial production, a complete commercial failure. With the sole exception of "Xavante X" and series produced mainly in 1970 decade, no Gurgel product had any commercial success. The "Tocantins" was transformed into "Gurgel Carajás". This vehicle was the leader in sales among off-road vehicles in Brazil, until 1990. Carajás "SUV" was so bad and expensive that when the importation of Lada Niva was authorized in 1990, by Fernando Collor, the Gurgel Carajás went out of production within a few months. Lada Niva got almost all Gurgel Carajás' market even though Lada Niva had to pay an import tax of 85% in 1990. Lada Niva was better and cheaper than Gurgel Carajás. Lada Niva also was a real 4 x 4 drive, while all Gurgel's SUV's were 4 x 2. The Gurgel BR-800 and Gurgel Supermini were both worse than Fiat's Uno Mille, far less spacious, powerful and more uncomfortable.(1)

In 1991, João Gurgel had one of his last ideas. The decided to start the [[Gurgel Delta]] a small car, for only two persons(4). His idea was to build plants in the States of Ceará and São Paulo, having both States as investment partners, inspired by the well succeeded example given by the partnership between the Italian carmaker Fiat and the State of Minas Gerais. Both State governments failed in providing the promised investments. Without resources, João Gurgel appealed to the Federal government, but the [[Brazil]]ian President Fernando Collor refused to give loans of about US$80,000,000 from BNDES and US$25,000,000 from SUDENE. The terrible situation of his industry sent it to bankruptcy in 1994.

==Controversy==
Even today, João Gurgel remains with followers, claiming that he was sent to bankruptcy by politicians. Between 1976 and 1990 was out of law to import jeeps or in fact, any kind of vehicle in Brazil. Even, so in 1990, the tax to import a jeep in Brazil was about 85%. Until Gurgel's bankruptcy, Brazilian press gave all possible support to João Gurgel. In fact, he was flattered by Brazilian press and for more than twenty years. His vehicles were expensive, mainly because they were practically made by hand. The Brazilian press was always saying that João Gurgel would be the Brazilian [[Henry Ford]] of the future. João Gurgel was also a popular figure. In 1987-1988 he launched a crusade to get money from partners. Buying shares for something around US$4,500.00, the new shareholderes would be entitled to be the first owners of the new car that would be produced by his industry (BR-800 model). Those shareholders did indeed receive their BR-800 car.

João Gurgel was admired as a brilliant engineer, but not as a manager. The site [http://www.gurgelbrasil.com/GURGEL-Jornal-do-Carro_PAG1.htm Default] claims that João Gurgel default was about US$1,200,000,000, in 1994. As a consequence of the bankruptcy, suppliers of parts of his small vehicles and even workers weren't paid.

In the middle 90's, João Gurgel was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He died on January 30, 2009, always surrounded by his family, which lives in São Paulo. Another [[Brazil]]ian, Paulo Emílio Lemos that never knew João Gurgel started a small factory of small agriculture's vehicles some years ago, also called Gurgel(2). Except the name and logo, the new "Gurgel" has nothing with the old Gurgel founded by this Brazilian businessman. Differently from João Gurgel's industry, the new "Gurgel" does not produce any single Brazilian vehicle, but merely resells Chinese products.

In November 2017, investigations of the [[Paradise Papers]] revealed that, in 2010, Napout created a company in the Bahamas the day he started to receive bribes from the Datisa (the consortium handling football broadcasting rights in Paraguay). A proxy bank account based in Switzerland was also set under his wife's name (Ruth Forster) to wire the money from the Bahamas to a European account and reroute it back to Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [https://www.eluniverso.com/deportes/2017/11/06/nota/6466732/dinero-sobornos-transferidos-esposa Dinero de sobornos, transferidos por esposa de Juan Ángel Napout], ''Eluniverso'', 6 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.notimerica.com/deportes/noticia-juan-angel-napout-aparece-paradise-papers-mismo-dia-inicia-juicio-sobornos-fifa-gate-20171108122024.html Juan Ángel Napout aparece en 'Paradise Papers' el mismo día que se inicia su juicio por los sobornos del 'FIFA Gate'], ''Notimerica.com'', 8 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he allegedly received 1 million dollars in bribes on the [[Copa América 2015]] deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}}

'''Konga.com''' is a Nigerian [[e-commerce]] company founded in July 2012 with headquarters in [[Gbagada]], [[Lagos State]]. It offers a third-party [[online marketplace]], as well as first-party direct retail spanning various categories including consumer electronics, fashion, home appliances, books, children's items, health care and personal care products.

==History==
Konga was founded in July 2012 by [[Sim Shagaya]], with 20 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3f455b7e-b1bb-11e2-9315-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3RU9JEu86 | title=Internet sales flourish in Nigeria | work=FinancialTimes | date=14 May 2013 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after launching in 2012, Konga raised a $3.5 million seed round from [[Investment AB Kinnevik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/konga-online-shopping-limited | title=Konga funding rounds | work=CrunchBase | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site initially functioned as a Lagos-only online retailer focused on merchandise in the Baby, Beauty, and Personal Care categories, but broadened its scope to all of Nigeria in December 2012 and gradually expanded merchandise categories through 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://innovation-village.com/konga-goes-nationwide-today/ | title=Konga goes nationwide today | work=Innovation Village | date=3 December 2012 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion may have been a response to Konga's major competitor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bits.ng/2012/08/nigerias-online-retailer-kasuwa-com-becomes-jumia/] {{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocket Internet backed [[Jumia]], which launched around the same time and was functional across all categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ogbongeblog.com/2012/08/jumiacomng-launches-in-nigeria.html|title=JUMIA.com.ng Launches in Nigeria|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, Konga raised a $10 million Series A round from [[Investment AB Kinnevik]] and [[Naspers]]. In Q2 2013, Konga beta-tested 'Konga Mall,' opening up the Konga platform to third-party retailers and moving away from a pure first-party online retail model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://techloy.com/2013/04/09/konga-mall/ | title=Konga Wants Entrepreneurs To Own An Online Store On Its Mall | work=TechLoy | date=9 April 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, Konga finalized a $25 million Series B round from previous investors, [[Investment AB Kinnevik]] and [[Naspers]], the largest single round raised by a single African startup at the time.&lt;ref name=TechCabal2014&gt;{{cite web | url=http://techcabal.com/2014/01/03/exclusive-konga-raises-25-million-dollar-series-b-kinnevik-naspers/ | title=Exclusive: Online Store, Konga, Raises 25 Million Dollar Series B From Kinnevik And Naspers | work=TechCabal | date=3 January 2014 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, 2013, Konga.com crashed and remained offline for 45 minutes as a result of unprecedented traffic stemming from its [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] promotion.&lt;ref name="IPO"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.humanipo.com/news/37500/konga-com-crashes-during-online-promotion/ | title=Konga.com crashes during online promotion | work=HumanIPO | date=2 December 2013 | accessdate=24 December 2013 | author=Mulligan, Gabriella}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/nigerian-retailers-fight-for-online-shoppers/ | title=Nigerian retailers fight for online shoppers | work=Business Day | date=24 December 2013 | accessdate=24 December 2013 | author=Uzor Jr, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/online-sales-boom-as-konga-jumia-lure-shoppers/ | title=Online sales boom as Konga, Jumia lure shoppers | work=Business Day | date=6 December 2013 | accessdate=24 December 2013 |author1=Atuanya, Patrick |author2=Augie, Bala }}&lt;/ref&gt; Konga sold more during the first six hours of the promotion than it did in the prior month.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/faraigundan/2015/01/07/sim-shagaya-on-building-the-next-big-thing-konga-africas-version-of-alibaba-part-one/ | title=Sim Shagaya: On Building The Next Big Thing, Konga, Africa's Version Of Alibaba - Part One | work=Forbes | date=7 January 2015 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Konga officially launched its third-party retail platform in the first half of 2014, rebranding it as 'Marketplace' from 'Konga Mall'; by the end of 2014, Konga's Marketplace featured 8,000 merchants, beating internal targets of 1,000 merchants eight-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/faraigundan/2015/01/14/sim-shagaya-on-building-the-next-big-thing-konga-africas-version-of-alibaba-part-two/ | title=Sim Shagaya: On Building The Next Big Thing, Konga, Africa's Version Of Alibaba - Part Two | work=Forbes | date=14 January 2015 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Konga received USD $3.5 million worth of orders during its 2014 [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] promotion, compared to USD $300,000 during the promotion in the previous year.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; Konga reportedly grew 2014 revenue 450% from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fortune.com/2015/02/16/nigeria-internet-startups/ | title=Why Africa may be on the verge of an Internet boom | work=Fortune | date=16 February 2015 | accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, Konga finalized a $40 million Series C round from [[Investment AB Kinnevik]] and [[Naspers]], the largest single round raised by a single African startup to date.&lt;ref name=TechCabal2014/&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2018}} Despite reports that [[Naspers]] acquired 50% of Konga in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ventures-africa.com/2013/03/naspers-acquires-50-holding-in-nigerian-online-retailer-konga-com/ | title=Naspers Acquires 50% Stake In Nigerian Online Retailer Konga.com|website=Ventures-africa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://techmoran.com/developing-story-naspers-buys-50-percent-of-nigerias-konga-com | title=Developing Story: Naspers Buys 50 Percent Of Nigeria’s Konga.com|website=Techmoran.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; publicly traded [[Naspers]] disclosed that its stake in Konga after the October 2014 Series C investment was 40.22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naspers.com/pdf/financials/interim-results/2015/interim-results-english.pdf | title=Naspers 2015 Interim Report |format=PDF|website=Naspers.com |date=30 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Konga was reportedly valued at approximately $200 million as of the Series C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://innovation-village.com/with-about-60million-new-funds-konga-com-market-value-stands-around-200-million/ | title=WITH ABOUT $60MILLION NEW FUNDS, KONGA.COM MARKET VALUE STANDS AROUND $200 MILLION|website=Innovation-village.com | date=8 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Konga was ranked as the most visited website in Nigeria by [[Alexa Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/konga-now-most-visited-nigerian-site/200240/ | title=Konga Now Most Visited Nigerian Site | work=ThisDayLive | date=27 January 2015 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CEO Sim Shagaya, Konga "leads the field in Nigeria today [early 2015] in Gross Merchandise Value," a metric measuring the total value of merchandise sold through a particular marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/faraigundan/2015/01/07/sim-shagaya-on-building-the-next-big-thing-konga-africas-version-of-alibaba-part-one/ | title=Sim Shagaya: On Building The Next Big Thing, Konga, Africa's Version Of Alibaba - Part One | work=Forbes | date=7 January 2014 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Konga announced it acquired the assets and mobile money license of Zinternet Nigeria Limited in June 2015, thereby meeting the Central Bank of Nigeria's legal requirement for the provision of mobile payment services. The acquisition will support KongaPay, launched in August 2015, Konga's solution to facilitate uptake of cashless electronic payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ventureburn.com/2015/06/kongas-bold-attempt-to-revolutionise-online-payments-in-nigeria/ | title=Konga’s bold attempt to revolutionise online payments in Nigeria | work=VentureBurn | date=25 June 2015 | accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With over 80 million mobile internet users in Nigeria, Konga has made online payment easy with its delivery payment option embraced by its numerous users.

==Types of services==

===KongaPay===
KongaPay was launched as a pilot product in 2015 in partnership with Nigerian commercial banks in order to work for customers only within the Konga.com's platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techpoint.ng/2015/06/10/konga-launches-kongapay-to-war-against-pay-on-delivery-model/|title=Konga launches 'KongaPay' to war against Pay on Delivery|website=Techpoint.ng|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge of lack of trust in making online payment was quenched by KongaPay that has made it possible for anyone to use Konga's online platform. This innovation had protected online shoppers against the reports of fraud when they release their bank details online. KongaPay is similar to what is seen in [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] platform with its one-click payments. It was unveiled in Lagos, Nigeria at a KongaPay Demo event. The payment option has been fully integrated with Ecobank, Access bank, FCMB, Diamond Bank, Zenith Bank, Heritage Bank, UBA, First Bank and GTB.

According to Sim Shagaya, KongaPay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Konga's bold attempt to revolutionise online payments in Nigeria – Ventureburn|url = http://ventureburn.com/2015/06/kongas-bold-attempt-to-revolutionise-online-payments-in-nigeria/|website = Ventureburn|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a partnership with Nigeria's banks. We strongly believe that together, we could change the face of online shopping in Nigeria by removing the uncertainties customers associate with pre-paying for goods and services they are yet to receive.”

KongaPay has become the game-changer in the online shopping in Nigeria. This is because it has made possible for a seamless movement of goods, services and payments.  This has grown safety and trust among Konga's users.

With KongaPay, a customer receives an authorization code that is secured and registered to the mobile phone number on the website. There is no need for customers to sign up for electronic banking if the customer has a registered mobile phone number and a bank account. KongaPay has eliminated the use of sensitive personal information such as Internet banking passwords or card details with just a click.

===Konga Express===

To make its online integration very effective, Konga introduced Konga Express that focus on selling of its products to reach the buyer with every available means. Customers can have their ordered products get to them within 1–3 days. Konga Express fulfills the orders that are made daily with online tracking.

===Konga Marketplace===
Konga started its massive expansion in Nigeria with Konga Mall, which is a revolutionary option that allows businesses in Nigeria to showcase their products online. Business owners were offered a free and simple delivery service. The  business owner packages order that is accompanied with SellerHQ details and details of the order before dropping the parcel at Konga's dropoff center.

With the success of Konga Mall, came Konga Marketplace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introducing the Konga Marketplace, a platform where everyone can sell anything to anyone online - Blog|url = http://www.konga.com/blog/introducing-the-konga-marketplac/|website = Blog|accessdate = 2016-01-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has made it possible for even roadside sellers to be involved from any part of the country. Amazing products have been discovered and massive sales are made daily through this market. The sellers and buyers interact in this marketplace which is revolutionary. Unlimited opportunities have been created through this marketplace that has ended up boosting employment and economic growth and development in the country. Affiliate marketing and comparison online stores such as bestprices &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bestprices.ng - Nigeria's #1 price comparison website. |url=http://bestprices.ng/ |website=Bestprices .ng|accessdate=2016-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109201022/http://bestprices.ng/ |archivedate=2016-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has also become possible with this marketplace.

Sim Shagaya says;“About a year ago, we realised that for our services to be really valuable to society, we had to build a platform for anyone, not just Konga, to sell and prosper. We launched this platform to a limited number of sellers and in that time, we have learned how to build a truly revolutionary Nigerian online marketplace…”

===Konga Self-Fulfill Model===
Self-Fulfill Model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Konga.com Sellers’ Platform Expands Nationwide with Self-Fulfill Model - Blog|url = http://www.konga.com/blog/konga-com-sellers-platform-expands-nationwide-with-self-fulfill-model/|website = Blog|accessdate = 2016-01-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a major upgrade in Konga's marketplace offer. This service made it possible for its merchants to have great shipping agreements negotiated by Konga with reputable courier partners. The sellers control the management of its parcels from the point of order till the customers receive them. Payments are made directly to the sellers from the buyers when they receive their parcels. Buyers expect flexible and faster delivery of their parcels through Self-Fulfill Model. Self-Fulfill Model has the option of allowing customers rate sellers, products and overall experience.

==Zinox acquisition==
Two months after laying off over half of its staff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techpoint.ng/2017/12/01/breaking-konga-sacks-60-workforce-kills-pay-delivery/|title=Konga sacks about 60% of workforce, kills Pay on Delivery|website=Techpoint.ng|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konga was acquired by Zinox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techpoint.ng/2018/02/03/zinox-acquires-konga/|title=Zinox Group acquires Konga|website=Techpoint.ng|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Nigerian firm that manufactures and distributes computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1198123/nigerias-konga-jumia-rival-bought-by-zinox/|work=Quartz|title=The acquisition of a major Nigerian e-commerce player will be a cautionary tale for investors|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the acquisition, a few changes were made to the Konga leadership. In March 2018, the company appointed Olusiji Ijogun, former UAC Foods and Unilever executive as its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techpoint.ng/2018/03/19/olusiji-ijogun-konga-chairman/|title=Konga appoints former UAC Foods and Unilever exec, Olusiji Ijogun as new chairman|website=Techpoint.ng|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Shola Adekoya, resigned from his role as Konga CEO to be replaced by Nick Imudia, the immediate past Regional Director TCL/Alcatel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techpoint.ng/2018/03/28/konga-ceo-resigns/|title=Konga CEO, Shola Adekoya exits. Announces replacement|website=Techpoint.ng|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2018, Zinox merged Konga.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techpoint.ng/2018/04/16/konga-yudala-marriage/|title=What we can expect from Konga-Yudala marriage|website=Techpoint.ng|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its emerging retail outfit, Yudala, into a newer, bigger company, maintaining the Konga brand name, to become arguably the biggest e-commerce &amp; retail company in Africa. The new Konga combined the online e-commerce strength of Konga.com and the expansive branch network of Yudala to execute pure omni-channel retail for the first time in Africa. Rumours suggest that Zinox acquired Konga for a meagre $10 million suggesting that Kinnevik and Naspers, its long term investors lost a combined 93% return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techpoint.ng/2018/02/05/kinnevik-naspers-konga-investment/|title=It seems Kinnevik and Naspers lost a combined 93% ROI in Konga|website=Techpoint.ng|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
Konga faces competition from other dominant African digital commerce platforms, such as [[Jumia]], Kilimall, Patricia.com.ng and [[Sunvait Network Ltd.]], due to the strong agency networks these platforms have.

===Domain war with Jumia===
In 2014, Jumia registered some Konga domains outside Nigeria which caused huge uproar in the technology scene. Konga had been talking up the possibility of expanding outside Nigeria which [[Jumia]] was already doing with Jumia having operations in more than 8 countries across Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techmoran.com/rocket-internets-jumia-launches-in-senegal/#sthash.vyxccnak.dpbs|title=Rocket Internet's Jumia Launches in Senegal |website=Techmoran.com|last=Wakoba|first=Sam|date=2015-04-13|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was read by industry stakeholders as Jumia trying to stifle Konga's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encomium.ng/konga-jumia-war-over-trade-name/|title=KONGA, JUMIA WAR OVER TRADE NAME|website=Encomium.ng|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6522">{{+r|date=March 2016}}A '''loan agreement''' is a [[contract]] between a borrower and a lender which regulates the mutual promises made by each party. There are many types of loan agreements, including "facilities agreements," "revolvers," "term loans," "working capital loans."  Loan agreements are documented via a compilation of the various mutual promises made by the involved parties.

Prior to entering into a loan agreement, the "borrower" first makes representations about his affairs surrounding his character, creditworthiness, cashflow, and any collateral that he may have available to pledge as security for a loan. These representations are taken into consideration and the lender then determines under what conditions (terms), if any, they are prepared to advance money.

Loan agreements, like any contract, reflect an "offer," the "acceptance of the offer," "consideration," and can only involve situations that are "legal" (a term loan agreement involving heroin drug sales is not "legal").  Loan agreements are documented via their commitment letters, agreements that reflect the understandings reached between the involved parties, a promissory note, and a collateral agreement (such as a [[mortgage]] or a [[personal guarantee]]).   Loan agreements offered by regulated banks are different from those that are offered by finance companies in that banks receive a "banking charter" granted as a privilege and involving the "public trust."

Loan agreements are usually in written form, but there is no legal reason why a loan agreement cannot be a purely [[oral contract]] (although oral agreements are more difficult to enforce).

==Types==

For commercial banks and large finance companies, "loan agreements" are usually not categorized although "loan portfolios" are often broadly characterized into "personal" and "commercial" loans while the "commercial" category is then subdivided into "industrial" and "commercial real estate" loans. "Industrial" loans are those that depend on the cashflow and creditworthiness of the company and the widgets or service that it sells.  "Commercial real estate" loans are those that repay loans but that depend on the rental revenues paid by tenants who lease space, usually for extended times.  More granular categorizations of loan portfolios exist but these are always variations around the larger themes.

The loan agreements originated by commercial banks, savings banks, finance companies, insurance organizations, and investment banks are very different from each other and all feed a different purpose.  "Commercial banks" and "Savings banks," because they accept deposits and benefit from FDIC insurance, generate loans that incorporate the concepts of the "public trust."  Prior to interstate banking, that "public trust" was easily measured by State bank regulators who could see how local deposits were used to fund the working capital needs of local industry and businesses, and the benefits associated with those organization's employment.  "Insurance" organizations, who collect premiums for providing either life or property/casualty coverage, created their own types of loan agreements.  "Banks" and "Insurance" organizations' loan agreements and documentation standards evolved from their individual cultures and were governed by policies that somehow addressed each organizations liabilities (In the case of "banks," the liquidity needs of their depositors; in the case of insurance organizations, the liquidity needs associated with their expected "claims" payments).

"Investment banks" create loan agreements that cater to the needs of the investors whose funds they attempt to attract; "investors" are always sophisticated and accredited organizations not subject to bank regulatory supervision and the need to cater to the public trust.  Investment banking activities are supervised by the SEC and their main focus is on whether the correct or proper disclosures are made to the parties who provide the funds.

Types of Loans:
* bilateral loans
* [[syndicated loan]]s

Categorizing loan agreements by type of facility, usually results in two primary categories:
* term loans, which are repaid in set installments over the term, or
* revolving loans (or [[overdraft]]s) where up to a maximum amount can be withdrawn at any time, and interest is paid from month to month on the drawn amount.

Within these two categories though, there are various subdivisions such as [[interest-only loan]]s, and [[Balloon payment mortgage|balloon payment]] loans.  It is also possible to subcategorize on whether the loan is a [[secured loan]] or an unsecured loan, and whether the [[interest|rate of interest]] is fixed or floating.

==Contents of Loan agreement==

Forms of loan agreements vary tremendously from industry to industry, country to country, but characteristically a professionally drafted commercial loan agreement will incorporate the following terms:

# Parties to contracts with their addresses
# Definitions or interpretation provisions
# Facility and purpose&lt;ref&gt;Purpose provisions serve a variety of purposes in different jurisdictions, but they are often used to seek to impose a [[Quistclose trust|''Quistclose'' trust]] on the loan proceeds if the stated purpose of the loan becomes impossible.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conditions precedent to utilization
# Repayment provisions
# Prepayment and cancellation provisions
# Interest and interest periods
# Provisions dealing with [[gross-up]] in relation to any [[withholding]] imposed
# Payments provisions
# [[Misrepresentation|Representations]] of the [[borrower]]
# Representations of the lender
# Covenants of the borrower&lt;ref&gt;Such as a [[negative pledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;
# Events of [[default (finance)|default]]
# Remedies in the event of default
# Provisions for penalties and liquidated damages
# For syndicated loans, provisions relating to the facility agent and security agent and voting of the lenders
# Formulae for calculations
# Provisions for fees of the lenders
# Provisions for expenses
# [[Securitization]] provisions
# Amendments and waivers provisions
# Covenants relating to changes in parties
# [[Set-off (law)|Set-off]] clause
# [[Severability clause]]
# [[Counterparty|Counterpart]]s clause
# Addresses for notices
# Language provisions
# [[Choice of law clause]]
# [[Forum selection clause]]
# Appointment of a [[process agent]]

'''Route 128''' (designated as the '''Yankee Division Highway''') is a [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, maintained by the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] (MassDOT). Spanning {{convert|57|mi|km}}, it is one of two [[Ring road|beltways]] (the other being [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]]) around [[Boston]], and is known as the "inner" beltway, especially around areas where it is {{convert|15|mi|km|round=5}} or less outside of [[Boston]]. The original 128, called the "Circumferential Highway," followed existing roadways in Boston suburbs and was designated in 1927. The present-day 128 exists as a [[controlled-access highway]] and was the first limited-access circumferential highway in the United States, the first segment of which opened in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wgbh.org/post/route-128-once-known-road-nowhere-had-traffic-jam-day-it-opened|title=Route 128, Once Known As 'Road To Nowhere,' Had A Traffic Jam The Day It Opened|last=Herwick III|first=Edgar|publisher=WGBH|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its southern terminus was previously located at the [[Braintree Split]] in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]]; currently, it exists at the interchange with [[Interstate 93]] (I-93), [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] (I-95), and [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]]. Despite no longer carrying this designation, the section of highway between Braintree and Canton continues to be informally called 128 within Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/massmarkets/2012/08/13/despite-federal-and-state-agencies-efforts-a-road-by-any-other-name-is-still-route-128/|title=Despite federal and state agencies’ efforts, a road by any other name is still Route 128|last=Chesto|first=John|publisher=Wicked Local. GateHouse Media|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its current terminus, 128 begins running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-95 and US 1. While its concurrency with US 1 ends in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], its concurrency with I-95 continues as it intersects with expressways including I-90 (the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]) in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]; [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|US 20]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]]; [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]]; [[U.S. Route 3 in Massachusetts|US 3]] in [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] (with which it runs concurrently within the town); and I-93 and US 1 again in [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]] and [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]], respectively. 128 and I-95 split in [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]]; as I-95 continues north towards New Hampshire, 128 travels east towards its northern terminus at an interchange with [[Massachusetts Route 127|Route 127A]] in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]].

In local culture, 128 is recognized as an informal dividing line between the inner municipalities of [[Greater Boston]] and the more distant suburbs. It delimits the areas accessible by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) [[public transit]] system, and is used to reference the [[high-technology industry]] that developed from the 1960s to the 1980s in the [[suburban]] areas along the highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=246 "MassMoments: Route 128 Opens Boston's High-Tech Age."] Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities. Accessed 05-18-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route description==
[[Image:128 south end.jpg|thumb|400px|Since 1997, MA Route 128's southern end has been in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], where [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] exits south-westwards on its own roadbed, and [[Interstate 93]] north begins. [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] north continues straight.]]

128 begins in [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] in the south, at the interchange with [[Interstate 93|I-93]], [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]], and [[U.S. Route 1|US 1]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]]. Until the 1990s, its southern terminus was located at the junction of I-93, US 1, and [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]] (the [[Braintree Split]]) in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]]. At this present-day terminus, 128 becomes [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with I-95, and follows the sequential exit numbering scheme used by I-95 as it enters Massachusetts from [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. It also begins a wrong-way concurrency with US 1; as 128 and I-95 are signed traveling north, US 1 is signed traveling south, and vice versa. US 1 splits onto its own roadbed at exit 15 in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]].

About two-thirds of Route 128 runs in tandem with I-95 from Canton north to [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]], and after I-95 continues north from Peabody toward [[New Hampshire]], north-east as its own signed highway from Peabody to Gloucester. The I-95 and I-93 signage were added in the mid-1970s when plans to construct [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] through Boston, directly connecting the two I-95/Route 128 interchanges, were cancelled leaving an unsigned gap (filled in using Route 128). An unused [[Cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], now removed, was one of the leftover structures from this plan as well as the existing [[Northeast Expressway (Boston)|Northeast Expressway]] (now part of US 1.)

Until 1965, while and shortly after the [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]] freeway to Cape Cod was fully finished, the section of current Route 3 between exits 15 and 20 was also designated as Route 128. The route's southern end was then truncated to its intersection with Route 3 in Braintree. The non-freeway section of Route 128 from Route 3 through [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] to Nantasket was redesignated Route 228. The [[MassHighway|Massachusetts Highway Department]] has tried twice, in 1997 and 2003, to truncate 128 back to its intersection with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in Peabody, but local opposition has convinced them to back down.

[[Image:128 north end.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The north end of Route 128 is at [[Massachusetts Route 127|Route 127A]] in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]]. The sign pointing Route 127A south straight is incorrect; it is actually to the right, where the sign points "ALT 127".]]

The area along the western part of Route 128 is home to a number of high-technology firms and corporations. This part of Route 128 was dubbed "America's Technology Highway", and signs marking it that way were put in place beginning in October 1982. Two years later, those blue signs were  changed to read "America's Technology Region" after complaints from veterans groups that noted the highway already had a name: the [[Yankee Division]] Highway&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2011/01/09/how_bout_a_sign_for_the_times/|title=How ’bout a sign for the times?|last=Voorhis|first=Scott Van|work=Boston.com|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a name bestowed in 1941 in honor of the U.S. Army unit first formed in Boston in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1941|others=Massachusetts. General Court. Senate.|title=1941 Senate Bill 0387. An Act Designating A Certain Highway As The Yankee Division Highway.|url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/handle/2452/222918|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the I-95 signage mapping onto 128, the mapping of US 3 onto this stretch of 128 is due to US 3 as a separate limited access highway terminating in [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] on 128 instead of further south at [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] as originally envisioned. This abrupt termination requires the US 3 signage to continue along 128 for somewhat over a mile until it can interchange the old US 3 surface arterial. Moreover, when I-93 and Route 128 ran concurrently south of Boston, before the route was truncated to the I-95 interchange in Canton, they were signed in opposite directions, so it was possible to travel north on I-93 and south on Route 128 at the same time.

The northernmost several exits along Route 128, past exit 12, are not [[grade separation|grade-separated]] [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s. Exit 10 is signed as the [[traffic signal|signalized]] intersection with [[Massachusetts Route 127|Route 127]], and there are two [[rotaries (road)|rotaries]] between that and exit 12 (the Crafts Road interchange).

Following the completion of the Peabody I-95/Route 128 interchange (Exit 45/29) in 1988; the exit system was changed from concurrency along 128 to a system using the I-95 exits. The exits, which had gone from Gloucester to Braintree, were renumbered along I-95, from the [[Rhode Island]] state line to the border with [[New Hampshire]]. Exit 37 had been the interchange with I-93, which also had its exit numbered 37 at that interchange. Coincidentally, with the renumbering, exit 37 remained exit 37.

The Boston area [[Metropolitan planning organization|MPO]] studied the Route 128/I-95 Corridor from approximately 2005–2010. The study focused on the heavily congested section from I-90 (Newton) to US 3 (Burlington), and was completed in November 2010. As of 2010, the highway carried over 200,000 vehicles per day. Some possible improvements to Route 128 include [[HOV]] Lanes, reconstruction of shoulders, [[ramp metering]], bus on shoulder, and fiber optic traffic system improvements. More studies will need to be completed before projects will begin.

By 1928, it had been extended east to [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] from its south end along the following streets, ending at the intersection of [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] and [[Route 3A (southeastern Massachusetts)|Route 3A]] (now Route 3A and [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]):&lt;ref name="1928 map"&gt;1928 map of numbered routes in Boston and vicinity, prepared by the [[Massachusetts Department of Public Works]] for the New England Affairs Bureau, Boston Chamber of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

The first section of the new '''Circumferential Highway''', in no way the [[freeway]] that it is now, was the piece from [[Route 9 (Massachusetts)|Route 9]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] around the south side of Boston to [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] (now [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]) in [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]]. Parts of this were built as new roads, but most of it was along existing roads that were improved to handle the traffic. In 1931, the [[Massachusetts Department of Public Works]] acquired a [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] from [[Route 138 (Massachusetts)|Route 138]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] through [[Westwood, Massachusetts|Westwood]], [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] and [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]] to Route 9 in Wellesley. This was mostly 80 feet (24 m) wide, only shrinking to 70 feet (21 m) in Needham, in the area of Great Plain Avenue and the [[Needham Line]]. Much of this was along new alignment, but about half &amp;mdash; mostly in Needham &amp;mdash; was along existing roads:
*Royall Street from west of Route 138 to east of Green Street (Canton)
*Green Lodge Street from Royall Street (now cut by Route 128) to [[Route 128 Station]] (Canton and Westwood)
*Greendale Avenue from Lyons Street and Common Street just south of the [[Charles River]] to Hunting Avenue (Dedham and Needham)

From Route 138 in Canton east through the [[Blue Hills Reservation]] in Canton, [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]], [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] acquired a right-of-way in 1927&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Canton/Layouts/3960/3960.tif 3960] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524111915/http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Canton/Layouts/3960/3960.tif |date=2006-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and built the Blue Hill River Road. This tied into West Street in northwest Braintree, which itself had been taken over by the county in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/6741/6741-6.TIF 6741] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524111922/http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/6741/6741-6.TIF |date=2006-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Street led to [[Route 37 (Massachusetts)|Route 37]], which ran southeast to Braintree center. This part of Route 37 had been taken over by the state in 1919 (to Braintree center)&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1823/ 1823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907003218/http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1823/ |date=2006-09-07 }} (June 24, 1919)&lt;/ref&gt; and 1917 (in Braintree center).&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1765/ 1765] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907003139/http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1765/ |date=2006-09-07 }} (September 4, 1917)&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the new highway, from Route 37 east to [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] (now [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]), through Braintree, [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]] and [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], was taken over by the state in 1929. This was all along existing roads, except possibly the part of Park Avenue west of [[Route 18 (Massachusetts)|Route 18]] in Weymouth.&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plans:

By 1933,&lt;ref name="1933 map"&gt;1933 General Drafting Boston and vicinity map&lt;/ref&gt; the whole Circumferential Highway had been completed, and, except for the piece from [[Route 9 (Massachusetts)|Route 9]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] south to Highland Avenue in [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], was designated as Route 128. Former Route 128 along Highland Avenue into Needham center was left unnumbered (as was the Circumferential Highway north of Highland Avenue), but the rest of former Route 128, from Needham center east to [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], became part of [[Route 135 (Massachusetts)|Route 135]]. Thus the full route of the Circumferential Highway, as it existed by 1933, is now the following roads:

At the same time as Route 128 was extended along the new Circumferential Highway, it was extended further into [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]]. This alignment, not part of the Circumferential Highway, ran southeast on [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] (now [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]) (Whiting Street) to the border of [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] and [[Norwell, Massachusetts|Norwell]], where it turned north on present [[Route 228 (Massachusetts)|Route 228]] (Main Street) through Hingham and into [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]]. The exact route through Hingham was Main Street, Short Street, Leavitt Street, East Street, and Hull Street. The end of the numbered route was at the south end of [[Nantasket Beach, Massachusetts|Nantasket Beach]], where Nantasket Avenue curves northwest to follow the shore of [[Massachusetts Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;1937 Massachusetts Department of Public Works map of Hull&lt;/ref&gt;

==="America's Technology Highway"===
In 1955, ''Business Week'' ran an article titled "New England Highway Upsets Old Way of Life" and referred to Route 128 as "the Magic Semicircle".&lt;!--Rosegrant p 108--&gt; By 1958, it needed to be widened from four to six lanes, and business growth continued, often driven by technology out of [[Harvard University]] and [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.route128history.org/index.html "Technically, It's Still Route 128"], route128history.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, there were 99 companies employing 17,000 workers along 128; in 1965, 574; in 1973, 1,212. In the 1980s, the area was often compared to California's [[Silicon valley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1997/34/b354197.htm "BOSTON'S ROUTE 128: COMPLEMENTING SILICON VALLEY"], August 1997, Businessweek&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bizcloudnetwork.com/route-128-birthplace-of-the-digital-age-2 "Route 128: Birthplace of the Digital Age"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130628182344/http://bizcloudnetwork.com/route-128-birthplace-of-the-digital-age-2 |date=2013-06-28 }}, July 6, 2010, http://bizcloudnetwork.com {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130509024150/http://bizcloudnetwork.com/ |date=2013-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the positive effects of this growth on the Massachusetts economy were dubbed the "[[Massachusetts Miracle]]".

Major companies with significant locations in the broader Route 128 area prior to 2000 included:

==Future and improvements==
===Add-A-Lane project===
The $315 million MassDOT Highway Division project has started widening on the project to upgrade the existing {{convert|14.3|mi|km|adj=on}} six-lane section of highway to eight lanes from north of Route 9 in Wellesley to Route 24 in Randolph. The project consists of adding a lane on the inside of each carriageway, complete with a 10-foot inside shoulder. The existing 1950s bridges, 22 in total, will be replaced as well. The project will be constructed in five phases over a twelve-year period. Construction of phase 1 began in 2004. The first phase of the project consisted of replacing the existing three-lane Route 128 bridges over University Avenue/MBTA/Amtrak and the Neponset River with new four-lane bridges in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]]. The project also included construction of a new two-lane ramp from Route 128 to I-95. The $33 million project was awarded to SPS New England of [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]].

During the initial construction of Route 128, a provision had already been made for a fourth lane within the widely spaced [[median]] along the 1.5-mile (2.5&amp;nbsp;km) length of Route 128 running from just north of the U.S. Route 1 interchange in Dedham, Massachusetts, north-westwards to the Route 109 interchange, and this will finally be used for the Add-A-Lane project.

Construction on phase 1 was officially completed in October 2009. Construction of phase 2 of the project began in summer 2006. This phase of the project consisted of the replacement of the Route 1 and Route 1A bridges over Route 128 in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] along with the road widening between Exits 13 and 15 (US 1). Construction of four sound barriers between the US 1 and I-95 interchanges were also included. This phase was completed in the Spring of 2011.

Construction on phase 3, begun in April 2009, widened I-93/US 1 to 4 lanes in each direction from Route 24 to the I-95 interchange. Phase 4 of the Project, which began in March 2011, is replacing seven bridges and widens Route 128 (I-95) to four lanes in each direction from Route 109 to south of Highland Avenue in Needham. The southeastern freeway (Pilgrims Highway) that extends from Braintree to Cape Cod, [[Massachusetts Route 3|MA Route 3]], is also in the process of undergoing a similar "add-a-lane" project for much of its own 42 mile length.

===Sign upgrade projects on Route 128===
Over the last fifteen or so years, the state has funded a number of highway sign resigning projects on Route 128 that are replacing the 25-year-old signs with new exit, regulatory and route signs. Starting in 1998 and continuing through 2002, signs were replaced through a $1.1 million project between Reading and Lynnfield. Progress continued in 2005 and 2006 during a $2.2 million project which replaced the signs on from Peabody to Gloucester, and continued with a $1.4 million project in 2008 and 2009 that replaced signs in Peabody and the remaining ones in Lynnfield. A $2.9 million federal stimulus project helped replace exit and highway signs in 2010 and 2011 along Route 128 (I-95) from US-3 in Lexington to I-93 in Reading.

A project begun in the Fall of 2012 and completed in the Fall of 2015, replaced exit &amp; guide signs on Route 128 from Route 9 (Exit 20) in Wellesley to Routes 4/225 (Exit 31) in Lexington and, as part of the Add-A-Lane project discussed above, new signs were put up along section of the project completed in 2015 from Great Plain Avenue in Needham to Route 109 in Dedham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gribblenation.net/mass21/i95photos.html See photos of the new signage on the I-95 in Mass. Photo Page]&lt;/ref&gt; New signage was put up between I-95 and US 1 in 2010 and most of the signage between I-95 and Route 24 (on I-93/US 1) has been replaced by the end of 2011. Future projects will replace the signs between the Rhode Island Border and I-93 in Canton in 2018 and between I-93 in Reading and US 1 in Peabody in 2019. New mileage markers were placed every 2/10 of a mile along the highway in 2010 (except for the area covered by the widening project) for I-93 between Braintree and Canton and I-95 from Canton to Peabody. New markers put along Route 128 from Peabody to Gloucester reflect the state highway's total mileage from Canton, indicating MassDOT's change of heart in decommissioning the route where it shares the road with I-95. The previous mile markers (reflected in the exit list below) had mile 0 in Peabody.

== Popular culture ==
Two songs by [[Massachusetts]] alternative rock artists, "[[Roadrunner (Jonathan Richman song)|Roadrunner]]" by [[The Modern Lovers]] and "Blue Thunder" by [[Galaxie 500]], prominently feature Route 128 in their lyrics.

==Exit list==
Exit numbers along the I-95 portion of Route 128 are in accordance to the [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts#Exit list|I-95 exit numbering scheme in Massachusetts]] . The stretch north of I-95, as well as the rest of the length before I-95 exit numbering was applied, has decreasing exit numbers traveling northbound, contrary to almost all highways in the US with numbered exits.  Route 128 currently has 18 numbered interchanges, starting at 29 (southbound) and continuing downwards to 9 (former Exit 27, an at-grade intersection, was removed, and the last two exits are at-grade intersections). This may be changed over the next few years if all freeway interchanges in Massachusetts are converted to mileage-based numbers under a project that was scheduled to start in January 2016, in order to comply with Federal regulations mandating mileage-based exit numbers on interstate highways, but that, for now, has been indefinitely postponed.&lt;ref name="Exit Numbers"&gt;{{cite web|author=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|year=2015|title=COMMBUYS - Bid Solicitation FAP# HSIP-002S(874) Exit Signage Conversion to Milepost-Based Numbering System along Various Interstates, Routes and the Lowell Connector |url=https://www.commbuys.com/bso/external/bidDetail.sdo?docId=BD-16-1030-0H100-0H002-00000005477&amp;external=true&amp;parentUrl=bid|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.malmeroads.net/mass21c/massexits.html|title=Massachusetts Highways Exit Lists|publisher=Robert H.

The '''memorandum of association''' of a [[company (law)|company]] is an important corporate document in certain jurisdictions. It is often simply referred to as the '''memorandum'''.  In the UK, it has to be filed with the [[Registrar of Companies]] during the process of incorporating a company. It is the document that regulates the company’s external affairs,&lt;ref&gt;http://thelawstudies.blogspot.com/2017/01/memorandum-of-association-of-company.html&lt;/ref&gt; and complements the [[articles of association]] which cover  the company's internal constitution. It contains the fundamental conditions under which the company is allowed to operate. Until recently{{Where|date=November 2018}} it had to include the "objects clause" which let the shareholders, creditors and those dealing with the company know what is its permitted range of operation, although this was usually drafted very broadly. It also shows the company's initial capital. It is one of the documents required to incorporate a [[company (law)|company]] in [[India]], the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |  url = http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/memorandum-of-association/ | title = Memorandum of Association Law &amp; Legal definition | format = w  | accessdate = 2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Nigeria]], Nepal, [[Bangladesh]], Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and [[Tanzania]] and is also used in many of the [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mca.gov.in/SearchableActs/Schedule1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements: United Kingdom==
It is still a requirement to file a memorandum of association to incorporate a new company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |  url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/memorandum%20of%20association | title = Memorandum of association  | format = w  | accessdate = 2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it contains less information than was required before 1 October 2010. The [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/3014/pdfs/uksi_20083014_en.pdf Companies (Registration) Regulation 2008] included pro-forma Memoranda.

It is basically a statement that the subscribers wish to form a company under the Companies Act 2006, have agreed to become members and, in the case of a company that is to have a share capital, to take at least one share each. It is no longer required to state the name of the company, the type of company (such as public limited company or private company limited by shares), the location of its registered office, the objects of the company, and its authorised share capital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/companyRegistration.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Companies incorporated prior to 1 October 2009 are not required to amend their memorandum. Those details which are now required to appear in the Articles, such as the objects clause and details of the share capital, are deemed to form a part of the Articles.

==Capacities==
The memorandum no longer restricts the activities of a company.  Since 1 October 2009, if a company's constitution contains any restrictions on the objects at all, those restrictions will form part of the articles of association.

Historically, a company's memorandum of association contained an objects clause, which limited its capacity to act. When the first limited companies were incorporated, the objects clause had to be widely drafted so as not to restrict the board of directors in their day to day trading.  In the Companies Act 1989, the term "General Commercial Company" was introduced which meant that companies could undertake "any lawful or legal trade or business."

'''Moloka‘i Coffee''' refers to [[coffee]] grown, processed and roasted on the island of [[Moloka'i]] in [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]], [[United States]].

== Producers ==
German merchant [[Rudolph Wilhelm Meyer]] (1826–1897) grew coffee on the island and also built a [[sugar mill]].
"Coffees of Hawaii" is currently the only producer of Moloka‘i coffee. They are located on a {{convert|500|acre|km2|sing=on}} plantation in [[Kualapuu|Kualapu'u]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://espressocoffeeguide.com/gourmet-coffee/asian-indonesian-and-pacific-coffees/hawaii-coffee/molokai-coffee/|title=Molokai Coffee Beans - Espresso &amp; Coffee Guide|work=Espresso &amp; Coffee Guide|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distributors ==
[[Trader Joe's]] introduced this coffee in mid-2008. The packaging, a {{convert|13|oz|sing=on}} can, featured two red [[hummingbird]]s on a light yellow background filled with flowers The can was titled "Moloka'i 100% One Hundred Percent Hawaiian Coffee" and labeled the coffee "Dark Roast, Robust &amp; Earthy, 100% Arabica Whole Bean Coffee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Molokai Coffee |work= Trader Joe's fan web site |date= June 4, 2008 |url= http://www.traderjoesfan.com/Trader_Joes/molokai_coffee/details/ |accessdate= October 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discontinued it in late 2009.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8771">A '''national numbering agency''' ('''NNA''') is the organisation in each country responsible for issuing [[International Securities Identification Number]]s (ISIN) as described by the [[ISO 6166]] standard and the Classification of Financial Instruments code as described by the [[ISO 10962]] standard.  The role of NNA is typically assigned to the national [[stock exchange]], [[central bank]], or [[financial regulator]] but may be as diverse as a financial data provider or clearing and custodian organisation for that country.

There is a global governing body that coordinates the work of the NNAs called the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anna-web.com |association of NNAs&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overcapitalisation''' or '''Overcapitalization''', refers to an economic phenomenon whereby the valuation/ price of an asset is superior to its ‘real’ value – however difficult to define - therefore putting a strain on attempts to obtain a reasonable [[return on investment]]. This is especially the case when [[capital goods]] are at stake which are necessary to engage in the production of goods or delivery of services (e.g. agricultural holdings, industrial plants, etc.). It is less the case with those contemporary financial instruments that are valued not for their returns, but for their potential earnings upon resale.

Overcapitalisation is closely related (in causes and consequences) to [[assets inflation]]. As the [[financialisation]] of the economy has led to the monetisation (also called ‘securitisation’) of many non-financial assets, such as [[real estate]], infrastructures, etc., overcapitalisation has become rife, with deleterious consequences at the level of firms (struggling to achieve an unrealistically high level of profitability), households (struggling to pay their inflated mortgage), and individuals (whose [[Ownership equity|equity]] holding, and hence borrowing and repayment potential, may be vastly over-valued).

==Examples==
In his book "''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse]]''", [[Jared Diamond]] gives an example of widespread overcapitalisation (Chapter 13, "Mining" [[Australia]], paragraph on 'imported values') when he describes how settlers in Australia bought or leased land at prices derived from those at 'home' ([[England]]), and then were pushed very hard (and usually failed) to achieve the necessary returns, wrecking the fragile resource in the process by [[over-exploitation]].

'''Paul M. Achleitner''' (born 28 September 1956) is an Austrian businessman. He has been chairman of the supervisory board of [[Deutsche Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-trump-davos-ties/|title=All the President’s Friends: These Are Trump’s Ties in Davos|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 31 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.deutsche-bank.de/en/content/company/supervisory_board.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606115031/https://www.deutsche-bank.de/en/content/company/supervisory_board.htm|title=Supervisory Board |archive-date=6 June 2013 |publisher=Deutsche Bank }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Education==
Achleitner studied at the [[University of St. Gallen]] Business Administration, Economics, Law and Social Sciences, where he also earned his doctorate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-621415-1-1286679-1-0-0-0-0-0-104-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Dr. Paul Achleitner|publisher=Daimler|accessdate=30 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427054043/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-621415-1-1286679-1-0-0-0-0-0-104-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|archivedate=27 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Harvard Business School]].

==Career==
After working at the consulting firm [[Bain and Company]] and [[Goldman Sachs]], where he was managing director of the German subsidiary, in 2000, Achleitner joined the board of Allianz AG (Allianz SE since 2006). He was primarily responsible for finance and investments. After his appointment to the chairman of the supervisory board of Deutsche Bank, he left Allianz. 

During Achleitner's first four-year tenure at Deutsche Bank, its stock price more than halved, weighed down by a string of legal issues and fines running to billions of euros.&lt;ref&gt;Kathrin Jones and Andreas Kröner (November 21, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-achleitner/achleitners-bid-for-five-more-years-at-deutsche-splits-investors-idUSKBN13G1DA Achleitner's bid for five more years at Deutsche splits investors] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; An internal investigation in 2016 cleared Achleitner of wrongdoing in connection with the bank’s manipulation of interbank borrowing rates including [[Libor]], which cost it a record $2.5 billion in fines from U.S. and British authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Kathrin Jones and Andreas Kröner (November 21, 2016), [Achleitner's bid for five more years at Deutsche splits investors] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He retained the support of the bank’s biggest shareholder, Qatari Sheikh [[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani]],&lt;ref&gt;James Shotter (November 21, 2016), [https://www.ft.com/content/30efc7a0-afcb-11e6-a37c-f4a01f1b0fa1 Deutsche Bank nominates Achleitner for second term as chairman] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2017, shareholders backed Achleitner’s re-election to a second five-year term.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sims (May 18, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-agm-shareholder/deutsche-bank-management-gets-shareholder-backing-of-its-agenda-at-agm-idUSKCN18E2U9 Deutsche Bank management gets shareholder backing of its agenda at AGM] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a 2016 report by consultancy [[Willis Towers Watson]], Achleitner is the highest paid supervisory board head at Germany’s 30 biggest listed companies that make up the benchmark [[DAX]] index.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Steitz (November 23, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-largecap-salary/top-german-supervisory-board-chairs-earn-4-4-pct-more-in-2016-report-idUSL8N1DO4A3 Top German supervisory board chairs earn 4.4 pct more in 2016-report] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In Munich, he shares an office with his wife [[Ann-Kristin Achleitner]], [[Michael Diekmann]], [[Joachim Faber]] and [[Peter Löscher]].&lt;ref&gt;Henning Peitsmeier and Klaus Max Smolka (May 22, 2017), [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/d-a-l-f-a-die-geheime-machtzentrale-in-muenchen-15025484.html Die geheime Machtzentrale in München] ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achleitner is an honorary professor of the [[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management|WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management]] in [[Vallendar]], Germany, where he teaches a course in investment banking. He is also head of the Exchange Expert Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-05-22/deutsche-bank-s-paul-achleitner-to-head-commission-ftd-says|title=Deutsche Bank's Paul Achleitner to Head Commission FTD says|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the German federal commission for the German [[Corporate Governance]] Code.

'''The Plants for Human Health Institute (PHHI)''' is a [[North Carolina State University]] research and education organization located at the [[North Carolina Research Campus]] in [[Kannapolis]], [[North Carolina]], United States. The institute researches food crops, like [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]], and the potential health-promoting properties they may convey when consumed.

PHHI is part of the [[North Carolina State University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]], which staffs the institute with faculty from the departments of horticultural science; food, bioprocessing and nutrition sciences; plant and microbial biology; genetics; and agricultural and resource economics.&lt;ref name="CALS report" /&gt; The institute has both research and [[Cooperative Extension]] components. [[Mary Ann Lila]], a [[blueberry]] researcher,&lt;ref name="MAL NYT" /&gt; is director of the Plants for Human Health Institute.&lt;ref name="NCRC" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:PHHI Building Oct2012.jpg|thumb|right|The Plants for Human Health Institute building at the N.C. Research Campus, Kannapolis, N.C.]]
N.C. State began operations in Kannapolis in 2007 as the Fruit and Vegetable Science Institute. The university was one of the first organizations to join the biotech hub.

The program's name was changed to Plants for Human Health Institute when the N.C. Research Campus was dedicated on October 20, 2008, in order "to more accurately reflect the groundbreaking research approach the institute will take. Institute research will focus on identifying and making available to consumers bioactive compounds in plants that prevent and treat disease."&lt;ref name="N.C. Research Campus dedication" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Research Campus institute gets home" /&gt;

As of May 2014, PHHI has about 50 faculty and staff in Kannapolis, not including seasonal staff.&lt;ref name="PHHI employees stat" /&gt;

== Research ==

=== Overview ===

Plants for Human Health Institute researchers study the potential health-promoting properties of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]].&lt;ref name="GrowingMag" /&gt; The institute employs six lead researchers and has plans to expand to 14 researchers.&lt;ref name="WRAL" /&gt;

The institutes mission is to discover and deliver plant-based solutions to improve human health, PHHI researchers target naturally occurring chemical compounds in plants and [[Produce|fresh produce]], known as [[phytochemicals]], some of which convey health-promoting properties when ingested. Institute director, Lila, and other PHHI researchers have done research into  phytochemicals, such as [[anthocyanins]] present in [[blueberries]] and other crops, indicating they provide health benefits against [[cancer]], [[diabetes]] and other [[Chronic disease|chronic human diseases]] when consumed.&lt;ref name="DrOz" /&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=yes|date=October 2014}}

In 2013, Lila was a lead researcher in a study involving athletes ingesting blueberry and green tea-infused drinks twice daily during a two-week supplementation period and then for three days of rigorous exercise. Among the results, participants experienced a prolonged spike in their metabolism (up to 14 hours) after exercise.&lt;ref name="berrystudy" /&gt;{{npsn|date= October 2014}}

=== Greenhouse Complex ===

[[Image:PHHI greenhouse complex.JPG|thumb|right|The Plants for Human Health Institute greenhouse complex in Kannapolis, N.C.]]The institute operates three [[greenhouses]]. At a cost of $340,000 the greenhouse complex provides about 10,000 square feet of space for plant trials on crops like [[broccoli]] and [[strawberry]], and allow the institute to rent space or collaborate on research with other campus operations and businesses.&lt;ref name="Greenhouses" /&gt;

Researchers also partner with the Piedmont Research Station, a research farm located near [[Salisbury, North Carolina|Salisbury]], N.C., to grow and test [[field crop]]s.&lt;ref name="Cabbage Program" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PRS" /&gt;

=== Kannapolis Scholars ===

Funded by a $1 million [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] – Agriculture &amp; Food Research Initiative (USDA-AFRI) the Kannapolis Scholars is a program for [[graduate students]] from multiple disciplines to participate in integrated research. Led by Jack Odle, William Neal Reynolds, Professor of Nutritional Biochemistry at N.C. State, the examines issuesin the broad domain of [[functional foods]], [[Bioactive plant food compounds|bioactive food components]] and [[human health]].&lt;ref name="KScholars" /&gt; 30 faculty members from eight universities in North Carolina act from multiple disciplines, including [[food science]], [[nutritional science]], [[plant science]], [[animal science]], [[microbiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[metabolomics]] as mentors to the Kannapolis Scholars. Some are resident at the N.C. Research Campus while others are at the associated university campuses.&lt;ref name="KScholars2" /&gt;

=== Plant Pathways Elucidation Project (P2EP) ===

The Plant Pathways Elucidation Project, or P2EP, is a $1.9 million program that engaging college students from across North Carolina in education and research. Started in June 2013, the program is supported by a consortium of academic and industry organizations, including the Plants for Human Health Institute. The program teams university scientists, industry leaders and college students to explore plant health benefits, prepare student scientists to pursue careers in [[STEM fields]] (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), and create a research [[knowledge base]].&lt;ref name="CO-P2EP" /&gt;

The 2014 P2EP summer session includes doctoral candidates and graduate and undergraduate interns from 12 colleges and universities and two high schools in [[Cabarrus County]].&lt;ref name="P2EP" /&gt;

The N.C. Cooperative Extension Service houses a multidisciplinary team at the N.C. Research Campus as part of the Plants for Human Health Institute. The team is an education and outreach component directed toward farm and agribusiness management, communications and marketing, and fresh produce safety.

=== Programs ===

In addition to and in partnership with PHHI research programs, the Cooperative Extension group coordinates educational and outreach efforts, secures grants and delivers practical applications of science-based research to strengthen the agriculture industry in North Carolina.

The N.C. Value-Added Cost Share Program (NCVACS), coordinated by the Cooperative Extension team at PHHI, provides assistance to agricultural operations in the form of cost share awards. The program has awarded more than $1 million to support [[agribusinesses]] in North Carolina since it began in 2009. The N.C. Tobacco Trust Fund Commission funds the program.&lt;ref name="SFN" /&gt;

The N.C. Cooperative Extension component of PHHI is a cooperative development center for the state, supported by the [[USDA Rural Development|U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development program]], the group works with producer groups and cooperatives to expand economic activity.&lt;ref name="RCDG" /&gt;

PHHI is home to the N.C. Fresh Produce Safety program, a program of the Cooperative Extension, established to educate fruit and vegetable growers about minimizing [[food safety]] risks. The program's training curriculum addresses [[Good Agricultural Practices|Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs)]].&lt;ref name="FPS" /&gt;

=== History ===

Blake Brown, Hugh C. Kiger Professor in agricultural economics at N.C. State, started the Program for Value-Added and Alternative Agriculture in 2006 with support from the N.C. Tobacco Trust Fund Commission. The program was originally created to assist the transition of tobacco-farm families to other profitable enterprises after the [[Tobacco Buyout]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="TTFC" /&gt;

As part of N.C. State's development of the N.C. Research Campus, the program relocated to Kannapolis in 2008 as an on-site Cooperative Extension complement to the research personnel and programs with the institute. The program operated under the N.C. MarketReady brand from October 2009 until July 2012.&lt;ref name="N.C. MarketReady name change" /&gt; The program has since dropped the name and been fully integrated into the institute as the N.C. Cooperative Extension component.

== N.C. Research Campus ==
{{main article|North Carolina Research Campus}}
[[Image:N.C. Research Campus aerial image.jpg|thumb|left|The N.C. Research Campus]]
The [[North Carolina Research Campus|N.C. Research Campus]] is a public-private venture including eight universities, one community college, the [[David H. Murdock Research Institute]] (DHMRI), the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and corporate entities that collaborate to advance the fields of human health, [[nutrition]] and [[agriculture]]. It was founded by [[David H. Murdock]], CEO of [[Dole Foods]]. The campus is built upon the former site of the [[Cannon Mills|Cannon Textile Mill]] in [[Kannapolis]], about 30 miles north of [[Charlotte]].

The research campus represents an effort by the state of [[North Carolina]] to revitalize the region following the decline of the [[textile industry]]. The campus is supported mainly through annual funding from the state of North Carolina, federal research grants to university researchers located on the campus, and investment of real estate by Murdock, former owner of the Cannon textile mill that previously occupied the site.

It was announced in November 2013 that two new facilities were breaking ground at the Kannapolis campus, including a 50,000-square-foot data center (DataChambers) and a 100,000-square-foot municipal center (the new Kannapolis City Hall).&lt;ref name="groundbreaking" /&gt;

The Plants for Human Health Institute is housed on the campus in a 105,000-square-foot facility that includes research labs, lab support areas and an Advance II 700 US-2 Magnet [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscope.&lt;ref name="building" /&gt;

== Funding ==
The institute has received $2.1 million in gift donations and $7.8 million in federal and private competitive grants, $1.42 million from the N.C. Tobacco Trust Fund Commission, $2 million from the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]], $780,000 from the [[University of North Carolina]] General Administration, and $1.05 million from commodity groups and other private sponsors. This funding is in addition to state appropriations.&lt;ref name="CALS report" /&gt; PHHI research programs have also received significant grant funding support from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref name="Gates" /&gt; and the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name="NIH" /&gt;

'''Positive non-interventionism''' was the [[economic policy]] of [[Hong Kong]]; this policy can be traced back to the time when Hong Kong was under [[United Kingdom|British]] rule. It was first officially implemented in 1971 by [[Financial Secretary (Hong Kong)|Financial Secretary of Hong Kong]] [[John James Cowperthwaite|John Cowperthwaite]], who observed that the economy was doing well in the absence of [[government intervention]] but it was important to create the regulatory and physical infrastructure to facilitate [[free market|market]]-based decision making. The policy was continued by subsequent Financial Secretaries, including Sir [[Philip Haddon-Cave]]. Economist [[Milton Friedman]] has cited it as a fairly comprehensive implementation of [[laissez-faire]] policy, although Haddon-Cave has stated that the description of Hong Kong as a laissez-faire society was "frequent but inadequate".&lt;ref&gt;[http://psweb.sbs.ohio-state.edu/faculty/mcooper/ps536readings/cheung_interventionism.pdf Journal of Contemporary China] (2000), 9(24) 291-308&lt;/ref&gt;

== First-hand explanation ==
According to Cowperthwaite:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the long run, the aggregate of decisions of individual businessmen, exercising individual judgment in a free economy, even if often mistaken, is less likely to do harm than the centralised decisions of a government; and certainly the harm is likely to be counteracted faster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legco.gov.hk/1966/h660324.pdf Official Report of Proceedings of the Hong Kong Legislative Council] (March 24–25, 1966) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Haddon-Cave:

&lt;blockquote&gt;positive non-interventionism involves taking the view that it is normally futile and damaging to the [[Economic growth|growth rate]] of an economy, particularly an [[open economy]], for the Government to attempt to plan the allocation of resources available to the [[private sector]] and to frustrate the operation of market forces&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Haddon-Cave goes on to say that the "positive" part means the government carefully considers each possible intervention to determine "where the advantage" lies, and, although usually it will come to the conclusion that the intervention is harmful, sometimes it will decide to intervene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3172">The '''public relations officer''' ('''PRO''') or '''chief communications officer''' ('''CCO''') or '''corporate communications officer''' is the head of [[communication]]s, [[public relations]], and/or [[Public affairs (military)|public affairs]] in an organization. Typically, the CCO of a [[corporation]] reports to the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO). The CCO may hold an academic degree in communications.

== Role ==
The CCO of a company is the corporate officer primarily responsible for managing the communications risks and opportunities of a business, both internally and externally. This executive is typically responsible for communications to a wide range of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], including employees, shareholders, media, bloggers, influential members of the business community, the press, the community and the public. Typically, the CCO may partner with others in the organization to communicate with investors, analysts, customers and company Board members. Most organizations will rely on the CCO to advise and participate in decisions that may impact the ongoing [[reputation]] of the firm.

The Chief Communications Officer role is further defined by the Arthur Page Society. This study indicates the importance in the role especially as a key advisor to the CEO. In addition to the Chief Communications Officer title, comparable titles include Vice President of Corporate Communications, Vice President of Public Affairs or Public Information Officer in governmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awpagesociety.com/site/resources/ Resources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015043809/http://www.awpagesociety.com/site/resources/ |date=October 15, 2010 }} Arthur W. Page Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==
Qualifications of the CCO typically include communications experience with multiple stakeholder groups. Early experience may include journalism, work in a public relations agency or an MBA-type background in strategy or business development. In many cases, the CCO will need to assume responsibility for plans and outcomes that are the result of actions by persons throughout the organization. Korn/Ferry’s Corporate Affairs Center of Expertise&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130916105346/http://kornferryinstitute.com/sites/all/files//documents/briefings-magazine-download/Chief%20Communications%20Officers-%20A%20Survey%20of%20Fortune%20200%20Companies%20.pdf "The Chief Communications Officer: A Survey of Fortune 200 Companies"] Korn/Ferry Institute, April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study of CCOs at 67 Fortune 200 companies in order to develop a current profile of the individuals who run the communications function at major global organizations. The survey reviewed how these executives are compensated, the size and scope of their responsibility and where they reside organizationally.

'''Roger Jaar''' is a [[Haiti]]an businessman with operations largely in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name="Raynald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portfolio.raynald.co/importante-entente-avec-un-producteur-de-vins-de-provence/ |title=Important agreement with a producer of wines of Provence |editor=Admin |date=25 February 2014 |publisher=Portfolio Raynald |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Jaar was born in [[Fort-de-France]], [[Martinique]], to a family of Arab-Palestinian descent from [[Bethlehem]], moved to Haiti at a young age where he had grown up.&lt;ref name="Raynald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2003-07-28/business/0307250469_1_miami-s-little-haiti-haitian-neighborhood-center-haitian-tv |title=Reaching Haitians Via Cable |editor=Hemlock, Doreen |date=28 July 2003 |publisher=Sun Sentinel |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Roger and his brother Raymond Jaar bought the [[Brasserie de la Couronne]], one of the oldest soft drink companies in Haiti and supplier of the popular local drink, [[Cola Couronne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/130685/La-Brasserie-de-la-Couronne-recoit-la-visite-du-Premier-ministre-Lamothe.html |title=La Brasserie de la Couronne reçoit la visite du Premier ministre Lamothe |editor=Belfort, Jocelyn |date=6 May 2014 |publisher=Le Nouvelliste |accessdate=24 February 2016}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1991 Haitian coup d'état]] of [[Raoul Cédras]], Jaar left Haiti to pursue investments abroad. Initially, considering opening up a brewery in [[Miami]], he decided to open it in Quebec instead, a ''microbrewery'' called [[Les Brasseurs RJ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesaffaires.com/secteurs-d-activite/general/du-coke-en-haiti-a-la-sainte-paix-au-quebec/547167 |title=Du Coke en Haïti à la Sainte Paix au Québec |editor=Joncas, Hugo |date=8 April 2012 |publisher=Les Affaires |accessdate=24 February 2016}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Samuel Fränkel was born 22 November 1801 in Zülz (currently [[Biała Prudnicka]], [[Poland]]). In 1827 he moved to Neustadt O.S. (currently [[Prudnik]]). He founded a terrycloth factory at the shore of [[Prudnik (river)|Prudnik river]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://prudnik24.pl/index.php/2015/01/13/jak-zmienial-sie-prudnik-z-inicjatywy-rodzin-frankel-pinkus-cz-1/|title=Jak zmieniał się Prudnik z inicjatywy rodzin Fränkel i Pinkus – cz. 1 - Prudnik24|date=2015-01-13|work=Prudnik24|access-date=2018-11-03|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''The Society of Psychologists in Management''' (SPIM) is a professional association of [[psychologist]]s who also serve in [[management|managerial]] or leadership positions.

==History and purpose==
The Society of Psychologists in Management was founded in 1985 in [[Tampa, Florida]] by a small group of psychologists who also served in managerial roles. These included Anthony Broskowski, Richard Kilburg,&lt;ref&gt;Carey School of Business, Johns Hopkins University&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight Harshbarger, Margaret Hastings, and [[Harry Levinson]]. The intent was to provide a professional home and identity for psychologists who were no longer working as practicing or academic psychologists, both to help them retain their identity and to recognize psychology-management as a distinctive profession.

==Presidents of SPIM==
The presidents of SPIM have been Richard Kilburg (1985–1986), Anthony Broskowski (1986–87), D. Dwight Harshbarger (1987–1988), Elizabeth Wales (1989–1990), Darwin (Deke) Dorr, (1990–1991), Dory Hollander (1991–1992), Ken Ball (1992–1993), Robert Perloff (1993–1994), [[Rodney L. Lowman]] (1994–1995), Marc T. Frankel (1995–1996), Ann Howard (1996–1997), Mark Ginsberg (1997–1998), Arthur M. Freedman (1998–1999), Paul Lloyd (1999–2000), Robert P. Lowman (2000–2001), Donald O. Clifton (2001–2002), Carl Greenberg (2002–2003), [[Marilyn Gowing]] (2003–2004), Linda Richardson (2004–2005), Dale Thompson (2005–2006), [[Judith Albino]], 2006–2007, John C. Bruckman (2007–2008) and [[Cathleen Civiello]] (2008–2009). The current president is Roger Cooper (2010–2011).

==Conferences, awards, and journal==
SPIM holds an annual mid-winter conference for psychologist-managers and also provides programming at the annual meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]]. The Society annually awards the Distinguished Psychologist in Management (DPIM) Award and the Richard Kilburg Service Award. It also publishes an [[academic journal]], ''[[The Psychologist-Manager Journal]]''. The journal has provided professional guidance relevance for psychologist-managers (e.g., crisis management, Ball, 2005; principles for growing a company, Clifton, 1999; transformational leadership, Eisenhower) and special issues such as on The Psychologist-President (Lowman, 1999). The organization also formed a not-for-profit foundation to further its charitable purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22918">{{for|the South Korean film|Sovereign Default}}{{Use British English|date=October 2018}}{{Insolvency}}
A '''sovereign default''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|v|ər|ᵻ|n}}){{refn|group=n|When used as a noun in a financial context, ''default'' takes stress on the second syllable; in other senses of the word, it may take stress on the first syllable, depending on the speaker's dialect.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of "default" |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/default |website=Collins Dictionary |publisher=Collins| accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is the failure or refusal of the [[government]] of a [[sovereign state]] to pay back [[Government debt|its debt]] in full. Cessation of due payments (or receivables) may either be accompanied by formal declaration (repudiation) of a government not to pay (or only partially pay) its debts, or it may be unannounced. A [[credit rating agency]] will take into account in its gradings capital, interest, extraneous and procedural [[default (finance)|default]]s, failures to abide by the terms of bonds or other debt instruments.  Countries have at times escaped the real burden of some of their debt through [[inflation]].  This is not "default" in the usual sense because the debt is honored, albeit with currency of lesser real value.  Sometimes governments [[Devaluation|devalue their currency]]. This can be done by printing more money to apply toward their own debts, or by ending or altering the convertibility of their currencies into precious metals or foreign currency at fixed rates.  Harder to quantify than an interest or capital default, this often is defined as an extraneous or procedural default (breach) of terms of the contracts or other instruments.

If potential lenders or bond purchasers begin to suspect that a government may fail to pay back its debt, they may demand a high interest rate in [[risk premium|compensation for the risk]] of default. A dramatic rise in the interest rate faced by a government due to fear that it will fail to honor its debt is sometimes called a '''[[debt crisis|sovereign debt crisis]]'''. Governments may be especially vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis when they rely on financing through short-term bonds, since this creates a situation of [[maturity mismatch]] between their short-term bond financing and the long-term asset value of their tax base.

They may also be vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis due to [[currency mismatch]]: if few bonds in their own currency are accepted abroad, and so the country issues mainly foreign-denominated bonds, decrease in the value of their own currency can make it prohibitively expensive to pay back their foreign-denominated bonds (see [[Original Sin (economics)|original sin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B. |last=Eichengreen |authorlink=Barry Eichengreen |first2=R. |last2=Hausmann |year=2005 |title=Other People's Money: Debt Denomination and Financial Instability in Emerging Economies |location=Chicago |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-19455-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] government, by definition, controls its own affairs, it cannot be obliged to pay back its debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=E. |last=Borensztein |first2=U. |last2=Panizza  |url=http://vox.lacea.org/fckeditor.html?q=node/25 |title=The Costs of Sovereign Default: Theory and Reality |work=VOXLACEA |date=Nov 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, governments may face severe pressure from lending countries. In a few extreme cases, a major creditor nation, before the establishment of the [[UN Charter]] Article 2 (4) prohibiting [[use of force by states]], made threats of war or waged war against a debtor nation for failing to pay back debt to seize assets to enforce its [[creditor's rights]]. For example, Britain [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|invaded Egypt in 1882]]. Other examples include the United States' "[[gunboat diplomacy]]" in Venezuela in the mid-1890s and the [[United States occupation of Haiti]] beginning in 1915.&lt;ref name="This-time-is-different"&gt;{{cite book |first=Carmen M. | last=Reinhart |first2=Kenneth S. |last2=Rogoff | year=2009 |title=This time is different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly (p. 54ff) |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=0-691-14216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today a government which defaults may be widely excluded from further credit, some of its overseas assets may be seized;&lt;ref name="This-time-is-different"/&gt; and it may face political pressure from its own domestic bondholders to pay back its debt. Therefore, governments rarely default on the entire value of their debt. Instead, they often enter into negotiations with their bondholders to agree on a delay ([[debt restructuring]]) or partial reduction of their debt  (a '[[Haircut (finance)|haircut or write-off]]').

Some economists have argued that, in the case of acute [[insolvency]] crises, it can be advisable for [[regulator (economics)|regulators]] and [[supranational]] [[lender]]s to preemptively engineer the orderly restructuring of a nation’s public debt- also called "orderly default" or "controlled default".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. Nicolas J. |last=Firzli |title=Greece and the Roots the EU Debt Crisis |journal=The Vienna Review |date=March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nouriel |last=Roubini |authorlink=Nouriel Roubini |title=Greece’s best option is an orderly default |newspaper=Financial Times |date=June 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek debt crisis|the case of Greece]], these experts generally believe that a delay in organising an orderly default would hurt the rest of Europe even more.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Armitstead, "EU accused of 'head in sand' attitude to Greek debt crisis" ''The Telegraph'', 23 June  2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Monetary Fund]] often lends for sovereign debt restructuring. To ensure that funds will be available to pay the remaining part of the sovereign debt, it has made such loans [[conditionality|conditional]] on acts such as reducing [[corruption]], imposing [[austerity|austerity measures]] such as reducing [[public sector|non-profitable public sector]] services, raising the tax take (revenue) or more rarely suggesting other forms of revenue raising such as [[nationalization]] of inept or corrupt but lucrative economic sectors. A recent example is the [[European sovereign debt crisis#Greek government funding crisis|Greek bailout agreement of May 2010]].

== Causes ==
According to financial historian [[Edward Chancellor]], past instances of sovereign default have tended to occur under some or all of the following circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/files/2010/07/chancellor.pdf ''Reflections on the sovereign debt crisis''], Edward Chancellor, GMO White Paper, Juli 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A reversal of global capital flows
* Unwise lending
* Fraudulent lending
* Excessive foreign debts
* A poor credit history
* Unproductive lending
* Rollover risk
* Weak revenues
* Rising interest rates
* [[Terminal debt]]

A significant factor in sovereign default is the presence of significant debts owed to foreign investors such as banks who are unable to obtain timely payment via political support from governments, supranational courts or negotiation; the enforcement of [[creditors' rights]] against sovereign states is frequently difficult. Such willful defaults (the equivalent of [[strategic bankruptcy]] by a company or [[strategic default]] by a mortgager, except without the possibility of the exercise of normal creditors' rights such as asset seizure and sale) can be considered a variety of sovereign [[theft]]; this is similar to [[expropriation]] (including inadequate repayment for the exercise of [[eminent domain]]).&lt;ref name=theft&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Mark|last2=Tomz|first2=Mike|editor1-first=William |editor1-last=Hogan|editor2-first=Federico|editor2-last=Sturzenegger|title=The Natural Resources Trap: Private Investment without Public Commitment|url=http://www.econ.ucla.edu/mlwright/research/workingpapers/Papers.html#Theft|accessdate=6 November 2011|year=2010|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA, USA|pages=69–110|chapter=Sovereign Theft: Theory and Evidence about Sovereign Default and Expropriation|chapterurl=http://www.econ.ucla.edu/mlwright/research/workingpapers/TomzWrightExpropriationDefault.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Is Walking Away From Your Mortgage Immoral? | first = James R. | last = Hagerty | date = 2009-12-17 | journal = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2009/12/17/is-walking-away-from-your-mortgage-immoral/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{Who?|date=October 2018}} also believe that sovereign default is a dark side of globalization and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisayis.com/sovereign-default-the-dark-side-of-globalization-and-capitalism/ |title=Sovereign Default-The dark side of globalization and capitalism |publisher=AllISayIs.com |date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolvency/over-indebtedness of the state===
{{duplication|date=March 2014}}
If a state, for economic reasons, defaults on its treasury obligations, or is no longer able or willing to handle its debt, liabilities, or to pay the interest on this debt, it faces sovereign default.  To declare insolvency, it is sufficient if the state is only able (or willing&lt;ref name=theft/&gt;) to pay part of its due interest or to clear off only part of the debt.

Reasons for this include:{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*massive increases in [[public debt]]
*declines in employment and therefore [[tax revenue]]
*government regulation or perceived threats of [[Financial regulation|regulation of financial markets]]
*popular unrest at [[austerity]] measures to repay debt fully

Sovereign default caused by insolvency historically has always appeared at the end of long years or decades of [[Government budget|budget]] emergency ([[overspending]]&lt;ref name="Baqir, Reza"&gt;{{citation|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/2192.html|title=Districts, spillovers, and government overspending|author=Baqir, Reza|publisher=World Bank|date=30 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in which the state has spent more money than it received.  This budget balance/margin was covered through new indebtedness with national and foreign citizens, banks and states.

===Illiquidity===
The literature proposes an important distinction between ''illiquidity'' and ''insolvency''. If a country is temporarily unable to meet pending interest or principle payments because it can not liquify sufficient assets, it is "in default because of illiquidity". In this concept the default can be solved as soon as the assets which are "only temporarily illiquid" become ''liquid'' (again), which makes illiquidity a temporary state - in contrast to insolvency. The weakness of this concept is that is practically impossible to prove that an asset is only temporarily illiquid.

===Change of government===
While normally the change of government does not change the responsibility of the state to handle treasury obligations created by earlier governments, nevertheless it can be observed that in revolutionary situations and after a [[regime change]] the new government may question the legitimacy of the earlier one, and thus default on those treasury obligations considered [[odious debt]].

Important examples are:
*default of debts of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] France after the [[French Revolution]].
*default of bonds through [[Denmark]] in 1850, which were issued by the government of [[Holstein]] instated by the [[German Confederation]].
*default of debts of the [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government came to power in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Landon-Lane J., Oosterlinck K., (2006), "Hope springs eternal: French bondholders and the Soviet Repudiation (1915-1919)", Review of Finance, 10, 4, pp. 507-535.&lt;/ref&gt;
*repudiation of debts of the [[Confederate States of America]] by the [[United States]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] through the ratification of Section 4 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

===Decline of the state===
With the decline of a state,{{clarify|date=November 2011|reason=how is this distinct from successor governments discussed above?}} its obligations are turned over to one or several [[succession of states|successor state]]s.

Lost wars significantly accelerate sovereign default. Nevertheless, especially after [[World War II]] the [[government debt]] has increased significantly in many countries even during long lasting times of peace. While in the beginning debt was quite small, due to [[compound interest]] and continued [[overspending]]&lt;ref name="Baqir, Reza"/&gt; it has increased substantially.

== Approaches to debt repayment ==
There are two different theories as to why sovereign countries repay their debt.

=== Reputation approach ===
The reputation approach stipulates that countries value the access to international capital markets because it allows them to smooth consumption in the face of volatile output and/or fluctuating investment opportunities. This approach assumes no outside factors such as legal or military action because the debtor is a sovereign country. Debtor countries with poor reputations will lack access to these capital markets.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/why-sovereigns-repay-debts-external-creditors-and-why-it-matters|title=Why sovereigns repay debts to external creditors and why it matters|last=|first=|date=|website=VoxEU.org|jstor=2296886|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punishment approach ===
The punishment approach stipulates that the debtor will be punished in some form, whether it be by legal action and/or military force. The creditor will use legal and/or military threats to see their investment returned. The punishment may prevent debtors from being able to borrow in their own currency.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;

==Consequences==
Creditors of the state as well the economy and the citizens of the state are affected by the sovereign default.

===Consequences for creditors===

The immediate cost to creditors is the loss of principal and interest owed on their loans to the defaulting country.

In this case very often there are international negotiations which end in a partial [[debt cancellation]] ([[London Agreement on German External Debts]] 1953) or [[debt restructuring]] (e.g. [[Brady Bonds]] in the 1980s). This kind of agreement assures the partial repayment when a renunciation / surrender of a big part of the debt is accepted by the creditor. In the case of the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)]] some creditors elected to accept the renunciation (loss, or "haircut") of up to 75% of the outstanding debts, while others ( "holdouts") elected instead to await a change of government (2015) for offers of better compensation.

For the purpose of debts regulation debts can be distinguished by nationality of creditor (national or international), or by the currency of the debts (own currency or foreign currency) as well as whether the foreign creditors are private or state owned. States are frequently more willing to cancel debts owed to foreign private creditors, unless those creditors have means of retaliation against the state.&lt;ref name=theft/&gt;

===Consequences for state===
When a state defaults on a debt, the state disposes of (or ignores, depending on the viewpoint) its financial obligations/debts towards certain creditors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The immediate effect for the state is a reduction in its total debt and a reduction in payments on the interest of that debt. On the other hand, a default can damage the reputation of the state among creditors, which can restrict the ability of the state to obtain credit from the capital market.&lt;ref name=theft/&gt; In some cases foreign lenders may attempt to undermine the [[Monetary Sovereignty|monetary sovereignty]] of the debtor state or even declare war (see above).

===Consequences for the citizen===
If the individual citizen or corporate citizen is a creditor of the state (e.g. [[government bonds]]), then a default by the state can mean a devaluation of their monetary wealth.

In addition, the following scenarios can occur in a debtor state from a sovereign default:
* a [[banking crisis]], as banks have to make [[Writedowns|write downs]] on credits given to the state.
* an [[economic crisis]], as the interior [[demand]] will fall and investors withdraw their money
* a [[currency crisis]] as foreign investors avoid this national economy

Citizens of a debtor state might feel the impact indirectly through high unemployment and the decrease of state services and benefits. However, a [[Monetary sovereignty|monetarily sovereign]] state can take steps to minimize negative consequences, rebalance the economy and foster social/economic progress, for example Brazil's [[Plano Real]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lim |first=Richard |url=http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/brazil-battle-against-inflation/ |title=Brazil's Battle Against Inflation |publisher=Soundsandcolours.com |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
With the reputation of the [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|Big Three]] &amp;ndash; [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]] and [[Fitch Group]] &amp;ndash; coming under fire since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], many have questioned their ratings methods. Marc Joffe, a former Senior Director at Moody's and now Principal Consultant at [http://www.publicsectorcredit.org/ Public Sector Credit Solutions] (PSCS), has recently argued that economists and other academic social scientists, via logit and probit [[Econometric model|econometric models]], are better equipped than ratings agencies to assess the default risk of sovereigns and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/rating-government-bonds-can-we-raise-our-grade |title=Joffe, Marc. "Rating Government Bonds: Can We Raise Our Grade?" Econ Journal Watch 9(3): 350-365, September 2012 |publisher=Econjwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support better ratings methods, PSCS (in partnership with [[Wikirating]]) maintains a comprehensive public database of sovereign defaults, revenues, expenditures, debt levels, and debt service costs. PSCS has also developed the [[Public Sector Credit Framework]], an open source budget simulation model that helps analysts assess default probabilities.

==Examples of sovereign default==
{{main article|List of sovereign defaults}}
A failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. [[Philip II of Spain]] defaulted on debt four times – in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596 – becoming the first nation in history to declare sovereign default due to rising military costs and the declining value of gold,  as it had become increasingly dependent on the revenues flowing in from its [[Spanish Empire|mercantile empire]] in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~cowen/~GEL115/115CH8.html Gold and Silver: Spain and the New World] University of California&lt;/ref&gt; This sovereign default threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the [[Fuggers]] as Spanish financiers. [[Republic of Genoa#Golden age of Genoa|Genoese]] bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further military ventures.

In the 1820s, several Latin American countries which had recently entered the bond market in London defaulted. These same countries frequently defaulted during the nineteenth century, but the situation was typically rapidly resolved with a renegotiation of loans, including the writing off of some debts.&lt;ref name="jorgensen"&gt;Erika Jorgensen and Jeffrey Sachs, "Default and Renegotiation of Latin American Foreign Bonds in the Interwar Period" In: Barry J. Eichengreen and Peter H. Lindert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K42LgBw0zqMC The International Debt Crisis in Historical Perspective]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A failure to meet payments became common again in the late 1920s and 1930s; as protectionism by wealthy nations rose and international trade fell especially after the banking crisis of 1929, countries possessing debts denominated in other currencies found it increasingly difficult to meet terms agreed under more favourable economic conditions.  For example, in 1932, Chile's scheduled repayments exceeded the nation's total exports (or, at least, its exports under current pricing; whether reductions in prices – forced sales – would have enabled fulfilling [[creditors' rights]] is unknown).&lt;ref name="jorgensen" /&gt;

More recently Greece became the first developed country to default to the International Monetary Fund. In June 2015 Greece defaulted on a $1.7 billion payment to the IMF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/30/news/economy/greece-imf-default/index.html|title=Greece defaults on $1.7 billion IMF payment|last=Liakos|first=Virginia Harrison and Chris|date=2015-06-30|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''''The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid''''' originally appeared as an article by [[C. K. Prahalad]] and [[Stuart L. Hart]] in the business journal ''[[Strategy+Business]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuartlhart.com/sites/stuartlhart.com/files/Prahalad_Hart_2001_SB.pdf The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt; The article was followed by a book with the same title that discusses new business models targeted at providing goods and services to the poorest people in the world. It makes a case for the fastest growing new markets and entrepreneurial opportunities being found among the billions of poor people 'at the bottom of the [financial] pyramid'. According to [[Bill Gates]], it "offers an intriguing blueprint for how to fight poverty with profitability." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Fortune-Bottom-Pyramid-Eradicating-Poverty/dp/0131467506 From the blurbs about the book], via Amazon.com, retrieved October 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The book consists of a number of case studies, one to a chapter, about businesses that have thrived with such models.  These include the businesses [[Casas Bahia]], [[Patrimonio Hoy]], [[Bank of Madura]], [[Aravind Eye Hospital]], [[Jaipur rugs]] and [[Project Shakti]] and how they were founded.

[[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]] '''Thomas Moody''' (1779–1849), {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|ADC|JP|}}, [[Order of Military Merit (France)|Knight of the Order of Military Merit of France]], was a British [[Colonial Office|Aide-de-camp to the Colonial Office]], [[Royal Engineer]], and merchant. He served as the Commander of the [[Royal Engineers]] in the [[West Indies]], as the Director of several trading companies in the [[City of London]], and as an Advisor to the [[East India Company]].

Moody was [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary Commissioner]] into the conditions of African slaves in the [[West Indies]], as which he engaged in a feud with [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]]. Moody's ultimate conclusion was that the indentured [[Africans]] in the West Indies should be taken back to West Africa.

In 1828, Moody and his friend [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Stirling]] offered to [[Australia|colonise Australia]] using their own capital, but were prohibited from doing so by the British Government.

Thomas was born into a family with an extensive history of military service to the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; He was the third son of Thomas Moody (1732–1796)&lt;ref name="royalengineers.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalengineers.ca/Moody.html|title=The Royal Engineers: Colonel Richard Clement Moody|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Blakey Smith, ed., 'The Journal of Arthur Thomas Bushby, 1858–1859,' British Columbia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalengineers.ca/SapperJune1958.html|title=The Sapper Vol. 5 No. 1 June 1958|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Blamire (1740–1806),&lt;ref name="longtown19.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longtown19.co.uk/some_longtown_families.84.html|title=The Moody Family, Some Longtown Families|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a member of the Blamire family of [[Cumberland]] and a cousin of [[William Blamire|William Blamire MP, High Sheriff of Cumberland]], and a cousin of the poet [[Susanna Blamire]].&lt;ref name="longtown19.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; He was born in [[Longtown, Cumbria]].&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; His eldest brother, Charles, was a merchant in the [[West Indies]], and his other brother, George, was a surgeon.

===Character and society===
In character, Moody was obsessed with social hierarchy, discipline, and surveillance:&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; with what he termed 'the bonds of respect and subordination'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Moody was a [[Freemason]] and was described by [[Humphrey Fleming Senhouse|Sir Humphrey Fleming Senhouse]] as 'an Officer of high character and reputation'.&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"/&gt;
Moody was incorporated in diverse factions of the London establishment.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Inside the Colonial Office, Moody had 'all its archives open to him'.&lt;ref name="Pardue"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pardue|first=Jeffrey David|title=Agent of Imperial Change: James Macqueen and the British Empire, 1778-1870|year=1996|publisher=University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[City of London]], Moody was an Advisor to the [[East India Company]]; a Director of the Crown Life Assurance Company, of [[Blackfriars, London|33 Bridge Street, Blackfriars]];&lt;ref name="Kalendar"/&gt; and a Director of the [[New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company]], of 5 Coptball Court, London.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=19706|page=269|date=12 February 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was a member of the [[Political Economy Club]], at which he disputed with both [[James Mill]] and [[John Ramsay McCulloch]], and at which he admired the philosophy of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]].&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody’s other friends included [[Robert Wilmot-Horton|Sir Robert Wilmot Horton]], with whom he had an extensive private correspondence,&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; and after
whom he named one of his sons;&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; [[Shute Barrington|Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham]], after whom he named another of his sons;&lt;ref name="Shute Barrington correspondence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence with Major Moody, of Barrington, Shute (1734 - 1826), Bishop of Durham|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/N13994364}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Leith (British Army officer)|Sir James Leith]], after whom he named another of his sons;&lt;ref name="DFB James Leith Moody"/&gt; [[Humphrey Fleming Senhouse|Sir Humphrey Fleming Senhouse]];&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"/&gt; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]];&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; [[James Macqueen]];&lt;ref name="Pardue"/&gt; [[James Mangles (Royal Navy officer)|James Mangles]];&lt;ref name="Ambition's Fire"/&gt; [[Thomas Hyde Villiers]];&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt; and [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Stirling]].&lt;ref name="Wakefield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stirling letter"/&gt;

Moody was a [[polymath]] who read in several languages, and in diverse subjects, including philosophy, climatology, sociology, economics, history, and physics.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; His reading included the works of [[Montesquieu]]; [[William Petty]]; [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] (whom he knew personally, and of whom he was a fervent admirer);&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;[[Johannes van den Bosch]]; and those of the [[Africans]] [[Toussaint Louverture]] and [[Henri Christophe]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; He was also influenced by the [[Africa]]n [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], the [[President of Haiti]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; He disputed the economic philosophy of [[James Mill]], that of [[John Ramsay McCulloch]], and that of [[Adam Smith]], and admired the philosophy of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]].&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;
Moody was also extensively read in abolitionist literature.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

==West Indies==
===Aide-de-camp (1797 - 1821)===
Moody arrived in Barbados in 1797,&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; to serve as mathematics master,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rupprecht|first1=Anita|last2= |first2= |date=September 2012|title='When he gets among his countrymen,they tell him that he is free': Slave Trade Abolition, Indentured Africans and a Royal Commission|journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition|volume=33 |issue=3 |pages= 435–455|doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; writing master,&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; and Assistant Headmaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codrington.org/site/index.php/important-dates|title=Codrington College, Barbados: Important Dates}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Codrington College]], at which he served until 1805.&lt;ref name="Parry"&gt;{{cite book|title=Codrington College in the Island of Barbados|author=Thomas Parry, Bishop of Barbados|publisher=Society for the Propagation of the Gospel|year=1847|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these positions, Moody demonstrated such an aptitude for mathematics that [[Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth|Lord Seaforth]], the [[List of Governors of Barbados|British General in Barbados]], granted Moody his patronage,&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; and procured for Moody a direct commission in the [[Royal Engineers]],&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Barbados|author=Schomburgk, Sir Robert H.|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Moody entered as a Lieutenant on 1 July 1806.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Military Calendar"/&gt; Moody's first duty was to administer the Office of Ordinance in [[Demerara]],&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; and he proceeded, subsequently, to distinguish himself in the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; Moody was promoted to Second Captain on 1 May 1811; to Captain on 20 December 1814; and to Brevet Major on 23 May 1816.&lt;ref name="Royal Military Calendar"/&gt; [[File:LordSeaforthByThomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|upright|Moody was recruited into the [[Royal Engineers]] by [[Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth|Lord Seaforth]]]]

In 1816, Moody was responsible for the transfer of groups of rescued Africans to the Crown estates in [[Guadeloupe]]. Moody believed that rescued Africans made an 'extremely useful' contribution to the British Empire.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; His competent performance in this appointment may have contributed to his subsequent appointment as a Parliamentary Commissioner on Slavery.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

===Estates===
Moody owned plantations in Barbados by 1816, but he supported the Barbados Slave Rebellions of September and October 1816, which he witnessed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fliphtml5.com/ngat/kjqo|title=Letter of Thomas Moody to H.

===French knighthood (1820)===
In 1820, Moody was knighted by [[Louis XVIII]] in the [[Order of Military Merit (France)|Order of Military Merit]] for defending the French colony of [[Guadeloupe]]. He was permitted by [[George IV]] to wear the Cross of the Order whilst in Britain, but not to use the title 'Sir'.&lt;ref name="Bulletins"&gt;{{cite book | last =| first = | title = Bulletins and Other State Intelligence Compiled and Arranged from the Official Documents published in the London Gazette, 1820| page=220 |publisher=R.

===The Parliamentary Commission on Slavery (1821 - 1828)===
In 1821, [[William Wilberforce]] proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] the creation a Commission to investigate the condition of slaves in the West Indies due to omnipresent reports that the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which had made the trade of slaves illegal, was being universally violated by wealthy plantation owners, who were redesignating their slaves as 'apprentices' and continuing to trade.&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"&gt;{{cite book |title = Slave Trade.

Moody and John Dougan (1765-1826) volunteered for each of the commissionerships and were selected by Bathurst.&lt;ref Name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody was a friend of the President of Tortola, the island on which the commissioners were to commence their investigations.&lt;ref Name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Dougan was the son of an owner of sugar plantations on Demerara: Dougan stated, 'all my nearest relations and friends were either Planters or Owners of slaves'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan had lived on Tortola, where he worked as a merchant, privateer, Prize Agent for the Royal Navy, and Colonial administrator.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan was the uncle of Moody's wife,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Martha Clement,&lt;ref name= "Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL"/&gt; and the son of a slave-plantation owner.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Dougan was influenced by the zealous idealism of [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] agitators in England, such as the [[Quaker]] [[John Barton (Quaker)|John Barton]],&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Slave Trade.

Moody and Dougan arrived on Tortola in May 1822.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody objected to the interview process recommended by the Commission, in which masters and apprentices were supposed to be interviewed together, because he thought that it were 'calculated to excite complaints of the servant against the master'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Among the ex-slaverowners interviewed by Moody was Abraham Mendes Belisario, the Deputy Provost Marshal of Tortola, who possessed 17 African apprentices.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; As a consequence of the unreliability of the reports of apprentices that such masters provided, which were known as 'Characters' of apprentices, Moody insisted that such reports should not be heard, nor quoted in the official Commission report, but that he and Dougan, the Commissioners, should specify only their own opinions of the masters of the apprentices.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

The Commissioners recorded that many black African apprentices were employed by free black [[Africans]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; When ‘apprentices’ employed by H. C. Maclean, a prosperous merchant who served as Comptroller of the Customs on Tortola, complained to the Commission, Macclean had them beaten. Moody refused to criticise Macclean: Dougan objected to Moody's refusal, but received no sympathy amongst the Colonial administration of the islands. This event provoked a spiteful feud between Dougan and Moody: Dougan complained about the 'state of Irritation and Disunion of the Commission'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan attempted to reconcile himself with Moody, but Moody refused to forgive him, and, as a consequence, Dougan was compelled to resign from the Commission,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; in June 1822, to return to England, and to submit his report to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in private.&lt;ref name="Kinsman" /&gt; In this report, dated 20 December 1823, Dougan contends that "free labour in the West Indies is preferable to compulsory labour".&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"/&gt; On his resignation, Dougan stated that '[the] repeated attacks, the State of Irritation of Major Moody's Mind, and all hopes of Conciliation [were] ended': however, their 'protracted and unpleasant dispute' continued even after the death of Dougan,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; in 1826, subsequent to which his efforts for reform were continued by his daughter, Mary,&lt;ref name="Kinsman"/&gt; between whom and Moody the feud continued.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

In 1824, Moody's friend [[Robert Wilmot-Horton|Sir Robert Wilmot Horton]], forwarded one of Moody's papers to [[George Canning]], then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Subsequently, in 1825, Moody returned to London and presented to the House of Commons an exposition of the reasons for his refusal to sign the report prepared by Dougan in Tortola, in addition to the official Commission report,&lt;ref name="Commission Report of Thomas Moody"/&gt; which he had completed on his own, without Dougan,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; and which he submitted without the consent of Dougan,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; that is dated 2 March 1825,&lt;ref name="Commission Report of Thomas Moody"/&gt; and consists of over 200 pages.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody's official Commission report contends that "without some species of coercion African labour would be worthless".&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commission Report of Thomas Moody"&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | title =Parliamentary Abstracts, Containing the Substance of all Important Papers laid before the two Houses of Parliament during the Session of 1825| page=239|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green, 1826|ISBN=0646417215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whig [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] described Moody's report as 'in substance, a defence of West Indian slavery', but Moody described his theories as a 'Philosophy of Labour',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Macaulay | first =Thomas Babington | title =Social and Industrial Capacities of the Negroes (Edinburgh Review, March 1827), collected in Critical, Historical and Miscellaneous Essays, Volume 6 (1860),| pages=361–404|publisher=New York, Sheldon and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; and himself as a 'practical philanthropist'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Lord Macaulay's description is inaccurate because, although Moody desired the employment of Africans, Moody did not desire their employment under conditions of enslavement:&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; indeed, Moody had supported the Barbados Slave Rebellions of September and October 1816, despite owning plantations in Barbados.&lt;ref name="Empowering Impulse"/&gt; 
Moody was influenced by the theory of the climatological determination of the human constitution that was advocated by [[Montesquieu]], and contended that it were a 'physical fact' that only blacks possessed the ability to perform agricultural labour in the 'torrid zone'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody was also extensively read in abolitionist literature.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

Moody's ultimate conclusion was that the indentured [[Africans]] in the West Indies should be taken back to West Africa.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Moody submitted a second report, also of over 200 pages, in 1826.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody's philosophy also analysed [[Netherlands|Dutch]] agricultural colonies, the [[Bengal]] peasantry, slavery in [[India]], prostitution in [[Sierra Leone]], slavery in the [[United States]], and the American Colonization Society for African-American settlement in West Africa.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

Moody's philosophy, which incorporated innumerable scholarly references,&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; won the advocacy of the director of the Commission, [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]], and of his Under-Secretary, [[Robert Wilmot-Horton|Sir Robert Wilmot Horton]],&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; with whom Moody had an extensive private correspondence;&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; of the [[Tories]]; and of the advocates of Britain's

in 1827.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody's contentions and his style of expression were condemned by Lord Macaulay,&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Babington Macaulay]], ''Social and Industrial Capacities of the Negroes'' ([[Edinburgh]] Review, March 1827), collected in ''Critical, Historical and Miscellaneous Essays, Volume 6'' (1860), pp.361–404.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a series of anonymous letters to the [[Morning Chronicle]] newspaper, all which provoked extensive defensive refutations from Moody.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Throughout the period in which London political society responded to his reports, Moody maintained a continuous dialogue with the Colonial Office, in which he vigorously refuted the criticisms of his reports, and repudiated the doctrines of his critics in private correspondences and in the newspapers.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody's friends Sir Robert Wilmot Horton and [[Thomas Hyde Villiers|Thomas Hyde Villiers MP]] also wrote articles - under the pseudonym 'Vindex', which Moody had also used - to the Star newspaper, in which they refuted the objections that others had made to Moody's philosophy and defended Moody.&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt; Moody proceeded to testify before the Privy Council, on the matter, in 1828.&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt; Moody's report influenced Lord Bathurst, [[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Sir Henry Taylor]], and [[James Stephen (civil servant)|James Stephen]].&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt;

Dougan was infuriated when he discovered that Moody had submitted the report without his consent, and began to compose a response, but he died, destitute,&lt;ref name="Kinsman"/&gt; in September 1826, before he had completed his response.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan's response was completed after his death by his daughter, Mary,&lt;ref name="Kinsman"/&gt; but it was intercepted by Moody, who annotated it extensively with refutations, before it reached Bathurst.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; A feud between Moody and Mary Dougan continued after the death of John Dougan.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

For their efforts, Dougan and Moody were each made a [[Justice of the Peace]].&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"/&gt;

When the British Government abandoned plans to implement the plans of [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Stirling]] to settle the [[Swan River Colony]], Stirling and Moody, in August 1828, offered form an association of private capitalists that would settle Australia, using their own capital, observing the 'principles' that had been observed by [[William Penn]] in the settlement of [[Pennsylvania]], but this proposal was rejected by the government.&lt;ref name="Wakefield"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Colonization of Australia (1829–42): The Wakefield Experiment in Empire Building| last = Mills | first = Richard Charles |chapter= III, p. 45 | publisher= Sidgwick and Jackson, 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Stirling letter"&gt;{{citation | chapter = Letter by Captain Stirling and Major Moody to Under Secretary Hay. 21st August, 1828, in Official Papers relating to the Settlement at Swan River, West Australia, December 1826 – January 1830 | title= [[Historical Records of Australia]] | series= Series III | volume= Volume VI |pages= 551–640}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Indian Service, 1828 -  1837===
Moody’s residential office at the Colonial Office was abolished in 1828.&lt;ref name="Pardue"/&gt; His departure from this office was a consequence of his 'unpopularity with the saints'.&lt;ref name="Pardue"/&gt; Moody returned to the West Indies in 1828, to perform special service in the Dutch Colonies for Sir Robert Wilmot Horton, which he completed in 1829.&lt;ref name="Lamont"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/30676/1/SP%20Lamont%20thesis%20-%20electronic%20version.pdf|title=Robert Wilmot Horton and Liberal Toryism|author=Lamont, Stephen Peter|publisher=University of Nottingham|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period in which he were in the West Indies, Moody rose from the rank of Major to that of [[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]] in the Royal Engineers.&lt;ref name="royalengineers.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20660|supp=y|page=3993|date=10 November 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5715 Richard Clement Moody]" in ''[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] Online''(2002)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Moody served as Commander of the Royal Engineers in the [[West Indies]] from 1829 to 1837:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nautical Magazine and Naval Chronicle: a Journal of Papers on Subjects Connected with Maritime Affairs|volume= 1844|page= 773 | publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was made a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1830&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; and had been promoted to Colonel by 1847.&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt;

==Later life (1837 - 1849)==
The British Government considered Moody to be a highly competent civil engineer and consulted him in regard of several important projects, such as the [[Caledonian Railway]], the West Cumberland Railway, and the  [[Furness Railway]], and the embankments at Morecambe Bay and at Duddon Sands. For his civil engineering, Moody received a DCL degree from the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Proceedings of the Caledonian, West Cumberland, and Furness Railway Meeting held at Whitehaven on 10 April 1838|publisher=J. Robinson, Lowthorpe Street, 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government appointed Moody as the director of two major government manufactories, [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|one making gunpowder]] and the other making small arms, at [[Waltham Abbey (town)|Waltham Abbey]].&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"/&gt;

Thomas was posted, by the Colonial Office, to [[Guernsey]] in 1846.&lt;ref name="DFB Richard Clement Moody"/&gt;

Thomas Moody's London residences were [[Bedford Square|7 Alfred Place, Bedford Square]], and [[Mayfair|23 Bolton Street, Mayfair]]. He died on 5 September 1849 at Berrywood House, near [[Southampton]].&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; In 1852, an advertisement appeared in [[The Times]] (02/06/1852 p.&amp;nbsp;1.) for unclaimed stock of the value of £120 that had been the property of 'Lieutenant-Colonel [sic] Thomas Moody, of Waltham Abbey', and the dividends of which had been unclaimed since 1839.&lt;ref name="Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL" /&gt;

===Reputation at Colonial Office===
It is likely that the illustrious reputation, at the Colonial Office, that Thomas had acquired, contributed to the Office's decision to appoint his son, [[Richard Clement Moody]], to the position of [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Lieutenant-Governor of the Falkland Islands]] when Richard Clement Moody was only the unprecedentedly young age of 28 years.&lt;ref name="DFB Richard Clement Moody"/&gt; Thomas's reputation may also have contributed to the appointment of Richard Clement Moody as the first [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia]], by [[Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5715|title= Entry for Richard Clement Moody in Dictionary of Canadian Biography|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
On 1 January 1809, Thomas married Martha Clement (1764–1868), who was the daughter of Richard Clement (1754–1829), a Dutch landowner of Barbados,&lt;ref name="DFB Richard Clement Moody"&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry for Moody, Richard Clement, in Dictionary of Falklands Biography|url=https://www.falklandsbiographies.org/biographies/moody_richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the niece of John Dougan (1765-1826).&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Thomas's father in law, Richard Clement, after whom Thomas named his son [[Richard Clement Moody]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legacies of British Slave Ownership: Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Moody: Imperial Legacy Details|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/imperial/view/1837776487}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the owner of the Black Bess (196 slaves) and Clement Castle (220 slaves) estates on St Peter's Island, which passed to Clement's sole remaining son, Hampden Clement, on his death.&lt;ref&gt;Will of Richard Clement of Barbados, PROB 11/1811/204, University College, London&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and Martha had 10 children, 8 of whom were living at the time of their father's death.&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/6650|title=The Will of Major Thomas Moody, PROB 11/2101, Codicil of 09/01/1843; The Carlisle Patriot 22/09/1849, accessed via Legacies of British Slave-Ownership: Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Moody: Profile and Legacies Summary|publisher=University College London|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:VitesseLogo.jpg|thumb|250px]]
'''Vitesse''' was started in 1982 as a Portuguese company making diecast cars mostly in 1:43 scale. It was founded in the city of Oporto and is a brand name of Cinerius, Ltd.

==The Fit of Vitesse==
Because of detail and realism of the models, Vitesse gained increasing popularity in the late 1980s and 1990s (Richardson 1999, p. 173). Models were often similar in concept to French [[Solido]], though less toy-like and more oriented to collectors. Conceptually, then, Vitesse falls somewhere between Solido and the Italian [[Brumm]] in presentation. Though diecast, and realistic, models were rather fragile. Pieces tended to fall off, bodies separated from chassis and paint sometimes peeled - but in good condition they were impressive.  

By about 1992, Vitesse had produced about 40 different models, often in top-up or top-down versions like Brumm or [[Rio Models]]. Offerings were made in plenty of liveries. For example, by 1990, the 1947 Chrysler Windsor model (a car also produced by Solido) had been produced in at least eight different versions: a plain sedan, New York City police, San Francisco Fire Brigade, Istanbul Taxi, official French government car, a French voisin 'pompiers', a Hot Springs National Park hotel taxi, and a clever Zippo lighters version with the middle of the car looking like two zippo lighters standing up together (Vitesse 1990).

It seems the company didn't take itself too seriously. Vitesse referred to its rather fragile offerings as 'toys' in a rather self-deprecating manner. The cover of the 1990 full-color catalog showed a 1957 Buick as a planter, Citroen 2 CVs with live rabbits, a VW bug cabriolet nearly being 'driven' by a golf club, and a 1953 Caddy between two buns - our next meal in miniature (Vitesse 1990).

==Portuguese Diecast==
In 1990, the oldest Vitesse model was a 1934 White truck and the newest was a contemporary Peugeot 205, but most models were from the 1950s. Of course, Portugal had no vehicles of its own to offer to stoke nationalism, so models were fairly evenly selected from Britain, Germany, France, Italy and the United States. Inside the front cover of one catalog, an introduction to Vitesse was given in nine different languages (Vitesse 1990). Like Solido in the 1980s and 1990s, several different American cars were reproduced, but like Brumm, European cars were often made in varying race decorations.  For example, the Lancia Delta HF Turbo Integrale was offered in at least 19 different racing  variations.

The 1982 company beginning doesn't appear to be chance. With Portugal joining the European Union in 1984, it seems natural that more diversity of investment would occur and that different niche companies of all types would start appearing there, shoring up Portugal's less developed economy. Vitesse seems to have been one of these companies that benefited. [[Quartzo]] was a racing car line owned by Vitesse. [[Onyx Models]] and [[Trofeu]] were two other independent Portuguese brands started at about the same time, also possibly as start-up companies with EU influenced funding. 

Other toy companies such as [[Metosul]] with recastings of Dinkys and smaller sized [[Novacars]] had come out of Portugal earlier, but no company with the collector flair, variety of liveries, and sophistication of detail like Vitesse had previously appeared there. For comparison, fewer such companies seem to have come out of Greece, a country similar in environment, economic status and which had joined the EU even earlier than Portugal.  Yet Greece's toy brands (like Polfi Toys) remained just that - toys more crudely cast and more for children.

Vitesse also produces models for other companies, but most are produced under the Vitesse name (Richardson 1999, p. 173).

==Variety and detail==

Despite the company's overt sense of humor, its products were ultra detailed and precise in proportion and presentation. Rixon reports on Vitesse's 1960 Aston Martin DB4 commenting on the model's "simulated wooden steering wheel", "banks of dashboard clocks", and "metal mesh radiator" and "astonishing photo etched wire spoke wheels" (2005, p. 62). Other European cars like the 1938 BMW 328 roadster were typical. The 2-tone Austin Healey 3000 was very well-designed...even if the paint peeled off of the sides. 

When the Sachsenring "Trabi" (Trabant) became the symbol of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Vitesse quickly jumped at the chance to produce it in miniature and sell it across a unified Germany and an emotional Europe. A unique American issue was the 'Carrera Panamericana' version of its 1953 Cadillac Type 62, whose two-tone color treatment included detailed race decals. With Vitesse there was rarely the feeling of 'just another Lamborghini Diablo', though it did offer its own Porsche 911 and Ferrari 308 GTB both of which have been offered by about every other diecast company on the planet (Vitesse 1993).

One rather fragile offering was the 1956 Ford Fairlane police car. The model came with two delicate spotlights, two roof lights (one blue, one red) a very long antenna, and a "speed kills" speedometer sign affixed to the roof. Only 5,000 of these cars were made, so chances of finding one with all lights and parts intact may be a challenge (Rixon 2005, p. 109).

==Promotions==
Vitesse also was quick to offer models in promotional guises, particularly related to racing sponsors. A specially packaged Coca-Cola Porsche 917, a Martini Lancia, special Peugeot promotional models and others made for Rothmans or Kenwood (Vitesse 1990).

One popular promotional model often seen in the U.S. was the 3.5 inch 1/64 scale UPS truck. Sometimes seen mounted on special bases, the truck is impressively detailed with official UPS brown colors and logo (Rixon 2005, p. 93).

==Vitesse today==
Eventually Vitesse was purchased by Sun Star Models of Macau, usually a maker of well-detailed 1:18 scale diecasts.  Three former Vitesse lines are now supported by Sun Star: Vitesse Models, Vitesse Rallye, and Quartzo which does race car replicas.

'''WGBN''' (AM 1360) is a [[gospel music|gospel]] [[radio station]] that serves the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] market. Owned by Pentecostal Temple Development Corporation, the station operates at 1360&amp;nbsp;[[Kilohertz|kHz]] with a power of 5,000 watts daytime, 1,000 watts nighttime, and is licensed to [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania]].

==History==

===As WMCK===
The station began broadcasting April 30, 1947, with the call letters WMCK, and under the ownership of the Mon-Yough Broadcasting Company.  George Raikes served as company president, and Jack Craddock as general manager.  Studios were located at 517 Market Street in McKeesport.  Its initial programming included Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WMCK on Air|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-05-12-BC.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=May 12, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these early years, the station broadcast at a full-time power of 1,000 watts, day and night, changing to a directional antenna pattern during the nighttime hours.

===As WIXZ===

It was a [[Top 40]] station with the [[call letters]] ''WIXZ'' ("Wick-zee 1360") beginning in 1969, following its acquisition by WWZ Corporation and the move of its studios and offices to the recently completed [[Monroeville Mall]]. Among its disc jockeys during the Top 40 era was Jeff Christie, better known today by his real name, [[Rush Limbaugh]].

On June 19, 1974, the station was sold to Renda Broadcasting Corporation.  Anthony F. Renda served as the company president and Melvin Abramovitz was appointed as station manager.  By the end of the decade, the station changed its format to country and the studios and offices were moved to 400 Lincoln Highway in East McKeesport.

On July 16, 1985, Renda Broadcasting Corporation sold WIXZ to Serena Communications, a company owned by Renda executive Alan C. Serena.  Renda had acquired Pittsburgh stations [[WJAS]] and [[WSHH]] the year before and was required to sell off WIXZ to comply with more stringent FCC ownership requirements at the time that limited owners to possess no more than one AM and one FM property in any given market.  Serena maintained the format until September 1997, when Renda Broadcasting bought back the station after FCC ownership rules were relaxed.

===As WPTT and WMNY===

Shortly after the re-acquisition, WIXZ switched to a [[Talk radio|talk]] format, then took the WPTT call letters (formerly on [[WPNT|channel 22]] in Pittsburgh).  On August 19, 2008, [[Renda Broadcasting]] announced that WPTT would be switching formats from talk to financial advice;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Roth, "[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08232/905263-42.stm Format change will take Cullen off WPTT]," ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (August 19, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; this was accompanied by a call change to WMNY.  In all of its incarnations since WMCK, the radio station has positioned itself as a Pittsburgh outlet, rather than directly addressing the suburb of McKeesport, despite a weak nighttime signal.

On September 19, 2011, Renda Broadcasting announced that WMNY would return to its "AM News Talk 1360" format.  This format contains numerous popular talk programs from the Talk Radio Network based radio network.

===As WGBN===

In July 2013, Renda Broadcasting announced that WMNY would be donated to Pentecostal Temple Development Corporation, licensee of [[WMNY|WGBN]] in New Kensington.  The transaction was completed on October 9, 2013. 1360 went off the air for about a month to allow engineering adjustments that would allow it to simulcast 1150's programming. The stations swapped call signs on March 1, 2014.
