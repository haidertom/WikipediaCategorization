Each summary should be a concise exposition of the source's central idea(s) and give the reader a general idea of the source's content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliographies|url=http://writing.ku.edu/bibliographies|website=KU Writing Center|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annbib3&gt;{{cite web |title=Annotated Bibliographies|author=Geoff Stacks, Erin Karper |year=2001 |publisher=Purdue University |url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/general/gl_annotatedbib.html |accessdate=2009-10-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907132223/http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/general/gl_annotatedbib.html| archivedate=September 7, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main Components of Annotated Bibliographies ==
The following are the main components of an annotated bibliography. It is important to note that not all fields shown below must be used at once in an annotated bibliography. The fields may vary depending on the type of annotated bibliography and special instructions from the instructor in case the bibliography is part of a school assignment.
* '''Full bibliographic citation :''' An annotated bibliography must contain the necessary and complete bibliographical information i.e. (author, title, publisher and date, etc),
* '''Author’s Background:''' You should provide the name, authority, experience, or qualifications of the author.
* '''Purpose of the work:''' You should provide the reasons why the author wrote the work
* '''Scope of the work:''' You should state the breadth or depth of coverage and topics or sub-topics covered.
* '''Main argument:''' State the main informative points of the paper
* '''Audience:''' For whom was it written (general public, subject specialists, student?
* '''Methodology:''' What methodology and research methods did the work employ? 
* '''Viewpoint:''' What is the author’s perspective or approach (school of thought, etc.)? Do you detect an unacknowledged bias, or find any undefended assumptions?
* '''Sources:''' Does the author cite other sources, and if so, what types? Is it based on the author’s own research? Is it personal opinion?
* '''Reliability of the source:''' How reliable is the work?  
* '''Conclusion:''' What does the author conclude about the work? Is the conclusion justified by the work?
* '''Features:''' Any significant extras, e.g. visual aids (charts, maps, etc.), reprints of source documents, an annotated bibliography?
* '''Strengths and Weaknesses:''' What are the strengths and weaknesses of the work?
* '''Comparison:''' How does the source relate to other works done by other writers on the topic: does it agree or disagree with another author or a particular school of thought; are there other works which would support or dispute it?
* '''Your Voice / Personal Conclusion:''' Provide your point of view of the work or your reaction to the source based on other available works, prior knowledge of the subject matter or knowledge pools done by other researchers.

==Types of annotations==
Annotations may be written with different goals in mind. There are three types of annotations, depending on what might be most important for your reader or according to your professor’s instructions.It is impossible to describe a standard procedure for all types of annotations because one annotation does not fit all purposes. In order to know the best type of annotation, it is prudent to consult your instructor or follow the instructions. For example, if the assignment states that your annotative bibliography should give evidence proving an analytical understanding of the sources you have used, then you are supposed to write an analytical annotated bibliography which includes evaluation of the sources you are using. The three types of annotated bibliographies are; summary annotations, critical annotations and a combination of the former two.

'''Summary annotations'''

Summary annotations are further classified into informative and indicative annotations.

The following are the main features of summary annotations:
* They show a summary of the source content
* They highlight the arguments and proofs/evidence mentioned in the work
* They sometimes describe the author’s methodology and any theories used
* They offer the conclusion of the source 
* They do not evaluate the work they are discussing
'''Informative Annotations'''

This type of annotation is a summary of the source. An informative annotation should include the thesis of the work, arguments or hypothesis, proofs and a conclusion.&lt;ref name=annbib&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/AnnBib_content.html |title=Annotated Bibliographies: Content |location=Madison |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison: The Writing Center |work=Writer's Handbook |accessdate=2008-03-02 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080304040827/http://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/AnnBib_content.html| archivedate= 4 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Informative annotations provide a straight summary of the source material.

They summarise all relevant information about the author and the main points of the work.

To write an informative annotation, begin by writing the thesis; then develop it with the argument or hypothesis, list the proofs, and state the conclusion

'''Indicative annotated bibliographies'''

Indicative annotations do not provide actual information from the source.

They provide overall information about what kinds of questions or issues are addressed by the work, for example, through chapter titles.

In the indicative entry, there is no attempt to give actual data such as hypotheses, proofs, etc.

===Evaluative annotations===
This type of annotation assesses the source's strengths and weaknesses, in terms of usefulness and quality.&lt;ref name=annbib /&gt;

Evaluative annotated bibliographies do more than just summarising, they provide critical appraisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://help.library.ubc.ca/planning-your-research/how-to-write-an-annotated-bibliography/|title=How to Write an Annotated Bibliography|last=The University of British Columbia|first=|date=August 10, 2016|website=Planning Your Research|publisher=The University of British Columbia|access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They evaluate the source or author critically to find any biases, lack of evidence, objectives, etc.

They show how the work may or may not be useful for a particular field of study or audience.

They explain how researching this material assisted your own project.

===Combination annotations===
Most annotated bibliographies contain combination annotations. This type of annotation will summarize or describe the topic, and then evaluate the source's usefulness and a summary. Usually also includes a detailed analysis on the reason the article was written.&lt;ref name=annbib /&gt;

== Formats of writing annotated bibliographies ==
Annotated bibliographies contain two main sections; the bibliographic information section and the annotations section.

Since the formats may slightly vary from one institution to another and amongst scholars and researchers depending on the regulations, courses and materials being annotated, it is imperative to ask for specific guidelines.

'''The bibliographic information'''

There are also bibliography annotations that combine all three types (MLA, APA and Chicago style). When deciding on the style for your annotated bibliography, consider its purpose and the instructions given to you by your supervisor. Regardless of the formatting style required at your institution, all annotated bibliography pieces need to follow the same rule: the author’s last name should be the only part that is flush left, while the rest of the text requires to be indented.&lt;ref&gt;[https://domywriting.com/blog/annotated-bibliography-example/ ''Annotated Bibliography Example''] from the DoMyWriting's blog 2018. Retrieved August 07, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The bibliographic information is written before the annotation using the suitable referencing style. The information is normally identified using a hanging indent.

Generally, though, the bibliographic information of the source (the title, author, publisher, date, etc.) is written in either MLA or APA format.

'''The annotations'''

The annotations for each source are written in paragraph form.

The lengths of the annotations can vary significantly from a couple of sentences to a couple of pages.

The length of the annotation should be between 100 to 200 words.

When writing summaries of sources, the annotations may not be very long.

However, when writing an extensive analysis of each source, more space may be needed.

A few sentences of general summary followed by several sentences of how you can fit the work into your larger paper or project can serve you well when you go to draft.

==Writing==
Sample entry of an [[APA style]] annotated bibliography:
{{quote box
| border = 2px

Murray's book offers an in-depth look at the history of libraries since ancient times. He
incorporates beautiful illustrations, quotations, and descriptions of numerous libraries
worldwide. This book states the history of the evolution of the book from era to era.
It also serves as a primary source of information for research in library history. This
is a good book that should be of interest to book lovers and librarians.
&lt;/poem&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7418">'''Anxiety of Influence''' is a type of [[literary criticism]] established by [[Harold Bloom]] in 1973, in his book, ''[[The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry]]''. It refers to the psychological struggle of aspiring authors to overcome the anxiety posed by the influence of their literary antecedents.

== Theory ==

The theory of anxiety of influence is a theory applied principally to early nineteenth century romantic poetry. Its author, Harold Bloom, maintains that the theory has general applicability to the study of literary tradition, ranging from Homer and the Bible to [[Thomas Pynchon]] and [[Anne Carson]] in the 20th and 21st century. It is based primarily on Bloom's belief that there is no such thing as an original poem, that every new composition is simply a misreading or misinterpretation of an earlier poem and that influence is unavoidable and inescapable; all writers inevitably, to some degree, adopt, manipulate or alter and assimilate certain aspects of the content or subject matter, literary style or form from their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrams &amp; Harpham|2009|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate his point, Bloom quotes Oscar Wilde, noting that:

"Influence is simply transference of personality, a mode of giving away what is most precious to one's self, and its exercise produces a sense, and, it may be, a reality of loss. Every disciple takes away something from his master."&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to universally-held beliefs that the literary influence of precursors can provide a purely benevolent, inspirational platform for young, aspiring writers; Bloom deems that this influence provides entirely the opposite effect.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom}}{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that it proves detrimental; that this influence instills in young writers a type of unease, apprehension or anxiety as they psychologically struggle against past literary forebears to create something definitive and original and achieve literary recognition and success. Bloom equates this struggle to the Freudian family drama; particularly to the Oedipal complex and relationship of son to father, where the emerging writer is cast as the 'son' in a battle against the 'father'; a literary precursor.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; Bloom claims that this forces poets or authors into a type of 'creative misprision'; where they must distort the works of their literary masters in an attempt to create something revolutionary and innovative.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; The authors who triumph over this struggle are deemed 'strong', with some even receiving acclaim to the extent where the contemporary has the potential to transcend time, with some literary predecessors being read in terms of their contemporary successor. In contrast, writers who cannot prevail over this anxiety of influence are deemed 'weak', with their works regarded as markedly derivative and reminiscent of the works of earlier literary masters. Some great poets in which Bloom draws upon, who have overcome this anxiety of influence include Wordsworth, Shelley and Wallace Stevens.

== Effects on literature ==
In order to determine the effects of this theory on literature, Bloom has established the six "revisionary ratios", which are occasionally based on the model of Freud's defense mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-8"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ratios show the developmental stages of anxiety of influence in relation to the ways a poet or author misreads and deforms the work of a literary precursor in the composition of a literary text.&lt;ref name="Geddes"&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Clinamen'' – Bloom defines this as "poetic misreading or misprision proper".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author makes a swerve away from a precursor, alluding to the proposition that the original work was only precise and accurate up until a particular end; at which point, the successive author makes the corrective motion.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;  
* ''Tessera'' – Bloom defines this as "completion and antithesis".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author elaborates upon a precursor's work, maintaining the precursor's terms and ideas but constituting them in another sense, with the implication that the predecessor failed to take the argument far enough in the first instance&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Kenosis'' – Bloom defines this as a "breaking device similar to the defence mechanisms our psyches employ against repetition compulsions".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author seeks a state of discontinuity, in the act of isolating themself from the influence of the precursor&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Daemonization'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement towards a personalised Counter-Sublime, in reaction to the precursor's Sublime".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author manipulates an apparent power of a precursor that they believe is superior to the precursor in an effort to dismiss the originality of the predecessor's work and perpetuate the greatness of their own.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Askesis'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement of self-purgation which intends the attainment of a state of solitude".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; In this process, the author diminishes both his own and his precursor's achievements, purging themself of all remnants of influence, with a rationale for independent, individual success and achievement.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Apophrades'' – Bloom defines this as the "return of the dead".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; The author is encumbered by his previous state of solitude and holds his work open for inspection with that of his predecessors&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; Geddes 1999). Instead of proving detrimental to the author, this instead has the effect of the successor overpowering the predecessor, with the predecessor's work being read in terms of the successor's work.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;

The '''bookwriter''' is the member of a [[Musical theatre|musical]]'s writing team who creates the book—the musical's plot, character development, and dramatic structure.  Essentially, the bookwriter is the playwright of the musical.  He or she works very closely in collaboration with the [[lyricist]] and [[composer]] to create an integrated piece of drama.

There is a common misconception that the bookwriter merely writes the dialogue; though the book does include the musical's spoken text, it is much more than that, defining and organizing the dramatic action of the entire piece, including action that is musicalized by the songwriter(s).  Even "sung-through," "operatic," or "through-composed" musicals, where there is little, if any, spoken text, require as much contribution from a bookwriter as do musicals with extensive dialogue scenes.

The bookwriter is often also the musical's lyricist, composer, or director.

'''Broadminded''' was a daily talk and entertainment show on [[SIRIUS XM Satelliete Radio]] Channel 107 – [[Sirius XM Stars]].

It was hosted by real-life friends, [[Christine Eads]] and [[Molly Dedham]]. The hosts refer to themselves as "''Broads''".  They discussed a wide range of topics from sex, men, entertainment, and life in general.  Christine and Molly met at George Mason University in the early 90's and have been best friends ever since.  They often refer to living together in LA, doing random jobs together and even dating the same guy.

The show debuted on &lt;ref&gt;XM Radio&lt;/ref&gt; XM Radio channel 105 &lt;ref&gt;Take 5&lt;/ref&gt; TAKE 5 in October 2005.  The show was originally heard from 8:00 – 10:00 PM evenings eastern time, but was quickly moved to the evening drive time slot, from 5:00 – 8:00 PM Eastern time, due to its popularity with listeners. In September 2007, their timeslot was again moved – this time to the 12:00 – 3:00 PM (EST) slot with encore re-broadcasts at 9:00 PM (EST).

The original Broadminded show consisted of three '''"Broads",''' which included '''Molly, Christine''' and '''[[Shari Elliker]]. Shari's''' last show was on December 21, 2007. '''Jason Moore''', of [[Panacea (group)]] fame, was the well-liked Board Operator (Board Op. for short) for the show and could be heard "chiming in" on the girls' rants from time to time.

After the merger between '''Sirius and XM satetellite radio companies''', '''Broadminded''' went on a hiatus for six weeks in the beginning of 2009, and when they returned on March 17, 2009, to '''Sirius 102 and XM 155 The Stars Channels''' their time was changed to 12:00 – 2:00 PM (EST), with replays 8:00 – 10:00 PM (EST) Monday – Friday.

On November 3, 2009, '''Broadminded''' aired live from 2:00 – 4:00 PM (EST), with replays 10:00 PM – 12:00 AM (EST) Monday – Friday.

As of January 3, 2011, '''Broadminded''' is now live on the morning drive time slot, 8:00 – 10:00 AM (EST).

As of March 2013, the show was cancelled.

== Specialities ==

'''Christine''' is a fan of entertainment and gossip and leads the other broads daily during Broadbuzz. Christine also seems to be the driving force during Ask The Broads/As Tried on Broadminded and The Unbelivable Broads.  Her passion for her charity The Duffy House is now a part of a monthly segment Christine does the second Tuesday of each month to raise awareness about Domestic and Sexual abuse and  Violence.

'''Molly''' is a fan of music and movies, and you will hear a Molly's Music segment every Thursday ranging from singing to the songs of the 80s onto a Tribute to Marvin Gaye. Molly also will give you all the scoop on movies before they hit the theaters and tell you what is worth watching and what to skip at the theaters.

'''Bruno Zevi''' (22 January 1918 – 9 January 2000) was an Italian architect, historian, professor, curator, author, and editor. Zevi was a vocal critic of "classicizing" modern architecture and [[postmodernism]].

==Early life==
Zevi was born and died in Rome. His family was [[Italian Jew]]ish.&lt;ref&gt;His kin never kept him from openly expressing his own ideas: Art Kutcher (''Politics could do more harm than the planners in Jerusalem'', [[The Times]] , Monday, Aug 25, 1975; pg. 6; Issue 59483) remembers a protest in 1970 against [[Teddy Kollek]], opposing the project of building an underground parking near the [[Jaffa Gate]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On finishing school in 1933, he enrolled at the Faculty of Architecture at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]]. Due to the [[anti-Semitic]] laws, Zevi was forced in 1938 to abandon his studies, and so left for London, UK, before moving to the United States. Zevi graduated from the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], then under the directorship of [[Walter Gropius]].

In 1940 he married Italian journalist and writer [[Tullia Zevi|Tullia Calabi]].&lt;ref name="NY Times - 27Jan2011 - obits - Tullia Zevi"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/world/europe/27zevi.html|title=Tullia Zevi, 91; Led Italian Jewish Community|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=27 January 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=23|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While in the US he discovered the work of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], which became one of the bases for his championing of [[organic architecture]].&lt;ref name="Zeier, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilat|first1=Stephanie Zeier|title=Reconstructing Italy: The Ina-Casa Neighborhoods of the Postwar Era|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781409465805|page=63|edition=US|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPzsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=Association+for+Organic+Architecture+(APAO)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LhYxDzni2S&amp;sig=R1U7zR0ywjU3uX4_14SO3yof-XY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ6KyNuYvUAhUD7iYKHd_bBQsQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Association%20for%20Organic%20Architecture%20(APAO)&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zevi returned to London in 1943, working as a translator in the war effort.

==Association for Organic Architecture==
In 1944, he founded the influential Association for Organic Architecture (APAO).&lt;ref name="Zeier, 2014" /&gt; The following year the magazine ''Metron-architecture'' reviewed his book [https://www.amazon.com/Towards-Organic-Architecture-Bruno-Zevi/dp/B000WEKQ3A Towards an Organic Architecture]  (published in English by [[Faber and Faber|Faber]] in 1950), which brought him international acclaim.

[[Image:IMG 0387 - scalea Bruno Zevi.jpg|thumb|300px|A stairway in Rome named in his honor]]

==University professor==
In 1945, Zevi became Professor of Architectural History at the [[University of Venice]]. Later, he was a Professor at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], and a member of the [[International Academy of Architecture]] (IAA) in Sofia, Bulgaria.

==Editor, writer and politician==
From 1955 onwards, he wrote a column for the weekly ''[[L'Espresso]]'' magazine. He was an active member of the Italian Jewish community, and took part in anti-fascist activities within the [[Giustizia e Libertà]] movement. He was active in the [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] and later in [[Popular Unity (Italy)|Popular Unity]] and in the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]], which he represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] from 1987 to 1992. From 1954 until his death in 2000 he was editor of his own magazine ''[[L'architettura. Cronache e storia]]''.

''The Modern Language of Architecture'' is one of Zevi’s most significant publications. In this book Zevi sets forth seven principles or “antirules” to codify the language of architecture created by [[Le Corbusier]], [[Walter Gropius|Gropius]], [[Mies van der Rohe]], and [[Frank Lloyd Wright|Wright]]. In place of the classical language of the Beaux Art school, with its focus on abstract principles of order, proportion, and symmetry, he presents an alternative system of communication characterized by a free interpretation of contents and function, an emphasis on difference and dissonance, a dynamic of multidimensional vision, and independent interplay of elements, an organic marriage of engineering and design, a concept of living spaces that are designed for use, and an integration of buildings into their surroundings. Anticipating the innovations of postmodern architecture, Zevi argues forcefully for complexity and against unity, for decomposition dialogue between architecture and historiography, finding elements of the modern language of architecture throughout history, and discussing the process of architectural innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zevi|first1=Bruno|title=The modern language of architecture|date=1978|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=9780295955681|url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=13470360009&amp;searchurl=isbn%3D9780295955681%26sortby%3D17|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture as space==
Zevi argued in ''Saper Vedere L'Architettura'' (1948, translated as ''Architecture as Space. How to Look at Architecture'') that space is essential for both the definition and appreciation of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Sauchelli, [http://philpapers.org/rec/SAUOAA 'On Architecture as a Spatial Art'], ''[http://nsae.au.dk/the-journal Nordic Journal of Aesthetics]'', 43 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern architecture movement==
Zevi participated in the influential International Architecture Symposium "Mensch und Raum" (Man and Space) at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] (Technische Universität Wien) in 1984, also attended by [[Justus Dahinden]], Ernst Gisel, [[Jorge Glusberg]], Otto Kapfinger, [[Frei Otto]], [[Ionel Schein]], [[Dennis Sharp]], [[Paolo Soleri]], and [[Pierre Vago]].

Such was Zevi's uncompromising critique of any tendency in modern architecture towards classicism that he even would criticize those architects he otherwise admired: "When [[Walter Gropius|Gropius]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies]]  and [[Alvar Aalto|Aalto]] produced [symmetrical buildings] it was an act of surrender. Lacking a modern code, they weakened and regressed to the familiar womb of classicism." (Zevi, ''The Modern Language of Architecture'').

== Quotes ==
"In 1973, Zevi set out (his) ideas as a set of invariants - a sort of anti-classical codebook that attempted to define modernity as a language of asymmetry and dissonance, which he propagated via his magazine L'architettura, cronache e storia. This exciting theory of architecture as rupture and fragmentation marks him out as the seminal theoretician for all currents of modernism interested in iconoclasm and deconstruction, from [[Alvar Aalto]] in the 1930s to [[Daniel Libeskind]] in the 1990s." (Thomas Muirhead, March 1, 2000; ''The Guardian'', Obituary, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Muirhead, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/01/guardianobituaries1 'Bruno Zevi, Architectural philosopher who railed against the evils of classicism'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Wednesday 1 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Burghley Nef''' is a [[silver-gilt]] [[salt cellar]] made in Paris in 1527–28 (or possibly earlier). In medieval France the word [[Nef (metalwork)|nef]] was applied to various types of boat-shaped containers, including the most magnificent objects intended for the dining tables and buffets of the rich. Apart from having an obvious ornamental quality, their function was to hold personal pieces of cutlery or, as in this case, [[salt]] or [[spice]]s—there is a detachable compartment on the rear deck, which was presumably passed around the table.  This [[nautilus shell]], mounted in silver, was a rare natural curiosity. 

The Burghley Nef would have been placed in front of the most important person at table as a mark of their status. At the foot of the mast, engaged in a game of chess, are the tiny figures of the lovers [[Tristan and Iseult]] who, according to the legend, mistakenly drank a love potion and suffered tragic consequences.  The Burghley Nef is currently in the collection of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]]. It was discovered at [[Burghley House]] in 1956 and sold on 17 July 1959 when the [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|6th Marquess of Exeter]] auctioned part of his silver collection.

'''Byron Bay''' is a beachside town located in the [[Northern Rivers|far-northeastern corner]] of the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is located {{convert|772|km|mi|0}} north of [[Sydney]] and {{convert|165|km|mi|0}} south of [[Brisbane]]. [[Cape Byron]], a headland adjacent to the town, is the easternmost point of mainland Australia. At the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]], the town had a permanent population of 9,246.&lt;ref name="abs"/&gt; The town is in turn the nucleus of [[Byron Shire]], which had 31,556 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Census 2016 AUS|id=LGA11350|name=Byron Shire |accessdate=1 October 2018|quick=on}}[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/# |date=16 October 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The local [[Bundjalung people|Arakwal]] Aboriginal people's name for the area is ''Cavvanbah'', meaning "meeting place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1503982/buck-passing-threatens-aboriginal-lifeline/|title=Aboriginal elders gather at historic meeting place|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|accessdate=16 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324075539/http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1503982/buck-passing-threatens-aboriginal-lifeline/#|archive-date=24 March 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant [[James Cook]] named Cape Byron after Naval officer [[John Byron]], circumnavigator of the world and grandfather of the poet [[Lord Byron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NSW GNR|id=KWjLjzUlJP|title=Byron Bay|accessdate=28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of Europeans in Byron Bay began in 1770, when Lieutenant [[James Cook]] found a safe anchorage and named [[Cape Byron]] after a fellow sailor [[John Byron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Penny |editor1-first=Justine |editor1-last=Vaisutis |title=Lonely Planet: Australia |edition= 15|date=November 2009 |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |isbn= |page= 195 |chapter= New South Wales |quote= The Grandfather of the [...] poet Lord Byron was a renowned navigator in the 1760s, and Captain Cook named this spot after [...] him. (In the 1880s, when Europeans settled more permanently, streets were named for other English writers and philosophers. A star-struck clerk in Sydney thought the grandson was the one being honoured, and named the streets – and the town – after poets: [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first industry in Byron was cedar logging from the Australian red cedar (''[[Toona ciliata]]''). The timber industry is the origin of the word "shoot" in many local names – Possum Shoot, Coopers Shoot and Skinners Shoot – where the timber-cutters would "shoot" the logs down the hills to be dragged to waiting ships.&lt;ref name="early_settlement"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://byronbayhistoricalsociety.org.au/development-of-byron-bay/early-settlement/# |title=Byron Bay Historical Society: Early Settlement |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815012228/http://byronbayhistoricalsociety.org.au/development-of-byron-bay/early-settlement/# |archive-date=15 August 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Timber getting became insignificant after [[World War I]] and many former timber workers became farmers.

Gold mining of the beaches was the next industry to occur. Up to 20 mining leases set up on Tallow Beach to extract gold from the black sands around the 1870s.

Byron Bay has a history of primary industrial production ([[dairy]] factory,&lt;ref&gt;''Creamery Tramway at Byron Bay'' Longworth, Jim [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], October 1996, pp. 295–298.&lt;/ref&gt; [[abattoirs]], fishing, and [[whaling]] until 1963) and was a significant, but hazardous, sea port. The poet Brunton Stephens spoke of cattle grazing on the "mossy plains" of Cape Byron in a poem he penned in 1876.

The first [[jetty]] was built in 1886, and the railway was connected in 1894, and Cavvanbah became Byron Bay in 1894.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; Dairy farmers cleared more land and settled the area.

The town has several beaches which are popular for [[surfing]]. It is a resort popular with both domestic and international tourists, including [[backpacking (urban)|backpackers]], who travel along the Australian coast; the scenery also attracts skydivers. The area is also noted for its wildlife, with the [[whale watching]] industry a significant contributor to the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/byron-bay-area/byron-bay|title=Byron Bay|publisher=Visit NSW|accessdate=19 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208035053/http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/byron-bay-area/byron-bay#|archive-date=8 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[oceanway]] runs from the centre of town to the Cape Byron lighthouse. This allows visitors to walk and cycle to the lighthouse.

Temperate and tropical waters merge at Byron Bay, making it a popular area for [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkelling]]. Most diving is done at [[Julian Rocks]] which is part of the recently established [[Cape Byron Marine Park]] and only a few minutes boat ride from Main Beach.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Byron Bay also lies close to subtropical rainforests, and areas such as the [[Nightcap National Park]] with the [[Minyon Falls]] are all within easy reach of the town.

Byron Bay is now also a popular destination for [[Schoolies week]] during late November and early December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/byron-bay-schoolies-put-gold-coast-to-shame-20091130-jzb8.html|title=Byron Bay Schoolies 'put Gold Coast to shame'|date=30 November 2009|publisher=[[Brisbane Times]]|access-date=29 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203103359/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/byron-bay-schoolies-put-gold-coast-to-shame-20091130-jzb8.html#|archive-date=3 December 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Byron Bay Railroad Company|Byron Bay Train]] service will operate as a shuttle between Byron Bay station in the Byron township and North Beach station. The privately run service operates on a 3 km section of the disused [[Murwillumbah railway line|Murwillimbah line]]. It is expected to open by Christmas 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/city-file/article/worlds-first-solar-powered-train-heads-byron-bay|title=The World’s First Solar-Powered Train Heads to Byron Bay|work=Broadsheet|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029121255/https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/city-file/article/worlds-first-solar-powered-train-heads-byron-bay#|archive-date=29 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byron Bay railway station]] was a stop on the [[Murwillumbah railway line|Casino to Murwillumbah railway line]] until 2004. It was served by trains from Sydney and for various periods also by services originating at Casino that connected with expresses running between Sydney and South Brisbane. A 3.4&amp;nbsp;km section of the Murwillumbah railway line is to be rehabilitated in 2016 for a two car self-propelled diesel train planned to run from the town centre to the Elements of Byron resort and nearby attractions.

An earlier local train service, known as the Byron Bay Tram conveyed passengers from about 1928 until about 1954 between the railway station and the "new jetty" where connections were made with passenger carrying ships of the North Coast Steam Navigation Company. Motive power was a Simplex petrol locomotive, locally known as the "Green Frog", and the passenger vehicles comprised former Newcastle B2 class steam tram trailer 74B and former Sydney C class electric tram C37. After the trams stopped running both the cars went to a heritage tramway in Parramatta Park where 74B was destroyed by fire. The Simplex was built in Bedford England and went into service in 1923 shunting freight to and from the "old" jetty adjacent to the township and then to "new" jetty to the north when it was completed in 1928. Later it hauled whales from the jetty to the rendering down works, livestock to the meat works, mineral sands and meat wagons to the station for onward movement and regularly shunted Norco and other railway sidings and between these duties ran the passenger tramway until the coastal passenger shipping service stopped. The Simplex locomotive was retired in 1984 when the meat works closed and is now stored in a shed near the Kendall Street level crossing under the care of volunteers and the Byron Bay Council.

== Education ==
Byron Bay schools include Byron Bay Public School, [[Byron Bay High School]], St Finbarr's Primary School, Byron Bay Community School, and [[Cape Byron Rudolf Steiner School]].

== Sport and recreation ==
The Byron Bay Surf Club is the longest-standing current sports club; it has been one of Australia's leading surf clubs and has been in continuous operation for more than 105 years. The [[rugby league]] club the [[Byron Bay Red Devils]] and the [[Australian rules football]] team [[Byron Football Club|Byron Magpies]] are well known.

== In fiction ==

John Macgregor's 1986 novel ''[[Propinquity (novel)|Propinquity]]'' is partly set in Byron Bay and nearby [[Mullumbimby]]. The 2008/2009 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] drama series ''[[East of Everything]]'', written by [[Deb Cox]] and Roger Monk, is set in the fictional town of Broken Bay which is based on a somewhat more run-down version of Byron Bay and its surrounds, with much of the filming taking place in and around Byron Bay including obviously recognisable landmarks such as the lighthouse and local beaches. The town also features in the 2016 [[open world]] racing video game, ''[[Forza Horizon 3]]''.

[[File:Ardabil Carpet.jpg|thumb|right|170px| One of the [[Ardabil Carpet]]s]]
[[File:Wollteppich_1.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A small rug]]
A '''carpet''' is a [[textile]] [[floor covering]] typically consisting of an upper layer of [[Pile (textile)|pile]] attached to a backing. The pile was traditionally made from wool, but, since the 20th century, synthetic fibers such as [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]] or [[polyester]] are often used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool. The pile usually consists of twisted tufts which are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term "carpet" is often used interchangeably with the term "rug", although the term "carpet" can be applied to a floor covering that covers an entire house, whereas a "rug" is generally no bigger than a single room, and traditionally does not even span from one wall to another, and is typically not even attached as part of the floor.

Carpets are used for a variety of purposes, including insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a [[prayer rug]]), reducing sound from walking (particularly in [[apartment buildings]]) and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. In the 2000s, carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and [[hotel]]s and in private homes. In the 2010s, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are [[mass production|mass-produced]] in [[factory|factories]] and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs which are used in private homes of wealthy families.

Carpets can be produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]], made using needle [[felt]]s, knotted by hand (in [[oriental rug]]s), made with their pile injected into a backing material (called tufting), flatwoven, made by hooking wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric or [[embroidery|embroidered]]. Carpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the USA, 4&amp;nbsp;m and 5&amp;nbsp;m in Europe. Since the 20th century, where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet, different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s. Wall-to-wall carpet is distinguished from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings, as wall-to-wall carpet is fixed to the floor and covers a much larger area.

The [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodWeave.org/index.php?cid=13 |title=About the GoodWeave label |publisher=Goodweave.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:A carpet seller in Jaipur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A carpet seller in [[Jaipur]], India]]
It is assumed that the word "carpet" entered into English (English: carpet) in the 13th century (through Medieval Latin carpita, meaning "thick woolen cloth") [11] as a consequence of the trade in rugs through the port cities of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia. The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the term "carpet" was first used in English in the late 13th century, with the meaning "coarse cloth", and by the mid-14th century, "tablecloth, [or] bedspread".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=carpet Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The meaning of the term "carpet" shifted in the 15th century to refer to floor coverings.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The term ''[[wikt:carpet|carpet]]'' comes from [[Old French]] ''carpite''. It is assumed that the word "carpet" entered into French (French: carpette) in the 13th century (through Medieval Latin carpita, meaning "thick woolen cloth") [11] as a consequence of the trade in rugs through the port cities of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia. One derivation of the term states that the French term came from the [[Old Italian]] ''carpita'', from the verb "carpire" meaning ''to pluck''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/carpet |title=Definition of carpet|publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carpet |title=Carpet - Definition |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the term comes "...from Old French carpite "heavy decorated cloth, carpet," from Medieval Latin or Old Italian carpita "thick woolen cloth," probably from Latin carpere "to card, pluck," probably so called because it was made from unraveled, shred[d]ed, "plucked" fabric".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; 

The term "carpet" is often used interchangeably with the term "rug". Some sources define a carpet as stretching from wall to wall.&lt;ref&gt;How It's Made, Season 2, Episode 7&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition treats rugs as of lower quality or of smaller size, with carpets quite often having finished ends. A third common definition is that a carpet is permanently fixed in place while a rug is simply laid out on the floor. Historically, the term "carpet" was also applied to table and wall coverings, as carpets were not commonly used on the floor in European interiors until the 15th century.

The term "rug" was first used in English in the 1550s, with the meaning "coarse fabric". The term is of "...Scandinavian origin; compare Norwegian dialectal rugga "coarse coverlet," from [[Old Norse]] rogg "shaggy tuft," from Proto-Germanic *rawwa-, perhaps related to rag (n.) and rough (adj.)."&lt;ref name="etymonline2"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=rug Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of "rug" "...evolved to "coverlet, wrap" (1590s), then "mat for the floor" (1808)".&lt;ref name="etymonline2"/&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Moden carpet illustrating camel caravan on Silk Road. Kashgar.jpg|thumb|left|Modern carpet illustrating a camel caravan on the [[Silk Road]]]]

===Woven===
The carpet is produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]]. The pile can be [[plush]] or [[Berber carpet|Berber]]. Plush carpet is a cut [[Pile (textile)|pile]] and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan, and Arabia.

===Needle felt===
[[File:Toranj - special circular design of Iranian carpets.JPG|thumbnail|A [[Persian carpet#Field design - medallions and borders|''toranj'' medallion]], a common design in [[Persian carpets]]]]
These carpets are more technologically advanced. Needle [[felt]]s are produced by intermingling and felting individual [[synthetic fiber]]s using barbed and forked needles forming an extremely durable carpet. These carpets are normally found in commercial settings such as hotels and restaurants where there is frequent traffic.

===Knotted===
{{main|Knotted-pile carpet}}
[[File:Carpet in Preparation on a Carpet Loom.jpg|thumb|A traditional rug being woven on a carpet [[loom]]]]
On a '''knotted pile''' carpet (formally, a "supplementary weft cut-loop pile" carpet), the structural [[weft]] threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises at right angles to the surface of the weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] by one of three knot types (see below), such as [[shag carpet]] which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or [[nap (textile)|nap]] of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in [[oriental rug]]s and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

There are several styles of knotting, but the two main types of knot are the '''symmetrical''' (also called Turkish or [[Ghiordes knot|Ghiordes]]) and '''asymmetrical''' (also called Persian or [[Senna knot|Senna]]). Contemporary centres of knotted carpet production are: [[Lahore]] and [[Peshawar]] ([[Pakistan]]), [[Kashmir]] ([[India]]), [[Mirzapur]], [[Bhadohi]],&lt;ref name="to"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-09/varanasi/28226568_1_bhadohi-mirzapur-bhadohi-carpet-carpet-manufacturers-association|title=Famed Bhadohi carpet gets GI tag|date=September 9, 2010|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tabriz]] ([[Iran]]), [[Afghanistan]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]], [[Northern Africa]], [[Nepal]], [[Spain]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tibetan rugs|Tibet]]. The importance of carpets in the culture of Turkmenistan is such that [[Flag of Turkmenistan|the national flag]] features a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing rugs). Kashmir is known for handknotted carpets of silk or wool. The [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Tufted===
[[File:Swatches of carpet 1.jpg|thumb|[[Textile sample|Swatches]] of [[Tufting|tufted]] carpet]]
[[Image:OurikaValleyCarpets.jpg|thumb|Drying carpets in a village workshop at the [[Ourika Valley|Ourika Valley, Morocco]]]]
These are carpets that have their pile injected into a backing material, which is itself then bonded to a secondary backing made of a woven [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]] weave or a man made alternative to provide stability. The pile is often sheared in order to achieve different textures. This is the most common method of manufacturing of domestic carpets for floor covering purposes in the world.

===Others===
A '''flatweave''' carpet is created by interlocking warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads. Types of oriental flatwoven carpet include [[kilim]], [[soumak]], [[plain weave]], and [[tapestry weave]]. Types of European flatwoven carpets include Venetian, Dutch, [[damask]], list, [[haircloth]], and ingrain (aka double cloth, two-ply, triple cloth, or three-ply).

A '''hooked rug''' is a simple type of rug handmade by pulling strips of cloth such as wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric such as burlap. This type of rug is now generally made as a [[handicraft]]. The process of creating a hooked rug is called [[Rug hooking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science Of Color Enhances Carpet Style|url=http://www.carpet-rug.org/Carpet-for-Business/Specifying-the-Right-Carpet/Dyeing-and-Color-Selection.aspx|website=carpet-rug.org|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike woven carpets, '''[[embroidery]] carpets'''' are not formed on a loom. Their pattern is established by the application of [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] to a [[cloth]] (often [[linen]]) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch are two of the most common. Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the [[Bradford carpet]]). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the [[coat of arms]] of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called [[Berlin wool work]], were introduced in [[Germany]] in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.

==Fibres and yarns==
[[File:Stamp of Moldova 138.jpg|thumb|A [[Moldova]]n [[Postage stamp|stamp]] featuring a carpet]]
Carpet can be formulated from many single or blended [[nature|natural]] and [[synthetic fibre]]s. Fibres are chosen for durability, appearance, ease of manufacture, and cost. In terms of scale of production, the dominant yarn constructions are polyamides (nylons) and polypropylene with an estimated 90% of the commercial market.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Heisterberg-Moutsis, Rainer Heinz, Thomas F. Wolf, Dominic J. Harper, David James, Richard P. Mazzur, Volker Kettler, Hansgert Soiné "Floor Coverings" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nylon===
Since the 20th century, [[nylon]] is one of the most common materials for the construction of carpets. Both [[nylon 6]] and [[nylon 6-6]] are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying). Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics. Due to nylon's excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In carpets, nylon tends to stain easily because of the dye sites which exist on the fibre. These dye sites need to be filled in order to give nylon carpet any type of stain resistance. As nylon is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.

===Polypropylene===
[[Polypropylene]], a [[polyolefin]] stiffer than the cheaper [[polyethylene]], is used to produce carpet yarns because it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as "olefin", is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops tend to be more resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles can be well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil- based agents. If a stain does set, it can be difficult to clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or installed over a 1/4" thick, 8-pound density padding. Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.

===Wool and wool-blends===
[[File:2012-10-02 Wurstteppich huchwasistdenndas anagoria.jpg|thumb|A wool carpet]]
[[Wool]] has excellent durability, can be dyed easily and is fairly abundant. When blended with synthetic fibres such as nylon the durability of wool is increased. Blended wool yarns are extensively used in production of modern carpet, with the most common blend being 80% wool to 20% synthetic fibre, giving rise to the term "80/20". Wool is relatively expensive and consequently it only comprises a small portion of the market.

===Polyester===
The [[polyester]] known as "PET" ([[polyethylene terephthalate]]) is used in carpet manufacturing in both spun and filament constructions. After the price of raw materials for many types of carpet rose in the early 2000s, polyester became more competitive. Polyester has good physical properties and is inherently stain-resistant because it is hydrophobic, and, unlike nylon, does not have dye sites. Colour is infused in a molten state (solution dyeing). Polyester has the disadvantage that it tends to crush or mat down easily. It is typically used in mid- to low-priced carpeting.

Another polyester, "PTT" ([[Polytrimethylene terephthalate]]), also called Sorona or 3GT (Dupont) or Corterra (Shell), is a variant of PET. Lurgi Zimmer PTT was first patented in 1941, but it was not produced until the 1990s, when Shell Chemicals developed the low-cost method of producing high-quality 1,3 propanediol (PDO), the starting raw material for PTT Corterra Polymers. DuPont subsequently commercialized a [[biological process]] for making [[1,3-propanediol]] from [[corn syrup]], imparting significant [[Renewable resource|renewable]] content on the corresponding Sorona polyester carpet fibers.&lt;ref name=Sengupta&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sengupta|first1=Debolina|last2=Pike|first2=Ralph W.|title=Chemicals from Biomass: Ingegrating Bioprocess into Chemical Production|date=July 5, 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1439878145|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9N_xWEGI9wC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=1,3-propanediol+production+tennessee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8IrdtdI33Q&amp;sig=ZtWronTOOt0k4XdYssVPs1U_q7Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VW3HVIKEEMiVNrWGhMAN&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=1%2C3-propanediol%20production%20tennessee&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These carpet fibers have resiliency comparable to nylon.&lt;ref name=Chuah&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuah|first1=Hoe H.|title=Poly(trimethylene terephthalate)|journal=Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology|date=22 October 2001|doi=10.1002/0471440264.pst292|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471440264.pst292/abstract|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acrylic===
[[Acrylic fiber|Acrylic]] is a synthetic material first created by the Dupont Corporation in 1941 but has gone through various changes since it was first introduced. In the past, acrylic carpet used to fuzz or "pill" easily. This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction. Over the years, new types of acrylics have been developed to alleviate some of these problems, although the issues have not been completely removed. Acrylic is fairly difficult to dye but is colourfast, washable, and has the feel and appearance of wool, making it a good rug fabric.

==History==
[[File: Pazyryk carpet.jpg|thumb|The [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk]] Carpet, the oldest surviving carpet in the world ([[Armenia]] or [[Iran|Persia]], 5th century BC.)]]
[[File:The Czartoryski Carpet.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Czartoryski]] carpet with coat of arms of the Polish Myszkowski family,&lt;ref name=polish /&gt; made with a [[cotton]] warp, a [[silk]] weft and pile, and metal wrapped thread (Iran, 17th century)]]
The knotted pile carpet probably originated in the [[Caspian Sea]] area (Northern Iran) &lt;ref&gt;E.J.W. Barber, ''Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean'', 1992, {{ISBN|0-691-00224-X}}, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Armenian Highland]].&lt;ref name=" Volkmar Gantzhorn 1998"&gt;Volkmar Gantzhorn, "Oriental Carpets", 1998. {{ISBN|3-8228-0545-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is evidence of goats and sheep being sheared for wool and hair which was spun and woven as far back at the 7th millennium, the earliest surviving pile carpet is the "Pazyryk carpet", which dates from the 5th-4th century BC. It was excavated by [[Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko]] in 1949 from a [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk burial]] mound in the [[Altai Mountains]] in [[Siberia]]. This richly coloured carpet is 200 x 183&amp;nbsp;cm (6'6" x 6'0") and framed by a border of griffins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7d.html |title=The State Hermitage Museum: Collection Highlights |publisher=Hermitagemuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005151326/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7d.html |archivedate=October 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although claimed by many cultures, this square tufted carpet, almost perfectly intact, is considered by many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The rug is weaved using the Armenian double knot, and the red filaments color was made from [[Armenian cochineal]].&lt;ref name=vk2&gt;[[Ashkhunj Poghosyan]], [[:File:Ashkhunj Poghosyan, On origin of Pazyryk rug, Yerevan, 2013(2).pdf|On origin of Pazyryk rug, Yerevan, 2013]] (PDF) pp. 1-21 {{ref-hy}}, pp. 22-37 {{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USSR conference to exchange experiences leading restorers and researchers.

===Afghanistan===
{{main article|Afghan rug}}
There has recently been a surge in demand for Afghan carpets, although many Afghan carpet manufacturers market their products under the name of a different country.&lt;ref name="pajhwok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanembassyjp.com/en/news/?an=1377 |title=Afghan rugs sell like hot cakes |publisher=Afghanembassyjp.com |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets are made in Afghanistan, as well as by [[Afghan refugees]] who reside in Pakistan and Iran. Famous Afghan rugs include the ''[[Shindand, Herat|Shindand]]'' or ''[[Adraskan]]'' (named after local Afghan villages), woven in the [[Herat Province|Herat]] area in western Afghanistan.

Afghan carpets are commonly known as Afghan rugs. Afghan carpets are a unique and well recognized handmade material design that originates from Afghanistan. They often exhibit intricate detailing, mainly using traditional tribal designs originating from the Turkmen, Kazakh, Baloch, and Uzbeks. The hand-made rugs come in many patterns and colors, yet the traditional and most common example of Afghan carpet is the octagon-shaped elephant-foot (Bukhara). The rugs with this print are most commonly red in color. Many dyes, such as [[vegetable dye]]s, are used to impart rich color.

===Armenia===
{{main article|Armenian carpet}}

The historian Herodotus writing in the 5th century BC also informs us that the inhabitants of the Caucasus wove beautiful rugs with brilliant colors which would never fade.[23] Various rug fragments have been excavated in Armenia dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier. The oldest, single, surviving knotted carpet in existence is the Pazyryk carpet, excavated from a frozen tomb in Siberia, dated from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. This square tufted carpet, almost perfectly intact, is considered by many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The eminent authority of ancient carpets, Ulrich Schurmann, says of it, "From all the evidence available I am convinced that the Pazyryk rug was a funeral accessory and most likely a masterpiece of Armenian workmanship".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Ulrich%20Schurmann%22 Ulrich Schurmann, The Pazyryk. Its Use and Origin, Munich, 1982, p.46]&lt;/ref&gt; Gantzhorn concurs with this thesis. At the ruins of Persepolis in Iran where various nations are depicted as bearing tribute, the horse design from the Pazyryk carpet is the same as the relief depicting part of the Armenian delegation.
[[Armenian carpet]]s were renowned by foreigners who travelled to Artsakh; the Arab geographer and historian [[Al-Masudi]] noted that, among other works of art, he had never seen such carpets elsewhere in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ulubabyan| first = Bagrat A| authorlink =Bagrat Ulubabyan| title = Խաչենի իշխանությունը, X-XVI դարերում (The Principality of Khachen, From the 10th to 16th Centuries)| publisher =Armenian Academy of Sciences| location= Yerevan, Armenian SSR| year = 1975| page=267| isbn = |language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that "Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making."&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"&gt;Hakobyan. ''Medieval Art of Artsakh'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles. They were diverse in style, rich in colour and ornamental motifs, and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them, such as ''artsvagorgs'' (eagle-carpets), ''vishapagorgs'' (dragon-carpets) and ''otsagorgs'' (serpent-carpets).&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"/&gt; The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, "covered with vegatative ornaments", and bears an artistic resemblance to the [[illuminated manuscripts]] produced in Artsakh.&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"/&gt;

The art of carpet weaving was in addition intimately connected to the making of curtains as evidenced in a passage by [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]], a 13th-century Armenian historian from Artsakh, who praised Arzu-Khatun, the wife of regional prince Vakhtang Khachenatsi, and her daughters for their expertise and skill in weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]]. ''Պատմություն Հայոց '' (''History of Armenia''). Yerevan, Armenian SSR: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1961, p. 216, as cited in Hakobyan. ''Medieval Art of Artsakh'', p. 84, note 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azerbaijan===
{{Main article|Azerbaijani rug}}

The Gultapin excavations discovered several carpet weaving tools which date back to the 4th-3rd millennium BC. According to Iranica Online "''The main weaving zone was in the eastern Transcaucasus south of the mountains that bisect the region diagonally, the area now comprised in the Azerbaijan SSR; it is the homeland of a Turkic population known today as Azeri. Other ethnic groups also practiced weaving, some of them in other parts of the Caucasus, but they were of lesser importance''." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carpets-xv|title=CARPETS xv. Caucasian Carpets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan was one of the most important centers of carpet weaving and as a result of that, several different schools have evolved. While traditionally schools are divided into four main branches, each region has its own version of the carpets. The Schools are divided into four main branches: Kuba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh carpet-weaving school, The Baku carpet school, Karabakh school of carpet weaving.

===China===
{{See also|Oriental rug}}
As opposed to most antique rug manufactory practices, Chinese carpets were woven almost exclusively for internal consumption. China has a long history of exporting traditional goods; however, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that the Chinese began to export their rugs. Once in contact with western influences, there was a large change in production: Chinese manufactories began to produce [[art-deco]] rugs with [[commerce|commercial]] look and price point. The centuries-old Chinese textile industry is rich in history. While most antique carpets are classified according to a specific region or manufactory, scholars attribute the age of any specific Chinese rug to the ruling emperor of the time. The earliest surviving examples of the craft were produced during the time of [[Ch'ung Chen]], the last emperor of the [[Chen Dynasty]].

===India===

Carpet weaving may have been introduced into the area as far back as the eleventh century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the [[Ghaznavids]] and the [[Ghauris]], from the West. It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Dynasty in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, Babar, extended his rule from Kabul to India to found the Mughal Empire. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the Punjab made use of motifs and decorative styles found in Mughal architecture.

[[Akbar]], a Mogul emperor, is accredited to introducing the art of carpet weaving to India during his reign. The Mughal emperors patronized Persian carpets for their royal courts and palaces. During this period, he brought Persian craftsmen from their homeland and established them in India. Initially, the carpets woven showed the classic Persian style of fine knotting. Gradually it blended with Indian art. Thus the carpets produced became typical of the Indian origin and gradually the industry began to diversify and spread all over the subcontinent. During the Mughal period, the carpets made on the Indian subcontinent became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets had distinctive designs and boasted a high density of knots. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Indian carpets are well known for their designs with attention to detail and presentation of realistic attributes. The carpet industry in India flourished more in its northern part with major centres found in Kashmir, Jaipur, [[Agra]] and Bhadohi.

Indian carpets are known for their high density of knotting. Hand-knotted carpets are a speciality and widely in demand in the West. The carpet industry in India has been successful in establishing social business models that help underprivileged sections of the society. Notable examples of [[social entrepreneurship]] ventures are [[Jaipur rugs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chillibreeze.com/articles_various/Jaipur-rugs-1101.asp |title=A Case of Social Entrepreneurship |publisher=Chillibreeze.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215919/http://www.chillibreeze.com/articles_various/Jaipur-rugs-1101.asp |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fabindia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-05-06/news/27717265_1_handloom-weavers-shareholders-fabric-suppliers |title= Handloom weavers shareholders fabric suppliers | work=The Times Of India | date=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another category of Indian rugs which, though quite popular in most of the western countries, have not received much press, is hand-woven rugs of Khairabad (Citapore rugs). {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} [[Khairabad, Sitapur|Khairabad]] small town in Citapore (now spelled as "[[Sitapur]]") district of India had been ruled by Raja [[Mehmoodabad]]. Khairabad (Mehmoodabad Estate) was part of [[Oudh]] province which had been ruled by [[shi'i]] Muslims having Persian linkages. Citapore rugs made in Khairabad and neighbouring areas are all hand-woven and distinct from tufted and knotted rugs. Flat weave is the basic weaving technique of Citapore rugs and generally cotton is the main weaving material here but jute, rayon and chenille are also popular. ''[[IKEA]]'' and ''[[Agocha]]'' have been major buyers of rugs from this area.

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Pakistani rug}}

The art of weaving developed in South Asia at a time when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]]– ancient cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]– have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles. As of the late 1990s, hand-knotted carpets were among Pakistan's leading export products and their manufacture is the second largest cottage and small industry. Pakistani craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of gulls, medallions, paisleys, traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Peter F. The Oriental Rug Lexicon. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of independence, manufacturing of carpets was set up in [[Sangla Hill]], a small town of District Sheikhupura. Chaudary Mukhtar Ahmad Member son of Maher Ganda introduced and taught this art to locals and immigrants. He is considered founder of this industry in Pakistan. Sangla Hill is now a focal point in Carpet Industry in Pakistan. Almost all the exporters and manufacturers who are running their business at Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi have their area offices in Sangla Hill.

The Persian carpet is a part of Persian (Iranian) art and culture. Carpet-[[weaving]] in Persia dates back to the [[Bronze Age]]. The earliest surviving corpus of Persian carpets come from the [[Safavid]] dynasty (1501–1736) in the 16th century. However, painted depictions prove a longer history of production. There is much variety among classical Persian carpets of the 16th and 17th century. Common motifs include scrolling vine networks, [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s, [[palmette]]s, [[cloud band]]s, medallions, and overlapping geometric compartments rather than animals and humans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This is because [[Islam]], the dominant religion in that part of the world, forbids their depiction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Still, some show figures engaged either in the hunt or feasting scenes. The majority of these carpets are wool, but several [[silk]] examples produced in [[Kashan]] survive.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Arthur Upham. A Survey of Persian Art from Prehistoric Times to the Present. Vol. XI, Carpets, Chapter 55. New York: Oxford University Press, 1938-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scandinavian rugs are among the most popular of all weaves in modern design. Preferred by influential modernist thinkers, designers, and advocates for a new aesthetic in the mid-twentieth century, Scandinavian rugs have become very widespread in many different avenues of contemporary interior design. With a long history of adaptation and evolution, the tradition of Scandinavian rug-making is among the most storied of all European rug-making traditions.

The carpets are always hand made of wool or sometimes cotton, with occasional additions of silk. These carpets are natural barriers against the cold. Turkish pile rugs and kilims are also frequently used as tent decorations, grain bags, camel and donkey bags, ground cushions, oven covers, sofa covers, bed and cushion covers, blankets, curtains, eating blankets, table top spreads, prayer rugs and for ceremonial occasions.

The oldest records of flat woven kilims come from [[Çatalhöyük]] Neolithic pottery, circa 7000 B.C. One of the oldest settlements ever to have been discovered, Çatalhöyük is located south east of Konya in the middle of the Anatolian region.&lt;ref name="Çatalhöyük.com: Ancient Civilization and Excavation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catalhoyuk.com/mission.html |title=Çatalhöyük.com: Ancient Civilization and Excavation |publisher=Catalhoyuk.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101144734/http://www.catalhoyuk.com/mission.html# |archive-date=2016-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavations to date (only 3% of the town) not only found carbonized fabric but also fragments of kilims painted on the walls of some of the dwellings.

The knotted rug is believed to have reached Asia Minor and the Middle East with the expansion of various nomadic tribes peoples during the latter period of the great [[Turkic migration]] of the 8th and 9th centuries. Famously depicted in European paintings of [[The Renaissance]], beautiful Anatolian rugs were often used from then until modern times, to indicate the high economic and social status of the owner.

Women learn their weaving skills at an early age, taking months or even years to complete the beautiful pile rugs and flat woven kilims that were created for their use in every aspect of daily life. As is true in most weaving cultures, traditionally and nearly exclusively, it is women and girls who are both artisan and weaver.&lt;ref name="The Dominant role of women and girls in Turkish carpet weaving"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/tapestry/anatolian-carpets/carpet-weaving-tradition-600.htm?type=1 |title=The Dominant role of Turkish Women and Girls in Turkish carpet weaving |publisher=Turkishculture.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Türkmen carpet (also called "Bukhara Uzbekistan") is a type of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally originating in Central Asia. It is useful to distinguish between the original Turkmen tribal rugs and the rugs produced in large numbers for export in the 2000s, mainly in Pakistan and Iran. The original Turkmen rugs were produced by the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes who are the main ethnic group in [[Turkmenistan]] and are also found in Afghanistan and Iran. They are used for various purposes, including tent rugs, door hangings and bags of various sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medeniyet.gov.tm/downloads/rowayat_ru.pdf Living legend] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212110046/http://medeniyet.gov.tm/downloads/rowayat_ru.pdf |date=December 12, 2013 }}, The president of Turkmenistan [[Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov]] book about Turkmen rug&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oriental carpets in Europe====
Oriental carpets began to appear in Europe after the [[Crusades]] in the 11th century, due to contact by Crusaders with Eastern traders. Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables. Except in royal or ecclesiastical settings they were considered too precious to cover the floor. Starting in the 13th century oriental carpets begin to appear in paintings (notably from Italy, Flanders, England, France, and the Netherlands). Carpets of Indo-Persian design were introduced to Europe via the Dutch, British, and French [[East India Company|East India Companies]] of the 17th and 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, Maurice Sven and Jean Mailey.

Although isolated instances of carpet production pre-date the Muslim invasion of Spain, the [[Hispano-Moresque]] examples are the earliest significant body of European-made carpets. Documentary evidence shows production beginning in Spain as early as the 10th century AD. The earliest extant Spanish carpet, the so-called [[Synagogue carpet]] in the Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin, is a unique survival dated to the 14th century. The earliest group of Hispano-Moresque carpets, [[Admiral carpet]]s (also known as [[armorial carpet]]s), has an all-over geometric, repeat pattern punctuated by blazons of noble, Christian Spanish families. The variety of this design was analyzed most thoroughly by [[May Beattie]]. Many of the 15th-century, Spanish carpets rely heavily on designs originally developed on the Anatolian Peninsula. Carpet production continued after the Reconquest of Spain and eventual expulsion of the Muslim population in the 15th century. 16th-century Renaissance Spanish carpet design is a derivative of silk textile design. Two of the most popular motifs are wreaths and pomegranates.

During the [[Moorish]] (Muslim) period production took place in [[Alcaraz]] in the province of Murcia, as well as being recorded in other towns. Carpet production after the Christian reconquest continued in Alcaraz while [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], first recorded as a weaving centre in the 12th century, became increasingly important, and was dominant in the 17th and early 18th century. Carpets of completely different French based designs began to be woven in a royal workshop, the [[Royal Tapestry Factory]] ''(Real Fábrica de Tapices de Santa Bárbara)'' in Madrid in the 18th century. Cuenca was closed down by the royal degree of Carlos IV in the late 18th century to stop it competing with the new workshop. Madrid continued as a weaving centre through to the 20th century, producing brightly coloured carpets most of whose designs are strongly influenced by French carpet design, and which are frequently signed (on occasions with the monogram MD; also sometimes with the name Stuyck) and dated in the outer stripe. After the [[Spanish civil war]] [[General Franco]] revived the carpet weaving industry in workshops named after him, weaving designs that are influenced by earlier Spanish carpets, usually in a very limited range of colours.&lt;ref name="Sherrill, Sarah B 1996"&gt;Sherrill, Sarah B.

===Serbia===
{{main article |Pirot carpet}}
'''Pirot carpet'''{{Cref2|a}} ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Пиротски ћилим, Pirotski ćilim) refers to a variety of flat tapestry-woven carpets or rugs traditionally produced in [[Pirot]], a town in southeastern Serbia. Pirot kilims with some 122 ornaments and 96 different types have been protected by geographical indication in 2002. They are one of the most important traditional handicrafts in Serbia. In the late 19th century and up to the Second World War, Pirot kilims have been frequently used as insignia of Serbian and Yugoslav royalty. This tradition was revived in 2011 when Pirot kilims were reintroduced for state ceremonies in Serbia. Carpet weaving in Pirot dates back to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;LEPOTA TRAJANJA&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first mentions of the Pirot kilim in written sources date to 1565, when it was said that the šajkaši boats on the Danube and Drava were covered with Pirot kilims. Pirot was once the most important rug-making centre in the Balkans. Pirot is located on the historical main highway which linked central Europe with Constantinople.Pirot was also known as Şarköy in Turkish. The Pirot carpet varieties are also found in Bulgaria and Turkey, and in many other international collections. One of the chief qualities are the colour effects achieved through the choice and arrangement of colours.

In the beginning of the 19th century plant dyes were replaced by aniline colourings. "The best product of the country is the Pirot carpet, worth about ten shillings a square metre. The designs are extremely pretty, and the rugs, without being so heavy as the Persian, or so ragged and scant in the web and woof as Caramanian, wear for ever. The manufacture of these is almost entirely confined to Pirot. From Pirots old Turkish signification as Şarköy stems the traditional trade name of the rugs as Şarköy-kilims. Stemming from the homonym to the today's Turkish settlement of Şarköy in Thracia, which had no established rug making tradition, Şarköys are often falsely ascribed to originate from Turkey. Also in the rug selling industry, Şarköy are mostly labeled as being of oriental or Turkish origin as to easier sell them to non familiar customers as they prefer rug with putative oriental origin. In fact, Şarköys have been established from the 17th century in the region of the Western Balkan or Stara Planina mountains in the towns of Pirot, Berkowiza, Lom, Chiprovtsi and Samokow. Later they have been also produced in Knjaževac and Caribrod.

{{main article |Chiprovtsi carpet}}
The [[Chiprovtsi carpet]] (Чипровци килим) is a type of handmade carpet with two absolutely identical sides, part of Bulgarian national heritage, traditions, arts and crafts. Its name is derived from the town of [[Chiprovtsi]] where their production started in the 17th century. The carpet weaving industry played a key role in the revival of Chiprovtsi in the 1720s after the devastation of the failed 1688 [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] against Ottoman rule. The western traveller [[Ami Boué]], who visited Chiprovtsi in 1836–1838, reported that "mainly young girls, under shelters or in corridors, engage in carpet weaving. They earn only five [[franc]]s a month and the payment was even lower before". By 1868, the annual production of carpets in Chiprovtsi had surpassed 14,000&amp;nbsp;square metres.&lt;ref&gt;Костова, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, almost 1,400 women from Chiprovtsi and the region were engaged in carpet weaving. In 1920, the locals founded the ''Manual Labour'' carpet-weaving cooperative society, the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Костова, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; At present. the carpet (''kilim'') industry remains dominant in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_Bulgarian/Theme_Ikonomika_Ekologia_Turizam/Material/2505-5.htm|title=Чипровските килими—запазена марка на килимарския бизнес в България|last=Димитрова|first=Милка|date=2005-05-25|publisher=[[Bulgarian National Radio|БНР]] [[Radio Bulgaria|Радио България]]|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-09-19}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpets have been crafted according to traditional designs, but in recent years it is up to the customers to decide the pattern of the carpet they have ordered.

In recent decades, however, the Chiprovtsi carpet industry has been in decline as it had lost its firm foreign markets. As a result, the town and the municipality have been experiencing a demographic crisis.

{{Main article|Savonnerie manufactory}}
In 1608 [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] initiated the French production of "Turkish style" carpets under the direction of [[Pierre DuPont (carpet maker)|Pierre DuPont]]. This production was soon moved to the Savonnerie factory in Chaillot just west of Paris. The earliest, well-known group produced by the Savonnerie, then under the direction of [[Simon Lourdet]], are the carpets that were produced in the early years of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s reign. They are densely ornamented with flowers, sometimes in vases or baskets, against dark blue or brown grounds in deep borders. The designs are based on Netherlandish and Flemish textiles and paintings. The most famous Savonnerie carpets are the series made for the Grande Galerie and the Galerie d'Apollon in the [[Palais du Louvre]] between c. 1665-1685. These 105 masterpieces, made under the artistic direction of [[Charles Le Brun]], were never installed, as Louis XIV moved the court to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1688. Their design combines rich [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves, architectural framing, and mythological scenes (inspired by [[Cesare Ripa]]'s Iconologie) with emblems of Louis XIV's royal power.

[[Pierre-Josse Perrot]] is the best-known of the mid-eighteenth-century carpet designers. His many surviving works and drawings display graceful rococo s-scrolls, central rosettes, shells, acanthus leaves, and floral swags. The Savonnerie manufactory was moved to the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins]] in Paris in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;(french) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bN_HkKC1xNUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=savonnerie+manufacture+gobelins+1826&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=5frOTtrDD4f3sgbnm6XCDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=savonnerie%20manufacture%20gobelins%201826&amp;f=false Jean Coural, ''Les Gobelins'', Nouvelles Editions Latines, 1989, p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; The Beauvais manufactory, better known for their [[tapestry]], also made knotted pile carpets from 1780 to 1792. Carpet production in small, privately owned workshops in the town of [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]] began in 1743. Carpets produced in France employ the symmetrical knot.&lt;ref name="Sherrill, Sarah B 1996"/&gt;

===England===
Knotted pile carpet weaving technology probably came to England in the early 16th century with [[Flemings|Flemish]] [[Calvinist]]s fleeing religious persecution. Because many of these weavers settled in South-eastern [[England]] in Norwich the 14 extant 16th and 17th century carpets are sometimes referred to as "Norwich carpets." These works are either adaptations of Anatolian or Indo-Persian designs or employ Elizabethan-Jacobean scrolling vines and blossoms. All but one are dated or bear a coat of arms. Like the French, English weavers used the symmetrical knot. There are documented and surviving examples of carpets from three 18th-century manufactories: Exeter (1756–1761, owned by [[Claude Passavant]], 3 extant carpets), Moorfields (1752–1806, owned by Thomas Moore, 5 extant carpets), and Axminster (1755–1835, owned by [[Thomas Whitty]], numerous extant carpets). Exeter and Moorfields were both staffed with renegade weavers from the French Savonnerie and, therefore, employ the weaving structure of that factory and Perrot-inspired designs. Neoclassical designer [[Robert Adam]] supplied designs for both Moorfields and Axminster carpets based on [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] floor [[mosaics]] and coffered ceilings. Some of the most well-known rugs of his design were made for [[Syon House]], [[Osterley House]], [[Harewood House]], [[Saltram House]], and [[Newby Hall]].

{{visible anchor|Axminster carpet}} was a unique floor covering made originally in a [[Axminster Carpets|factory]] founded at Axminster, Devon, England, in 1755 by the cloth weaver [[Thomas Whitty]]. Resembling somewhat the Savonnerie carpets produced in France, Axminster carpets were symmetrically knotted by hand in wool on woolen warps and had a weft of flax or hemp. Like the French carpets, they often featured Renaissance architectural or floral patterns; others mimicked oriental patterns. Similar carpets were produced at the same time in Exeter and in the Moorfields section of London and, shortly before, at Fulham in Middlesex. The Whitty factory closed in 1835 with the advent of machine-made carpeting. The name Axminster, however, survived as a generic term for machine-made carpets whose pile is produced by techniques similar to those used in making velvet or chenille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46332/Axminster-carpet |title=Axminster carpet - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Axminster carpet has three main types of broadloom carpet construction in use today (machine woven, tufted &amp; hand knotted). Machine woven carpet is an investment that will last 20 or 30 years and woven Axminster and Wilton carpets are still extremely popular in areas where longevity and design flexibility are a big part of the purchasing decision. Hotels and leisure venues almost always choose these types and many homes use woven Axminsters as design statements.

[[File:Rug.jpg|thumb|Machine used to cut and re-roll carpet lengths]]
Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton are made by massive looms that weave together ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, so that in the finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.

Six of Axminster carpets are known as the "Lansdowne" group. These have a tripartite design with reeded circles and baskets of flowers in the central panel flanked by diamond lozenges in the side panels. Axminster Rococo designs often have a brown ground and include birds copied from popular, contemporary engravings. Even now a large percentage of the 55,000 population town still seek employment in this industry. The town of [[Wilton, Wiltshire]] is also known for its carpet weaving, which dates back to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interior Decoration: A Complete Source|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_btgLVQUVL0C&amp;dq=lansdowne+group+axminster+carpets&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|work=Google book|accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brussels Loom was introduced into England towards the middle of the eighteenth century marked the beginning of a new era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the jacquard pattern selecting mechanism and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the U.S.A.

Later when bladed wires were developed the pile loops were severed on withdrawal of the blade wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton, after this development the loom became known as the Wilton loom, and in modern usage the designation Wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom. The latter now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired jacquard. The methods of manufacture, including the principles of designing, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire (2-shot), the Wilton cut-pile is woven more often with three picks of weft to each wire (3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured in the carpet backing.

Brussels carpets have a smooth slightly ribbed surface and their patterning is well defined, a characteristic feature of the carpet. Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and hard wearing properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton Carpets were initially produced on 27-inch (3/4) looms and were sewn together by hand. The looms could incorporate up to 5 frames all with different colours thus enabling figured or pattern carpets to be manufactured. With judicial and very skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, thus enabling very complex designs to be produced. Due to the additional costs in labour these carpets were normally only produced for the bespoke market.

After the first World War the carpets started to be produced for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class of the twentieth century aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce bespoke (custom-made) luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Carpets'' by George Robinson F.T.I., F.S.D.C. published 1966 Chap 7 Wilton Carpets page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern carpeting and installation==
[[File:Berber Carpet (macro).jpg|thumb|[[Macro photography|Macro]] shot of a [[Berber carpet|Berber-style carpet]]. Berber-style carpets feature two sizes of tufts of varying colors in a loop pile construction]]
Carpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the US, 4&amp;nbsp;m and 5&amp;nbsp;m in Europe. Where necessary different widths can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and it is fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s, thus distinguishing it from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings. For environmental reasons, the use of wool, natural bindings, natural padding, and formaldehyde-free glues is becoming more common. These options are almost always at a premium cost.

In the UK, some carpets are still manufactured for yachts, hotels, pubs and clubs in a narrow width of {{convert|27|in|m}} and then sewn to size. Carpeting which covers an entire room area is loosely referred to as 'wall-to-wall', but carpet can be installed over any portion thereof with use of appropriate transition moldings where the carpet meets other types of floor coverings. Carpeting is more than just a single item; it is, in fact, a system comprising the carpet itself, the carpet backing (often made of latex), the cushioning underlay, and a method of installation.
Carpet tiles are also available, typically {{convert|50|cm|in}} square. These are usually only used in commercial settings and are affixed using a special pressure-sensitive glue, which holds them into place while allowing easy removal (in an office environment, for example) or to allow rearrangement in order to spread wear.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Alan J. The Complete Carpet Buying Guide. Portland Oregon: AJ Books 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Carpet binding" is a term used for any material being applied to the edge of a carpet to make a rug. Carpet binding is usually cotton or nylon, but also comes in many other materials such as leather. Non-synthetic binding is frequently used with bamboo, grass and wool rugs, but is often used with carpet made from other materials.

==In culture and figurative expressions==
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|A mythical [[magic carpet]]]]
There are many stories about [[magic carpet]]s, legendary flying carpets that can be used to transport people who are on it instantaneously or quickly to their destination. Disney's Aladdin depicts a magic carpet found by Aladdin and Abu in the Cave of Wonders while trying to find Genie's lamp. Aladdin and Jasmine ride on him to go on a ride around the world. The term "[m]agic carpet [is] first attested [in] 1816.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; From the 16th century to the 19th century, the term "carpet" was used "...as an adjective often with a tinge of contempt, when used of men (as in carpet-knight, 1570s)", which meant a man who was associated with "...luxury, ladies' boudoirs, and drawing rooms".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; ''Rolling out the red carpet'' is an expression which means to welcome a guest lavishly and handsomely. In some cases, an actual [[red carpet]] is used for VIPs and celebrities to walk on, such as at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and when foreign dignitaries are welcomed to a country.

In 1820s British servant slang, to "carpet" someone means to call them for a reprimand.&lt;ref name="etymonline1" /&gt; To be ''called on the carpet'' means to be summoned for a serious reason, typically a scolding reprimand; this usage dates from 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=carpet. Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger variant of this expression, to be "hauled on the carpet", implies an even sterner reprimand. [[Carpet bombing]] is a type of bombing from airplanes which developed in the 20th century in which an entire city is bombed (rather than precise strikes on military targets). The slang expression "laugh at the carpet" means to [[vomit]] on the floor (especially a carpeted floor).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/carpet Carpet - Idioms by The Free Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "on the carpet" refers to a matter which is under discussion or consideration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The term "carpet muncher" is a derogatory slang term for a [[lesbian]]; this expression is first attested in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/carpet-muncher Carpet muncher | Define Carpet muncher at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The_Carpet_Seller,_a_figurine_by_Royal_Doulton.jpg|thumb|left|''The Carpet Seller'', a [[Royal Doulton]] figurine]]
The term [[carpet bag]], which literally refers to a suitcase made from a piece of carpet, is used in several figurative contexts. The term gained a popular usage after the [[American Civil War]] to refer to [[carpetbaggers]], Northerners who moved to the South after the war, especially during the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] (1865–1877). Carpetbaggers allegedly politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for financial and power gains. In modern usage in the U.S., the term is sometimes used derisively to refer to a politician who runs for public office in an area where he or she does not have deep community ties, or has lived only for a short time. In the United Kingdom, the term was adopted to refer informally to those who join a [[mutual organization]], such as a [[building society]], in order to force it to [[Demutualization|demutualize]], that is, to convert into a [[joint stock company]], solely for personal financial gain.

''Cutting the rug'' is a slang term for dancing which originated in 1942.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; The use of the term "rug" as an informal term for a "[[toupee]]" (man's [[wig]]) is [[theater]] slang from 1940.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; The term "sweep [something] under the rug" or "sweep [something] under the carpet" figuratively refers to situations where a person or organization is hiding something embarrassing or negative; this use was first recorded in 1953.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The figurative expression "pull the rug out from under (someone)", meaning to "suddenly deprive of important support" is first attested to in 1936, in American English. A related figurative expression used centuries earlier was "cut the grass under (one's) feet", which is attested to in the 1580s.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; A "rugrat" or "rug-rat" is a slang term for a baby or child, first attested in 1968.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; The expression "snug as a bug in a rug" means
"wrapped up tight, warm, and comfortable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/snug+as+a+bug+in+a+rug Snug as a bug in a rug - Idioms by The Free Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; To "lie like a rug" means "to tell lies shamelessly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/lie+like+a+rug Lie like a rug - Idioms by The Free Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "pull the rug out (from under someone)" means "to make someone or someone's plans fall through" or "to upset someone's plans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/pull+the+rug+out Pull the rug out - Idioms by The Free Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Chaos Days''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Chaostage'') was an annual [[Punk subculture|punk]] gathering, often violent, held in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]] starting in 1982 and reviving in the mid-1990s.

In 1982, after several punk meetings in Wuppertal, which are considered forerunners of Chaos Days, the first Chaos Days occurred in Hanover.  The gathering was intended to protest a police plan to create a reference library of photographs of punks.  Thereafter, "official" Chaos Days were held in 1983, 1984, and 1985.

The most well-known Chaos Days took place in 1994 and 1995&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|title=German Punks turn 'Chaos Days' into an orgy of violence|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/german-punks-turn-chaos-days-into-an-orgy-of-violence-1595163.html|accessdate=5 June 2010 | location=London | work=The Independent | date=7 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gainesville"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chaos Days|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19950805&amp;id=wwASAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=seoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1246,887696|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125072640/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19950805&amp;id=wwASAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=seoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1246,887696|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 January 2013|accessdate=5 June 2010|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|date=5 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in huge riots and the destruction of cars and buildings.&lt;ref name="Gainesville"/&gt; A whole supermarket was damaged and [[alcohol]]ic beverages were stolen by punks. These "chaos days" were the main topic of TV debates and newspapers for several weeks. Popular bands like [[Wizo|WIZO]] spontaneously played a show there, and [[Terrorgruppe]] wrote a now-classic song about it ("Wochenendticket", named after a train ticket that most punks used in order to get to Hanover from all across the country).

'''Chaos Days USA'''
Chaos Days were organized in the United States in 1995 and 1996, to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area during the same period of time as the German Chaos Days. Chaos Days USA were criticized for the same reasons as the German Chaos Days; critics{{Who|date=February 2011}} claimed that Chaos Days had "No social value".

[[File:De Re Aedificatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Title page of 1550 edition, [[Florence]]]]

'''''De re aedificatoria''''' ('''''On the Art of Building''''') is a classic architectural treatise written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1443 and 1452.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Grayson, in ''Kunstkronik'' '''213''' (1960:359ff, and ''Münchener Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst'' '''11''' (1960), demonstrated that the bulk of the composition was carried out between these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Although largely dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', it was the first theoretical book on the subject written in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and in 1485 it became the first printed book on architecture.  It was followed in 1486 with the first printed edition of Vitruvius.

[[File:L'architettura (1565) (14758258226).jpg|thumb|Plate from a 1565 edition, showing the plan of a [[basilica]]]]
{{further|Mathematics and architecture|Mathematics and art}}

Alberti's ''Ten Books'' consciously echoes Vitruvius's writing, but Alberti also adopts a critical attitude toward his predecessor. In his discussion, Alberti includes a wide variety of literary sources, including [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], presenting a concise version of the [[sociology]] of [[architecture]]. ''De re aedificatoria'' is subdivided into ten books and includes:

* Book One: ''Lineaments''
* Book Two: ''Materials''
* Book Three: ''Construction''
* Book Four: ''Public Works''
* Book Five: ''Works of Individuals''
* Book Six: ''Ornament''
* Book Seven: ''Ornament to Sacred Buildings''
* Book Eight: ''Ornament to Public Secular Buildings''
* Book Nine: ''Ornament to Private Buildings''
* Book Ten: ''Restoration of Buildings''

In his survey of desirable floor plans for sacred buildings— "temples" in his phrase—Alberti begins with the ideal form of the circle, which is expressed in numerous examples of Nature. Nine ideal centrally-planned geometrical shapes are recommended for churches; besides the circle he lists the square, the hexagon, octagon, decagon and dodecagon, all derived from the circle, and, derived from the square, rectangles that exhibit the square and a half, square and a third and double square, all of which have enharmonic parallels in music. Chapels add  small geometric figures to the basic circles and polygons to give a great variety of floor plans, in which each geometrical figure retains its clear unity and simple ratios that bind all elements of the plans and elevations into a harmonic unity.

''De re aedificatoria'' remained the classic treatise on architecture from the 16th until the 18th century.

'''''Dürer's Rhinoceros''''' is the name commonly given to a [[woodcut]] executed by German painter and [[printmaker]] [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources erroneously say 1513, copying a typographical error made by Dürer in one of his original drawings and perpetuated in his woodcut.(Bedini, p.121.)&lt;/ref&gt; The image is based on a written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist of an [[Indian Rhinoceros|Indian rhinoceros]] that had arrived in [[Lisbon]] in 1515.&lt;ref name=LT&gt;{{fr}} Joëlle Kuntz, [http://www.letemps.ch/culture/2015/12/18/1515-annee-rhinoceros "1515,  l’année du rhinocéros"], ''[[Le Temps]]'', Friday 18 December 2015 (page visited on 21 December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer never saw the actual [[rhinoceros]], which was the first living example seen in Europe since [[Roman Empire|Roman times]].&lt;ref name=LT/&gt; In late 1515, the King of Portugal, [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], sent the animal as a gift for [[Pope Leo X]], but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516. A live rhinoceros was not seen again in Europe until a second specimen, named [[Abada (rhinoceros)|Abada]], arrived from India at the court of [[Sebastian of Portugal]] in 1577, being later inherited by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] of Spain around 1580.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A street in Madrid was named ''Abada'' (rhinoceros in Portuguese) after this animal, that had a curious life too [http://callesdemadrid.blogspot.com/2006/11/abada-calle-de-la.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürer's woodcut is not an entirely accurate representation of a rhinoceros. He depicts an animal with hard plates that cover its body like sheets of [[armour]], with a [[gorget]] at the throat, a solid-looking [[breastplate]], and [[rivet]]s along the seams. He places a small twisted horn on its back, and gives it scaly legs and saw-like rear quarters. None of these features are present in a real rhinoceros,&lt;ref name=unicamp/&gt;&lt;ref name="kdpublish"/&gt; although the Indian rhinoceros does have deep folds in its skin that can look like armor from a distance. Despite its anatomical inaccuracies, Dürer's woodcut became very popular in Europe and was copied many times in the following three centuries. It was regarded by Westerners as a true representation of a rhinoceros into the late 18th century. Eventually, it was supplanted by more realistic drawings and paintings, particularly those of [[Clara (rhinoceros)|Clara the rhinoceros]], who toured Europe in the 1740s and 1750s. It has been said of Dürer's woodcut: "probably no animal picture has exerted such a profound influence on the arts".&lt;ref name="Clarke20"&gt;Quoted in Clarke, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rhinoceros==
[[Image:Nashorn.2.jpg|thumb|left|The first known print of the rhinoceros is a rather primitive woodcut which illustrates a poem by [[Giovanni Giacomo Penni]] published in Rome in July 1515. (Biblioteca Colombina, Seville).]]

On 20 May 1515, an Indian rhinoceros arrived in Lisbon from the Far East. In early 1514, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], governor of [[Portuguese India]], sent ambassadors to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Sultan]] [[Muzaffar Shah II]], ruler of [[Cambay]] (modern [[Gujarat]]), to seek permission to build a fort on the island of [[Diu, India|Diu]].  The mission returned without an agreement, but [[diplomatic gift]]s were exchanged, including the rhinoceros.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the rulers of different countries would occasionally send each other exotic animals to be kept in a [[menagerie]]. The rhinoceros was already well accustomed to being kept in captivity. Albuquerque decided to forward the gift, known by its [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] name of ''genda'', and its Indian keeper, named Ocem, to King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]. It sailed on the ''Nossa Senhora da Ajuda'',&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; which left [[Goa]] in January 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship, captained by Francisco Pereira Coutinho,&lt;ref name="lambe"&gt;[http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html História do famoso rhinocerus de Albrecht Dürer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218155010/http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html |date=2009-02-18 }}, Projecto Lambe-Lambe {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and two companion vessels, all loaded with exotic [[spice]]s, sailed across the [[Indian Ocean]], around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and north through the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], stopping briefly in [[Mozambique]], [[Saint Helena]] and the [[Azores]].

After a relatively fast voyage of 120 days, the rhinoceros was finally unloaded in Portugal, near the site where the [[Manueline]] [[Belém Tower]] was under construction. The tower was later decorated with [[gargoyle]]s shaped as rhinoceros heads under its [[corbel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Clarke, p.19, for a photograph of a gargoyle.&lt;/ref&gt; A rhinoceros had not been seen in Europe since Roman times: it had become something of a [[mythical beast]], occasionally conflated in [[bestiary|bestiaries]] with the "monoceros" (unicorn), so the arrival of a living example created a sensation. In the context of the [[Renaissance]], it was a piece of [[classical antiquity]] which had been rediscovered, like a statue or an inscription.

The animal was examined by scholars and the curious, and letters describing the fantastic creature were sent to correspondents throughout Europe. The earliest known image of the animal illustrates a ''poemetto'' by Florentine [[Giovanni Giacomo Penni]], published in [[Rome]] on 13 July 1515, fewer than eight weeks after its arrival in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Giacomo Penni, ''Forma e natura e costumi de lo rinocerote'' (...). See Ugo Serani, ''Etiopicas'' 2 (2006) ISSN 1698-689X [http://www.uhu.es/programa_calidad_literatura_amatoria/etiopicas/num_2/serani.pdf] for the original text in Italian and a translation into Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; The only known copy of the original published poem is held by the [[Institución Colombina]] in [[Seville]].

It was housed in King Manuel's menagerie at the [[Ribeira Palace]] in Lisbon, separate from his elephants and other large beasts at the [[Estaus Palace]]. On [[Trinity Sunday]], 3 June, Manuel arranged a fight with a young elephant from his collection, to test the account by [[Pliny the Elder]] that the elephant and the rhinoceros are bitter enemies.&lt;ref name="pliny"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/8*.html Latin original] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/pliny8.html English translation] of Chapter 29, Book VIII of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The rhinoceros advanced slowly and deliberately towards its foe; the elephant, unaccustomed to the noisy crowd that turned out to witness the spectacle, fled the field in panic before a single blow was struck.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albrecht Dürer's Rhinoceros, a drawing and woodcut|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/albrecht-d%C3%BCrer-s-rhinoceros-a-drawing-and-woodcut/VQE7S6K8Yxg5Zw?hl=en|publisher=[[Google Cultural Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Raffael.rhino.jpg|thumb|"Creation of the animals" by [[Raphael]], 1518–1519, a [[fresco]] on the second floor of the [[Palazzi Pontifici]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. A rhinoceros appears &lt;!-- in profile  --&gt;to the right of the tree, with an elephant [possibly [[Hanno (elephant)|Hanno]]] to the left.]]

Manuel decided to give the rhinoceros as a gift to the [[Medici]] [[Pope Leo X]]. The King was keen to curry favour with the Pope, to maintain the papal grants of exclusive possession to the new lands that his naval forces had been exploring in the [[Far East]] since [[Vasco da Gama]] discovered the sea route to India around Africa in 1498. The previous year, the Pope had been very pleased with Manuel's gift of a [[white elephant (pachyderm)|white elephant]], also from India, which the Pope had named [[Hanno (elephant)|Hanno]]. Together with other precious gifts of silver plate and spices, the rhinoceros, with its new collar of green velvet decorated with flowers, embarked in December 1515 for the voyage from the [[Tagus]] to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel passed near [[Marseille]] in early 1516. King [[Francis I of France]] was returning from [[Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume]] in [[Provence]], and requested a viewing of the beast. The Portuguese vessel stopped briefly at an island off Marseilles,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Frioul archipelago]] consists of four main islands. Bedini, p.128, nominates either [[Pomègues]] or [[Ratonneau]]; the other possibilities are the small island of [[If (island)|If]], now occupied by the [[Château d'If]], or [[Tiboulain]].&lt;/ref&gt; where the rhinoceros disembarked to be beheld by the King on 24 January.

After resuming its journey, the ship was wrecked in a sudden storm as it passed through the narrows of [[Porto Venere]], north of [[La Spezia]] on the coast of [[Liguria]]. The rhinoceros, chained and shackled to the deck to keep it under control, was unable to swim to safety and drowned. The carcass of the rhinoceros was recovered near [[Villefranche-sur-Mer|Villefranche]], and its hide was returned to Lisbon, where it was [[taxidermy|stuffed]]. Some reports say that the mounted skin was sent to Rome, arriving in February 1516, to be exhibited ''impagliato'' (Italian for "stuffed with straw"), although such a feat would have challenged 16th-century methods of taxidermy, which were still primitive. If a stuffed rhinoceros did arrive in Rome, its fate remains unknown: it might have been removed to [[Florence]] by the Medici, or destroyed in the 1527 [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]]. In any event, there was not the popular sensation in Rome that the living beast had caused in Lisbon, although a rhinoceros was depicted in contemporary paintings in Rome by [[Giovanni da Udine]] and [[Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hyena"&gt;[http://www.bio.utexas.edu/faculty/jost/hyena.pdf Gessner's Hyena and the Telephone Game], Manda Clair Jost, 2002 (PDF, 21 pages).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dürer's woodcut==
[[Image:Durer drawing.png|thumb|Preparatory study for the rhinoceros print by [[Albrecht Dürer]], 1515 ([[British Museum]]: {{British-Museum-db|SL,5218.161|id=720573}}). The inscription bears an incorrect date (1513) for the arrival of the rhinoceros in Lisbon, which actually occurred in 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, caption to colour plate I, p.181.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Valentim Fernandes]], a [[Moravia]]n merchant and [[Printer (publisher)|printer]], saw the rhinoceros in Lisbon shortly after it arrived and described it in a newsletter sent to the [[Nuremberg]] community of merchants in June 1515. The original document in German has not survived, but a transcript in Italian is held in the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze|Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale]] in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.120 and fn.10.&lt;/ref&gt; A second letter of unknown authorship was sent from Lisbon to Nuremberg at around the same time, enclosing a sketch by an unknown artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/ciencia/e71.html Article] (pt) by Luís Tirapicos at [[Instituto Camões]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer – who was acquainted with the Portuguese community of the [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] at Antwerp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lach, Donald Frederick|title=Asia in the making of Europe: A century of wonder. The literary arts. The scholarly disciplines|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-46733-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; – saw the second letter and sketch in Nuremberg. He made a [[pen and ink]] drawing
&lt;ref&gt;One later acquired by Sir [[Hans Sloane]] and now held by the [[British Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPthhO4YU28 The Durer Rhinoceros - Masterpieces of the British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; and printed a reversed reflection of it.&lt;ref name="hyena"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The woodcut was, per Quammen, p.204, cut on the block by a specialist craftsman known as a ''Formschneider'', for Dürer's approval. This may well have been [[Hieronymus Andreae]], who Dürer was using on other projects at this time, especially those with inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German language|German]] inscription on the woodcut, drawing largely from Pliny's account,&lt;ref name="pliny"/&gt; reads:
{{cquote|On the first of May in the year 1513 AD [sic], the powerful King of Portugal, Manuel of Lisbon, brought such a living animal from India, called the rhinoceros. This is an accurate representation. It is the colour of a speckled tortoise,&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.121; some versions translate ''Krot'' as "[[toad]]", but ''Schildkrot'' most likely refers to a [[tortoise]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is almost entirely covered with thick scales. It is the size of an elephant but has shorter legs and is almost invulnerable. It has a strong pointed horn on the tip of its nose, which it sharpens on stones. It is the mortal enemy of the elephant. The elephant is afraid of the rhinoceros, for, when they meet, the rhinoceros charges with its head between its front legs and rips open the elephant's stomach, against which the elephant is unable to defend itself. The rhinoceros is so well-armed that the elephant cannot harm it. It is said that the rhinoceros is fast, impetuous and cunning.&lt;ref&gt;Rough translation of the German original.

[[Image:Indian Rhinoceros cropped mirrored.jpg|left|thumb|The folds of skin of an [[Indian Rhinoceros|Indian rhinoceros]] match up well to the plates of [[armour]] depicted by [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]].]]

Dürer's woodcut is not an accurate representation of a rhinoceros. He depicts an animal with hard plates that cover its body like sheets of [[armour]], with a [[gorget]] at the throat, a solid-looking [[breastplate]], and [[rivet]]s along the seams. He places a small twisted horn on its back, and gives it scaly legs and saw-like rear quarters. None of these features is present in a real rhinoceros.&lt;ref name=unicamp&gt;[http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~ghtc/rhino1-e.htm Group of History and Theory of Science – Dürer's Rhinoceros] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710211552/http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~ghtc/rhino1-e.htm |date=2006-07-10 }}, [[State University of Campinas]], [[Brazil]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kdpublish"&gt;[http://www.kdpublish.com/journal/archives/000117.php Dürer's Rhinoceros] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505112141/http://www.kdpublish.com/journal/archives/000117.php |date=2006-05-05 }}, Kallisti Digital Publishing, 7 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a [[suit of armour]] was forged for the rhinoceros's fight against the elephant in Portugal, and that these features depicted by Dürer are parts of the armour.&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by [[Glynis Ridley]] (2004), ''Clara's Grand Tour: Travels with a Rhinoceros in Eighteenth-century Europe'', Atlantic Monthly Press, {{ISBN|1-84354-010-X}}, a study of [[Clara the rhinoceros]]; however, there is no mention of this in Bedini.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Dürer's "armour" may represent the heavy folds of thick skin of an Indian rhinoceros, or, as with the other inaccuracies, may simply be misunderstandings or creative additions by Dürer.&lt;ref&gt;Dürer was living near the [[armourer]]'s quarter in Nuremberg, ''Schmeidegasse'', and was designing armour at about the same time; this aspect may therefore be a creative conceit. (Clarke, p.20.)&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer also draws a scaly texture over the body of the animal, including the "armour". This may be Dürer's attempt to reflect the rough and almost hairless hide of the Indian rhinoceros, which has wart-like bumps covering its upper legs and shoulders. On the other hand, his depiction of the texture may represent [[dermatitis]] induced by the rhinoceros' close confinement during the four-month journey by ship from India to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humi.keio.ac.jp/treasures/nature/Gesner-web/highlight/html/sai.html Commentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010122702/http://www.humi.keio.ac.jp/treasures/nature/Gesner-web/highlight/html/sai.html |date=2006-10-10 }} on a plate from [[Conrad Gessner]]'s ''Mammals'', folio 131 verso, from the Humanities Media Interaction Project, [[Keio University]], [[Japan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Burgkmair.png|thumb|Unique surviving impression of [[Hans Burgkmair]]'s 1515 woodcut copy, in the [[Graphische Sammlung Albertina]], [[Vienna]]]]

A second woodcut was executed by [[Hans Burgkmair]] in [[Augsburg]] around the same time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, but it is not clear whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal.&lt;ref name="Bedini121"&gt;Bedini, p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros;&lt;ref name="Bedini121"/&gt; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived,&lt;ref&gt;Held by the [[Albertina, Vienna|Graphische Sammlung Albertina]], Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first [[State (printmaking)|state]], which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading.&lt;ref name="lambe"/&gt; Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century.&lt;ref name="Clarke23"&gt;Clarke, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.&lt;ref name="lambe"/&gt;

The block passed into the hands of the Amsterdam printer and cartographer [[Willem Blaeu|Willem Janssen]] (also called Willem Blaeu amongst other names). By this time the block was very damaged; the border lines were chipped, there were numerous [[woodworm]] holes and a pronounced crack had developed through the rhino's legs.&lt;ref name="quammen206"&gt;Quammen, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt; Janssen decided to re-issue the block with the addition of a new tone block printed in a variety of colours, olive-green and dark green, as well as blue-grey.&lt;ref name = BMJ&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhinocerus (Rhinoceros)|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1342313&amp;partId=1&amp;people=92361&amp;peoA=92361-2-70&amp;view=list&amp;sortBy=objectTitleSort&amp;page=1|publisher=[[British Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Goldman&gt;Goldman p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting ''[[chiaroscuro woodcut]]'', which entirely omitted the text, was published after 1620.&lt;ref name="Clarke23"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impact2003.uct.ac.za/ric_an.html The Journeyman Artist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002005211/http://www.impact2003.uct.ac.za/ric_an.html |date=2006-10-02 }}, Richard Anderton, [[University of the West of England]], at the 3rd Impact International Printmaking Conference, [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an example in the British Museum.&lt;ref name = BMJ/&gt; This was the seventh of the eight editions in all of the print.&lt;ref name= Goldman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Editions/&gt;

[[Image:Nashorn.medici.jpg|thumb|left|Emblem of [[Alessandro de' Medici]], from [[Paolo Giovio]]'s ''Dialogo dell'impresse militari et amorosi''.]]
Despite its errors, the image remained very popular,&lt;ref name="kdpublish"/&gt; and was taken to be an accurate representation of a rhinoceros until the late 18th century. Dürer may have anticipated this and deliberately chosen to create a woodcut, rather than a more refined and detailed [[engraving]], as this was cheaper to produce and more copies could be printed.&lt;ref name="quammen206"/&gt;  Images derived from it were included in naturalist texts, including [[Sebastian Münster]]'s ''Cosmographiae'' (1544), [[Conrad Gessner]]'s ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae Animalium]]'' (1551), [[Edward Topsell]]'s ''Histoire of Foure-footed Beastes'' (1607) and many others. A rhinoceros that was clearly based on Dürer's woodcut was chosen by [[Alessandro de' Medici]] as his emblem in June 1536, with the motto "Non vuelvo sin vencer" (old Spanish for "I shall not return without victory").&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.192.&lt;/ref&gt; A sculpture of a rhinoceros based on Dürer's image was placed at the base of a 70-foot (21&amp;nbsp;m) high [[obelisk]] designed by [[Jean Goujon]] and erected in front of the Church of the Sepulchre in the [[rue Saint-Denis (Paris)|rue Saint-Denis]] in Paris in 1549 for the [[royal entry]] welcoming the arrival of the new King of France, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar rhinoceros, in [[relief]], decorates a panel in one of the bronze west doors of [[Pisa Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[:File:Durer's Rhinoceros on Cathedral Door, Pisa C17th.jpg]].&lt;/ref&gt; The rhinoceros was depicted in numerous other paintings and sculptures, and became a popular decoration for [[porcelain]]. The popularity of the inaccurate Dürer image remained undiminished despite an Indian rhinoceros spending eight years in Madrid from 1580 to 1588 (although a few examples of a print of the Madrid rhinoceros sketched by [[Philippe Galle]] in [[Antwerp]] in 1586, and derivative works, have survived), and the exhibition of a live rhinoceros in London a century later, from 1684–86, and of a second individual after 1739.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, chapter 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dalí.Rinoceronte.JPG|thumb|left|''Rinoceronte vestido con puntillas'' (1956) by [[Salvador Dalí]] in [[Puerto Banús]], Marbella, Spain.]]
The pre-eminent position of Dürer's image and its derivatives declined from the mid-to-late-18th century, when more live rhinoceroses were transported to Europe, shown to the curious public, and depicted in more accurate representations. [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] painted a life-size portrait of [[Clara the rhinoceros]] in 1749, and [[George Stubbs]] painted a large portrait of a rhinoceros in London around 1790. Both of these paintings were more accurate than Dürer's woodcut, and a more realistic conception of the rhinoceros gradually started to displace Dürer's image in the public imagination. In particular, Oudry's painting was the inspiration for a plate in [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]'s encyclopedic ''Histoire naturelle'', which was widely copied.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, [[James Bruce]]'s travelogue ''Travels to discover the source of the [[Nile]]'' dismissed Dürer's work as "wonderfully ill-executed in all its parts" and "the origin of all the monstrous forms under which that animal has been painted, ever since". Even so, Bruce's own illustration of the African [[White Rhinoceros|white rhinoceros]], which is noticeably different in appearance to the Indian rhinoceros, still shares conspicuous inaccuracies with Dürer's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alperson, Philip A|title=The Philosophy of the Visual Arts|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=0-19-505975-1|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics|Semiotician]] [[Umberto Eco]] argues (fetching the idea from E.H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, 1961) that Dürer's "scales and imbricated plates" became a necessary element of depicting the animal, even to those who might know better, because "they knew that only these conventionalized graphic signs could denote «rhinoceros» to the person interpreting the iconic sign." He also notes that the skin of a rhinoceros is rougher than it visually appears and that such plates and scales portray this non-visual information to a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eco, Umberto|title=Theory of Semiotics|year=1978|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253202178|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the late 1930s, Dürer's image appeared in school textbooks in Germany as a faithful image of the rhinoceros;&lt;ref name="Clarke20"/&gt; and it remains a powerful artistic influence. It was one of the inspirations for [[Salvador Dalí]]; a reproduction of the woodcut hung in his childhood home and he used the image in several of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20724/lot/24/|title=Salvador Dalí (Spanish, 1904–1989) ''Chair de poule rhinocérontique, ou Rhinocéros cosmique''|publisher=Bonhams|date=2013|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Los Streetscapers Public Art Studios''' is a [[muralist]] [[art collective]] and [[fine art]] studio based in [[East Los Angeles, California]]. Its members have executed over twenty murals and large-scale [[public art]]works, primarily in the [[Los Angeles]] area.

==History==
East Los Streetscapers grew out of the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano Mural Movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s,&lt;ref name="ELSHistory"&gt;{{cite web

It was founded by Wayne Alaniz Healy and David Rivas Botello in 1975.

Alaniz and Botello met in elementary school, and when in the third grade, collaborated on a mural. However, they lost touch when Botello's family moved to nearby [[City Terrace, California|City Terrace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | quote = Botello and Healy did their first mural together about dinosaurs in the third grade, but soon afterwards Botello's family moved a mile away to City Terrace from their East Los Angeles neighborhood. It wasn't until they were adults, and both were doing murals on their own, that they met again and decided to renew their collaboration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Botello co-founded Goez Art Studio, "the first" [[Chicano art]] studio,&lt;ref name="Goez"&gt;{{cite web

In 1973, he painted ''Dreams of Flight'', one of the early murals at [[Estrada Courts]].

In 1968, Healy earned Bachelor's degrees in [[aerospace engineering]] and [[mathematics]] from [[Cal Poly Pomona]]. He went on to earn a [[Master's degree|Master's]] in [[mechanical engineering]] from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1973. He began working with Mechicano Art Center in East Los Angeles, and in 1974, painted the mural ''Ghosts of the Barrio'' at the Los Angeles [[housing project]] Ramona Gardens. He has since earned a Master's of Fine Arts from [[California State University, Northridge]] and created numerous [[screen print]]s with [[Self-Help Graphics &amp; Art]].

In 1975 Healy and Botello teamed to form Los Dos Streetscapers. They were soon joined by other artists such as [[George Yepes]], Paul Botello, Rudy Calderon, Rich Raya, Ricardo Duffy, Charles Solares and Fabian Debora, which occasioned the renaming of the group to “East Los Streetscapers.”{{cref | Name change}} While collaborating artists have come and gone, Healy and Botello have remained the core of the group.

In 1990, Healy and Botello founded the Palmetto Gallery to provide exposure for younger artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | quote = In 1990 they founded the Palmetto Gallery, a work and exhibition space for younger artists as well as for themselves.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Los Streetscapers have also sponsored projects for [[barrio]] youth.

==Work==
The collective used [[acrylic paint]] as the primary [[Media (arts)|medium]] for their early murals, but later incorporated such media as hand-painted tiles, cast bronze, and porcelain-enameled steel. Murals outside of Los Angeles include projects in [[San Jose, California]], [[Santa Maria, California]], [[Houston, Texas]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[Bellingham, Washington]]. Their work is characterized as "multicultural, strong, dynamic, colorful, site specific, and compositionally dramatic in line and texture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12237">In [[mathematics]], '''equivariance''' is a form of [[symmetry]] for [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from one symmetric space to another. A function is said to be an '''equivariant map''' when its domain and codomain are [[group action|acted on]] by the same [[symmetry group]], and when the function [[commutative property|commutes]] with the action of the group. That is, applying a symmetry transformation and then computing the function produces the same result as computing the function and then applying the transformation.

Equivariant maps generalize the concept of [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]], functions whose value is unchanged by a symmetry transformation of their argument. The value of an equivariant map is often (imprecisely) called an invariant.

In [[statistical inference]], equivariance under statistical transformations of data is an important property of various estimation methods; see [[invariant estimator]] for details. In pure mathematics, equivariance is a central object of study in [[equivariant topology]] and its subtopics [[equivariant cohomology]] and [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]].

==Examples==
===Elementary geometry===
[[File:Triangle.Centroid.svg|thumb|upright=1.35px|The centroid of a triangle (where the three red segments meet) is equivariant under [[affine transformation]]s: the centroid of a transformed triangle is the same point as the transformation of the centroid of the triangle.]]
In the geometry of [[triangle]]s, the [[area]] and [[perimeter]] of a triangle are invariants: translating or rotating a triangle does not change its area or perimeter. However, [[triangle center]]s such as the [[centroid]], [[circumcenter]], [[incenter]] and [[orthocenter]] are not invariant, because moving a triangle will also cause its centers to move. Instead, these centers are equivariant: applying any Euclidean [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]] (a combination of a translation and rotation) to a triangle, and then constructing its center, produces the same point as constructing the center first, and then applying the same congruence to the center. More generally, all triangle centers are also equivariant under [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity transformations]] (combinations of translation, rotation, and scaling),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 67
 | year = 1994
 | doi=10.2307/2690608}}. "Similar triangles have similarly situated centers", p.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the centroid is equivariant under [[affine transformation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The centroid is the only affine equivariant center of a triangle, but more general convex bodies can have other affine equivariant centers; see e.g. {{citation
 | last = Neumann | first = B. H.
 | journal = Journal of the London Mathematical Society
 | mr = 0000978
 | pages = 262–272

 | volume = 14
 | year = 1939
 | doi = 10.1112/jlms/s1-14.4.262 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same function may be an invariant for one group of symmetries and equivariant for a different group of symmetries. For instance, under similarity transformations instead of congruences the area and perimeter are no longer invariant: scaling a triangle also changes its area and perimeter. However, these changes happen in a predictable way: if a triangle is scaled by a factor of {{mvar|s}}, the perimeter also scales by {{mvar|s}} and the area scales by {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In this way, the function mapping each triangle to its area or perimeter can be seen as equivariant for a multiplicative group action of the scaling transformations on the positive real numbers.

===Statistics===
Another class of simple examples comes from [[statistical estimation]]. The [[mean]] of a sample (a set of real numbers) is commonly used as a [[central tendency]] of the sample. It is equivariant under [[Linear function (calculus)|linear transformation]]s of the real numbers, so for instance it is unaffected by the choice of units used to represent the numbers. On the other hand, the [[median]] of the sample is equivariant for a much larger group of transformations, the (strictly) [[monotonic function]]s of the real numbers. This analysis indicates that the median is more [[robust statistics|robust]] against certain kinds of changes to a data set, and that (unlike the mean) it is meaningful for [[ordinal data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Measurement theory: Frequently asked questions (Version 3)|date=September 14, 1997|publisher=SAS Institute Inc.|url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/courses/EPIB654/Summer2010/EF/measurement%20scales.pdf|first=Warren S.|last=Sarle}}. Revision of a chapter in ''Disseminations of the International Statistical Applications Institute'' (4th ed.), vol.&amp;nbsp;1, 1995, Wichita: ACG Press, pp. 61–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of an [[invariant estimator]] and equivariant estimator have been used to formalize this style of analysis.

===Representation theory===
{{See also|Representation theory#Equivariant maps and isomorphisms}}

In the [[representation theory of finite groups]], a vector space equipped with a group that acts by linear transformations of the space is called a [[linear representation]] of the group.
A [[linear map]] that commutes with the action is called an '''intertwiner'''. That is, an intertwiner is just an equivariant linear map between two linear representations. Alternatively, an intertwiner for representations of a group {{mvar|G}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|K}} is the same thing as a [[module (mathematics)|module homomorphism]] of {{math|''K''[''G'']}}-[[module (mathematics)|modules]], where {{math|''K''[''G'']}} is the [[group ring]] of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under some conditions, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are both [[irreducible representation]]s, then an intertwiner (other than the [[zero map]]) only exists if the two representations are equivalent (that is, are [[isomorphic]] as [[module (mathematics)|modules]]). That intertwiner is then unique [[up to]] a multiplicative factor (a non-zero [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] from {{mvar|K}}). These properties hold when the image of {{math|''K''[''G'']}} is a simple algebra, with centre {{mvar|K}} (by what is called [[Schur's Lemma]]: see [[simple module]]). As a consequence, in important cases the construction of an intertwiner is enough to show the representations are effectively the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Formalization==
Equivariance can be formalized using the concept of a [[group action|{{mvar|G}}-set]] for a [[group (mathematics)|group]] {{mvar|G}}. This is a mathematical object consisting of a [[set (mathematics)|mathematical set]] {{mvar|S}} and a [[group action]] (on the left) of {{mvar|G}} on {{mvar|S}}.
If {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are both {{mvar|G}}-sets for the same group {{mvar|G}}, then a function {{math|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is said to be equivariant if
:{{math|1=''f''(''g''&amp;middot;''x'') = ''g''&amp;middot;''f''(''x'')}}
for all {{math|''g'' ∈ ''G''}} and all {{math|''x'' in ''X''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nominal Sets: Names and Symmetry in Computer Science|volume=57|series=Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science|first=Andrew M.|last=Pitts|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=9781107244689|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVehscCSPh8C&amp;pg=PA14|at=Definition 1.2, p.&amp;nbsp;14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If one or both of the actions are right actions the equivariance condition may be suitably modified:
:{{math|1=''f''(''x''&amp;middot;''g'') = ''f''(''x'')&amp;middot;''g''}}; (right-right)
:{{math|1=''f''(''x''&amp;middot;''g'') = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;''f''(''x'')}}; (right-left)
:{{math|1=''f''(''g''&amp;middot;''x'') = ''f''(''x'')&amp;middot;''g''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}; (left-right)

Equivariant maps are [[homomorphism]]s in the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of ''G''-sets (for a fixed ''G'').&lt;ref name="grm"&gt;{{citation|title=Groups, Rings, Modules|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first1=Maurice|last1=Auslander|first2=David|last2=Buchsbaum|publisher=Dover Publications|year=2014|isbn=9780486490823|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VW2TAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86|pages=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence they are also known as '''''G''-morphisms''',&lt;ref name="grm"/&gt; '''''G''-maps''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The equivariance condition can also be understood as the following [[commutative diagram]].  Note that &lt;math&gt;g\cdot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the map that takes an element &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and returns &lt;math&gt;g\cdot z&lt;/math&gt;.

{{See also|Representation theory#Generalizations|Category of representations#Category-theoretic definition}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Equivariant maps can be generalized to arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|categories]] in a straightforward manner. Every group ''G'' can be viewed as a category with a single object ([[morphism]]s in this category are just the elements of ''G''). Given an arbitrary category ''C'', a ''representation'' of ''G'' in the category ''C'' is a [[functor]] from ''G'' to ''C''. Such a functor selects an object of ''C'' and a [[subgroup]] of [[automorphism]]s of that object. For example, a ''G''-set is equivalent to a functor from ''G'' to the [[category of sets]], '''Set''', and a linear representation is equivalent to a functor to the [[category of vector spaces]] over a field, '''Vect'''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Given two representations, ρ and σ, of ''G'' in ''C'', an equivariant map between those representations is simply a [[natural transformation]] from ρ to σ. Using natural transformations as morphisms, one can form the category of all representations of ''G'' in ''C''. This is just the [[functor category]] ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt;.

For another example, take ''C'' = '''Top''', the [[category of topological spaces]]. A representation of ''G'' in '''Top''' is a [[topological space]] on which ''G'' acts [[continuous function|continuously]]. An equivariant map is then a continuous map ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' between representations which commutes with the action of ''G''.

[[File:BadElster Schandfleck4549.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bad Elster]], [[Saxony]], [[Germany]] in April 2008. Wettiner Hof Hotel is awaiting renovation- locally it is known as the Schandfleck (the Eyesore).]]
An '''eyesore''' is something that is largely considered to look unpleasant or ugly. Its technical usage is as an alternative perspective to the notion of [[landmark]]. Common examples include [[dilapidation|dilapidated]] [[buildings]], [[graffiti]], [[litter]], [[pollution|polluted areas]], and excessive commercial [[signage]] such as [[billboards]]. Some eyesores may be a matter of opinion such as controversial [[modern architecture]] (see also [[spite house]]), [[transmission tower]]s or [[wind turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jun/25/uk.renewableenergy|title=Homeowners get green light for 'eyesore' wind turbines|author=Nick Mathiason|date=June 25, 2006|publisher=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6763067.stm|title=Eyesore or gem: Gateshead car park |publisher=BBC|date= 18 June 2007 | first=Building | last=Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural eyesores include [[feces]], [[mud]] and [[weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BL4Xrx-IFowC|page=255|title=Professional Planting Design|author=Scott C. Scarfone | isbn=978-0-471-76139-6 | year=2007 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on property values==
In the USA, the [[National Association of Realtors]] says an eyesore can shave about 10% off the value of a nearby listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dealing with an eyesore next door |url=http://realestate.msn.com/Selling/Article_mw.aspx?cp-documentid=5249535 |author=Rachel Koning Beals |accessdate=2008-03-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312214811/http://realestate.msn.com/Selling/Article_mw.aspx?cp-documentid=5249535 |archivedate=2008-03-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remediation==

Clean-up programmes to improve or remove eyesores are often started by local bodies or even national governments. These are frequently called ''Operation Eyesore''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=February 9, 1972|title=British Start 'Operation Eyesore' Cleanup}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High-profile international events such as the [[Olympic Games]] usually trigger such activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=New York Times|title=Russians Paint and Fuss As Olympic Games Near Putting Best Face on Things A Gleaming Soviet Capital Emigrate or Face Arrest|date=June 28, 1980|author=Craig R. Whitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others contend that it is best to nip such problems in the bud by addressing them while they are small, since signs of neglect encourage [[anti-social behaviour]] such as [[vandalism]] and [[fly-tipping]]. This strategy is known as ''[[Fixing Broken Windows|fixing broken windows]]''.

==Controversy==

Whether some constructions are eyesores is a matter of opinion which may change over time. [[Landmark]]s are often called eyesores.

===Examples of divided opinion===
[[File:Federation Square (SBS Building).jpg|thumb|right|[[Federation Square]] has divided opinion in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=Fed/&gt;]]
* [[Eiffel Tower]] – Upon its construction, Parisians wanted it torn down as an eyesore. Nowadays it is one of the world's top landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|

* [[Golden Gate Bridge]] was controversial ahead of its construction, it being said in ''[[The Wasp (magazine)|The Wasp]]'' that it "would prove an eye-sore to those now living  ... certainly mar if not utterly destroy the natural charm of the harbor famed throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3WWvdOUcFEC&amp;pg=PA278|page=278|title=Great American Bridges and Dams|author=Donald C.

* [[One Rincon Hill]] – Situated just south of [[San Francisco]]'s [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]], this high-rise condominium surrounded by shorter buildings has generated some mixed reviews.
* [[Lloyd's building]] – Situated in the [[City of London]], this building was described as an [[oil refinery]] when it was opened in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.inlondonguide.co.uk/london-buildings/city/81-lloyds-building-insurance.html|title=The Lloyd's Building|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for having most of its facilities, stairways and [[Air Conditioning|AC]] on the outside. Some people still say this, although the building has become more popular and liked in the recent years.
* [[Tour Montparnasse]] - lone skyscraper in the [[Montparnasse]] area of [[Paris]], [[France]]. Its appearance mars the Paris urban landscape, and construction of skyscrapers have been banned in the city two years after its completion. A 2008 poll of editors on [[Virtualtourist]] voted the building the second ugliest building in the world. It is sometimes said that the view from the top is the most beautiful in Paris, because it is the only place from which the tower itself cannot be seen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">The '''Forum AID Award''' is a [[Scandinavia|Nordic]] architecture and design award, given annually by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] magazine Forum AID. AID is an acronym for the three subject-matters of the magazine - Architecture, Interior design and Design - and it is also the three categories of the award. It is given to the designers of the "Best Building [interior design and design in the Nordic Countries" that year. The award was founded in 2004 and is presented at a ceremony in [[Stockholm]]

The selection process is carried out in two stages. Each Nordic country is represented through its selection committee. The task of the committees is to select the best objects in their respective countries or by their countrymen abroad. The committees choose freely from those objects that had been carried out during the period October 1, to September 30, the year before. The winner is chosen by an international jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.forumaid.com/eng/news/|title=News|publisher=Forum AID|accessdate=2009-05-09}}{{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Friendship Archway''''' is a gate installed at [[Chinatown (Washington, D.C.)|Chinatown]], [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.

==History==
[[File:Chinatown, Washington, United States (Unsplash W NJEJY1maI).jpg|thumb|right|Detail, 2016]]

In 1986, the city dedicated the traditional Chinese gate designed by Alfred H. Liu, a local architect and chairman of the Chinatown Development Corporation, who emigrated from [[Taiwan]] to the United States as a teenager. The colorful, US$1 million work of [[public art]] includes seven roofs up to 60 feet high, 7000 tiles, and 272 painted dragons in the style of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. Erected to celebrate friendship with Washington's [[sister city]] of [[Beijing]], it was hoped the arch would reinforce the neighborhood's Chinese character. According to the plaque next to the arch, it is the largest such single-span archway in the world. In 1993, the Friendship Archway underwent a major renovation funded by D.C. and Chinese governments. [[Artisan]]s from China performed extensive repairs on the archway and repainted its decorations.&lt;ref name=friendshiparchway&gt;{{cite web | author=DeFerrari, John| url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/9183/chinatowns-friendship-archway/ | title=Chinatown's Friendship Archway|publisher= Greatergreaterwashington.org| date=February 9, 2011| accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geodesign includes project conceptualization, analysis, design specification, stakeholder participation and collaboration, design creation, simulation, and evaluation (among other stages). 

==History==
Geodesign builds greatly on a long history of work in [[geographic information science]], [[computer-aided design]], [[landscape architecture]], and other [[environmental design]] fields. See for instance, the work of [[Ian McHarg]] and [[Carl Steinitz]].  

Members of the various disciplines and practices relevant to geodesign have held defining discussions at a workshop on [http://ncgia.ucsb.edu/projects/scdg/ Spatial Concepts in GIS and Design] in December 2008 and the [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/ GeoDesign Summit] in January 2010. GeoDesign Summit 2010 Conference Videos from [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/videos/day-one.html Day 1] and [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/videos/day-two.html Day 2] are an important resource to learn about the many different aspects of GeoDesign.  ESRI co-founder Jack Dangermond has introduced each of the GeoDesign Summit meetings.  Designer and technologist [[Bran Ferren]], was the keynote speaker for the first and fourth Summit meetings in Redlands, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2013/02/08/a-250-year-plan-for-the-planet/|title=A 250-Year Plan for the Planet {{!}} Esri Insider|website=blogs.esri.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fourth conference he presented a provocative view of how what is needed is a 250-year plan, and how GeoDesign was a key concept in making this a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Five Minutes into the Future: An Argument for Taking a Longer View|url=https://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=2119&amp;title=five-minutes-into-the-future-an-argument-for-taking-a-longer-view|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Steinitz was a presenter at both the 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=esri|title=GeoDesign Summit 2010: Carl Steinitz: Ways of Designing (Part 4 of 4)|date=2010-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HmYxTzPnLY|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Esri Events|title=Esri 2015 Geodesign Summit: Experiments in Geodesign Synthesis|date=2017-12-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czIeEJoEvuo|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summits.

The 2013 Geodesign Summit drew a record 260 attendees from the United States and abroad ([http://video.esri.com watch video coverage of the summit]). That same year, a master's degree in Geodesign — the first of its kind in the nation — began at [[Philadelphia University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/news/arcwatch/0113/educating-the-next-generation-in-geodesign.html Goldberg, Debbie. Educating the Next Generation in Geodesign ''ArcWatch'', january 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Goetz Phillips, director of Landscape Architecture and GeoDesign at [[Philadelphia University]] says "it is very exciting to be at the forefront of this exciting and relevant paradigm shift in how we address twenty-first-century global to local design and planning issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0313/geodesign-in-motion Wheeler, Carla. Geodesign in Motion ' 'ArcWatch'', march 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The theory underpinning Geodesign derives from the work of [[Patrick Geddes]] in the first half of the twentieth century and [[Ian McHarg]] in its second half. They advocated a layered approach to regional planning, landscape planning and urban planning. McHarg drew the layers on translucent overlays. Through the work of [[Jack Dangermond]], Carl Steinitz, Henk Scholten and others the layers were modeled with  [[Geographical Information Systems]] (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;''Landscape Planning and Environmental Impact Design'', (UCL Press London 1998). {{ISBN|1-85728-321-X}} p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The three components of this term each say something about its character. 'Geographical' implies that the layers are geographical (geology, soils, hydrology, roads, land use etc.). 'Information' implies  a positivist and scientific methodology. 'System' implies the use of computer technology for the information processing.&lt;ref&gt;''Landscape Planning and Environmental Impact Design'', (UCL Press London 1998). {{ISBN|1-85728-321-X}} p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
The scientific aspects of Geodesign contrast with the cultural emphasis of [[Landscape urbanism|Landscape Urbanism]] but the two approaches to landscape planning share a concern for layered analysis &lt;ref&gt;Pe, R. (2012) Hyper-localism and Parametric Mapping for Collaborative Urbanism. ''Digital Landscape Architecture conference, 31 May 2012''&lt;/ref&gt; which sits comfortably with [[postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[post-postmodernism|post-postmodern]] theory.

==Technologies==
Nascent geodesign technology extends [[geographic information systems]] so that in addition to analyzing existing environments and [[geodata]], users can synthesize new environments and modify geodata.  See, for example, [[CommunityViz]] or [[marinemap]].

"GeoDesign brings geographic analysis into the design process, where initial design sketches are instantly vetted for suitability against myriad database layers describing a variety of physical and social factors for the spatial extent of the project. This on-the-fly suitability analysis provides a framework for design, giving land-use planners, engineers, transportation planners, and others involved with design, the tools to leverage geographic information within their design workflows."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/summer09articles/gis-designing-our-future.html Dangermond, Jack. GIS: Designing Our Future ''ArcNews'', summer 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregg Bordowitz''' (born August 14, 1964) is a writer, artist and activist currently working as a professor in the Video, New Media, and Animation department at [[The School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].

==Biography==
Gregg Bordowitz was born August 14, 1964 in [[Brooklyn]], NY. In 1982, Bordowitz began his academic career at the [[School of Visual Arts]], then studied at the [[Whitney Museum]] Independent Study Program from 1985 to 1986, and at [[New York University]] from 1986 to 1987. In 1987, Bordowitz dropped out of school to become a full-time video artist, guerilla TV director and activist with the direct action advocacy group [[ACT UP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greggbordowitz.com/docs/Bordowitz_CV_2012.pdf|title=Gregg Bordowitz's online ''Curriculum vitae''|publisher=Greggbordowitz.com|accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, Bordowitz was central to the formation of the notable video activist collective, Testing the Limits, who produced work documenting AIDS activism that were distributed through television, museums, schools and community centers. He also wrote prolifically on the topic of AIDS activism, contributing heavily to the 1987 "AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism" of the well-respected academic journal [[October (journal)|October]]. In 1988, Gregg Bordowitz tested positive for [[HIV]] and, as a result, came out as a [[homosexual]] man  to his mother and stepfather. He left Testing the Limits (now a self-sufficient non-profit entity) to focus on a more 'guerilla' approach to documenting AIDS activism. In 1988, he met video artist [[Jean Carlomusto]] at a demonstration partnered with her to produce the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC) cable TV show ''Living With AIDS'', which ran regularly until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actupny.org/diva/Archive.html |title=A Report on the Archiving of Film and Video Work by Makers with AIDS |publisher=Actupny.org |date=1986-06-30 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he, along with numerous other video activists, formed [[Like a Prayer (documentary)|DIVA]] (Damned Interfering Video Activists), a partner organization to ACT UP, dedicated to accurately documenting the protests organized by ACT UP and providing an alternative representation of the AIDS activist movement than the one presented by the [[Media portrayal of HIV/AIDS#United States|mainstream media]].

In 1993, filled with despair at the decline of AIDS activism as well as his own diminishing chances of survival, Bordowitz produces one of his most famous pieces, the documentary/montage ''Fast Trip, Long Drop''. In this video, Bordowitz addresses the public's reaction to and representation of the [[AIDS epidemic]] as well as his own fears, insecurities and struggles related to the disease. ''Fast Trip, Long Drop'' provides a pessimistic counterpoint to the flood of representations of people "Surviving and Thriving" with AIDS through a collage of documentary footage, staged parody and vintage film clips. For the first time in an AIDS related documentary, people with AIDS were shown addressing and coming to terms with the ever-present fact of their own mortality. As Bordowitz explains in his 1999 interview with the AIDS art forum Artery, "When I made "Fast Trip, Long Drop" I was tired of pretending for the sake of others that I would survive. I became preoccupied with the burdens that sick people bear on behalf of those around them who are well. I wanted to get a handle on despair and put it out there as a political problem. To be recognized and discussed. If we couldn't do this, then it all seemed like bullshit. I wanted an honest media produced in the interests of people living with AIDS." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertatkins.net/beta/witness/artists/moves/bordowitz.html |title=Robert Atkins.Net |publisher=Robert Atkins.Net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, along with many of his other works, has been shown in film festivals, museums and on television ever since with extremely positive response.

From there, Bordowitz continued to address AIDS in his artwork, video work and writing. He taught video art at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]], [[Brown University]], and [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] from 1995 to 2010, before being hired as a permanent professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His works have been shown at [[the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], [[the Whitney Museum of American Art]], and [[the Museum of Modern Art]], as well as numerous film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter |first=Rebecca A. |url=http://www.fnewsmagazine.com/2002-april/aprilregulars5.html |title=Faculty Profile: Gregg Bordowitz |publisher=Fnewsmagazine.com |date=2002-07-07 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A History of Sexuality Volume One by Michel Foucault: An Opera==
In 2009, Gregg Bordowitz began collaboration with artist Paul Chan an opera adaptation of [[Michel Foucault]]’s [[History of Sexuality]]. Though they envisioned the project as an impossible to complete, they were approached by Viennese museum curator Achim Hochdörfer, and asked to stage a performance at the [[MUMOK]]. In 2010, they staged a 6-man performance written and directed by Bordowitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artforum.com/words/id=26517 |title=Gregg Bordowitz |publisher=Artforum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greggbordowitz.com/projects.html |title=Projects |publisher=Greggbordowitz.com |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haeckelites''' are three-fold coordinated networks of carbon atoms generated by a periodic arrangement of pentagons, hexagons and heptagons. They were first proposed by Humberto and Mauricio Terrones and their colleagues in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= New Metallic Allotropes of Planar and Tubular Carbon|year=2000 |journal= Physical Review Letters |volume=84|issue=8|pages=1716–1719 |doi=10.1103/physrevlett.84.1716|display-authors=etal |pmid=11017608|author1=Terrones |first1=H |last2=Terrones |first2=M |last3=Hernandez |first3=E |last4=Grobert |first4=N |last5=Charlier |first5=J. C. |last6=Ajayan |first6=P. M. |bibcode=2000PhRvL..84.1716T }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were named in honour of [[Ernst Haeckel]], whose diagrams of [[radiolaria]] contained similar structural features. They have not yet been synthesised in the laboratory, but have been the subject of a considerable amount of theoretical work.

In [[particle physics]], the '''Higgs sector''' is the collection of [[quantum field]]s and/or [[particle]]s that are responsible for the [[Higgs mechanism]], i.e. for the [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] of the [[Higgs field]]. The word "sector" refers to a subgroup of the total set of fields and particles.&lt;ref name=GunionEtAl&gt;{{cite book

'''''Jarhead''''' is a 2003 [[Gulf War]] [[memoir]] by author and former [[U.S. Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Anthony Swofford]]. After leaving military service, the author went on to college and earned a master's degree in Fine Arts at the [[University of Iowa]].

==Plot==
''Jarhead'' recounts Swofford's enlistment and service in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Persian Gulf War]], in which he served as a [[Scout Sniper]] with the [[STA Sniper (USMC)|Surveillance and Target Acquisition]] (STA) Platoon of [[2nd Battalion, 7th Marines]].

Like most of the troops stationed in the Middle East during the Gulf War, Swofford saw very little actual combat. Swofford's narrative focuses on the physical, mental and emotional struggles of the young Marines.&lt;ref&gt;Kakutani, Michiko (2003-02-19). [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/19/books/books-of-the-times-a-warrior-haunted-by-ghosts-of-battle.html "BOOKS OF THE TIMES; A Warrior Haunted By Ghosts Of Battle."]  ''NYTimes.com''.  The New York Times.  Retrieved 2017-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Through_line|through lines]] of his first-person account involves the challenge of balancing the art and science and mind-set of the warrior with one's own basic sense of humanity. Swofford admits to a sense of disappointment, frustration and emptiness that comes in the wake of ultimately being cheated of any real combat experience by a war that, for many American Marines at least, has ended all too quickly after enduring many months of grinding, anticlimactic suspense. And yet there have been the numerous encounters with poignant, eerie tableaux of dead Iraqi soldiers who'd been killed so quickly where they sat so as to appear to have been deliberately posed, like store-display mannequins, in their final moments of life.

== Film adaptations ==
The novel was adapted into a [[Jarhead (film)|2005 feature film]] starring [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Jamie Foxx]], and [[Peter Sarsgaard]]. The [[screenplay]] was written by [[William Broyles Jr.]] and directed by [[Sam Mendes]]. Reviews were generally positive. ''[[Jarhead 2: Field of Fire]]'' is the sequel to the 2005 film, followed by ''[[Jarhead 3: The Siege]]''.

'''Jean-Christophe Heyland''' aka '''Jean-Christophe Kumpfler''' (1791 [[Frankfurt]] – 29 August 1866 [[Genoa]]), was a Swiss engraver, watercolourist, and illustrator, who produced the plates for many botanical works such as the 1825-27 ''Plantes Rares du Jardin de Geneve'' by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SIKART|4029000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Geneva from 1803, and produced all illustrations for botanical memoirs published by Geneva botanists after 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Memoires, Volume 5 of "Société de physique et d'histoire naturelle de Genève" - Imprimerie A. L. Vignier, Rue de Rhone, Maison de la Poste, 1832&lt;/ref&gt; He also illustrated the work of [[Benjamin Delessert]], [[Philip Barker-Webb]], [[Giuseppe Giacinto Moris]], [[Pierre Edmond Boissier]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antiquariaatjunk.com/item.php?item=2152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Baptised Jean-Christophe Kumpfler, he went to Geneva in his youth as an apprentice hairdresser to an uncle named Heyland, whose surname he subsequently adopted. He showed a keen interest in the graphic arts, and employed his leisure time in studying drawing and engraving. After spending a few years in London, where he was a designer of costumes for the theatre, he returned and settled in Geneva.

[[José Mariano Mociño]] and [[Martín de Sessé]] worked on a ''Flora Mexicana'' and after de Sessé's death in 1808, Mociño met de Candolle in  
1816 in [[Montpellier]] and showed him the drawings they had produced for the planned work. De Candolle requested that the plates be copied by artists of the Geneva community.&lt;ref&gt;"Frontier Naturalist - Jean Louis Berlandier and the Exploration of Northern Mexico and Texas" - Russell M. Lawson&lt;/ref&gt; Of these copied plates, the sixteen done by Heyland caught de Candolle's eye. Guided by de Candolle he became one of the leading botanical artists of the period, working for him for 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pirages.com/pages/books/ST12198/augustin-pyramus-de-candolle/plantes-rares-du-jardin-de-geneve&lt;/ref&gt; One of his students was [[Jean-Louis Berlandier]] who also showed great aptitude in his botanical illustrations.

Becoming a citizen of Geneva in 1819, Heyland was admitted to the Society of Arts and the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences. The [[Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria|Archduke Reynier]], Viceroy of Lombardy, commissioned him in 1849 to work at the botanical garden in [[Monza]]. In 1859 he returned to Geneva, where he lived on the proceeds from the lessons he gave in drawing.

From 1835 he worked as principal artist on [[Charles Antoine Lemaire]]'s ''Jardin Fleuriste''. He drew and engraved 5 full-page illustrations, including ''[[Impatiens parviflora]]'' for de Candolle's ''Quatrieme Notice sur Les Plantes Rares''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/author/jean-louis-prevost/page-2/&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1839 and 1846 he produced the illustrations for volumes 4-5 of [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/535#/details ''Icones selectae plantarum''], another of de Candolle's projects in collaboration with Benjamin Delessert (1773-1847). He carried out several commissions for the Geneva Botanical Garden, and directed the engraving and printing in colour of the 180 plates used for 'Voyage botanique en Espagne'.

In his old age he suffered from trembling hands and failing eyesight, but retained his good humour to the end. His final contribution to botanical art was the 122 plates he produced for Pierre Edmond Boissier's 1866 work, "Icones Euphorbiarum". 
 
Augustin Pyramus de Candolle created the genus ''Heylandia'' in 1825 in his honour, a genus which is now included in ''[[Crotalaria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Crotalaria in Africa and Madagascar" - R. M. Polhill (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyland died on 29 August 1866 at a village near Genoa during a trip in Italy. He had married a girl from Milan and had a son.&lt;ref&gt;https://doc.rero.ch/record/11923/files/gf_584_1_partie2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/SchweizerKuenstlerLexikonBd2/SchweizerKuenstlerLexikonBd2_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, Boissier &amp; Reuter named an [[iris (plant)|Iris]] after him ''[[Iris heylandiana]]'' in the [[Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society]] (J. Linn. Soc. Bot.) Vol.16 on page 142.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bob |last=Pries |date=30 July 2016 |title=(SPEC) Iris heylandiana Boiss. &amp; Reut. |url=http://wiki.irises.org/bin/view/Spec/SpecHeylandiana |publisher=wiki.irises.org |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jim Supangkat''' is an Indonesian sculptor, [[art criticism|art critic]] and curator.&lt;ref name="jpf"&gt;Japan Foundation, [http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/culture/new/0507/jim.html biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Supangkat was born on May 2, 1948 in [[Makassar]]. He studied at the faculty of fine arts and Design of the [[Bandung Institute of Technology|Institute of Technology]] in [[Bandung]]. One of his teachers in this time was [[Dick Hartoko]] who taught him on [[Aesthetics]]. Directly after he graduated in 1975, he started to work as a sculptor. The same year, he was one of the founders of Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru (''New Art Movement'').&lt;ref name="jpf" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ensiklopedi Jakarta, [http://www.jakarta.go.id/web/encyclopedia/detail/1271/Jim-Supangkat biography] {{id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artatak, [http://www.artatak.net/eng/projects_gerakan_seni_rupa_baru_lecture.htm ''GSRB and the development of contemporary art in Indonesia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighties he grew to be an art critic and independent curator of exhibitions of work of other Indonesian artists. Since the nineties this has become his full-time profession. Besides, he has been an active promoter of Indonesian contemporary fine arts and initiated art-theoretical debate on Southeast Asian forums.&lt;ref name="jpf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/361 profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote several books and essays that put Indonesian art internationally on the map. For his contributions to Indonesian art he was honored with a [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]] from the [[Netherlands]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="PCF" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">'''John Dooley Reigh''' (1851 – 25 February 1914) was an Irish [[cartoonist]] whose work generally supported [[Irish nationalism]]. He first emerged as an artist in his native [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;Theo Snoddy, ''Dictionary of Irish Artists: 20th Century'', Merlin Publishing, 2002, p. 422-423&lt;/ref&gt; His cartoons were usually signed '''J.D. Reigh'''.&lt;ref&gt;John Dooley Reigh, artist, in the ''1911 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reigh's work coincided with and celebrated the success of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. Reigh's drawings were published in weekly magazines such as ''Zoz'', ''United Ireland'' and [[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|''The Nation'']], and were also sold individually as [[Printmaking|prints]].

His own success rested on his ability to render news in a simple format to a receptive public. Using [[chromolithography]] allowed colour to be added, making his works more attractive and seen by buyers as modern products. Many of his works, particularly about the [[1798 rebellion]], are still reprinted as if they were drawn contemporaneously with the subject matter. Some of these are his versions of older paintings.

Many of Reigh's prints can be seen at the [[National Library of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nli.ie/en/udlist/prints-and-drawings-collections.aspx?article=51747cf5-ae82-46eb-987a-5f8ce250045b NLI webpages section on cartoons; accessed Dec 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to England, living in London and [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;''1901 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Manchester in 1914.

[[File:Johnjoyce.jpg|right|200px]]
'''John Stanislaus Joyce''' (4 July 1849 &amp;ndash; 29 December 1931) was the father of writer [[James Joyce]], and a well known [[Dublin]] man about town.  The son of James and Ellen (''née'' O'Connell) Joyce, John Joyce grew up in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], where his mother's family, which claimed kinship to "Liberator" [[Daniel O'Connell]], was quite prominent.

John Joyce attended St Colman’s College, Fermoy, from 1859 and later studied medicine at The Queen’s College, Cork, from 1867. However, he did not complete his university studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=John Stanislaus Joyce: The Voluminous Life and Genius of James Joyce's Father|last=Jackson|first=John Wyse|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2008|isbn=1-85702-417-6|location=UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his father's death in 1866, John Joyce inherited substantial property around Cork, but soon after he moved to Dublin, where he worked for several years as secretary at a distillery company.   He was also noted as a fine tenor singer, although he never pursued a musical career. On 5 May 1879, Joyce married Mary "May" Murray.  The next year, because of his work supporting [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidates in the [[United Kingdom general elections|General Election]] of [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880]], Joyce was given a post in the [[Dublin Custom House]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J.W. and P. Costello (1998) ''John Stanislaus Joyce: The Voluminous Life and Genius of James Joyce's Father'', Fourth Estate Ltd, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1882, his son [[James Joyce|James]] was born, the first of ten surviving children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ellmann|Ellmann, Richard]], (1959) ''[[James Joyce (biography)|James Joyce]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], revised edition 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  From eldest to youngest, names and ages given according to the 1901 census (see link below): James Augustine (aged 19 in 1901), Margaret Alice (17), [[Stanislaus Joyce|John Stanislaus]] (16), Chales [sic] Patrick (14), George Alfred (13), Eileen (12), May Kathleen (11), Eva May (10), Florence (9) and Mabel (8). Over the next ten years, Joyce gradually ran through his property.  A supporter of [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]], Joyce was crushed by what he saw as Parnell's betrayal and death following the revelation of his adultery with [[Kitty O'Shea]].  He remained a committed Parnellite and benefited from the patronage of political colleagues in later life when he had few other sources of income.&lt;ref&gt;Fintan Lane, ‘The Parnellite connection: Daniel John Hishon and the Joyces’, James Joyce Quarterly, vol. 37, no. 1 (1999), pp 225–8.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Parnell's death in 1891, Joyce had spent most of his inheritance and had been pensioned from his post at the custom house.  A spendthrift, he proved barely able to live on the small pension that was left to him, and spent much of his time drinking. His wife died in 1903, but despite his poor management of the household, he managed to outlive her by 28 years.  He died at the age of 82, which was rather advanced given the circumstances.

Of all his children, Joyce got along well only with his eldest, James, who enjoyed his father's company and shared in some of his traits, including his musical talent and his inability with money.  John Joyce inspired several characters in his son's works, such as [[Simon Dedalus]] in ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' and ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker in ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', and the narrator's uncle in the stories "The Sisters" and "Araby" in ''[[Dubliners]]''.

Land art includes everything from constructing a road, to taking a walk, building a monument, and leaving a mark in the sand. The program seeks to expand upon connections between typically separate fields. Each fall we spend two months camping while traveling 7,000 miles to engage sites that range from the [[CLUI]] complex at Wendover, Utah to the [[Mata Ortiz pottery|pottery culture at Mata Ortiz]], Mexico, from earth works like Robert Smithson's [[Spiral Jetty]] to archeological sites like [[Chaco Canyon]]. We learn from the fact that [[Donald Judd]] surrounded himself with both contemporary sculpture and [[Navajo people|Navajo rugs]]; that [[Chaco Canyon]] and [[Roden Crater]] function as celestial instruments; and that the [[Very Large Array]] is a scientific research center with a powerful aesthetic presence on the land. We spend the semester living and working in the landscape with guest scholars that expand the range of our definition in disciplines including archeology, art history, architecture, ceramics, criticism, writing, design, and studio art. The immersive nature of how we experience the landscape triggers an amalgamated body of inquiry where students have the opportunity of time and space to develop authority in their work through direct action and reflection. Land Arts hinges on the primacy of first person experience and the realization that human-land relationships are rarely singular.

Land Arts of the American West started at the [[University of New Mexico]] by artist [[Bill Gilbert (artist)|Bill Gilbert]] in 2000 and developed as a collaboration between Gilbert and architect [[Chris Taylor (architect/educator)|Chris Taylor]] since 2001. From 2002-2008 Land Arts was co-sponsored by the University of New Mexico and the [[University of Texas at Austin]] where Taylor taught in the interdisciplinary design program of the Department of Art and Art History. In 2007 Taylor was invited by [http://www.incubo.cl Incubo] to bring together a group of students and professionals from Chile and the United States for a [http://earthworkslab.org/atacama_lab/3_conference.html symposium] in Santiago and a Land Arts [http://earthworkslab.org/atacama_lab/4_schedule.html exploration] of the Atacama Desert. In 2008 Taylor began teaching in the College of Architecture at [[Texas Tech University]] where Land Arts continues to develop in addition to the programming at the University of New Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1052">The '''Leonardo da Vinci Award''' was established in 1975 by the [[Rotary Club]] of [[Florence]] as an annual international prize named after [[Leonardo da Vinci]], to be presented to young people involved in the study of the sciences, technology, literature and the arts. Among the disciplines recognised and rewarded so far have been [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[geology]], [[architecture]], [[medicine]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The 21st Leonardo da Vinci Prize was recently presented to the brilliant young pianist Johan Schmidt. The prize giving event has been hosted by other European Rotary Clubs in cities such as [[Tours]], [[Vienna]], [[Athens]], [[Madrid]], [[Würzburg]], [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]].  This event was last held in [[London]] in 1987, when the prize was awarded to the internationally recognised percussionist [[Evelyn Glennie]]. In 1996 1/2 the Rotary Club of London will again be responsible for hosting the prize-giving ceremony.

==Reviews==
'''Giampietro Balia''' wrote in the [[Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival]] catalogue:&lt;ref&gt;[http://blacknightsfilmfestival.com/eng/films/249222/ ''Festival site''] Poff.&lt;/ref&gt; " A stifling symphony of defeat for human kind as a whole, "Lines" is a necessary film in times in which numbers and ideological yarns dominate the political agenda, much to the disadvantage of the millions of individuals ensnared in a system that has proven to be frail and unreliable." Also in the same festival's '''official page''' is written : "Director Vasilis Mazomenos offers a uncompromisingly bleak, ghastly and haunting view of modern Greece in "Lines". Seven chapters about seven broken individuals, about what it means to live in Greece in these hard times of financial restraint".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blacknightsfilmfestival.com/ ''Tallinn festival''] Blacknightsfilmfestival.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Liina Laugesaar''' wrote in Cineuropa:&lt;ref&gt;[http://cineuropa.org/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&amp;l=en&amp;did=319887 ''Cineuropa review''] Cineuropa.&lt;/ref&gt; "Lines does not focus on the political side of the crisis, but concentrates on the people who had to endure it. Everything extraneous is left out of the story. Mazomenos puts faces back on the numbers and creates a harrowing testament to the challenging years that have left scars on many." '''Élie Castiel''' wrote in [[Séquences]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revuesequences.org/2017/12/lines/ ''Séquences review''] Séquences.&lt;/ref&gt;  "A movie shock, surprising, nocturnal, shouting his rage through seven tables, seven paintings of durations approximately equal, the whole forming a coherent whole despite the side Byzantine intentionally of each Party. Straight lines, circulars, symmetrical, disordered also, as if the logic of the ancient Greece had disappeared for ever"

The '''''Madonna of the Rose Garden''''' (Italian: ''Madonna del Roseto'') is an [[International Gothic]] [[painting]] attributed to [[Michelino da Besozzo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artslife.com/2015/04/08/dai-visconti-agli-sforza-le-meraviglie-dellarte-lombarda-a-milano-mostra-foto/|title=Dai Visconti agli Sforza. Le meraviglie dell’arte lombarda a Milano. Mostra &amp; Foto|publisher=ArtsLife| language=Italian| accessdate =1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Stefano da Verona]]. Dating to c. 1420–1435, it is currently housed in the [[Castelvecchio Museum]] in [[Verona]], northern Italy.

==Description==
The [[tempera]] on panel painting shows the traditional theme of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna with Child]] within an enclosure of roses, a ''[[hortus conclusus]]'', symbol of her virginity, in the presence of [[St. Catherine of Alexandria]]. The latter, as a princess, is crowned, and is accompanied by her martyrdom attribute of the [[breaking wheel|torture wheel]]. There are also numerous slender angels. They are performing a series of activities: reading (a hint to the [[religious text]]s), collecting petals of rose, playing near a Gothic [[Baptismal font|font]] (symbolizing the definition of Mary as ''Fons gratiae'', "Spring of Grace").

Two peacocks are roaming in the garden: they are a symbol of the immortality of Christ since early Christian times, when their flesh was considered not liable to rot. 

The work has been attributed to both [[Stefano da Verona]] or [[Michelino da Besozzo]], with more recent scholars tending to favor the latter.

'''''Mga Ibong Mandaragit'''''  or '''''Mga Ibong Mandaragit: Nobelang Sosyo-Politikal''''' (literally, ''Birds of Prey: A Socio-Political Novel'') is a [[novel]] written by the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] writer and social activist, [[Amado V. Hernandez]] in 1969.  ''Mga Ibong Mandaragit'', hailed as Hernandez's masterpiece, focuses on the [[Neocolonialism|neocolonial]] dependency and revolt in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=PhilCSC/&gt;  The novel reflects Hernandez's experience as a [[guerrilla]] intelligence officer when the Philippines was under [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]] from 1942 to 1945.&lt;ref name=PhilCSC&gt;[http://philcsc.wordpress.com/2008/08/26/appreciating-amado-v-hernandez-proletarian-artis/ "Mga Ibong Mandaragit" by Amado V.

==Description==
The narrative, illustrates Hernandez's yearning for change and the elevation of the status of Philippine society and living conditions of [[Filipino people|Filipinos]].  The setting is in the middle of [[Philippines Campaign (1944–1945)|1944]], when the armed forces of the [[Japanese Empire]] were losing.&lt;ref name=Hernandez/&gt;

The novel acts as a sequel to [[Jose Rizal]]'s historic ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El filibusterismo]]''.  The protagonist Mando Plaridel is tested by Tata Matyas, an old revolutionary, on his knowledge about Rizal and Rizal's novels. Similar to Rizal's novel, the main character examines the Philippines as an outsider while traveling in Europe.&lt;ref name=Veric&gt;Veric, Charlie Samuya.

The '''Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar''' was a [[half dollar (United States coin)|fifty-cent piece]] struck intermittently by the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] between 1926 and 1939.  The coin was designed by [[Laura Gardin Fraser]] and [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], and [[United States commemorative coin|commemorates]] those who traveled the [[Oregon Trail]] and settled the Pacific Coast of the United States in the mid-19th century.  Struck over a lengthy period in small numbers per year, the many varieties produced came to be considered a ripoff by coin collectors, and led to the end, for the time, of the [[Early United States commemorative coins|commemorative coin series]].

Ohio-born [[Ezra Meeker]] had traveled the Trail with his family in 1852 and spent the final two decades of his long life before his death in 1928 publicizing the Oregon Trail, that it should not be forgotten. In 1926, at age 95, he appeared before a Senate committee, requesting that the government issue a commemorative coin that could be sold to raise money for markers to show where the Trail had been. The coin had originally been thought of by Idahoans, led by Dr. Minnie Howard, seeking to further preservation work at [[Fort Hall]]; Meeker broadened the idea.  Congress authorized six million half dollars, and placed no restriction on when or at what mint the coins would be struck.  Meeker's [[Oregon Trail Memorial Association]] (OTMA) had tens of thousands of pieces struck in 1926 and 1928, and did not sell them all.  Nevertheless, most years between 1933 and 1939, it had small quantities of the half dollar coined, in some years from all three operating mints to produce [[mint mark|mintmarked]] varieties, and raised prices considerably.

Collectors complained that some of the issues were controlled by coin dealers, and individual collectors had to pay high prices.  Public protests followed, and in 1939 Congress ended the series.  Despite the complaints, the OTMA had difficulty in selling the coins, and they remained available from the OTMA's successor organization as late as 1953. Just over 260,000 of the 6,000,000 authorized coins were struck, of which about 60,000 were melted. The US commemorative coin struck over the longest period, the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar has been widely praised for its design.

== Background ==
{{main|Oregon Trail}}

In the middle years of the 19th century, before the completion of the [[first transcontinental railroad|transcontinental railroad]] in 1869 made travel easier, hundreds of thousands of people journeyed along the [[Oregon Trail]] to settle the Far West of the United States.  Not all who began the journey reached their destination as there was much suffering and death along the way—by one estimate, 20,000 people lie in unmarked graves.{{sfn|"Meeker departs"}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-12-04}}

[[File:Ezra Meeker 1921.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ezra Meeker]] in 1921 at age 90]]

Ohio-born farmer [[Ezra Meeker]] (1830–1928) traveled the Oregon Trail in 1852; he and his young wife and infant child went by ox-drawn wagon from Iowa to [[Oregon Territory]].  In his old age, he came to believe that the Oregon Trail, and the sacrifice of those who had died along it, were being forgotten.  Amid considerable publicity as one of the last survivors of the pioneers who had blazed the way west, Meeker retraced his route along the Trail between 1906 and 1908.  The Trail had in some places disappeared, swallowed up by town and farm, and in his journeys, he sought to find where he had passed, seeking to have historical markers erected.  He took his ox team and wagon across the nation to publicize his cause, parking his rig in front of the White House where he met President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In New York, he crossed the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].  In 1910, he and his oxen participated in the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] in Pasadena.  In the succeeding years, he traveled the route by oxcart, automobile, and, at age 93 in 1924, airplane, attempting to further his cause, and seeking federal recognition and funding for his efforts.{{sfn|"Meeker departs"}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-12-04}}

== Inception ==
The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar stemmed from various efforts by Idahoans who favored the preservation of the site of [[Fort Hall]], an important way station on the Trail.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=33}}  The idea was sparked by the issuance of the 1925 [[Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar]], which caused Mabel Murphy, wife of an Idaho newspaperman, to propose to her husband the striking of an Oregon Trail coin, the profits from which could be used for historic preservation. Her husband, D.T. Murphy, on April 16, 1925 dutifully published an editorial, "Oregon Trail Covered Wagon Half Dollars" in the ''[[Idaho State Journal]]''.  Mrs. Murphy would not live to see the coin issued, dying November 30, 1925 of tuberculosis.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=35}}

The idea for the coin was brought up again when civic activists in [[Pocatello, Idaho]], led by Dr. [[Minnie Howard]], sought ideas for funding a monument on the site of Fort Hall.  Insurance salesman F.C. McGowan displayed a Stone Mountain piece, "Yes.  Coinage. Like this!" Howard and her colleagues pursued the idea.  Meeker did as well once he heard of it, forming the [[Oregon Trail Memorial Association]], ("OTMA" or "the Association") a national organization, which could also receive the half dollars, and sell them at a profit.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=34}}

An act to authorize the coinage of 50-cent pieces in commemoration of the heroism of the fathers and mothers who traversed the Oregon Trail to the far West with great hardship, daring, and loss of life, which not only resulted in adding new states to the Union but earned a well-deserved and imperishable fame for the pioneers; to honor the twenty thousand dead that lie buried in unknown graves along two thousand miles of that great highway of history; to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion; and to commemorate by suitable monuments, memorial or otherwise, the tragic events associated with that emigration—erecting them either along the trail itself or elsewhere, in localities appropriate for the purpose, including the city of Washington.
| source = Preamble of the act authorizing the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 54}}{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=79}}
}}

By 1925, Congress was reluctant to authorize more commemorative coins; twelve pieces had been issued between 1920 and 1925, and many legislators felt that coins were being allowed that "commemorate[d] events of local and not national interest".{{sfn|US Mint}} The entire mintages of commemoratives were sold at face value to the sponsoring organizations designated in the authorizing acts.  These groups then sold the coins to the public at a premium, thus raising money for causes that Congress had deemed worthy.{{sfn|Webber|p=15}} Made cautious by a series of unsuccessful issues, Congress rejected a number of proposals for special coins in early 1926.  Among these were pieces to honor the completion of the [[Lincoln Highway|Lincoln]] and [[Victory Highway]]s, and a proposal to commemorate the centennial of the birth of American composer [[Stephen Foster]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=118}}

The bill authorizing the Oregon Trail Memorial  [[half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]] was first introduced in the House of Representatives on January 25, 1926 by Washington Congressman [[John Franklin Miller (Washington representative)|John Franklin Miller]], who had previously been mayor of Seattle.  Meeker was living in Seattle while Miller was mayor, having moved from his previous home in [[Puyallup, Washington|Puyallup]]. According to local historian Bert Webber in his 1986 monograph on the coin, "there is little doubt that Mr. Miller was influenced to propose this coin by Ezra Meeker."{{sfn|Webber|pp=10, 13}}{{sfn|Driggs &amp; Meeker|p=302}} A hearing was held before the House Coinage Committee on March 3; Meeker testified.  The bill was reported favorably, and then passed by the full House on April 5, 1926.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|pp=34–35}} The bill was not opposed in the House of Representatives, though one member, Michigan Congressman [[Louis Cramton]], asked several questions before it passed by [[unanimous consent]].{{sfn|Webber|pp=16–21}} According to an October 2013 article in ''[[The Numismatist]]'', "Congress was no match for Meeker".{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=43}}

[[File:Meeker Coolidge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Meeker with President [[Calvin Coolidge]]]]
On April 26, 1926, the 95-year-old Meeker appeared before the Senate’s Committee on Banking and Currency.  Treasury Secretary [[Andrew W. Mellon]] had filed a letter opposing commemorative coin issues, except those of national importance.  Meeker, in his testimony, argued that the Trail issue would be of such importance.  The OTMA board considered whether to seek amendment of the bill to the alternative suggested by Mellon, a commemorative medal.  In part because of Howard's urging, they decided to stay with the coin.  The bill for the half dollar was reported without recommendation, but was passed by the Senate on May 10.  Meeker met with President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to ensure it would be signed, which it was on May 17, 1926 as Public Law 325, authorizing the issuance of up to 6,000,000 half dollars.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|pp=34–35}}  President Calvin Coolidge signed the bill on the White House lawn; Meeker was present at the [[signing ceremony]] and was photographed shaking hands with President Coolidge.{{sfn|Webber|p=21}}

The bill required that the Association pay for the half dollars at par, and that the [[coining (mint)|dies]] and other costs of preparation not be at the expense of the United States.{{sfn|Webber|p=18}} The figure of six million was the largest in American commemorative history, exceeding the five million for the Stone Mountain issue.  Congress placed no restriction on which mint should strike the coins, and did not put a time limit on the authorization.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=80, 88}}  According to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]] in their encyclopedia of US commemoratives, the bill passed "possibly because the stated purpose was nationalistic rather than obscurely local".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=181}}  Coin dealer and author [[Q. David Bowers]] states that "on the surface the motivation seemed to be good enough&amp;nbsp;... doubtless many American citizens had family ties to the famous migration".{{sfn|Bowers|p=88}}

== Preparation ==

Meeker wanted the new half dollars struck as quickly as possible; he was planning another journey west on the Trail, and wanted to be able to sell the coins along the way.{{sfn|Taxay|p=122}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1926-07-11}}  The Association initially contacted [[Chester Beach]], credited with the design of the 1923 [[Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar]], to sculpt the new coin, but he was unavailable, though he prepared sketches.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=63, 118}}

The OTMA tried to reach agreement with [[Gutzon Borglum]], designer of the Stone Mountain piece, but he wanted too much money and time. Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, who had played a minor role in the [[Columbian half dollar]] of 1892–93, was willing, but lacked the national reputation the Association felt the coin's sculptor needed. After receiving suggestions from the [[American Numismatic Society]],{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=35}} the Association turned to the husband-and-wife team of [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]] and [[Laura Gardin Fraser]].{{sfn|Taxay|pp=63, 118}} James Fraser had designed the [[Buffalo nickel]]; Laura Gardin Fraser had created several commemorative coins, including the Grant Centennial dollar and half dollar.{{sfn|''CoinSite''}} It chose the Frasers at the urging of Minnie Howard, who felt that James Fraser's work dealt with the West, and might make manifest, in his coin design, the importance of the migration by covered wagon.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=36}} The Association determined upon a design concept of a map showing the Oregon Trail on one side, and on the other a man leading an ox-drawn wagon, with his wife and infant child riding.  Although he is not formally commemorated by the coin, the man was meant to be Meeker.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|pp=36–37}}

Meeker pestered Laura Fraser to complete the modeling, as he wanted the half dollars available for sale at an upcoming event. She completed the work by July 30, 1926, when she wrote to enquire where she should send the designs for endorsement by the [[Commission of Fine Arts]].  This body since 1921 had been tasked with advising the Secretary of the Treasury on coinage design.  She sent photographs of her models to the commission's offices.  On August 5, 1926, commission chairman [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts)|Charles Moore]] responded enthusiastically, informing her that not only had the commission endorsed the designs, but they were having the prints framed for their meeting room.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=118, 122}}  To save time, the hubs from which coinage dies could be prepared were made by the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, which had made reductions from plaster models to hubs for several commemorative issues.  The resulting hubs were sent to the [[Philadelphia Mint]], where working dies for the issue were made.{{sfn|Bowers|p=88}}{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=182}}  A [[compass rose]] on the Indian side, included in Laura Fraser's models, does not appear on the issued coin, though the reason for the change is not known.{{sfn|Taxay|p=122}}

The ''wagon side'' designed by James Fraser depicts a [[Conestoga wagon]] drawn by two oxen, heading into an extremely large setting sun, with resplendent rays.  The designers’ initials appear behind the wagon; five stars appear below the vehicle, though what they represent is uncertain.  Swiatek and Breen suggested that they represent five states and territories through which pioneers would have passed.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=181}}{{sfn|Vermeule|p=173}}

The ''Indian side'' designed by Laura Fraser features a dramatically rendered Native American, standing erect with outstretched arm in what Vermeule describes as a gesture of peace.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=173}} The Indian was added by the Frasers to the original map design concept endorsed by the OTMA.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=37}} Swiatek and Breen noted that the Indian's "position has been irreverently compared to that of a traffic policeman demanding 'Halt!'&amp;nbsp;"{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=181}}  Such statements were made from the time of issue; ''The Numismatist'' in November 1926 stated that the Indian's left hand "is upraised as if warning the people of the East of the perils and hardship of the Trail".{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 1926}} Meeker's 1928 obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' averred that the Indian was "standing with hands upraised to stop the white man's progress westward".{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-12-04}} The Native American wears a headdress, has a blanket and bow, and is superimposed on a map of the United States, with a line of Conestoga wagons heading west. The design is carried to the rim of the coin; [[Hudson Bay]] is visible in the upper right.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=181}}{{sfn|Bowers|p=88}}{{sfn|Vermeule|p=173}}

The Frasers' design for the half dollar has been widely admired.  Swiatek and Breen deemed the issue "one of the greatest artistic triumphs ever to be released by the Mint".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=182}}  Numismatic historian [[Don Taxay]] called the coin "the most beautiful as well as the most truly 'American' U.S. coin.  It testifies to the fact that authentic genius, even when trammeled by the necessities of a modern, mechanical mint, can transform our coinage into a work of art."{{sfn|Taxay|p=122}}

=== Initial release ===

[[File:Meeker last photo.jpg|thumb|right|Ezra Meeker, Detroit, November 1928]]
According to Webber, "during the final stages of manufacture, [Meeker] kept heckling the mint to 'hurry up'&amp;nbsp;".{{sfn|Webber|p=22}}  The Philadelphia Mint struck 48,000 pieces in September 1926, plus 30 reserved for inspection by the 1927 [[United States Assay Commission]].   Meeker peddled them along his route at $1 each.  The difference between the face value and the sale price was to pay the cost for historical markers along the Trail, and to renovate the [[Whitman Mission National Historic Site|Whitman Mission]] in Washington state.  The 1926 piece was later dubbed by the Association the "Ezra Meeker Issue".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-08-04}} The first piece struck was presented to Meeker; its whereabouts are not known, while the second, presented to Howard, rests in the [[Idaho State Historical Museum]].{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=37}}

With the initial quantity committed (75 pieces were returned to the mint, most likely because they were damaged or misstruck), the Association requested that more pieces be produced.  A hundred thousand were coined at the [[San Francisco Mint]] in October and November, bearing the [[mint mark]] S (1926-S).{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}  The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar thus became the first commemorative coin struck at multiple mints; Bowers notes that this set "a precedent which would be expanded and abused in the years to come".{{sfn|Bowers|p=89}} According to Swiatek and Breen, "the Association&amp;nbsp;... [was] expecting that the collectors who bought 1926 Philadelphia coins would turn out in similar or greater numbers for the second variety".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=182}}  Although a few thousand quickly sold, the market for the half dollars proved saturated, and tens of thousands remained at the mint pending payment.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}{{sfn|Bowers|p=89}}  On December 29, 1926, Meeker celebrated his 96th birthday in New York; he was presented with 96 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars by the Association.{{sfn|''New York Times''|1927-12-30}}

[[File:Meeker grave.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ezra Meeker's grave, Puyallup, Washington]]

Despite the many unsold 1926-S half dollars still in the government's hands, the Association sought the issuance of 1927-dated half dollars; this was refused by the Treasury Department (of which the Bureau of the Mint was a part) due to the backlog.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}  In 1928, 50,000 more were struck at the Philadelphia Mint.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=182}}  Meeker continued his exploits: he was presented with 97 coins on his birthday in December 1927 by the Association{{sfn|''New York Times''|1927-12-30}} and brought his half dollars to the visitor's gallery of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], though he was refused permission to go onto the floor.{{sfn|''Morning Leader''}} In April 1928, Meeker wrote to the [[American Numismatic Association]], urging its coin-collecting members to purchase both the 1926 and 1926-S pieces.{{sfn|Rossman|p=889}} Nevertheless, although Meeker organized a national campaign to sell the coins, the OTMA lost $10,000 by his efforts, due to office and other expenses. "The aged pioneer did not appear to be that good with money".{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|pp=44–45, 47}}

Meeker was given a truck chassis and money to modify it into a wagon-topped vehicle by [[Henry Ford]] in 1928 for yet another Trail trip.  Ford offered to make the vehicle more comfortable for Meeker if he brought it to the Ford factory in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].  Accordingly, when he left New York  in August 1928 on another journey, planning to sell half dollars along the way, he headed directly for Michigan.{{sfn|Webber|p=22}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-08-04}}{{sfn|Driggs &amp; Meeker|pp=299–302}} He arrived ill, and was hospitalized, almost dying there.  He was able to return home, disgruntled at having missed voting in the election (he supported the successful Republican candidate, [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]], for president) for the first time since 1853.  At his home in Washington state, Meeker again became ill in November, and died December 3, 1928, three and a half weeks before his 98th birthday.{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-12-04}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-08-04}}  He was buried in a cemetery in Puyallup, a place he had helped settle.  Meeker's headstone bears a plaque reproducing the wagon side of the half dollar.{{sfn|Webber|p=49}}

=== Reissue ===
[[File:Oregon medal.jpg|thumb|right|Medal of the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, presented to its second and last president, [[Howard R. Driggs]]]]
After Meeker's death, the OTMA selected [[Howard R. Driggs]], a professor of English education at [[New York University]] as his successor, and elected a new board of directors, which worked to clear the debt Meeker had accrued. Coins on hand continued to be sold.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=45}} It was able to persuade President Hoover to proclaim the Covered Wagon Centennial in 1930, the hundredth anniversary both of Meeker's birth and of the first wagon train leaving St. Louis for the [[Oregon country]]. One means of selling coins the Association devised was a campus-wide drive at [[Yale University]], alma mater of Association executive director Lorne W. Buckley, in October 1930 to raise money for Trail markers.  More than 600 coins were sold.{{sfn|Webber|pp=29, 35–37, 42}}

Most 1928 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars remained in the hands of the Treasury for several years after their striking, though the Association purchased an estimated 1,000 for sale to the public.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=45}} This impoundment by the government generated interest in the coin collecting community—several letters to the editor appeared in ''The Numismatist'', enquiring as to the coins's fate.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}{{sfn|Bowers|p=89}} One collector followed up with the Philadelphia Mint; Acting Superintendent Fred H. Chaffin replied that the coins were being held there for the Association, and were dated 1928.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|May 1930}} The OTMA had a financial crisis in 1931, and was planning to close its doors, but operations continued, with headquarters moved from its Manhattan office to Driggs's home in [[Bayside, Queens]].{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=45}}  The Association marketed the 1928 coins as the "[[Jedediah Smith]] Issue".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=78}}

[[File:Oregon Trail memorial Fort Laramie.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Oregon Trail memorial, Fort Laramie, Wyoming]]

In early 1933, Driggs sought the issuance of more half dollars on behalf of the OTMA, writing to the acting Mint Director, [[Mary Margaret O'Reilly]]. and then to Treasury Secretary [[William H. Woodin]]. Driggs wanted 5,000 of the 1928 and 5,000 new half dollars struck at Denver (1933-D), proposing to exchange 10,000 half dollars dated 1926.  All the coins held by the government, including those acquired by the exchange, were to be melted. This was approved, and the pieces were duly struck at the [[Denver Mint]],{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=45}} the first commemorative coins ever struck at Denver.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1068}}

The Association had turned to the [[John Walter Scott|Scott Stamp and Coin Company]] of New York to market the coins.  Scott was able to sell some of the 1928 half dollars. These actions have been interpreted negatively by numismatic scholars: Q. David Bowers alleges that Scott's representative, Wayte Raymond, proposed melting most of the issue to create an artificial scarcity, and that the company "desired to capitalize on the gullibility of collectors and their need to complete sets by having more varieties coined. Scott figured that if additional Oregon Trail half dollars could be minted with the date 1933 they could be sold effectively at the [[Century of Progress Exposition]] held that year in Chicago."{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}  Swiatek and Breen noted, "through God only knows what manner of political manipulation, the Oregon Trail Memorial Association managed to obtain approval of a new 1933 Denver issue" for sale at the exposition.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p =182}}

A total of 5,250 of the 1933-D were struck, of which approximately five were reserved for the Assay Commission and 242 were eventually returned for melting.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|pp=182–183}}  Bowers believes that the returned pieces were likely defective, rather than unsold.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}} The Association dubbed the 1933-D the "Century of Progress Exposition Issue"; both the 1928 and the 1933-D half dollars were sold for $2 each.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=77–78}}  However, the 1928 could be obtained for $1.75 by anyone who had recently bought two or more of the 1926 issues, and could be purchased for as little as $1.10 each by purchasing 10 of the 1926-dated coins.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 59}}

With the relative success of the 1933-D issue, the Association ordered 7,000 more in 1934, also struck at Denver.  These were dubbed the "Fort Hall, [[Fort Laramie]] and [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]] Issue" and were also sold by Scott, for $2.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=183}} These also were not paid for by the OTMA, but were an exchange for 1926-S half dollars—the distribution figure of 83,055 for the 1926-S equals 100,000 for the OTMA plus 55 assay pieces minus 17,000 returned in exchange for the 1933-D and 1934-D pieces.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=46}}

The resurrected Oregon Trail issue became controversial in the collecting community, with a large number of coin clubs passing resolutions against the reissues; the president of the American Numismatic Association called for commemorative coins to be sold only by the Mint, not by private organizations.  Driggs protested against the resolutions, copies of which were sent to federal authorities.  Nevertheless, the 1935-S pieces he had requested of the Mint, and dies for which were prepared, were never struck, perhaps because of the indignation of collectors.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|pp=46–47}} Other reasons have been postulated for the lack of an issue in 1935: in a 1937 monograph quoted by Bowers, early coin dealer B. Max Mehl speculated that it took Scott two years to dispose of the 1934-D pieces.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 56}}

=== Final issues and termination ===
[[File:Oregon Trail memorial Lingle WY.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Oregon Trail memorial, [[Lingle, Wyoming|Lingle]], Wyoming]]

Beginning in 1934, organizations and individuals saw small-mintage commemoratives, struck at multiple mints over the course of years, as an opportunity for profit.{{sfn|Bowers|p=12}}  Congress authorized several issues in 1934, including the Texas Centennial half dollar, meant to honor the centennial of [[Texas Independence]] in 1936, but struck from 1934 to 1938, after 1934 at all three mints each year.  More new commemoratives followed in 1935, and over 20 in 1936.  These issues included the [[Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar]], issued to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, although nothing out of the ordinary is known to have taken place in that city's musical life in 1886.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=12–13}}

Numismatist Arlie R. Slabaugh, in his volume on US commemorative coins, discussed the marketing practices of the 1930s:

{{quote
| Added to the abuse of reissues was the manner of selling these [the Oregon Trail pieces] and several other later issues of commemoratives.  The price was often higher than the dollar per coin usually asked in the past, although most of the commemorative deluge came during the depression years.  A few pieces at a higher price would not have been too bad, but on a large number of types, the cost to collectors added up.  Then, too, many issues were sold only in sets.  Coinage was generally small and sold out in only a few days.  Speculation was rife—original cost was low to what it might be a short time later if you unfortunately missed having your order filled&amp;nbsp;... collectors who had not managed to obtain single specimens from the original source were forced to buy it at higher and higher prices from speculators—it soon became a regular round robin of higher and higher prices.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=78}}

[[File:1936 Scott Oregon ad.jpg|thumb|left|Scott advertisement, February 1936]]
On December 30, 1935, Driggs wrote to O'Reilly, who with the appointment of [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]] as Mint Director had resumed her position as Assistant Mint Director, seeking the issuance of 5,000 Oregon Trail coins to be struck at San Francisco (1936-S) to celebrate the centennial of the arrival of missionary [[Marcus Whitman]] and his wife in the [[Walla Walla River|Walla Walla Valley]].  O'Reilly and other officials did not immediately answer and Driggs wrote again in March 1936, Chaffin, again acting superintendent at Philadelphia, responded that the dies had been prepared and sent to San Francisco.  The coins were sent at Driggs' request to Scott's in New York. In May, Driggs asked that 10,000 more be struck at Philadelphia, and this was done.  These were sold at the height of the commemorative coin boom.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=47}}   Some of the 1936 and 1936-S pieces were sold by Scott, others by the Association through a New York City mail drop, in either case at an initial price of $1.60 per half dollar. Six each of the 1936 and 1936-S were struck in addition to the requested quantities, for assay.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}

In June 1936, Herbert G. West, head of the Whitman Centennial Celebration, wrote to Driggs informing him that his group had sought and failed to gain (unusually for 1936) a commemorative half dollar to finance its activities. West wanted Driggs to order a special issue of the Oregon Trail commemorative for the Whitman organization to sell.  Driggs was non-committal, first telling West that he hoped they might still be successful in gaining their own half dollar, and then that a special issue would be difficult to get as the mints had shut down for the summer.  He eventually agreed to give the Whitman group a thousand 1936-S half dollars, on condition they not be sold for less than $1.60 so as not to undercut the OTMA's sales efforts.  In fact, Driggs suggested a sale price of $2, which was what the Whitman organization sold them for. These were dubbed the "Whitman Centennial Issue", or the "Whitman Mission Issue". {{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 56}}{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|pp=47–48}} Most of the 1936 pieces struck at Philadelphia were sold by the means of a mailing to Scott's customer list.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 60}} Some portion of each of the issues between 1933 and 1937 were reserved for sale by patriotic organizations.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=78–79}}

The 1937 issue was distributed only by the Association as the deal with Scott had been ended.  A total of 12,000 pieces (plus eight for the Assay Commission) were struck at Denver, and were sold at $1.60.  No special name was given to the issue.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|pp=182–183}}  Coin dealer Mehl wondered in 1937, "the 1936 Philadelphia Mint coin is now retailing at $5 and the San Francisco Mint at $10. Where will this thing stop? I don't know."{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 56}}

The 1938 coins, again without a special name, were struck at all three mints, the first time that had been done for the Oregon Trail coins in one year.  Six thousand (plus pieces for the Assay Commission) were struck at each mint, and the issue was sold in sets of three, for $6.25.  The same practice was followed in 1939, but the price was raised to $7.50 a set and the mintage reduced to 3,000 coins, plus the assay pieces.  According to Swiatek and Breen, these sets were also bought up by speculators, and individual collectors often had to pay double or triple the issue price to secure a set.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|pp=182–183}}  The coins did not sell out instantly; the OTMA's accounting records reveal that nine months after the 1938 coins were put on sale, the organization still had almost half the issue available. Similarly, by October 1939, the Association had sold only 8,283 half dollars dated that year, less than the 9,000 available for sale.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|pp=48–49}} Nevertheless, collectors sent letters of protest to congressmen and to the Treasury Department.{{sfn|Webber|p=24}} On August 5, 1939, Congress acted, passing legislation that put an end to all commemorative issues authorized before March 1939.  Swiatek and Breen observed that if Congress had not intervened, "there would probably be Oregon Trail coins dated 1980".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|pp=182–183}}

A total of 264,419 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars were struck, of which approximately 174 were intended for the Assay Commission, and 61,317 were melted.  Accordingly, a total of 202,928 were issued to the public.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=183}}  The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was the commemorative coin struck for the longest period.{{sfn|Bowers|p=87}}  According to [[R.S. Yeoman]]'s 2018 deluxe edition of ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', the cheapest Oregon Trail coins are the 1926 and 1926-S at $135 in Almost Uncirculated.  The 1939 pieces are listed only as a set and in [[Mint state|Mint State]] condition (uncirculated), beginning at $1,350.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1069}}

== Aftermath ==

The Oregon Trail Memorial Association became part of the newly formed American Pioneer Trails Association (APTA) in 1940, a group meant to be broader in scope than the OTMA.  A 1942 joint financial statement of both organizations reveals that it still held 7,212 half dollars.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=49}}  It was selling 1936 and 1937-D half dollars in 1943.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=78–79}}  A letter to the editor in the September 1943 issue of ''The Numismatist'' stated that the group was selling the pieces at $5 to finance stakes made of Oregon wood with which to mark the Trail.  The sum of five dollars, which included membership, paid for a coin at a time, the letter noted, when the pieces were selling at $1.50 from dealers.{{efn|Advertisements in the same issue bear that out.  On page 742, a dealer named O. Fred Koch of Cincinnati was selling 1936 half dollars for $1.40 and 1937-D pieces for $1.50.  The 1936-S was $5.00, and the set of three from 1938 was $6.50; the 1939 set was $20.}}{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|September 1943}}

Minnie Howard was still in 1947 trying to secure the site of Fort Hall, and as part of that effort got Idaho Senator [[Henry Dworshak]] to introduce legislation allowing the issuance of more Oregon Trail half dollars to benefit Howard's Idaho organization.  No sooner had he done so, on February 26, than President [[Harry Truman]] announced his opposition to various coin bills that had been introduced.  Acting Treasury Secretary E.F. Foley wrote in opposition, tracing the history between the OTMA and the Treasury Department, "Coins were ordered to be minted and left in the mints".{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=38}} The Banking Committee opposed the bill, and it failed. According to a November 2014 article in ''The Numismatist'', "With the efforts in the 1940s, the Oregon Trail half dollar, having seen its sunrise in Pocatello, met its sunset there as well."{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=38}}

Driggs led the APTA until his death at age 89 in 1963, but it became less active in his final years.  He retained at least some half dollars, notifying the Mint in 1953 that the APTA was the successor to the OTMA, and still had half dollars for sale.  After his death, over fifty Oregon Trail half dollars were found among his effects.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=49}}   Other groups have carried the APTA's missions of Trail preservation and the building of monuments.{{sfn|Webber|pp=25, 27}} In 1963, two years before Howard's death, the City of Pocatello erected a replica of Fort Hall in a park.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=38}} The actual site, however, remains undeveloped, with an inconspicuous marker.{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=37}}

[[File:Oregon Trail Register Cliff.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An Oregon Trail memorial at [[Register Cliff]], Wyoming, reproducing the coin's design]]

No commemorative coins were struck between 1939 and 1945.  When authorizations resumed after the war, issues in honor of [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[George Washington Carver]] were sold, in some years, in low-mintage sets of coins from all three mints.  After 1954, when the last such pieces were struck, the Treasury Department did not again support a non-circulating commemorative until 1982, when a half dollar in honor of the 250th anniversary of the birth of [[George Washington]] was issued.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=14–15}}  The Washington half dollar was distributed by the Mint, with profits applied to the reduction of [[United States national debt|the national debt]].{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 180}}  Bowers writes, "this time around[, striking of commemorative coins] would not be on behalf of private or local interests".{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 179}}

In the past, numismatic writers have described the Association and its activities harshly. Bowers states that the Oregon Trail coins "are beautiful, but circumstances surrounding their issuance leave much to be desired".{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 54}} Slabaugh noted that "Artistically, this is my favorite commemorative coin.  But from an ethical standpoint, it is not."{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=78}} Swiatek and Breen wrote that the Association's "activities in exploiting coin collectors and the general public eventually led to the unpopularity of commemoratives in Congress and ultimately to adamant Treasury Department opposition to any further commemorative issues, no matter how worthy the cause to be memorialized, no matter who represented the sponsoring commissions".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=182}}  According to Bowers, "as far as I know, the financial benefits which provided the reason for issuing the half dollars, 'to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion,' to erect 'suitable monuments, memorial and otherwise,' etc., never came to pass, at least not from money provided by the sale of the coins."{{efn|In fact, over 100 memorials were built with coin-derived funds (see {{harvnb|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=38}}).}}{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 57}} These, however, did not have the benefit of examining OTMA records.  Following the opening of Driggs's papers for research at [[Southern Utah University]],{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|November 2014|p=38}} an October 2013 article in ''The Numismatist'' concluded that though many documents, such as the arrangements with Scott's, are missing from his records, what there is "seems consistent with Driggs wanting to use the coins to finance the marking of the Oregon Trail, not to line his own pockets".{{sfn|''The Numismatist''|October 2013|p=49}}

A small number of coins from each year and mint were put aside for inspection by the following year's Assay Commission; the above figures include such pieces.  This accounts for the variance from the even thousand mintages in 1933 and after.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=183}}

The '''''Pioneer Woman''''' monument is a bronze sculpture in [[Ponca City, Oklahoma|Ponca City]], [[Oklahoma]], designed by [[Bryant Baker]] and dedicated on April 22, 1930. The statue is of a [[wikt:sunbonnet|sunbonneted]] woman leading a child by the hand. It was donated to the State of Oklahoma by millionaire oilman [[E. W. Marland]]. He commissioned models from twelve well-known sculptors and financed a nationwide tour to get feedback from art critics and the general public in order to decide which model to use for the final statue.

== Design and construction ==
Around 1925 Marland sketched out an ambitious sculptural program to sculptor [[Jo Davidson]] involving numerous statues based on the theme of the settling of the [[American West]] and attempted to persuade Davidson to take it on. When Davidson declined Marland replies that he could pay for it, prompting Davidson to come back with "I don't doubt it for a minute, but I don't see myself working for you for the rest of my life." Marland ultimately convinced Davidson to go to Ponca City, Marland's then home town, and create three statues for him: one of Marland and one of each of Marland's adopted children, [[Lydie Marland|Lydie]] and George.

While Davidson was producing his three Marland statues E.W. told him of another project that he has in mind, "E.W.'s most cherished dream." Davidson writes, " It was to be a twenty-five foot figure, which he planned to put up on a hill where it could be seen for miles ... E.W. brought his friends to see what I was doing. He acted as if he was the sculptor, and in conversation would say that he was doing the figure - that I was his hands."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson. Jo, ''Between Sittings: An informal autobiography of Jo Davidson'', The Dial Press, NY 1951 pp. 210-215&lt;/ref&gt;

Marland's inspiration for this project included his pioneering mother and grandmother.&lt;ref name="LAT4"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=A4 |date= April 6, 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The models ===
At that point Marland sent out invitations to many of America's leading sculptors, offering them each a $10,000 honorarium to produce a roughly {{convert|3|ft|m|sigfig=1}} tall bronze model for the statue.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSM7"&gt;{{cite news |title=Oil Magnate Refuses to Forget Land That Brought Him Wealth: There Were Women Pioneers Too |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor |page=5A |date= April 6, 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He further proposed that the models tour the United States and that the American public vote as to which of the models would be erected in Ponca City. Several sculptors, [[Daniel Chester French]], [[George Grey Barnard]] and [[Paul Manship]] turned Marland down, also declining were the only two women invited, [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]] and [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Art News'', Vol. XXV - No. 21, February 26, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; leaving him with an even dozen artists, all males. The artists who submitted models were [[Bryant Baker]], [[Alexander Stirling Calder|A, Stirling Calder]], [[Jo Davidson]], [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], [[John Gregory (sculptor)|John Gregory]], [[F. Lynn Jenkins]], [[Mario Korbel]], [[Arthur Lee (sculptor)|Arthur Lee]], [[Hermon Atkins MacNeil]], [[Maurice Sterne]], [[Mahonri Young]], and [[Wheeler Williams]].&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |title=PIONEER WOMAN IN BRONZE: Models in Marland Competition Will Be Shown Here. |newspaper=New York Times |page=21 |date= February 22, 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The models were to tour America and everyone who visited the sites where they were exhibited was allowed to vote for their favorite.&lt;ref&gt;''Exhibition of Models for a Monument to the Pioneer Woman'', at the Chicago Architectural Exhibition, East Gallerias, Art Institute of Chicago, June 25 to August 1, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

Marland's original idea was to have a woman in pioneer dress accompanied by a child, and so he provided a sunbonnet to each sculptor. While the artists were not limited to these ideas, nine of the twelve models included a sunbonnet and all save for Jo Davidson's included a child.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT29"&gt;{{cite news|title=PIONEER WOMAN SEEN IN BRONZE: Twelve Sculptors Show Their Models for the Proposed Monumental Statue to Be Erected In Oklahoma—Other States to See Them.|date=March 20, 1927|page=XX6|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Davidson and Calder visited Oklahoma to gain further inspiration.&lt;ref name="NYT29" /&gt;

Mahonri Young's biographer Thomas Toone relates that Young produced not only the required three foot tall statuette, but also a plaster version of the entire Pioneer Memorial as he envisioned it, replete with detailed bas-reliefs of western scenes around the base of a massive pedestal and platform, on top of which the pioneer woman "holds her child in the embrace of a Renaissance Madonna."&lt;ref&gt;Toone, Thomas, ''Mahoni Young: His Life and Art'', Signature Books, Salt Lake City Utah, 1997 pp. 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of spirited bison guard the stairs leading up the base. The voting public was not privy to Young's vision and his work showed poorly in the balloting. Young, who described not winning the competition as the worst disappointment in his career, did manage to get some of his ideas out in later works.

Toone also adds that the winning sculptor, Baker Bryant used, "a professional actress as his model, which produced a glamorous figure, representing Western myth more than reality."&lt;ref&gt;Toone, Thomas, ''Mahoni Young: His Life and Art'', Signature Books, Salt Lake City Utah, 1997 p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some questions raised about the winning design by [[Donald De Lue]], at that time Baker Bryant's assistant. De Lue's biographer, D. Roger Howlett makes several points about the ''Pioneer Woman'' statue.

[[File:Pioneer Woman by Wheeler Williams.jpg|thumb|145px|right|[[Wheeler Williams]] model, enlarged and cast in [[Liberty, Kansas]]]]

"it was especially on the "Pioneer Woman" that De Lue manifest his talent. . . .... Baker claimed that the conception and movement of the final monument was developed in an eight-to-ten inch sketch model made by him a few hours after he learned about the competition. De Lue executed the thirty-three inch competition model for the sculpture in 1927, with Baker supervising and completing the face."&lt;ref&gt;Howlett, D. Roger, ''The Sculpture of Donald De Lue: Gods, Prophets, and Heroes'', David R. Godine, Publisher, Boston 1990, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Baker was also the last sculptor to enter the contest having only one month to prepare his model.&lt;ref name="NYT29" /&gt;

James Earle Fraser based his almost Impressionistic statue on his favorite aunt, Dora, who was herself a pioneer woman. This model is unique among the ones submitted to the competition, and perhaps in the entire world of ''Pioneer Women'' Statues, in that the woman, caught breast feeding her child, exposes a bare breast. No stranger to multi-tasking, she still manages to hold on to her rifle while feeding the baby.&lt;ref&gt;Freundlich, A.L., ''The Sculpture of James Earle Fraser'', Universal Publishers 2001, pp. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years after the competition Wheeler Williams' model was re-discovered, enlarged, cast, and now sits in front of the public library in [[Liberty, Kansas]].

=== The tour ===
The submitted bronze models were unveiled at the Reinhardt Galleries in New York on February 26, 1927 where they remained in exhibition until March 19.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; At a dinner for the twelve finalists the evening before the models were revealed to the public, Marland announced:

{{quote|Pictures have we in plenty of the stern Pilgrim Fathers and the gallant gentlemen of the friendlier Virginia soil, but we are forced to draw on our imagination somewhat for pictures of the mothers. When these women started West all their earthly possessions could be packed on a horse or in a wagon. What sturdy broods they bore, ever pushing westward, ever making homes on the lands their husbands gained.

The toll of life resulting from their hardships left millions of unmarked graves across this continent, graves of women who dies that we might live and love this homeland.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;}}

Marland reserved the right to make the final choice for the monument, but he sought input from the public and so these models then began a tour of museums and art galleries across the nation.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT4"&gt;{{cite news|title=VOTE ON "PIONEER WOMAN.": Bryant Baker's Statue in the Lead -- H.A. MacNeil's Second.|date=March 20, 1927|page=E6|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its opening at the Reinhardt Galleries, the tour moved on. Stops included [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Detroit]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], and [[Ponca City, Oklahoma|Ponca City]].&lt;ref name="CSM1"&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Sculptor Wins Prize for Typifying Pioneer Women |author=SPECIAL FROM MONITOR BUREAU |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |page=3 |date= December 21, 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At each location visitors were invited to vote for their three favorite models.&lt;ref name="NYT29" /&gt; In all over 750,000 people viewed the models and over 120,000 votes were placed.&lt;ref name="CSM1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT25" /&gt;

The models were the subject of much discussion at the time, and photographs of them were included in full-page pictorials of both the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[LA Times]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT24"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |page=RP4 |date= February 27, 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT5"&gt;{{cite news |title=HEART OF THE WEST |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=I4 |date= May 1, 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art critics discussed the merits of one model over another and almost universally lambasting the sunbonnets as "terrible headwear". The models were even the subject of writing assignments for elementary school art classes.&lt;ref name="NYT30"&gt;{{cite news|title=PUPILS ANALYZE PIONEER WOMEN: Children in Art Course Favor Most the Design Showing Gun and Arrow—Some Impressed By Babe and Bible Details|date=February 27, 1927|page=RP4|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''L.A. Times'' reported that art critic Helen Appleton Read felt that "no adequate tribute had been paid to the pioneer woman" and that "most of the competitors failed to produce anything monumental".&lt;ref name="LAT1"&gt;{{cite news|title=OF INTEREST TO ARTISTS|date=May 1, 1927|pages=36–37|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 1927, E. W. Marland's son George announced that Bryant Baker's model was selected as the winner. Baker's model received the most votes in 11 cities and Gregory's was the second most popular, being the favorite in three cities.&lt;ref name="NYT25"&gt;{{cite news |title=PICKS BAKER STATUE OF 'PIONEER WOMAN': Marland Names Winner Among 12 Sculptors for Monument in Oklahoma. POPULAR VOTE THE FACTOR Young Woman, With Bible, Leading Her Son Typifies Hardy Spirit of the Early Days. |newspaper=New York Times |page=9 |date= March 20, 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the tour of the models was over, Baker's ''Pioneer Woman'' had won first place, out-balloting John Gregory's effort 42,478 to 37,782. "De Lue set to work in 1928 and 1929, modeling it in Baker's Brooklyn studio, working with Jean La Seure, the enlarger. De Lue later remembered: "One day Bryant decided he would work on it, and did some work. I said, 'Look, Bryant, if I were you I'd get the hell out of here, because you're not helping at all,' He said, 'Thank you very much.' and he went."&lt;ref&gt;Howlett, D. Roger, ''The Sculpture of Donald De Lue: Gods, Prophets, and Heroes'', David R. Godine, Publisher, Boston 1990 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fundraising and construction ===
The cost of the ''Pioneer Woman'' project was approximately $350,000.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news |title=MARLAND PRAISES WOMEN PIONEERS: Describes Hardship at Dinner for 12 Sculptors Competing for Huge Memorial.

While the vast majority of the project was funded by Marland, his fortunes were on the decline at this time and so he was forced to seek additional funding to complete the project. Some private fundraising helped to defray the final costs and $25,000 was supplied by [[Lew Wentz]], Marland's long-time business rival as well as fellow philanthropist of Ponca City.  After much private debate and encouragement, Lew Wentz in 1929 loaned money to Marland enabling him to make final payments for the statue, secured by a real estate mortgage and arranged by a local banker, resulting in Wentz filing a lawsuit in 1936 to collect on the non-performing loan [see ''Ada Weekly News'', 12 March 1936].

Marland had purchased 2,000 acres on which to place the statue.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt; The area where the statue was erected stands just off of U.S. Route 77, a mile northeast of the center of Ponca City.&lt;ref name="NYT14" /&gt;

Baker said the work took years off of his life and he was afraid he would die before completion.

=== Dedication ===
[[File:Pioneer Woman Historical Statue Ponca City, Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|The ''Pioneer Woman'' statue and base.]]
On April 16, 1930 it was announced that the statue would be unveiled on April 22, 1930 on the 41st anniversary of the [[Land Run of 1889]] which opened the Oklahoma Territory to settlers. The day was declared a state holiday&lt;ref name="NYT7"&gt;{{cite news |title=TO HONOR PIONEER WOMEN: Statue by Bryant Baker to Be Unveiled in Ponca City, Okla., Tuesday. |newspaper=New York Times |page=5 |date= April 17, 1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the governor and the celebration in Ponca City included a parade, 19-gun salute. An estimated 40,000 people attended the unveiling.&lt;ref name="NYT15"&gt;{{cite news |title=THE PIONEER WOMAN |newspaper=New York Times |page=19 |date= April 29, 1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dedication itself began at 1:30 pm central time with a nationwide radio address on [[Blue Network|WJZ]] by [[United States President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] broadcasting from the White House.&lt;ref name="NYT8"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |page=114 |date= April 20, 1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the native Oklahoman, Secretary of War [[Patrick J.

Other speakers during the 90 minute broadcast were Marland, Baker, Episcopal Bishop of Oklahoma [[Thomas Casady]], Oklahoma Governor [[William J. Holloway]], and Oklahoma humorist, [[Will Rogers]], who closed the unveiling ceremonies.&lt;ref name="NYT14"&gt;{{cite news |author=Special to The New York Times.|title=THE PIONEER WOMAN PRAISED BY HOOVER: President, by Radio, Aids Unveiling of Bronze Group at Ponca City, Okla.

{{rquote|left|Mr. Chairman and fellow-citizens gathered at Ponca City:

It is a pleasure both to address a great audience gathered to do honor to the pioneer woman and to support my friend, the Secretary of War, who, to your and my misfortune, cannot yet leave his room from recent illness, from which happily he is on the road to recover.

There are few men of the West of my generation who did not know the pioneer woman in his own mother, and who does not rejoice to know that her part in building that great civilization is to have such beautiful recognition.

It was those women who carried the refinement, the moral character and spiritual force into the West. Not only they bore great burdens of daily toil and the rearing of families, but they were intent that their children should have a chance, that the doors of opportunity should be open to them. It was their insistence which made the schools and the churches.

But it is my duty to introduce a product of the pioneer woman of Oklahoma, who has risen high in the councils of the nation—and high in the esteem of the whole country—the Secretary of War, Patrick J. Hurley.&lt;ref name="NYT14" /&gt;|Herbert Hoover}}

{{rquote|center|In the erection of this monument, we pledge a reverence to the woman who has laid the foundation of the character of our community, State and nation. This tribute to her memory will keep the fundamental principles of her character constantly before the people of Oklahoma. Every citizen who passes this way and looks upon this memorial will be strengthened in the conviction that this State shall be kept worthy of the woman whom this bronze statue commemorates.

... &lt;!--... a late tribute to the sterling character of the pioneer woman. --&gt;

Woman has never been given her just place in history as a pioneer, an educator, a builder, or as a leader. This is probably due to the fact that most of the pages of history are written by men about men.

Historians have been so busy with the lives of great sons that they have not stopped to immortalize the mothers who produced them. The characters of men are molded by women. We have reached that period in civilization where we are fair enough to accord to woman the honor of the pre-eminent part she has taken in shaping the destinies of mankind.

The woman has held the objectives gained by the man. She has been the bulwark ever standing between civilization and barbarism. The pioneer woman has played her part in the conquest of nature through all the ages.

We cannot evaluate her character without any appreciation of her intelligence. Here was an intelligence that quickly and clearly recognized that the three great pillars of democratic government are religion, education and the home. She trusted in God and was a firm believer in the efficacy of prayer.&lt;ref name="NYT14" /&gt;|Patrick J. Hurley}}

=== History since dedication ===
The area surrounding the statue has been designated as Pioneer Woman State Park.
[[File:Pioneer woman tee shirt.jpg|thumb|159px|right|Image of the statue used on a [[tee-shirt]]]]

=== The Pioneer Woman Museum ===

On September 16, 1958, the 65th anniversary of the [[Land Run of 1893|opening]] of the [[Cherokee Outlet]] which included the land of Ponca City, the state opened the Pioneer Woman Museum, on land adjacent to the monument.&lt;ref name="Tulsa11"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gene Curtis |title=Only in Oklahoma: Pioneer woman's spirit preserved in bronze|newspaper=Tulsa World |page=A4 |date= April 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An image of the ''Pioneer Woman'' statue serves as the de facto logo of the museum.

== Access and attributes ==

=== Location and visiting ===
The statue resides on a {{convert|5.5|acre|km2}} park.

=== Physical characteristics ===
The bronze statue itself stands {{convert|17|ft|m|sigfig=2}} tall and weighs {{convert|12000|lb|kg|sigfig=2}}. It stands on a pyramidal stepped base of granite blocks which brings the total height of the monument to {{convert|40|ft|m|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name="NYT7" /&gt;

The statue faces to the southwest, symbolising that the majority of the settlers had come from the northeast.

There is a plaque on the first step beneath the statue which reads:
{{cquote|{{smallcaps|this monument was erected by e. w. marland in appreciation &lt;br /&gt;of the heroic character of the woman who braved the&lt;br /&gt;dangers and endured the hardships incident to the daily&lt;br /&gt;life of the pioneer and homesteader in this country&lt;/span&gt;}}}}

[[File:Pioneer recipes.jpg|thumb|202px|right|Image used on cook book cover.]]

== Depictions ==
The image of the ''Pioneer Woman'' has long been a symbol of Ponca City.

In 1941 as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] presented gold and bronze medals with a [[bas-relief]] of the ''Pioneer Woman'' to prominent and long-standing members.&lt;ref name="NYT20"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kathleen M'Laughlin |title=CLUBWOMEN PLAN FUND OF $1,000,000: Foundation Will Be Expanded by Federation to Mark Golden Jubilee in 1941 TEA WITH MRS.

The statue is also the official emblem of the four-state [[Ozark Frontier Trail]].&lt;ref name="Trib3"&gt;{{cite news |author=Edward A Coolier |title=Ozark Frontier Trail Winds Thru History Area Also Rich in Recreation, Scenic Beauty Ozark Frontier Trail Hits Highlights of Four States Sights Linked with History of West. |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date= May 10, 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trib4"&gt;{{cite news |author=Bill Thomas |title=THE TRIBUNE TRAVELERS' GUIDE: Ozark Frontier Trail Leads to Adventure. |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date= June 5, 1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[State Quarter]] for Oklahoma was to be issued in 2008, there was a statewide call for proposals to be sent to the Mint for final design work. From the thousands of designs received, five were sent along to the mint. Four of the five submitted designs included the ''Pioneer Woman''. When the professional designs returned from the mint in order for the people of Oklahoma to decide on the final design by voting amongst them, none of the designs included the book which is held under the ''Pioneer Woman''{{'}}s arm. As this book is often thought to be a [[Bible]],&lt;ref name="NYT4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT14" /&gt; this was viewed as an attempt at censorship by the government and caused a statewide controversy. Eventually the fifth design was selected.

That the book was intended to be the Bible was made clear by Baker in an interview in which he stated, "In trying to symbolize the Pioneer Woman of America I wanted to depict Courage and Faith... The Bible was a vital factor in building up this country, and it often was the one indispensable book, recording the facts of the family life, of births, marriages and death and often the only reading material available for mothers to teach their children to read and write in those days."&lt;ref&gt;"Sculptor's View of Monument", ''Ponca City News'', Sunday September 15, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivative works==
There have been several notable works of sculpture proposed or produced in the years following the unveiling of the ''Pioneer Woman'' based on it.  The first one was the Kansas Pioneer Woman Memorial.  A competition by the Pioneer Women's Memorial association&lt;ref&gt;Topeka Journal, January 28, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; was held and, as in the competition for the Ponca City statue, Bryant Baker was the winner. A Kansas critic at the time pointed out, "There is a striking similarity in the appearance of the two works despite many actual differences."&lt;ref&gt;''Topeka Journal'', February ? 1929&lt;/ref&gt;  However this version of a Kansas monument was never completed.  In 1937 the Pioneer Women's Memorial association presided over the unveiling of the Kansas Pioneer Memorial by Kansas born sculptor [[Merrell Gage]],&lt;ref&gt;''Topeka State Journal'', May 11, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; a work very different from Baker's.

In 1959 a 36' tall fiberglass sculpture by Gordon Shumaker&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Moira A., ‘’Monumental Minnesota: A Guide to Outdoor Sculpture’’, Pogp Press Inc.,  1992 p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; was produced to commemorate the first 100 years of the [[Minnesota State Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;''Minnesota State Fair: The history and heritage of 100 years'', p. 311-312&lt;/ref&gt;  It stands in front of the Pioneer Building.  Like the Ponca City statue, it depicts a bonneted woman in ankle length dress striding forward, and like its predecessor, she holds a large book/Bible in her right crooked arm as well as carrying a large bundle on the same arm. At 36 feet tall she more closely approaches the monumentality that Marland was originally seeking for his work.

''Hardship and Dreams'' was the title of a sculpture by [[Dorothy Koelling]] (1913-2004) unveiled in [[Wichita, Kansas]] on June 28, 1994.  A newspaper article at that time described the work as being, "inspired by the monumental 'Pioneer Woman' in Ponca City, Okla."&lt;ref&gt;Holman, Rhoda, ''Sculpture recalls hardship, dreams'', The ''Wichita Eagle'', June 27, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Koeling's six foot tall statue depicts the bonneted pioneer woman, carrying a large book/Bible and bundle in her right arm, marching forward with her flatfooted son, whose hand she holds, next to her.&lt;ref&gt;Polk,  Chris Paulsen, ‘’Beautifying Wichita through Sculpture’’, Project Beauty, Inc. Wichita Kansas, 1995, c. 1980 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

A plot twist may be [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]], to prepare the audience to accept it. There are a variety of methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience or misleading them with ambiguous or false information.

Revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a "[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]", since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience not expecting it. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lehrer, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don’t Spoil Anything], '' Wired Science Blogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early examples==

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale "[[The Three Apples]]". It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator's own slave.

==Mechanics==
{{section refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
''[[Anagnorisis]]'', or discovery, is the protagonist's sudden recognition of their own or another character's true identity or nature.&lt;ref name="Baldick2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'': [[Oedipus]] kills his father and marries his mother in ignorance, learning the truth only toward the climax of the play.&lt;ref&gt;John MacFarlane, "Aristotle's Definition of Anagnorisis." ''American Journal of Philology'' - Volume 121, Number 3 (Whole Number 483), Fall 2000, pp. 367-383.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a [[crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.&lt;ref name=Pinault&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marzolph&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he didn't survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled "[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]", the viewer discovers at the climax that the characters are discarded toys in a [[clothing bin|donation bin]].&lt;!-- This fact is self evident by watching the episode.--&gt; In ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', [[Edward Norton]]'s character realizes that Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]) is his own [[multiple personality]]. A mental patient in the horror film ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is, in fact, unknown, as in ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' or the eponymous assassins in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Flashback===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]], or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain's past victims, as [[Sergio Leone]] did with [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' or [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Odessa File]]''. The TV series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' and manga (twice made into a movie) ''[[Old Boy (manga)|Old Boy]]'' uses similar twists.

===Unreliable narrator===
An [[unreliable narrator]] twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Motif (literature)|motif]] is often used within [[noir fiction]] and [[Film noir|films]], notably in the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', a novel that generated much controversy due to critics' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224193140/http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-12-24 |title=The ubiquitous unreliable narrator |publisher=My.en.com |date=1996-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (and [[David Fincher]]'s [[Fight Club|film adaptation]]), [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Book of the New Sun]]'', the second episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', [[Iain Pears]]'s ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]''.

===Peripeteia===
''[[Peripeteia]]'' is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character's circumstances.&lt;ref name="PayneBarbera2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Payne|author2=Jessica Rae Barbera|title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjSl5y_i8TEC&amp;pg=PA689|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=31 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2346-7|page=689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''deus ex machina'' device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode "[[Time Enough at Last]]" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.

===Deus ex machina===
''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning "god out of the machine." It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.&lt;ref name="Shipley1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the "deus ex machina" ('ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. In its modern, figurative sense, the "deus ex machina" brings about an ending to a narrative through unexpected (generally happy) resolution to what appears to be a problem that cannot be overcome (see [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]''). This device is often used to end a bleak story on a more positive note.

===Poetic justice===
[[Poetic justice]] is a literary device in which [[virtue]] is ultimately rewarded or [[vice]] punished in such a way that the reward or punishment has a logical connection to the deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA439|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=439|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern literature, this device is often used to create an [[Irony|ironic]] twist of fate in which the villain gets caught up in his/her own trap. For example, in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'', Prince Rabadash climbs upon a mounting block during the battle in Archenland. Upon jumping down while shouting "The bolt of [[Tash (Narnia)|Tash]] falls from above," his [[hauberk]] catches on a hook and leaves him hanging there, humiliated and trapped. Another example of poetic justice can be found in [[John Boyne]]'s ''[[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas]]'', in which a [[concentration camp]] commander's son is mistakenly caught up with inmates rounded up for gassing, or in [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s picture book, ''[[The Sweetest Fig]]'', where a cold-hearted dentist is cruel to his dog, and ends up getting his comeuppance.

===Chekhov's gun===
[[Chekhov's gun]] refers to a seemingly minor character or plot element introduced early in the narrative that suddenly acquires great importance to the narrative. One example of this is the beggar woman in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]''. At the end of the musical, she is revealed to be the main character's wife.&lt;ref name="BergmanLambert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory Bergman|author2=Josh Lambert|title=Geektionary: From Anime to Zettabyte, An A to Z Guide to All Things Geek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbYLQfZrUPcC&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=18 December 2010|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-1188-2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mechanism is the "plant", a preparatory device that repeats throughout the story. During the resolution, the true significance of the plant is revealed.

===Red herring===
A [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.&lt;ref name="Asong2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named "Bishop Aringarosa" draw attention away from the true master villain ("Aringarosa" literally translates as "pink herring"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel [[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]] (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].

=== False protagonist ===
A [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins.

===In medias res===
''[[In medias res]]'' ([[Latin]] for "into the middle of things") is a literary technique in which narrative proceeds from the middle of the story rather than its beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Clifford|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information such as characterization, setting, and motive is revealed through a series of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s. This technique creates a twist when the cause for the inciting incident is not revealed until the climax. This technique is used within the film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' in which the opening scenes show one of the main characters drowning and the other being imprisoned. Subsequent scenes reveal the events leading up to these situations through a series of flashbacks. In ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'', a similar beginning proves to be a flashforward as it is the linear conclusion of the events that then follow; this is not apparent until the end. ''In medias res'' is often used to provide a [[narrative hook]].

===Non-linear narrative===
A [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.&lt;ref name="Steiff2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc. Productions |publisher=Plotsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse chronology===
[[Reverse chronology]] works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event.&lt;ref name="Philips2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Edward Philips|title=Writing African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq5wGaae5qkC&amp;pg=PA507|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-256-3|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a "twist ending". Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]] and the [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

A '''precentor''' is a person who helps facilitate worship.  The details vary depending on the religion, denomination, and era in question. The [[Latin]] derivation is "præcentor", from [[cantor (church)|cantor]], meaning "the one who sings before" (or alternatively, "first singer").

==Ancient precentors==

The chief precentor was the highest position in many [[ancient Mesopotamia]]n cities (see [[Music of Mesopotamia]]).

==Jewish precentors==

Jewish precentors are song or prayer leaders, leading [[synagogue music]].  A Jewish precentor is typically called a [[hazzan]] or [[Cantor in Reform Judaism|cantor]]. In the Middle Ages, women precentors leading prayers in the ''weibershul'' (women's gallery) were known as [[firzogerin]], vorsangerin, foreleiner, zugerin, or zugerke.

==Christian precentors==

[[File:View from Precentor's Court.jpg|thumb|left|A view of [[York Minster]] from a street named Precentor's Court.]]

A precentor is a member of a church who helps facilitate worship.  The role of precentor was carried over from the [[synagogue]]s into the early church.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, Dr. Ron: ''[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201194151/http://www.haydid.org/yeshron1.htm Yeshua: A Guide to the Real Jesus and the Original Church]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic precentors===
{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}

====Ancient era====
The term ''precentor'' described sometimes an [[ecclesiastical]] dignitary, sometimes an administrative or ceremonial officer. Anciently, the precentor had various duties: he was the first or leading chanter, who on Sundays and greater feasts intoned certain [[antiphons]], [[psalms]], [[hymns]], [[responsories]] etc.; gave the pitch or tone to the [[bishop]] and [[Dean (religion)|dean]] at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (the [[succentor]] performing a similar office to the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] and [[clerk (choral)|clerks]]); recruited and taught the [[choir]], directed its [[rehearsal]]s and supervised its official functions; interpreted the [[rubric]]s and explained the [[ceremonies]], ordered in a general way the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] and sometimes composed desired [[hymns]], [[Sequence (religion)|sequences]], and [[Lection|lessons]] of [[saints]]. He was variously styled ''capiscol'' (from the Latin ''caput scholæ'', head of the choir-school), ''[[prior]] scholæ'', ''magister scholæ'', and ''primicerius'' (a word of widely different implications). [[Victor of St. Hugo]] tells us that in the care of the primicerius were placed the [[acolytes]], [[exorcism|exorcists]], [[lector]]s, and psalmists (chanters).

====Middle Ages====
In the [[Middle Ages]] the principal dignitaries of [[cathedral]], [[chapter (religion)|collegiate chapter]]s, and [[monastic]] orders, imitated the example of [[St. Gregory the Great]] in acting as directors of chant-schools. The [[schola]] was always in attendance when the bishop officiated in his cathedral, and to the precentor was assigned a place near the bishop and high in dignity. His office was obviously one demanding much learning and executive ability, and his dignity corresponded with his duties.

In the cathedrals of England, France, Spain, and Germany, he ranked sometimes next to the dean, sometimes next to the [[archdeacon]]. In some instances his sphere of activity was much broader, including the duty of installing deans, canons, and other dignitaries; and in some [[monasteries]], the duties of librarian and registrar. But from the fourteenth century his title and dignity were largely handed over to incumbents whose musical knowledge did not fit them for the duties to which the name of precentor owed its origin; the dignities remained, but the duties became obscured. "In France, some chapters retain traces of the dignity of Precentor, and one may see sometimes an archdeacon, sometimes a titular or honorary canon, carrying the baton cantoral, the insignia of his office".&lt;ref&gt;[[Migne]], "Dict. de Droit Canon", s.v. Chantre.&lt;/ref&gt; This "baton cantoral" is a silver or white staff. "In the dioceses of Aix, Carcassonne, Coutances, Dijon, Metz, Orléans, the dignity of Precentor is still the highest in the chapter.... Some chapters have sub-chanters, those of Arras being among the honorary resident canons",&lt;ref&gt;Migne, "Dict. de Jurisprudence", s.v. Grand Chantre.&lt;/ref&gt; where also the quoted statutes of the [[Bishop of Dijon]] may serve to illustrate the modern idea of the office of precentor: "The Précenteur or Grand Chantre is the head of the choir and ... brings the antiphon to the bishop when officiating pontifically. [[Sacristan]]s, chanters, choir-boys, and employés of the Cathedral are placed under his surveillance. He will also preserve order and silence in the sacristy").&lt;ref&gt;Henry, H. (1911). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12372a.htm "Precentor"]. In ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved June 15, 2010 from New Advent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/glossary/precentor.php Precentor], The Cistercians in Yorkshire. Retrieved June 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican precentors===

A precentor is a person, usually a clergy member, who is in charge of preparing worship services. This position is usually held in a large church. Most [[cathedral]]s have a precentor in charge of the organisation of liturgy and worship. The precentor of a cathedral is usually a residentiary [[canon (priest)|canon]] or [[prebendary]], and may be assisted by a [[succentor]] (particularly in the daily task of leading choral singing). In some cathedrals (including [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]]), the Precentor is a [[minor Canon]], and therefore part of the Foundation, but not part of the Chapter.
[[File:Pulpit and Communion Table in Duirinish Church - geograph.org.uk - 1548755.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The [[pulpit]] and [[communion table]] from the [[Church of Scotland]] church in [[Duirinish, Skye]]. Between the two is the box for the precentor.]]
Traditionally the precentor's [[choir stall|stall]] (seat) in the cathedral is on the opposite side of the [[Choir (architecture)|Quire]] from that of the Dean, leading to the traditional division of the [[choir|singers]] into [[Decani]] (the Dean's side) and [[Cantoris]] (the precentor's side).

===Presbyterian precentors===

In Presbyterian churches that worship in the historical fashion (i.e., sing [[a cappella]]; see [[Presbyterian worship]]), a precentor is a person (man or woman, not necessarily clergy) who leads the singing, often by means of [[conducting]] techniques, but sometimes just by singing from amongst the congregation.

Churches that use a repeat-after-me manner of singing called [[lining out]] (used primarily when sufficient numbers of [[psalter|psalm books]] are unavailable, or the congregation insufficiently literate, as was the case in the black church in [[Harper Lee]]'s [[To Kill a Mockingbird]]) are usually led by the precentor, much as with other non-instrumental churches.

===Public schools and Cambridge===

The word "precentor" is also used at two English public schools, Radley College and Eton College, to refer to the Head of Music. These school precentors have no specific religious duties although, as part of their musical function, they may conduct the college chapel choir. At [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], the precentor's main responsibility is as director of the college choir, which provides music for chapel services.

{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}
In the [[music industry]], a '''reissue''' (also '''re-release''', or '''repackage''', or '''re-edition''') is the release of an [[album]] or [[Single (music)|single]] which has been released at least once before, sometimes with alterations or additions.

==Reasons for reissue==

===New audio formats===

Recordings originally released in an audio format that has become technologically or commercially obsolete are reissued in new formats. For example, thousands of original [[vinyl record|vinyl]] albums have been reissued on [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CDs]] since introduction of that format in the early 1980s. More recently, many albums originally released on CD or earlier formats have been reissued on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] or [[DVD-Audio]].

===Budget records===

Beginning with [[Pickwick Records]], which acquired the rights to reissue many of [[Capitol Records]]' non-current albums at a low price in venues other than record stores, several record companies started "budget" or "[[drugstore records]]" subsidiaries to sell their deleted items at lower prices.

===New ownership===

When one record label buys out another record label or acquires an individual recording artist's back catalogue, their albums are often reissued on the purchasing label. For example, [[Polydor Records]] reissued many of [[James Brown]]'s albums which were originally released on his former label, [[King Records (USA)|King Records]]. King Records had itself previously reissued albums and [[Single (music)|single]]s by Brown that were originally recorded for its subsidiary label, [[Federal Records]].

===Strong or weak sales===

Recordings are reissued to meet continuing [[demand]] for an album that continues to be popular after its original release. In other cases, albums are reissued to create interest in and hopefully revive the sales of a release which has sold poorly. For example, the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] label [[Roadrunner Records]] is notorious for reissuing their artist's works' only months after releasing the original album. According to US music magazine ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', reissues target "casual consumers who hadn't picked up the album when it was originally released, as well as obsessives who need to own every song in an artist's catalog."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6304512/beyonce-platinum-edition-box-set-essay?facebook_20141104 |title=Beyonce's Platinum Edition: Feeling a Twinge of Disappointment About The False Rumors |first=Jason |last=Lipshutz |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |location=New York |date=November 4, 2014 |accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special, Limited and Commemorative Editions===

Some recordings are reissued to celebrate their popularity, influence, or an [[anniversary]] of the artist or the recording.

===Track controversy and revisionism===

Some recordings are reissued soon after their original release because one of the tracks was seen in a negative light. "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]" by [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]] was one such example.

Some recordings are [[remix]]ed and reissued in an effort to erase prior band member’s contributions.  Two such examples were [[Ozzy Osbourne]]’s ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]'' and ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/ozzy_osbourne_classic_album_reissues_due_in_may.html|title= Classic Album Reissues, due in May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ultimateclassicrock.com/former-ozzy-osbourne-bandmate-bob-daisley-dishes-dirt-on-last-years-ozzy-reissues|title= Ultimate Classic Rock, on last year’s Ozzy reissues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alterations==
Common additions to reissued albums include:

* Audio [[Audio mastering|remastering]]
* Inclusion of [[bonus track]]s or [[multimedia]] content
* New [[liner notes]]
* New [[album art]] or [[packaging]]
* Modifiers in the title such as "[[Special Edition]]" or "Expanded Version"

==Reissues and certification==
For the purposes of quantifying sales, an album's original and subsequent releases are counted together. For example, if an album sold 300,000 of its original release and 700,000 in subsequent reissues, it would be entitled to [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] certification. However, the musical contents of the original disc must remain the same on a reissue for it to count towards certification.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Reissue labels==
Some [[record label]]s specialize in reissuing recordings originally released on other labels. Three of the biggest reissue labels are [[Rhino Records]], [[Hip-O Records]], and [[Legacy Recordings]]. Each of these companies reissues material from the labels of a major music [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]: [[Warner Music Group]], [[Universal Music Group]], and [[Sony BMG]], respectively. [[Collectables Records]] is another prolific reissue label that [[license]]s recordings from other labels.

'''Richard George Rogers, Baron Rogers of Riverside''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CH|FRIBA|FCSD|FREng|RA}} (born 23 July 1933) is a British architect noted for his [[modernist]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] designs in [[high-tech architecture]].

Rogers is perhaps best known for his work on the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Centre]] in Paris, the [[Lloyd's building]] and [[Millennium Dome]] both in London, the [[Senedd]] in [[Cardiff]], and the [[European Court of Human Rights building]] in Strasbourg. He is a winner of the [[Royal Gold Medal|RIBA Gold Medal]], the [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Architecture|Thomas Jefferson Medal]], the RIBA [[Stirling Prize]], the [[Chartered Society of Designers|Minerva Medal]] and [[Pritzker Prize]]. He is a Senior Partner at [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]], previously known as the Richard Rogers Partnership.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Lloyds building, London at night.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lloyd's building]] in 1991]]
Richard Rogers was born in [[Florence]] ([[Tuscany]]) in 1933 into an Anglo-Italian family. His father, William Nino Rogers (1906–1993), was the cousin of Italian architect [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]]. His ancestors moved from [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] to [[Venice]] in about 1800, later settling in [[Trieste]], [[Milan]] and [[Florence]]. In 1939 William Nino Rogers decided to come back to England.&lt;ref name="RR"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=o6P1DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT450&amp;lpg=PT450&amp;dq=su+brumwell+born+1939&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ksQX9UX1sO&amp;sig=ZKbN6GMza8xl8q67zqytrKd0HKs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnov3i-Y7WAhWmBcAKHRw7DPsQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=su%20brumwell%20born%201939&amp;f=false| title=Richard Rogers | publisher=Canongate Books| accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon moving to England, Richard Rogers went to [[St John's School, Leatherhead|St Johns School, Leatherhead]]. Rogers did not excel academically, which made him believe that he was "stupid because he could not read or memorize his school work"&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt; and as a consequence he stated that he became "very depressed".&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt; He wasn't able to read until the age of 11,&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nyc-architecture.com/ARCH/ARCH-ROGERS.htm| title=Richard Rogers | publisher=www.nyc-architecture.com| accessdate=31 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until after he had his first child that he realised that he was dyslexic.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt; After leaving St Johns School, he undertook a foundation course at Epsom School of Art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/stirling-prize-for-architecture-2006--riba-uk-|title=Stirling Prize for Architecture 2006 (RIBA UK), Studio International|last=Spens|first=Michael|website=Studio International - Visual Arts, Design and Architecture|language=en-gb|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[University for the Creative Arts]]) before going into [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] between 1951 and 1953.&lt;ref name="RR"/&gt; He then attended the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] in London, where he gained the Architectural Association's Diploma (AA Dipl) from 1954 until 1959, subsequently graduating with a master's degree (M Arch) from the [[Yale School of Architecture]] in 1962 on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]].&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://dyslexia.yale.edu/rogers.html | title= Richard Rogers, Architect | publisher=[[Yale School of Medicine]] | accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.richardrogers.co.uk/render.aspx?siteID=1&amp;navIDs=1,{{formatnum:518107}} | title=Richard Rogers | publisher=Richard Rogers Partnerships | accessdate=31 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying at Yale, Rogers met fellow architecture student [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and planning student [[Su Rogers|Su Brumwell]].

After leaving Yale he joined [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; On returning to England in 1963, he, Norman Foster and Brumwell set up architectural practice as [[Team 4]] with [[Wendy Foster|Wendy Cheeseman]] (Brumwell later married Rogers, Cheeseman married Foster).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Lambot (Ed.), "Norman Foster&amp;#58; Buildings and Projects Volume 1 1964–1973", Watermark Publications (1991), pp. 14–15, {{ISBN|1-873200-01-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers and Foster earned a reputation for what was later termed by the media [[high-tech architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://designmuseum.org/design/richard-rogers|publisher=Design Museum|title=Richard Rogers + Architects – From the House to the City|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1967, Team 4 had split up, but Rogers continued to collaborate with [[Su Rogers]], along with John Young and Laurie Abbott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsh-p.com/Asp/uploadedFiles/Image/News/RR_pritzker.pdf|title=Richard Rogers, Pritzker Speech|publisher=[[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]]|accessdate=11 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715210750/http://www.rsh-p.com/Asp/uploadedFiles/Image/News/RR_pritzker.pdf|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1968 he was commissioned to design a house and studio for [[Humphrey Spender]] near [[Maldon, Essex]], a glass cube framed with I-beams. He continued to develop his ideas of prefabrication and structural simplicity to design a Wimbledon house for his parents. This was based on ideas from his conceptual [[Zip-Up House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Rogers-EN/ENS-Rogers-EN.html#beginnings|title=Richard Rogers: Beginnings|publisher=Pompidou Centre|accessdate=23 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424022301/http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Rogers-EN/ENS-Rogers-EN.html#beginnings|archivedate=24 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the use of standardized components based on refrigerator panels to make energy-efficient buildings.

[[File:Pompidou center.jpg|thumb|left|Pompidou Centre]]

Rogers subsequently joined forces with Italian architect [[Renzo Piano]], a partnership that was to prove fruitful. His career leapt forward when he, Piano and [[Gianfranco Franchini]] won the [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] for the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Centre]] in July 1971, alongside a team from [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup]] that included Irish engineer [[Peter Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrepompidou.fr/pompidou/Communication.nsf/0/B90DF3E7C7F18CAEC1256D970053FA6D?OpenDocument&amp;sessionM=3.1.12&amp;L=2 |publisher=Centre Pompidou website |title=Architecture of the Building |accessdate=3 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204030132/http://www.centrepompidou.fr/pompidou/Communication.nsf/0/B90DF3E7C7F18CAEC1256D970053FA6D?OpenDocument&amp;sessionM=3.1.12&amp;L=2 |archivedate=4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This building established Rogers's trademark of exposing most of the building's services (water, heating and ventilation ducts, and stairs) on the exterior, leaving the internal spaces uncluttered and open for visitors to the centre's art exhibitions. This style, dubbed "[[Bowellism]]" by some critics, was not universally popular at the time the centre opened in 1977, but today the Pompidou Centre is a widely admired Parisian landmark. Rogers revisited this inside-out style with his design for London's [[Lloyd's building]], completed in 1986 – another controversial design which has since become a famous and distinctive landmark in its own right.

==Later career==
[[File:Richard Rogers talking about the Lloyd's building (London).png|thumb|upright|Richard Rogers in 2013]]

After working with Piano, Rogers established the [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners|Richard Rogers Partnership]] along with [[Marco Goldschmied]], [[Mike Davies (architect)|Mike Davie]]s and John Young in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/Business-international/Competitively-speaking-a-born-organiser-Marco-Goldschmied-of-Richard-Rogers-Partnership-is-being-tip.html#ixzz0shxml2TU|title= Competitively speaking: a born organiser, Marco Goldschmied of Richard Rogers Partnership is being tipped as a possible future RIBA president|publisher= Advameg Inc. |accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]] in 2007. The firm maintains offices in London, Shanghai and Sydney.

Rogers has devoted much of his later career to wider issues surrounding architecture, urbanism, sustainability and the ways in which cities are used. One early illustration of his thinking was an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1986, entitled "''London As It Could Be''", which also featured the work of [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and Rogers' former partner Norman Foster. This exhibition made public a series of proposals for transforming a large area of central London, subsequently dismissed as impractical by the city's authorities.

In 1995, he became the first architect to deliver the BBC's annual [[Reith Lectures]]. This series of five talks, titled Sustainable City, were later adapted into the book ''Cities for a Small Planet'' (Faber and Faber: London 1997, {{ISBN|0-571-17993-2}}). The BBC made these lectures available to the public for download in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13891740 | publisher=BBC News | title=BBC Radio 4 unveils 60 years of Reith Lectures archive | date=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he set up the Urban Task Force at the invitation of the British government, to help identify causes of urban decline and establish a vision of safety, vitality and beauty for Britain's cities. This work resulted in a [[white paper]], ''[[Towards an Urban Renaissance]]'', outlining more than 100 recommendations for future city designers. Rogers also served for several years as chair of the [[Greater London Authority]] panel for Architecture and [[Urbanism]]. He has been chair of the board of Trustees of [[The Architecture Foundation]]. From 2001 to 2008 he was chief advisor on architecture and urbanism to [[Mayor of London]] [[Ken Livingstone]]; he was subsequently asked to continue his role as an advisor by new mayor [[Boris Johnson]] in 2008. He stood down from the post in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=23738|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110604031741/http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=23738|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 June 2011|title=Richard Rogers steps down as advisor to mayor|publisher=Mayor of London's office|accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers has also served as an advisor to two mayors of Barcelona on urban strategies.

Amidst this extra-curricular activity, Rogers has continued to create controversial and iconic works. Perhaps the most famous of these, the [[Millennium Dome]], was designed by the Rogers practice in conjunction with engineering firm [[Buro Happold]] and completed in 1999. It was the subject of fierce political and public debate over the cost and contents of the exhibition it contained; the building itself cost £43 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardrogers.co.uk/render.aspx?siteID=1&amp;navIDs=1,4,25,661|title=Millennium Dome|publisher=RHSP|accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Rogers' practice was chosen as the architect of [[175 Greenwich Street|Tower 3]] of the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|new World Trade Center]] in New York City, replacing the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|old World Trade Center]] which was destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]].

Some of Rogers's recent plans have failed to get off the ground. The practice was appointed to design the replacement to the [[Birmingham Central Library|Central Library]] in the [[Eastside, Birmingham|Eastside]] of [[Birmingham]]; however, his plan was shelved for financial reasons. City Park Gate, the area adjacent to the land the library would have stood on, is now being designed by [[Ken Shuttleworth (architect)|Ken Shuttleworth]]'s [[Make Architects]].

Rogers has been awarded honorary degrees from several universities, including Alfonso X El Sabio University in Madrid, [[Oxford Brookes University]], the [[University of Kent]], the [[Czech Technical University in Prague]] and the [[Open University]]. In 1994, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the [[University of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bath.ac.uk/ceremonies/hongrads/ |title=Honorary Graduates 1989 to present  | publisher = [[University of Bath]] |website=bath.ac.uk |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palestine controversy==
In February 2006, Rogers hosted the inaugural meeting of the campaigning organisation Architects and Planners for Justice in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] (APJP) in his London offices. At that time his practice had secured a number of projects in New York, including the redevelopment of the [[Silvercup Studios]] site, a masterplan for the East River Waterfront and a commission for a $1.7 billion expansion of the [[Jacob K. Javits]] Convention Centre in Manhattan. Rogers however publicly dissociated himself from the group within weeks, following an outcry from generally pro-Israeli New York voters and politicians, which threatened him with the loss of prestigious commissions including projects in New York and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/03/post_87.html | publisher=The Guardian | location=London | title=Boiling point | date=9 March 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his withdrawal with the statement, "I unequivocally renounce Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine and have withdrawn my relationship with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/09/usa.israel | publisher=The Guardian | location=London | title=Israel-Palestine conflict engulfs Rogers's .7bn New York project | first=Oliver | last=Burkeman | date=9 March 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shushanik Kurghinian''' ({{lang-hy|Շուշանիկ Կուրղինյան}}; 18 August 1876 – 24 November 1927) was an [[Armenia]]n writer who became a catalyst in the development of [[socialist]] and [[feminist]] poetry. She gave voice to the voiceless and saw her role as a poet as profoundly political.

Her first poem was published in 1899 in ''Taraz'', and in 1900 her first short story appeared in the journal ''Aghbyur''. After founding the first [[Hunchakian]] women’s political group in [[Alexandrapol]], Kurghinian fled to [[Rostov on Don]] in order to escape arrests of the tsarist regime. Her first volume of poetry, ''Ringing of the Dawn'', was published in 1907, and one of her poems from this volume, "The Eagle's Love," was translated and included in [[Alice Stone Blackwell]]’s second anthology ''Armenian Poems: Rendered into English Verse'' (1917).

After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], in 1921 she returned to Soviet Armenia where she lived until her death. Throughout her lifetime, Kurghinian cultivated significant relationships with famous members of the Armenian artistic and literary worlds of her time, including [[Vrtanes Papazian]], [[Avetik Isahakian]], [[Hovhannes Toumanian]], and others.

==Biography==
[[File:Shushanik_Kurghinyan.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Shushanik Kurghinyan]]

Shushanik Kurghinian (née Popoljian) was born in [[Alexandrapol]], (present-day [[Gyumri]]), [[Armenia]], into a family of artisans. The young Shushanik benefited from the expansion of Armenian education to the working-class and attended an all-girls' primary school at a local monastery, before attending the Alexandrapol Arghutian Girls' School. In 1895 she studied at a Russian gymnasium, which was one of the many schools instituted by [[Tsar Alexander III]] to russify the Caucasus and expand the borders of [[Imperial Russia]]. At her school Kurghinian's literary ambition was known and encouraged by her teachers.

At twenty-one she married Arshak Kurghinian, a member of the socialist underground in the [[Caucasus]]. In 1903 she moved to [[Rostov on Don]] with her two children, while Arshak stayed in Alexandrapol. Experiencing utmost hardship and poverty, Kurghinian immersed herself in the Russian revolutionary milieu and some of her most powerfully charged poetry was written between 1907–1909, during the years of her affiliation with Rostov's proletarian underground.

''Arshaluysi ghoghanjner'' (Ringing of the Dawn), her first book of poetry was published in [[Nor Nakhijevan]] in 1907. It was a direct response to the failed [[revolution of 1905]] and was published with the assistance of [[Aleksandr Myasnikyan]]. Kurghinian's second volume was heavily criticized and rejected by tsarist censorship. From the late 1910s to the [[October Revolution]], she continued to write and participate in social projects, but her activities were curtailed by fragile health. In 1921, the year after the [[sovietization]] of Armenia, she moved back to Alexandrapol, her native city. In 1925 she traveled to [[Kharkov]] and [[Moscow]] for medical treatment and returned home disappointed. In 1926, after the Alexandrapol earthquake, she settled in Yerevan, where she was welcomed with great enthusiasm by literary circles. Due to health complications, Kurghinian died at the age of fifty-one in [[Yerevan]] on 24 November 1927. She was buried in the [[Komitas Pantheon]]-Park.

Kurghinian is considered one of the founders of [[feminist]] and [[proletarian literature]] in [[Armenian language|Armenian]].&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Rowe, ''A History of Armenian Women's Writing, 1880–1922'' (London: Cambridge Scholars, 2003), page 170. {{ISBN|1-904303-23-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
[[File:Shushanik Kurghinian's tomb at the Komitas Pantheon-Park.jpg|thumbnail|Shushanik Kurghinian's memorial at the Komitas Pantheon-Park|276x276px]]
I WANTED TO SING

I wanted to sing: they told me I could not,&lt;br&gt;
I wove my own songs: quiet, you are a girl!&lt;br&gt;
But when in this troubled world&lt;br&gt;
an elegy I became,&lt;br&gt; 
I spoke to the hearts of many.&lt;br&gt;
The more I sang:&lt;br&gt;
the sooner she'll get tired, they said.&lt;br&gt;
The louder I sang:&lt;br&gt;
the faster her voice will fail.&lt;br&gt;
But I kept singing endlessly,&lt;br&gt;
that's when they started to cajole.

==History==
The album was recorded in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1982 and released by Applause Records.&lt;ref name="tomlord"&gt;{{cite book | last =Lord | first =Tom | title =The Jazz Discography | publisher =Cadence Jazz Books | date =October 1982 | id = Entry: H82-48 - &lt;u&gt;Space Jazz&lt;/u&gt; | isbn =1-881993-02-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1983 press release put out by the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] subsidiary company [[Author Services Inc.]] marketed the [[concept album]] as "the only original sound track ever produced for a book before it becomes a movie".&lt;ref name="pressrelease01261983"&gt;{{cite news | last =[[Author Services Inc.]] (Press release) | title =PR Newswire, January 26, 1983 | work =PR Newswire | publisher =PR Newswire Association, Inc. | date =1983-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album includes performances by prominent musicians [[Chick Corea]] (keyboards), [[Stanley Clarke]] (bass), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (keyboards) and [[Gayle Moran]] (keyboards/vocals).&lt;ref name="tomlord" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berkwits" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Rusch  | first = Bob   | title = Battlefield Earth  | journal = [[Cadence Magazine]]  | volume = 11  | page = 23  | year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins was known for his work in rock and roll, the others mainly as jazz musicians; all were, at the time, associated with Scientology. The album features extensive use of the [[Fairlight CMI]] synthesizer.&lt;ref name="berkwits" /&gt;  A demonstration of the "computer space jazz" soundtrack was one of the festival displays at the 1982 [[US Festival]] rock concert in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Wilson | first =Jeff | title =You couldn't have put this on in the Sixties... | work =[[United Press International]] | date =1982-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

L. Ron Hubbard's son [[Ronald DeWolf]] filed a probate case in November 1982, after his father had not made any public appearances since 1980, requesting to be appointed trustee of Hubbard's estate on the grounds that his father was missing or dead.&lt;ref name="lamont"&gt;{{cite book | last =Lamont | first =Stewart | title =[[Religion Inc.]] | publisher =Harrap | date =June 1986 | pages =153–155 | isbn =0-245-54334-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, attorneys representing Hubbard produced a letter in Hubbard's handwriting and with his fingerprints, in which he wrote that he had not had a leadership role in the [[Church of Scientology]] for "nearly 17 years", and mentioned his new novel ''Battlefield Earth'', his recently released album ''Space Jazz'', and 10-volume novel ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Mission Earth]]''.&lt;ref name="mathews"&gt;{{cite news | last =Mathews | first =Jay  | title =Sect's Missing Founder Leaves Legal Morass | work =[[The Washington Post]] | page =A2 | publisher =[[The Washington Post Company]] | date =1983-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "I am actively writing, having published ''Battlefield Earth'', and my ''Space Jazz'' album; a projected ten-volume work, ''Mission Earth'', is in the pre-publication stage at the moment", said Hubbard's statement.&lt;ref name="lamont" /&gt; In conjunction with the release of Hubbard's letter, Church of Scientology President [[Heber Jentzsch]] told the press that Hubbard had produced ''Space Jazz'' around December 1982, and wrote the majority of songs and [[lyrics]] for the computer-based music on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Arnold | first =Jay | title =Church Repeats Contention That Hubbard Still Alive | work =[[Associated Press]] | date =1983-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the [[LP album|LP]] was retitled to ''Battlefield Earth''.&lt;ref name="berkwits"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Berkwits   | first = Jeff   | title = Singing the Body Electric: Science Fiction Writers and Their Music   | newspaper = Locus Online  | publisher = www.locusmag.com  | date = September 13, 2003  | url = http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Reviews/Berkwits09_Songwriters.html  |accessdate = 2009-09-30}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1987 statement from Norman F.

[[Image:Uranometria orion.jpg|thumb|Johann Bayer's ''Uranometria'' showing the constellation Orion. Orion the Hunter is star lore created by the ancient Greeks.]]
'''Star lore''' or '''starlore''' is the creating and cherishing of [[mythology|mythical]] stories about the [[star]]s and star patterns ([[constellation]]s and [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]]); that is, [[folklore]] based upon the stars and star patterns. Using the stars to explain religious [[doctrine]]s or actual events in [[history]] is also defined as star lore. Star lore has a very long history; it has been practiced by nearly every culture recorded in history, dating as far back as 5,500 years ago. It was practiced by [[prehistory|prehistoric]] cultures of the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods as well.

==Orion and Scorpius==
One example of star lore is the inventing of the story of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the Hunter and the [[Scorpius]] the [[Scorpion]] by the ancient [[Greeks]]. This ancient culture saw a very startling pattern of bright stars in the winter [[sky]] that, from their point of view, resembled a mighty hunter, which they named [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]. During the summer, they saw another startling pattern of bright stars that resembled a scorpion. They noticed that the constellations of Orion and the scorpion were positioned at opposite ends of the sky and were never seen in the sky simultaneously. As one constellation rose above the eastern [[horizon]], the other was setting below the western horizon, and when either one was high in the sky, the other was completely absent. The ancient Greeks felt compelled to explain this [[phenomenon]] by composing a story or myth based on the two constellations{{Citation needed|reason=The order of events is counterintuitive.|date=November 2013}}.

The story was that Orion was a mighty and proud hunter who was stung by a scorpion. Orion died of the scorpion's sting and was placed among the stars by the gods. Although the scorpion was destroyed by the gods in vengeance for killing Orion, it was also placed among the stars. In order to prevent Orion and the scorpion from quarreling and fighting with each other in the sky, the gods placed Orion and the scorpion at opposite ends of the sky, and in opposite [[season]]s, so that both of them can never be seen in the sky at the same time.

==Andromeda==
Another example of star lore is the story behind the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], also known at "the chained woman". Andromeda was the daughter of the king and queen of [[Ethiopia]], King  [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]]. The story goes that because Cassiopeia bragged so much of Andromeda's beauty to the [[Nereids]], daughters of [[Poseidon]], that they complained to their father, who sent a sea monster to destroy the coast of Ethiopia. Cepheus consulted an oracle for assistance and learned that the only way to save his lands was to sacrifice his daughter to Poseidon's monster.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.constellationsofwords.com/Constellations/Andromeda.htm Andromeda: the Chained Woman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andromeda was chained to a rock and left for the sea monster. [[Perseus]], the hero of the story who had just killed the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]] found Andromeda in her distress and immediately, the two fell in love. Perseus asked for her name and refused to leave until he knew it, talking to her until she gave in. Andromeda told him her name, her country, and the reason for her imprisonment on the rock. He then consulted with Cepheus and Cassiopeia, and they decided that if Perseus rescued Andromeda from the sea monster, he could marry her. The story of how he then defeats the monster varies. [[Ovid]] describes his killing of the monster as a drawn out bloody battle. Other sources say that Perseus killed the sea monster with the aid of Medusa's head, turning the monster to stone. Andromeda and Perseus were married soon after,&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.comfychair.org/~cmbell/myth/andromeda.html Andromeda]&lt;/ref&gt; despite already being promise to her uncle, Phineus. At the wedding, Phineus and Perseus got into an altercation, and Perseus turned Phineus to stone using Medusa's head.

The constellation is said to have astrological influences as well. It is said that any man born at the same time Andromeda is said to rise from the sea will be one without mercy; he will be emotionally unmoved even in the presence of grieving parents. The constellation also influences the birth of the executioner, a man who will kill swiftly for money and kill willingly. Sources describe men born with the rise of Andromeda as one who would feel nothing if faced with Andromeda chained to her rock, just as Perseus did and fell in love with the girl.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.constellationsofwords.com/Constellations/Andromeda.htm Andromeda: the Chained Woman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Draco==
The [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] is another example of star lore. In Roman mythology, the constellation is representative of [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon that guarded the golden apples inside the garden, [[Hesperides]]. The tree was a wedding gift to [[Hera]] when she and [[Zeus]] were married, and she planted it on [[Mount Atlas]]. Hera tasked the Hesperides to guard the tree and put Ladon around the tree as well to ensure that the Hesperides would not steal the apples. In some sources, Ladon is called the child of [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], who was half woman and half viper, and had hundreds of heads. In other versions of Ladon's story, the number of heads he had is not at all mentioned and he is described as the offspring of [[Ceto]] and [[Phorcys]], two sea [[deity|deities]].&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/draco-constellation/ Draco Constellation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrastingly, in Roman mythology, Draco was one of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] who waged war on the Olympic gods for ten years. He was killed by [[Minerva]] in the battle and thrown into the sky.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/draco-constellation/ Draco Constellation]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1585">In algebraic topology, a '''symmetric spectrum''' ''X'' is a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] of pointed [[simplicial set]]s that comes with an action of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; such that the composition of structure maps
:&lt;math&gt;S^1 \wedge \dots \wedge S^1 \wedge X_n \to S^1 \wedge \dots \wedge S^1 \wedge X_{n+1} \to \dots \to S^1 \wedge X_{n+p-1} \to X_{n+p}&lt;/math&gt;
is equivariant with respect to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_p \times \Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt;. A morphism between symmetric spectra is a morphism of spectra that is equivariant with respect to the actions of symmetric groups.

The technical advantage of the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}p^\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of symmetric spectra is that it has a closed [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[Monoidal category|monoidal structure]] (with respect to [[smash product]]). It is also a [[simplicial model category]]. A '''symmetric ring spectrum''' is a monoid in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}p^\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;; if the monoid is commutative, it's a [[commutative ring spectrum]]. The possibility of this definition of "ring spectrum" was one of motivations behind the category.

A similar technical goal is also achieved by May's theory of [[S-modules]], a competing theory.

'''Tale Spinners for Children''' was a series of stories and novels adapted for young audiences on vinyl records in the early 1960s. They included a collection of old [[fairy tales]], [[folklore]], literary classics such as ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and time-honored [[fables]], with the title role sometimes played by a renowned theatrical actor or actress. (Many of the actors who appeared, however, such as [[Maggie Smith]] or [[Alec McCowen]], became more famous for other roles years after the albums were released, and some of the actors, such as [[Donald Pleasence]], who played Don Quixote, or [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]], who played several villainous roles, were not even identified on the album covers.) The series gave children an exposure to timeless classic stories.

Originally only 30 records were pressed in England and France and sold as [[Atlas Talespinners]] under the [[Atlas Record]] label, and included an easy to follow story booklet. Within a few years, these records were introduced to the U.S. as Tale Spinners for Children under the [[United Artists Records]] label. What was known as the Atlas Theatre Company in England was marketed as the Famous Theatre Company in the United States. The story booklets were not included in the U.S. releases.

UA continued to produce more stories records until the early 1970s, and distribute them in the Canadian&lt;ref&gt;Manufactured and Distributed in Canada by The Compo Company Ltd., Lachine, Que.&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian&lt;ref&gt;Manufactured and Distributed in Australia Under License from United Artists Records, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; markets as well.

With popular children's record companies like [[Walt Disney Records]] already on the market, a host of other record companies followed: [[Mercury Storyteller]] series, [[Golden Records]], [[Telegeneral Let's Pretend]], [[Riverside Wonderland]] and [[Pathways of Sound]].

==History==
United Artists released the 30 original stories in the US in 1962. The recording labels changed when [[Liberty Records]] (its budget subsidiary [[Sunset Records]]) and [[United Artists Records]]&lt;ref&gt;©LIBERTY/UA, INC., Los Angeles, Calf.&lt;/ref&gt;  merged in 1968 after [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]]&lt;ref&gt;DEPT. SUS 6920 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, Calif. (90028)&lt;/ref&gt; bought Liberty. All labels were merged under United Artists in 1971. When Liberty was deactivated in 1971 (for the first time) both the Sunset and Talespinners series was leased by [[Springboard International]]&lt;ref&gt;Distributed by SPRINGBOARD INTERNATIONAL RECORDS, INC., 947 U.S. Highway 1, Rahway, New Jersey 07065&lt;/ref&gt; and in the case of the Talespinners series they used the same catalog numbers until 1975. When Springboard International Records went bankrupt 1984 [[Gusto Records]] acquired some of their catalogues from [[Jay-Koala]].

==Music==
''Tale Spinners for Children'' used classical music as background and linking music in their productions.  Examples of this include:
* ''Robin Hood'' (UAC 11001) - [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Violin Concerto in E minor]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]
* ''William Tell'' (UAC 11002) - [[William Tell Overture]] and Overture from ''[[La Gazza Ladra]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]]
* ''The Three Musketeers'' (UAC 11007) - "The Dance of the Furies" from ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' by [[Christoph Gluck]]
* ''Treasure Island'' (UAC 11013) - [[Symphonie fantastique]] by [[Hector Berlioz]] ''(also used in "Hiawatha" [UAC 11054])''
* ''Sinbad the Sailor'' (UAC 110020) - [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]] by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] ''(also used in "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" [UAC 11018] and "Aladdin and the Magic Lamp" [UAC 11019])''
* ''Rip Van Winkle'' (UAC 11034) - [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|Overture for A Midsummer Night's Dream]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]
* ''Christopher Columbus'' (UAC 11040) - [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|New World Symphony]] by [[Antonín Dvořák]]
* ''The Little Mermaid'' (UAC 11042) - [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] by [[Edvard Grieg]]

==Early life==
Brooks was born in the rural Midwestern town of [[Sterling, Illinois]], and spent a large part of his life living there.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrybrooks.net/bio.html |title=Terry Brooks' official biography |accessdate=2008-05-19 |last=Speakman |first=Shawn |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an alumnus of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], earning his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English literature in 1966.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; He later obtained a law degree ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) from [[Washington and Lee University]]. He was a practicing [[Lawyer|attorney]] before becoming a full-time author.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Terry Brooks by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|Brooks at a book signing at the 2017 [[Phoenix Comicon]]]]
Brooks had been a writer since high school, writing mainly in the genres of [[science fiction]], western, fiction, and [[Non-fiction writing|non-fiction]].&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; One day, in his early college life, he was given a copy of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', which inspired him to write in one genre.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; While Tolkien inspired the genre, Brooks stated during his TEDxRainier talk "Why I Write about Elves",&lt;ref name="Why I Write about Elves"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Terry|title=Why I Write about Elves|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Why-I-Write-about-Elves-Terry-B|website=tedxtalks.ted.com|accessdate=December 14, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019000949/http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Why-I-Write-about-Elves-Terry-B|archivedate=October 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at the Charlotte Literary Festival that he credits the inspiration of his style of writing to [[William Faulkner]]'s works.&lt;ref name="Why I Write about Elves"/&gt; With this inspiration, he then made his debut in 1977 with ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]''.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt;

After finishing two sequels to ''The Sword of Shannara'', Brooks moved on to the series which would become known as the ''[[Magic Kingdom of Landover|Landover]]'' novels.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; Brooks then wrote a four-book series titled ''[[The Heritage of Shannara]]''.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; For the next fourteen years, he wrote more ''Landover'' books, then went on to write ''The Word and Void'' trilogy.  Continuing the ''[[Shannara]]'' series, Brooks wrote the prequel to ''The Sword of Shannara'', titled ''[[First King of Shannara]]''.  He then wrote two series, ''[[The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara]]'' and ''[[High Druid of Shannara]]'' and recently finished a third, ''[[Genesis of Shannara]]'', a trilogy bridging his ''Word and Void'' and ''Shannara'' series.  The sixth book in the ''Landover'' series, ''[[A Princess of Landover]]'', was released in August 2009. 
Returning to Shannara, a duology, ''[[Legends of Shannara]]'', taking place after the events of ''[[Genesis of Shannara]]'', was written next. The first book, entitled ''[[Bearers of the Black Staff]]'', was released in August 2010 and the second, ''[[The Measure of the Magic]]'', was released in August 2011.
He next completed a trilogy entitled ''[[The Dark Legacy of Shannara]]''. The three books are; ''[[Wards of Faerie]]'' (Feb 2013), ''[[Bloodfire Quest]]'' (June 2013), and ''Witch Wraith'' (Dec 2013). He followed this with the trilogy ''Defenders of Shannara'', which include ''The High Druid's Blade'' (July 2014), ''The Darkling Child'' (June 2015), and ''The Sorcerer's Daughter'' (May 24, 2016).
According to his website, he is currently working on the final and concluding tetralogy of the Shannara series known as [[The Fall of Shannara]]. The first book in the tetralogy is [[The Black Elfstone]] and was released on June 13, 2017.

A television series based on the Shannara works, entitled ''[[The Shannara Chronicles]]'' began showing on MTV in January 2016. The show starts with the second book of the original series, ''Elfstones'', as there are strong female roles which did not appear in the first book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/terry-brooks-mtv-is-doing-the-shannara-chronicles.html|title=Terry Brooks: MTV is Doing The Shannara Chronicles Right|author=|date=|website=pastemagazine.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828103526/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/terry-brooks-mtv-is-doing-the-shannara-chronicles.html|archivedate=August 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season aired in 2017 on SPIKE &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2870369/shannara-chronicles-renewed/|title=MTV Renews The Shannara Chronicles For Second Season|author=|date=|website=mtv.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106054106/http://www.mtv.com/news/2870369/shannara-chronicles-renewed/|archivedate=November 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title=‘The Shannara Chronicles’ Canceled After Two Seasons |url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-canceled-after-two-seasons-spike-mtv-paramount-network-1202244383/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |date=January 17, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117033103/http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-canceled-after-two-seasons-spike-mtv-paramount-network-1202244383/ |archivedate=January 17, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producers later announced that the series is being shopped to other networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title=‘The Shannara Chronicles’ Shopped To Other Networks For Season 3 |url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-shopped-other-networks-season-3-1202244442/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |date=January 17, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117064831/http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-shopped-other-networks-season-3-1202244442/ |archivedate=January 17, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Brooks resides in northwestern [[Oregon]] with his wife, Judine.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt;

==Novels versus short stories==
After writing "[[Indomitable (short story)|Indomitable]]", a short story constituting an epilogue to ''[[The Wishsong of Shannara]]'', Terry Brooks declared:
{{quote|I find it much harder to write short stories than long fiction. I feel cramped by the lack of space and the dictates of the form. There is considerable difference in long and short fiction disciplines, and I am not good with the latter. I hope not to have to do many more of them, but you never know. I must have written Indomitable anywhere from four to five times, each effort different. Give me a five hundred page sprawl as an assignment any day.&lt;ref name="Writing Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web | last = Brooks | first = Terry | title = Ask Terry Q&amp;A - Writing | date = 1999–2008 | url = http://www.terrybrooks.net/askterry/writing.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120914051957/http://www.terrybrooks.net/askterry/writing.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-09-14 | accessdate = 2008-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Edouard Manet - The Plum - National Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|300px|Édouard Manet, ''The Plum'', c. 1877. 73.6 x 50.2 cm (29 x 19 3/4 in.). Oil on canvas. National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.]]

'''''The Plum''''' (French: ''La Prune''), or '''''Plum Brandy''''', is an oil painting by [[Édouard Manet]].  It is undated but thought to have been painted about 1877.

The painting is a study in loneliness, depicting a quiet, almost melancholy, scene of a young working girl seated in a café.  The subject is viewed from nearby, perhaps by another seated customer.  She may be a prostitute waiting for a client, or possibly a shop worker hoping for some conversation.  On the table is a plum soaked in brandy, a speciality of Parisian cafés at the time (originally painted as a glass of beer), which gives the painting its title.  She may be waiting for a waiter to bring a spoon to eat her plum.  The plum may be a reference to the woman's sexuality, as the fruit was later used in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.  She leans forward, with her cheek resting on her right hand, and her right elbow on the marble tabletop, looking into the distance with a blank pensive look.  Her left hand rests on the table holding an unlit cigarette.  She wears a pink dress with embroidered cuffs, a white jabot, and a black hat trimmed with silk and lace.  Her head is framed by the decorative grille behind her, above the red upholstered [[banquette]] on which she sits.

Manet may have based the painting on observations at the [[Café de la Nouvelle Athènes]] on the [[Place Pigalle]] in Paris.  However, the background - the decorative grille and its gold frame - does not match other depictions of the café, and suggests the painting was made in Manet’s studio, where he is known to have had a café-style marble table on iron legs. Manet uses a simple style: for example, the plum in its glass and the fingers of the woman's left hand are created with just a few dabs of colour.

The model is the actress [[Ellen Andrée]], who was also depicted with [[Marcellin Desboutin]] in the similar 1876 painting ''[[L'Absinthe]]'' (or ''In a Café'') by [[Edgar Degas]].  The similarities between the two paintings suggest that Manet's ''The Plum'' may be a response to Degas's ''L'Absinthe''.  Degas's painting shows a bleak scene of despair blunted by [[absinthe]]; Manet's is a more hopeful scene, where there is the chance that the sitter's loneliness may be broken.  Andrée also appears in [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'s 1881 painting ''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]''.  [[Edward Hopper]]'s 1927 painting ''[[Automat (painting)|Automat]]'' has a similar theme.

The painting measures {{convert|73.6|cm}} by {{convert| 50.2|cm}}.  Manet sold the painting to collector [[Charles Deudon]] in about 1881.  It was inherited by Deudon's wife on his death in 1914 and sold before 1919.  It came into the collection of [[Arthur Sachs (banker)|Arthur Sachs]] (1880–1975), the son of [[Samuel Sachs]] and a partner in [[Goldman Sachs]] for many years.  It was then sold by [[M. Knoedler &amp; Co]] to [[Paul Mellon]] in 1961, who donated it to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC in 1971.

'''''The Successor''''' ({{lang-sq|Pasardhësi}}) is a 2003 [[novel]] by the Albanian writer and inaugural [[Man Booker International Prize|International Man Booker Prize]] winner [[Ismail Kadare]]. It is the second part of a [[diptych]] of which the first part is the [[novella]] ''[[Agamemnon's Daughter]]''. The diptych is ranked by many critics among the author's greatest works.

==Background==
{{See also|Mehmet Shehu}}
''[[Agamemnon's Daughter]]'', the [[prequel]] to ''The Successor'', was written in 1985 and smuggled out of [[Albania]] before the collapse of the [[Hoxhaism|Hoxhaist regime]], but it was published almost two decades later, after Kadare had already composed ''The Successor'' as its companion-piece.&lt;ref name=AgamemnonsDaughter&gt;{{cite book |last=Durand |first=Claude |editor-last=Kadare |editor-first=Ismail |title=Agamemnon's Daughter: A Novella and Stories|publisher=Arcade Publishing |date=2006 |translator-last=Bellos |translator-first=David |pages=ix–xii |chapter=About Agamemnon's Daughter: Adapted from the Publisher's Preface to the French Edition |isbn=978-1-559-70788-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the more personal ''[[Agamemnon's Daughter]]'', ''The Successor'' is much more grounded in actual history, presenting a fictional account of the events that may have led to the still-unexplained 1981 death of [[Mehmet Shehu]], [[Prime Minister of Albania|Albania's]] [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|long-time Prime Minister]] during the [[Cold War]] and [[Enver Hoxha]]'s most trusted ally and designated number two ever since the death of [[Stalin]] and the subsequent [[Soviet–Albanian split]].
Official Albanian government sources called his death a suicide, but his denouncement as "multiple foreign agent" and "traitor to the motherland" and the ensuing prosecution of the entire Shehu clan (starting with his influential wife, [[Fiqirete Shehu Sanxhaktari]], and his son, [[Albanian literature|Albanian writer]] [[Bashkim Shehu]]) has led to persistent popular rumors that Shehu had in fact been murdered on orders coming directly from either [[Enver Hoxha]] or his wife [[Nexhmije Hoxha|Nexhmije]].&lt;ref name=IanThomson&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Thomson |first= Ian |date= 15 January 2006 |title= Tyranny in Tirana |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/15/fiction.features1 |magazine= [[The Observer]] |access-date= 25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The novel is divided into seven chapters, the first four of which ("A Death in December", "The Autopsy", "Fond Memories", and "The Fall") are narrated by [[Narration#Third-person|an omniscient narrator]], and the fifth ("The Guide") by a third person limited narrator (the dictator of the country, a thinly veiled portrait of [[Enver Hoxha]]). As the [[mystery fiction|mystery]] behind the death – announced, in a characteristically simple Kadareian manner,&lt;ref name=LorraineAdams&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Adams |first= Lorraine |date= 13 November 2005 |title= 'The Successor': A Bad Night in Albania |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/books/review/the-successor-a-bad-night-in-albania.html |magazine= [[The New York Times]] |access-date= 25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the novel's opening sentence ("The Designated Successor was found dead in his bedroom at dawn on December 14") – ostensibly closes to an inevitable resolution, the narration abruptly turns to [[First-person narrative|first-person point of view]], as each of the last two chapters is narrated by one of the novel's two most important characters: "The Architect" (who renovated the Successor's palace and was one of only few people who knew about its secret underground passage leading directly from the Guide's to the Successor's home), and in the "extraordinary [last] chapter",&lt;ref name=IanThomson /&gt; "The Successor", the already deceased [[title character]].

Essentially a [[political thriller]] and a "[[whodunit]] [[tragicomedy]]",&lt;ref name=LorraineAdams /&gt; ''The Successor'' gradually moves away from speculating about the identity of the likely murderer – after juggling with the possibilities of him being a [[Sigurimi]] agent sent by [[Hoxha]], a rising political figure called Adrian Hasobeu striving to become the Number 2, the Architect who once felt offended by the Successor's jokes, or even the Successor's wife who slept much too soundly during the [[murder]] – choosing instead to focus on the brutal effects a close-knit [[dictatorship]] may have on everyone forced to live under it, no matter how safe he or she may seem in the eyes of the outward observers. Possibly analysing his own controversial dual role as both a privileged writer and an internal [[dissident]] under the Hoxha regime,&lt;ref name=JamesLasdun&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Lasdun |first= James |date= 7 January 2006 |title= The tyrant's legacy |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview2 |magazine= [[The Guardian]] |access-date= 25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kadare]] uses the figure of the Architect to explore the problem of artistic integrity in such circumstances,&lt;ref name=SimonCaterson&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Caterson |first= Simon |date= |title= 
Ismail Kadare’s ‘The Successor’ |url= https://www.themonthly.com.au/books-simon-caterson-ismail-kadare-s-successor--189 |magazine= [[The Monthly]] |access-date= 25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the events of ''[[Agamemnon's Daughter]]'' are here recounted once again – this time through the eyes of the female protagonist, Suzana – as further evidence that even the most intimate feelings, such as love, may fall victim to political intrigues and the demands of the state, in cases when the individual is continually sacrificed at a more fundamental, systematic level.

==Reception==
The diptych ''[[Agamemnon's Daughter]]''/''The Successor'' is considered by Kadare's French publisher, [[Fayard]]'s editor [[Claude Durand]], "one of the finest and most accomplished of all Ismail Kadare's works to date".&lt;ref name=AgamemnonsDaughter /&gt; Characterizing it as "laceratingly direct" in its criticism of the totalitarian regime, in a longer overview of Kadare's works, [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] describes the diptych as "surely one of the most devastating accounts ever written of the mental and spiritual contamination wreaked on the individual by the totalitarian state".&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Woods |first= James |date= 20 December 2010 |title= Chronicles And Fragments: The Novels of Ismail Kadare |url= http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/chronicles-and-fragments |magazine= [[The New Yorker]] |access-date= 25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood compares Kadare favourably to both [[George Orwell|Orwell]] and [[Kundera]], considering him to be "a far deeper ironist than the first, and a better storyteller than the second".&lt;ref name=NewYorker /&gt; As an especially good example of Kadare's [[irony]], he points out to one of the concluding passages of ''The Successor's'' third chapter, when the [[Visual impairment|almost blind]] Guide, led by his wife, visits the Successor's renovated home for the first time and suddenly discovers a [[dimmer]], a novelty in [[Albania]] at the time, the lavishness of which may be treated as a possible [[Bourgeoisie#Marxist theory|bourgeois trait]] by the paranoid leader:
{{Quote|text=Silence had fallen all around, but when he managed to turn on the light and make it brighter, he laughed out loud. He turned the switch further, until the light was at maximum strength, then laughed again, ha-ha-ha, as if he’d just found a toy that pleased him. Everyone laughed with him, and the game went on until he began to turn the dimmer down. As the brightness dwindled, little by little everything began to freeze, to go lifeless, until all the many lamps in the room went dark.|author=[[Ismail Kadare]], translated by [[David Bellos]] from [[Tedi Papavrami]]'s French translation |source=''The Successor'' ([[Arcade Publishing]] 2005, 113)}}
The same passage is excerpted by [[James Lasdun]] as representative of Kadare's power to chillingly portray [[fear]] and "the reptilian consciousness" of dictators. Lasdun considers ''The Successor'' a "gripping, fitfully brilliant" novel, which employs everything "from documentary realism to [[Kafkaesque]] fabulism" to depict a world bereaved of heroes, a universe where "everyone is stained, contaminated, implicated" – not excluding the author himself.&lt;ref name=JamesLasdun /&gt;

Even though branding the translation "clunky", a review by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' believes that the novel reaffirms Kadare's place "with Orwell, [[Kafka]], [[Kundera]] and [[Solzhenitsyn]] as a major chronicler of oppression".&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |date=  |title= Chronicles And Fragments: The Novels of Ismail Kadare |url= https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55970-773-2 |website= [[Publishers Weekly]] |publisher=  |access-date= 25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorraine Adams]] both cites and questions this in a "lukewarm review"&lt;ref name=DavidBellos&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Bellos |first= David |date= 27 November 2005|title= Ismail Kadare and 'The Successor' |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/opinion/ismail-kadare-and-the-successor-782335.html |magazine= [[The New York Times]] |access-date= 25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which she concludes by reiterating the possibility of reading ''The Successor'' "as something of a coded commentary on Kadare's own life. Just as we long to know the cause of the Successor's death, so do we long to resolve Kadare's true place in Hoxha's Albania. The archive may yet be discovered that helps Kadare's part become clearer. Will we ever know?"&lt;ref name=LorraineAdams /&gt;

Much like Lasdun's and albeit implicitly, Adams' review refers to a well-publicized denouncement of Kadare by the Romanian émigré poet [[Renata Dumitrascu]], who, in the wake of the announcement of the [[Man Booker International Prize]] winner in 2005, scathingly described the Albanian author as "an astute chameleon, adroitly playing the rebel here and there to excite the naïve Westerners who were scouting for voices of dissent from the East".&lt;ref name=MobyLives&gt;{{cite web |last=Dimitrascu |first=Renata |date=  |title= Kadare is no Solzhenitsyn |url= http://www.mobylives.com/Dumitrascu.html |website= MobyLives.com |publisher=[[Melville House Publishing]] |access-date= 25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a reply to [[Lorraine Adams]], Kadare's English translator [[David Bellos]] refuted these allegations as "fabrications", pointing to the fact that the regime's file on Kadare has already been published and is readily available to the public.&lt;ref name=DavidBellos /&gt;

Fundamentally echoing Landus' judgement, [[Simon Caterson]] dispenses with this kind of black-and-white reasoning, writing that "even if Kadare was complicit in the Hoxha regime, and there is nothing in this remarkable novel to suggest he was not, it is quite possible that ''The Successor'' could not otherwise have been written. As it is, the book asks questions for which, to its credit, it can find no convenient answers."&lt;ref name=SimonCaterson /&gt; Leaving aside the nature of Kadare's political role, [[Murrough O'Brien (journalist)|Murrough O'Brien]] calls ''The Successor'' a "strangely uplifting" novel, "despite the relentless tragedy it depicts, the tragedy of people yanked between fear and bewilderment. The final section, despite its sombreness, swings you up into the region where cruelty and pettiness are themselves left without air."&lt;ref name=MurroughOBrien&gt;{{cite magazine |last= O'Brien |first= Murrough |date= 8 January 2006 |title= The Successor, by Ismail Kadare |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-successor-by-ismail-kadare-6112435.html |magazine= [[The Independent|Independent]] |access-date= 25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uri (Uli)''' is the name given to the traditional designs drawn by the [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]]. Uri drawings are strongly [[linear]] and do not have deep perspective; they do, however, balance positive and negative space.  Designs are frequently [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]], and are often painted spontaneously.  ''Uri'' generally is not sacred, apart from those images painted on the walls of [[shrine]]s and created in conjunction with some community rituals.

The drawing of ''uri'' was once practiced throughout most of [[Igboland]], although by 1970 it had lost much of its popularity, and was being kept alive by a handful of contemporary artists.  It was usually practiced by women, who would decorate each other's bodies with dark [[dye]]s to prepare for village events, such as [[marriage]], title taking, and [[funeral]]s; designs would sometimes be produced for the most important market days as well.  Designs would last about a week.

Most ''uri'' designs were named, and many differed among various Igbo regions.  Some were abstract, using patterns such as [[zigzag]]s and [[concentric]] [[circle]]s, while others stood for household objects like [[chair|stool]]s and [[Pottery|pots]].  Some represented animals such as [[Pythonidae|python]]s and [[lizard]]s; others showed plants, like [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] leaves, or heavenly bodies, including a crescent [[moon]] and [[star]]s.  Still other designs depicted cutting and other actions.

The use of ''uri'' was not limited to the human body.  Igbo women would also paint murals of designs on the walls of compounds and houses.  These generally used four colors which could be created from natural bases easily found in the area; [[black]] was made from [[charcoal]], [[red]]dish [[brown]] from the [[camwood]] tree, [[yellow]] from either soil or tree bark, and [[white]] from clay.  When the [[Great Britain|British]] invaded the area at the turn of the twentieth century, they brought with them a commercial [[Bluing (fabric)|laundry additive]] which some painters used to create [[blue]] pigment.  ''Uri'' was not only meant to express a specific message. It was also meant to beautify the female body and buildings to which it was applied, as beauty is equated with [[morality]] in Igbo culture.

Today the practice of ''uri'' is being kept alive by, among others, Anam people who continues to pass the knowledge and use the culture and the artists of the [[Nsukka group]], who have appropriated its designs and incorporated them into other media.
