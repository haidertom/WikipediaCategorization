'''Aloyse Meyer''', born 31 October 1883 in [[Clervaux]], and died 3 May 1952, was a Luxembourgish engineer and manager in the steel industry.

He studied engineering at the university of [[Aachen]], and in 1903 was employed by the [[Dudelange]] office of works. A few months later he became ''Ingenieur adjoint'' at the foundry in Dudelange, in 1906 Chef de service and in 1912 director. In 1918, he was appointed to the headquarters of [[Arbed]] as technical director, becoming its director-general in 1920.

In 1925 Aloyse Meyer became the head of the [[Chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]], and in 1928 after the death of [[Émile Mayrisch]], became president of the European steel union. Under the [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II]], he remained as the director of ARBED. Just before US troops liberated Luxembourg in September 1944, Meyer was arrested by the Gestapo, acting on orders from Berlin, and taken to a prison in [[Wittlich]] in western Germany, along with his son Frank, and the head of the steel trading association Columeta, Michel Goedert.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schoentgen, Marc. "'Heim ins Reich'? Die ARBED-Konzernleitung während der deutschen Besatzung 1940-1944: zwischen Kollaboration und Widerstand". In: forum, No. 304 (February 2011). p. 29-35&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}} They were later released from prison, but remained in Germany under Gestapo surveillance until the war's end, and were unable to return to Luxembourg until April 1945.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|32}} It later became known that he had directed large amounts of his own money towards the [[Belgian Resistance|Belgian resistance]] and Belgian charities from 1942.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

After the war, he rejoined Arbed, the president of its executive board in April 1947.

Aloyse Meyer was married to Eugénie Heintz, a descendant of the founder of the cigarette factory Heintz Van Landewyck. After the death of his father-in-law, [[Victor Heintz]], Meyer in 1931 became president of the board of Heintz Van Landewyck, which he remained until his death. His son Robert Meyer, started his career in 1934 as an engineer at Heintz Van Landewyck.

'''Armi Jager''', otherwise known as Adler Jager, was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Italy|Italian]] firearms manufacturer located in the small town of [[Loano]], [[Italy]].

==Early history==

The gun manufacturer was active since the early 1950s, manufacturing semi-automatic [[.22 rimfire]] sporting rifles and replica "Western" revolvers. Later it evolved to rimfire and small-caliber [[centerfire]] ([[.32 ACP]]) firearms patterned after the look of military rifles which at the time were difficult or illegal to own for civilians in [[Italy]]. Some of its best-known products were several .22 rimfire versions styled after the [[M16 (rifle)|M16 rifle]], known as the '''AP-74''' and '''AP-74M'''; replicas of the [[Armalite AR-18]] assault rifle, known as the '''AP-75'''; replicas of the [[Soviet Union|Russian]] [[AK-47|Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle]], known as the '''AP-80'''; replicas of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[SA-80]] bull-pup rifle, known as the '''AP-82'''; replicas of the Israeli [[Galil]] assault rifle, known as the '''AP-84'''; replicas of the French [[FA-MAS]] bull-pup rifle, known as the '''AP-85'''. The factory sold most of its designs under the trade name ''Adler''. The Armi Jager production saw significant sales in Italy and exports in the United States, earning a reputation as high quality plinking rifles.

==Recent history==

Firearms production at Jager ended by the early 1990s, according to the old owner Mr. Piscetta for "lack of skilled personnel". The activity continues though as a [[gun store]] and [[gunsmithing]] shop located in the town of Basaluzzo, [[Alessandria]] province. The enterprise has since changed its name to "Nuova Jager".

Since 2009 the Company has been acquired by Mr. Massimiliano Locci, who is going to move the activity of the Company on the import, the transforming and wholesale of military full auto weapons. In the meanwhile, a direct new line of carbines AR-15 has been created and manufactured for civilian and military market too, for whom the Company is making maintenance and assistance too. Always for military market Nuova Jager distributes San Swiss Arms products (SIG).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''''Barbarians at the Gate''''' is a 1993 [[television movie]] based upon [[Barbarians at the Gate|the book]] by [[Bryan Burrough]] and [[John Helyar]], about the [[leveraged buyout]] (LBO) of [[RJR Nabisco]].

The film was directed by [[Glenn Jordan]] and written by [[Larry Gelbart]]. It stars [[James Garner]] as [[F. Ross Johnson]], the [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of RJR Nabisco, and [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[Henry Kravis]], his chief rival for the company. It also features [[Peter Riegert]], [[Joanna Cassidy]] and [[Fred Dalton Thompson]].

The film won both the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe for Best Television Movie]] while James Garner won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Movie]].     [[FOX]] also aired the film later in the same year.

==Plot==
Self-made multimillionaire and RJR Nabisco CEO F. Ross Johnson decides to take the tobacco and food conglomerate company private in 1988 after receiving advance news of the likely market failure of the company's smokeless [[cigarette]] called [[Premier (cigarette)|Premier]], the development of which had been intended to finally boost the company's stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Those Good Old Takeover Days |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDB113CF93BA25750C0A965958260 |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 18, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free-spending Johnson's bid for the company is opposed by two of the pioneers of the [[leveraged buyout]], Henry Kravis and his cousin. Kravis feels betrayed when, after Johnson initially discusses doing the LBO with Kravis, he takes the potentially enormous deal to another firm,  the [[Shearson Lehman Hutton]] division of [[American Express]].

Other bidders emerge, including [[Theodore J. Forstmann|Ted Forstmann]] and his company, [[Forstmann Little &amp; Company|Forstmann Little]], after Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences. The bidding goes to unprecedented heights, and when executive Charles Hugel becomes aware of how much Johnson stands to profit in a transaction that will put thousands of Nabisco employees out of work, he quips, "Now I know what the 'F' in F. Ross Johnson stands for." The greed was so evident, Kravis's final bid is declared the winner, even though Johnson's was higher.

The title of the book and movie comes from a statement by Forstmann in which he calls that Kravis' money "phoney [[junk bond]] crap" and how he and his brother are "real people with real money," and that to stop raiders like Kravis: "We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates."

The '''Basel Accords''' (see alternative [[#Spelling|spelling]]s below) refer to the banking supervision Accords (recommendations on banking regulations)—[[Basel I]], [[Basel II]] and [[Basel III]]—issued by the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] (BCBS).
They are called the Basel Accords as the BCBS maintains its [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]] at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] and the committee normally meets there. The Basel Accords is a set of recommendations for regulations in the banking industry.

==The Basel Committee==
{{main|Basel Committee on Banking Supervision}}
Formerly, the Basel Committee consisted of representatives from central banks and regulatory authorities of the [[Group of Ten (economic)|Group of Ten]] countries plus [[Luxembourg]] and [[Spain]]. Since 2009, all of the other [[G-20 major economies]] are represented, as well as some other major banking locales such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]]. (See the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision|Committee]] article for a full list of members.)

The committee does not have the authority to enforce recommendations, although most member countries as well as some other countries tend to implement the Committee's policies. This means that recommendations are enforced through national (or [[European Union|EU]]-wide) laws and regulations, rather than as a result of the committee's recommendations - thus some time may pass between recommendations and implementation as law at the national level.

== Spelling ==
The Basel Committee is named after the city of [[Basel|Basel, Switzerland]]. In early publications, the Committee sometimes used the British spelling "Basle" or the French spelling "Bâle," names that are sometimes still used in the media. More recently, the Committee has deferred to the predominantly German-speaking population of the region and used the spelling "Basel", which is also a common spelling in English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22147">In [[pharmacology]], '''bioavailability''' ('''''BA or F''''' ) is a subcategory of absorption and is the fraction of an administered [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] of unchanged drug that reaches the [[systemic circulation]], one of the principal [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] properties of [[medication|drugs]]. By definition, when a medication is administered [[intravenous]]ly, its bioavailability is 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=J. P.|title=The Textbook of Pharmaceutical Medicine|edition=6th|location=New Jersey|publisher=BMJ Books|ISBN=978-1-4051-8035-1}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a medication is administered via other [[route of administration|routes]] (such as orally), its bioavailability generally{{cref|TH}} decreases (due to incomplete absorption and [[first-pass metabolism]]) or may vary from patient to patient. Bioavailability is one of the essential tools in pharmacokinetics, as bioavailability must be considered when calculating dosages for non-intravenous routes of administration.

For [[dietary supplements]], herbs and other nutrients in which the route of administration is nearly always oral, bioavailability generally designates simply the quantity or fraction of the ingested dose that is absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert P. |last1=Heaney |title=Factors Influencing the Measurement of Bioavailability, Taking Calcium as a Model |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |pmid=11285351 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11285351 |year=2001 |volume=131 |issue=4 |pages=1344S–8S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioavailability is defined slightly differently for drugs as opposed to [[dietary supplements]] primarily due to the method of administration and [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations.

== Definitions ==

=== In pharmacology ===

In pharmacology, bioavailability is a measurement of the rate and extent to which a drug reaches at the site of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shargel|first1=L.|last2=Yu|first2=A. B.|date=1999|title=Applied Biopharmaceutics &amp; Pharmacokinetics|edition=4th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|ISBN=0-8385-0278-4}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is denoted by the letter ''f'' (or, if expressed in percent, by ''F'').

=== In nutritional sciences ===

In nutritional sciences, which covers the intake of nutrients and non-drug dietary ingredients, the concept of bioavailability lacks the well-defined standards associated with the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmacological definition cannot apply to these substances because utilization and absorption is a function of the nutritional status and physiological state of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11285351 |year=2001 |last1=Heaney |first1=Robert P. |title=Factors Influencing the Measurement of Bioavailability, Taking Calcium as a Model |volume=131 |issue=4 Suppl. |pages=1344–1348S |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11285351}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in even greater differences from individual to individual (inter-individual variation). Therefore, bioavailability for dietary supplements can be defined as the proportion of the administered substance capable of being absorbed and available for use or storage.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11285352 |year=2001 |last1=Srinivasan |first1=V. Srini |title=Bioavailability of Nutrients: A Practical Approach to In Vitro Demonstration of the Availability of Nutrients in Multivitamin-Mineral Combination Products |volume=131 |issue=4 Suppl. |pages=1349–1350S |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |url=https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/131/4/1349S/4686865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both pharmacology and nutrition sciences, bioavailability is measured by calculating the [[area under curve]] (AUC) of the drug concentration time profile.

=== In environmental sciences or science===

Bioavailability is the measure by which various substances in the environment may enter into living organisms.  It is commonly a limiting factor in the production of crops (due to solubility limitation or adsorption of plant nutrients to soil colloids) and in the removal of toxic substances from the food chain by microorganisms (due to sorption to or partitioning of otherwise degradable substances into inaccessible phases in the environment). A noteworthy example for agriculture is plant phosphorus deficiency induced by precipitation with iron and aluminum phosphates at low soil pH and precipitation with calcium phosphates at high soil pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1013351617532 |year=2001 |last1=Hinsinger |first1=Philippe |title=Bioavailability of soil inorganic P in the rhizosphere as affected by root-induced chemical changes: a review |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=237 |issue=2 |pages=173–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic materials in soil, such as lead from paint may be rendered unavailable to animals ingesting contaminated soil by supplying phosphorus fertilizers in excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es00046a007 |title=In situ lead immobilization by apatite |year=1993 |last1=Ma |first1=Qi-Ying |last2=Traina |first2=Samuel J. |last3=Logan |first3=Terry J. |last4=Ryan |first4=James A. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=1803–1810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic pollutants such as solvents or pesticides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sims|first=G.K. |first2=M. |last2=Radosevich |first3=X.-T. |last3=He |first4=S.

== Absolute bioavailability ==
[[File:AUC IVPO.svg|thumb|Absolute bioavailability is a ratio of areas under the curves. IV, intravenous; PO, oral route. C is plasma concentration (arbitrary units)]]

Absolute bioavailability compares the bioavailability of the active drug in systemic circulation following non-[[intravenous]] [[route of administration|administration]] (i.e., after [[per os|oral]], ocular, rectal, [[transdermal]], [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]], or [[sublingual]] administration), with the bioavailability of the same drug following intravenous administration. It is the fraction of the drug absorbed through non-intravenous administration compared with the corresponding intravenous administration of the same drug. The comparison must be dose normalized (e.g., account for different doses or varying weights of the subjects); consequently, the amount absorbed is corrected by dividing the corresponding dose administered.

In pharmacology, in order to determine absolute bioavailability of a drug, a [[pharmacokinetic]] study must be done to obtain a ''plasma drug concentration vs time'' plot for the drug after both intravenous (iv) and extravascular (non-intravenous, i.e., oral) administration. The absolute bioavailability is the dose-corrected area under curve (''AUC'') non-intravenous divided by ''AUC'' intravenous. The formula for calculating the absolute bioavailability, ''F'', of a drug administered orally (po) is given below (where ''D'' is dose administered).

: &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{abs} = 100 \cdot \frac{AUC_\mathrm{po} \cdot D_\mathrm{iv}}{AUC_\mathrm{iv} \cdot D_\mathrm{po}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, a drug given by the intravenous route will have an absolute bioavailability of 100% (''f'' = 1), whereas drugs given by other routes usually have an absolute bioavailability of ''less'' than one.
If we compare the two different dosage forms having same active ingredients and compare the two drug bioavailability is called comparative bioavailability.

Although knowing the true extent of systemic absorption (referred to as absolute bioavailability) is clearly useful, in practice it is not determined as frequently as one may think. The reason for this is that its assessment requires an ''intravenous reference''; that is, a route of administration that guarantees all of the administered drug reaches systemic circulation. Such studies come at considerable cost, not least of which is the necessity to conduct preclinical toxicity tests to ensure adequate safety, as well as potential problems due to solubility limitations. These limitations may be overcome, however, by administering a very low dose (typically a few micrograms) of an [[Isotopic labeling|isotopically labelled drug]] concomitantly with a therapeutic non-isotopically labelled oral dose (the isotopically-labelled intravenous dose is sufficiently low so as not to perturb the systemic drug concentrations achieved from the non-labelled oral dose). The intravenous and oral concentrations can then be deconvoluted by virtue of their different isotopic constitution, and can thus be used to determine the oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics from the same dose administration. This technique eliminates pharmacokinetic issues with non-equivalent clearance as well as enabling the intravenous dose to be administered with a minimum of toxicology and formulation. The technique was first applied using stable-isotopes such as &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and mass-spectrometry to distinguish the isotopes by mass difference. More recently, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C labelled drugs are administered intravenously and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) used to measure the isotopically labelled drug along with mass spectrometry for the unlabelled drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1517/17425255.2.3.419 |title=The use of isotopes in the determination of absolute bioavailability of drugs in humans |year=2006 |last1=Lappin |first1=Graham |last2=Rowland |first2=Malcolm |last3=Garner |first3=R. Colin |journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism &amp; Toxicology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=419–427 |pmid=16863443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no regulatory requirement to define the intravenous pharmacokinetics or absolute bioavailability however regulatory authorities do sometimes ask for absolute bioavailability information of the extravascular route in cases in which the bioavailability is apparently low or variable and there is a proven relationship between the [[pharmacodynamics]] and the pharmacokinetics at therapeutic doses. In all such cases, to conduct an absolute bioavailability study requires that the drug be given intravenously.&lt;ref name="Graham Lappin 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1517/17425255.4.8.1021 |title=Biomedical accelerator mass spectrometry: Recent applications in metabolism and pharmacokinetics |year=2008 |last1=Lappin |first1=Graham |last2=Stevens |first2=Lloyd |journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism &amp; Toxicology |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=1021–1033 |pmid=18680438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intravenous administration of a developmental drug can provide valuable information on the fundamental pharmacokinetic parameters of [[volume of distribution]] (''V'') and [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] (''CL'').&lt;ref name="Graham Lappin 2008" /&gt;

== Relative bioavailability and bioequivalence ==

In pharmacology, relative bioavailability measures the bioavailability (estimated as the ''AUC'') of a formulation (A) of a certain drug when compared with another formulation (B) of the same drug, usually an established standard, or through administration via a different route. When the standard consists of intravenously administered drug, this is known as absolute bioavailability (see [[#Absolute bioavailability|above]]).

: &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{rel} = 100 \cdot \frac{AUC_\mathrm{A} \cdot D_\mathrm{B}}{AUC_\mathrm{B} \cdot D_\mathrm{A}}&lt;/math&gt;

Relative bioavailability is one of the measures used to assess [[bioequivalence]] (''BE'') between two drug products. For FDA approval, a generic manufacturer must demonstrate that the 90% [[confidence interval]] for the ratio of the mean responses (usually of ''AUC'' and the maximum concentration, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of its product to that of the "brand name drug"{{cref|OB}} is within the limits of 80% to 125%. Where ''AUC'' refers to the concentration of the drug in the blood over time ''t'' = 0 to ''t'' = ∞, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the maximum concentration of the drug in the blood. When ''T''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is given, it refers to the time it takes for a drug to reach ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.

While the mechanisms by which a formulation affects bioavailability and bioequivalence have been extensively studied in drugs, formulation factors that influence bioavailability and bioequivalence in nutritional supplements are largely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11285360 |year=2001 |last1=Hoag |first1=Stephen W. |last2=Hussain |first2=Ajaz S. |title=The Impact of Formulation on Bioavailability: Summary of Workshop Discussion |volume=131 |issue=4 Suppl. |pages=1389–1391S |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11285360}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in nutritional sciences, relative bioavailability or bioequivalence is the most common measure of bioavailability, comparing the bioavailability of one formulation of the same dietary ingredient to another.

== Factors influencing bioavailability ==

The absolute bioavailability of a drug, when administered by an extravascular route, is usually less than one (i.e., ''F''&lt; 100%). Various physiological factors reduce the availability of drugs prior to their entry into the systemic circulation. Whether a drug is taken with or without food will also affect absorption, other drugs taken concurrently may alter absorption and first-pass metabolism, intestinal motility alters the dissolution of the drug and may affect the degree of chemical degradation of the drug by intestinal microflora. Disease states affecting liver metabolism or gastrointestinal function will also have an effect.

Other factors may include, but are not limited to:
* Physical properties of the drug ([[Hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]], [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]], [[solubility]])
* The drug formulation (immediate release, excipients used, manufacturing methods, [[Time release technology|modified release]] – delayed release, extended release, sustained release, etc.)
* Whether the formulation is administered in a fed or [[fasting|fasted]] state
* Gastric emptying rate
* [[Circadian]] differences
* Interactions with other drugs/foods:
** Interactions with other drugs (e.g., [[antacid]]s, alcohol, nicotine)
** Interactions with other foods (e.g., [[grapefruit juice]], [[pomello]], [[cranberry juice]], [[brassica]] vegetables)
* Transporters: Substrate of [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] transporters (e.g. [[P-glycoprotein]])
* Health of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]]
* [[Enzyme]] induction/inhibition by other drugs/foods:
** Enzyme induction (increased rate of metabolism), e.g., [[Phenytoin]] induces [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]], and [[CYP3A4]]
** [[Enzyme inhibitor|Enzyme inhibition]] (decreased rate of metabolism), e.g., grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A → higher nifedipine concentrations
* Individual variation in metabolic differences
** Age: In general, drugs are metabolized more slowly in fetal, neonatal, and geriatric populations
** [[Phenotype#Phenotypic variation|Phenotypic differences]], [[enterohepatic circulation]], diet, gender
* Disease state
** E.g., [[hepatic]] insufficiency, poor [[renal]] function

Each of these factors may vary from patient to patient (inter-individual variation), and indeed in the same patient over time (intra-individual variation). In [[clinical trial]]s, inter-individual variation is a critical measurement used to assess the bioavailability differences from patient to patient in order to ensure predictable dosing.

== Bioavailability of drugs versus dietary supplements ==

In comparison to drugs, there are significant differences in dietary supplements that impact the evaluation of their bioavailability. These differences include the following: the fact that nutritional supplements provide benefits that are variable and often qualitative in nature; the measurement of nutrient absorption lacks the precision; nutritional supplements are consumed for prevention and well-being; nutritional supplements do not exhibit characteristic [[dose-response relationship|dose-response curves]]; and dosing intervals of nutritional supplements, therefore, are not critical in contrast to drug therapy.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan" /&gt;

In addition, the lack of defined methodology and regulations surrounding the consumption of dietary supplements hinders the application of bioavailability measures in comparison to drugs. In clinical trials with dietary supplements, bioavailability primarily focuses on statistical descriptions of mean or average AUC differences between treatment groups, while often failing to compare or discuss their standard deviations or inter-individual variation. This failure leaves open the question of whether or not an individual in a group is likely to experience the benefits described by the mean-difference comparisons. Further, even if this issue were discussed, it would be difficult to communicate meaning of these inter-subject variances to consumers and/or their physicians.

== Nutritional science: reliable and universal bioavailability ==

One way to resolve this problem is to define "reliable bioavailability" as positive bioavailability results (an absorption meeting a predefined criterion) that include 84% of the trial subjects and "universal bioavailability" as those that include 98% of the trial subjects. This reliable-universal framework would improve communications with physicians and consumers such that, if it were included on products labels for example, make educated choices as to the benefits of a formulation for them directly. In addition, the reliable-universal framework is similar to the construction of confidence intervals, which statisticians have long offered as one potential solution for dealing with small samples, violations of statistical assumptions or large standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kagan |first1=Daniel |last2=Madhavi |first2=Doddabele |last3=Bank |first3=Ginny |last4=Lachlan |first4=Kenneth |title='Universal' and 'Reliable' Bioavailability Claims: Criteria That May Increase Physician Confidence in Nutritional Supplements |journal=Natural Medicine Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=2010 |url=http://naturalmedicinejournal.net/pdf/NMJ_JAN10_NaPh.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaware's Court of Chancery, the nation's pre-eminent court addressing intra-business disputes, has functioned as a business court of limited jurisdiction for a century.  However, its traditional equity jurisdiction has evolved and expanded since 2003 to include technology disputes (10 Del. C. § 346), some purely monetary commercial disputes (10 Del. C. § 347), and to expand its role in the alternative dispute resolution of business and commercial disputes. This includes the use of mediation (10 Del. C. § 347), arbitration (10 Del. C. § 349), Masters in Chancery to adjudicate matters (10 Del. C. § 350), and agreements to make decisions non-appealable (10 Del. C. § 351).&lt;ref&gt;[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c003/sc03/ Title 10, Delaware Code, Courts and Judicial Procedures]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Court Jurisdiction, Technology Disputes &amp; Cyber Courts, and Complex Litigation Courts==
Business Courts are trial courts that hear business disputes primarily or exclusively.  In the United States, these courts have been established in approximately twenty states.  In some cases, a state legislature may choose to create a business court by statute.  In other cases, business courts have been established by judicial rule or order, at the Supreme Court or trial court level.  In all cases, the jurisdiction of the court to hear certain cases is limited to disputes that are in some way related to "business" disputes, and generally fall into two categories:  (1) those courts which require that cases have an additional complexity component; and (2) those courts which establish jurisdictional parameters (i) through a defined list of case types (ii) combined with a specified minimum amount of damages in controversy, irrespective of complexity.  There are courts with mixed models as well.&lt;ref&gt;* Mitchell L. Bach &amp; Lee Applebaum, [http://v028u02dxf.maximumasp.com/uploads/publications/historybusinesscourts2.pdf ''A History of the Creation and Jurisdiction of Business Courts in the Last Decade''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904050912/http://v028u02dxf.maximumasp.com/uploads/publications/historybusinesscourts2.pdf |date=September 4, 2012 }}, 60 Business Lawyer 147 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, for example, the Commercial Division may hear cases (1) alleging breach of contract, (2) arising under the state's business corporation law, (3) arising under the state's partnership law, (4) relating to commercial loans, negotiable instruments, letters of credit, and bank transactions, or (5) involving business torts.  The Commercial Division may not, by comparison, hear cases involving (1) landlord/tenant disputes, (2) commercial foreclosures, (3) products liability claims, or (4) claims alleging discrimination except when part of or under the terms of a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Section 202.70, Rules of the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New York [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/trialcourts/202.shtml#70 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states have established specialized courts that include technology disputes as part of their express jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob A. Sommer, Business Litigation and Cyberspace: Will Cyber Courts Prove and Effective Tool for Luring High-Tech Business Into Forum States, 56 Vanderbilt Law Review 561 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Through legislative effort and court rule, Maryland established a Business and Technology Case Management Program.  In May 2003, [[Delaware]] expanded the Court of Chancery’s jurisdiction to include technology disputes, and the mediation of other kinds of business disputes (10 Del. C. §§ 346, 347).&lt;ref&gt;[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c003/sc03/ Title 10, Delaware Code, Courts and Judicial Procedures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states are in various stages of moving toward or away from business or complex courts, with Colorado having conducted extensive studies over a decade ago into the merits and potential parameters of creating a business court on a broad basis, which was not pursued; and New Jersey considering state wide business court legislation over a period of years.

'''''Capital Connection''''' is a television business news programme aired every weekday on various CNBC channels around the world.  It is broadcast live from [[CNBC Asia]]'s Singapore studios and from CNBC's Middle East headquarters in [[Abu Dhabi]] and is presented by Nancy Hungerford and Hadley Gamble.  

The programme debuted on 26 March 2007 as a result of significant schedule changes at both networks. Billed as "the bridge between Asia and Europe", the show airs from noon to 1pm [[Hong Kong]]/[[Singapore]]/[[Taiwan]] Time (until 2pm when Europe is not on Daylight Saving Time) on CNBC Asia (roughly the midpoint of the Asian trading day) and from 6am to 7am [[Central European Time|CET]] (starts at 5am when Europe isn't on DST) on CNBC Europe.  The show also airs on the [[CNBC World]] channel in the United States weekdays from midnight to 1am [[North American Eastern Time Zone|ET]].

==Format==
The show functions as an early-afternoon look at the Asian trading day. Previously the format had focussed on the top Asian business stories thus far and looked ahead to the corporate and economic news expected in Europe.  Previously correspondents from Asia usually appeared on the first half of the show while those from Europe came in on the second half of the show. Now only Asia-based staff input into the show. 

==History==
''Capital Connection'' replaced ''[[Today's Business (CNBC Europe)|Today's Business]]'' (also hosted by Steve Sedgwick), an early morning pre-market programme originating from CNBC Europe which also aired on CNBC Asia and CNBC World.

Prior to ''Capital Connection'', another show anchored from two continents was ''Market Watch'' (later renamed ''Global Market Watch''). Unlike ''Capital Connection'', this show was produced by CNBC Europe. It was originally anchored by [[Geoff Cutmore]] from London and Cecilia Zecha from Singapore but it was later hosted exclusively from London by [[Simon Hobbs]]. The show ended its run in early 2001.

[[Steve Sedgwick]] served as European anchor from the launch of the programme until 28 November 2008. He then left the programme to work full-time for ''[[Squawk Box Europe]]'' and was replaced by Rebecca Meehan (now Beccy Barr) on 1 December 2008 and in 2010 by Anna Edwards.[https://www.cnbc.com/id/27997245]  After Edwards departed at the end of 2011, Meehan returned as the programme's European anchor and continued in that role until she left CNBC at the end of 2012.

[[Maura Fogarty]] served as Asian anchor from the launch until March 2010, when she was replaced by Chloe Cho until she left the network in January 2014. Sri Jegarajah, previously a reporter, was promoted to anchor full-time, and subsequently permanently took the presenting role.

In 2010 and 2011, the show had a third anchor. On 14 June 2010 [[Yousef Gamal El-Din]], joined the show from the network's then-newly opened [[Bahrain]] studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=CNBC’s Editorial Hub Starts Broadcasting Live From The Middle East|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/37552562|publisher=[[CNBC Europe]]|accessdate=9 June 2010|date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, this leg of the show was only featured from Monday to Thursday, but was later featured every weekday from February 2011 to November 2011, when the Bahrain leg was discontinued altogether.  As a result, ''Capital Connection'' reverted to two continents (Asia and Europe). 

Between 31 December 2012 and 12 July 2013, the London studios was on hiatus after Meehan's departure from CNBC and the programme came from a single location and was solely presented from Singapore. On 15 July 2013, the European anchor was reinstated with Carolin Roth (also previously a reporter) in the presenters' chair until 29 August 2014. On 20 October 2014, Helia Ebrahimi replaced Roth on the anchoring role until she left CNBC altogether in March 2015.  In July 2015, Nancy Hungerford (previously a producer in CNBC Europe, who then became a reporter and anchor full-time) joined as European anchor for ''Capital Connection'' until she was re-assigned at the end of that year (Hungerford would ultimately return to the show as an anchor, this time based in Singapore, a year and a half later).  

On 9 February 2015, ''Capital Connection'' updated its logo.  The opening animation sequence was shared with CNBC US' ''[[Squawk on the Street]]''.

On 4 January 2016, due to CNBC International's cutbacks at its London operations, ''Capital Connection'' was permanently reduced to a single location in Singapore, with Jegarajah as its solo anchor. This was the first time that the show did not have an anchor based in London.

On 3 October 2016, Pauline Chiou, who had previously anchored ''[[The Rundown (CNBC Asia)|The Rundown]]'' since its 31 March 2014 debut, replaced Sri Jegarajah as anchor after the latter was elevated to CNBC Asia's Senior Correspondent.

On 3 July 2017, Nancy Hungerford, who was previously a correspondent and relief anchor in [[CNBC Europe]], joined CNBC Asia and rejoined the programme as an anchor, replacing Chiou.

From 30 October 2017 until the end of March 2018, when Europe was not on DST, the show was expanded to two hours, starting at 5am CET. This was the first time that live programming had been broadcast during this hour as previously the hour had been filled by a showing of ''[[Fast Money (talk show)|Fast Money]]'' on a six-hour tape delay or by pre-recorded programmes.  The show was once again expanded to two hours on 29 October 2018, again with Europe not on DST.  

On 16 April 2018, Hadley Gamble, who was previously a Middle East-based correspondent with CNBC Europe, joined the show as its European anchor.  She is based from the network's newly opened studio in [[Abu Dhabi]], with Hungerford still based in Singapore.

==Market holidays==
On Asian bank holidays, CNBC Europe occasionally produced the programme, as occurred on 8 February 2008, 16 February 2010 and 11 February 2013.  Alternatively, the show was simply not aired.

The '''Changi Business Park''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''CBP'''; {{lang-ms|Taman Perniagaan Changi}}; [[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 樟宜商业园; {{lang-ta|சாங்கி பிஸினஸ் பார்க்}}) is a [[business park]] located in [[Changi]] South, in the eastern part of [[Singapore]].

==Launch==
Launched in July 1997, the 66-[[hectare]] or  Changi Business Park is [[JTC Corporation]]'s second business park following the [[International Business Park]] in [[Jurong East]]. The Changi Business Park comprises a mix of [[high technology]] business, [[data]] and [[software]] enterprises, [[research and development]] divisions and [[knowledge]] intensive facilities.

The Changi Business Park is located near to [[Changi Airport]], the Aviation Distri-Zone and logistics facilities. This simplifies transportation and logistics arrangements for businesses leading to significant cost savings. 

The business park is also close to [[Singapore Expo]], one of South East Asia’s largest exhibition centres and easily accessible to the Central Business District by rail via the [[Expo MRT Station]] and by road via the [[Pan Island Expressway]] and the [[East Coast Parkway]]. 

Completed in 2012, a large area of 71.07-hectare Changi Business Park would open as a [[mixed-use development]] project. Comprising a retail shopping mall, office building, and hotel building, the project was redeveloped by a joint venture between Ascendas Land and Frasers Centerpoint. Construction of the project was undertaken by Japanese general construction contractor [[Nakano Corporation]].

Investors can lease land sites from JTC Corporation to construct their facilities.  

==List of CBP Businesses==
Within the past year, CBP has expanded greatly, and it now houses -- or is in close proximity to -- the following businesses (or branches/satellite offices of business), just to name a few:

A '''corporate accelerator''' is a specific form of [[seed accelerator]] which is sponsored by an established for-profit corporation. Similar to seed accelerators they support early-stage [[Startup company|startup companies]] through [[mentorship]] and often capital and office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Accelerating Entrepreneurs and Ecosystems: The Seed Accelerator Model |journal=Innovation Policy and the Economy |date=2015 |last=Hochberg |first=Yael |volume=16 |page=24|accessdate=2015-06-17 |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c13584.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to regular programs, though, corporate accelerators derive their objectives from the sponsoring organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://corporate-accelerators.net/2015/06/15/what-is-a-corporate-accelerator.html |title=What are Corporate Accelerators? |last=Heinemann |first=Florian |date=2015-06-15 |accessdate=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These objectives can include the wish to stay close to emerging trends or to establish a funnel for corporate [[venture capital]] investments.

According to [https://corporate-accelerators.net/database/index.html Corporate Accelerator DB] there are 70+ such programs in existence as of December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://corporate-accelerators.net/database/index.html |title=Corporate Accelerator Database |last=Heinemann |first=Florian |accessdate=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable companies include [[Microsoft]], [[Citrix]], and [[Telefónica]] who were among the first companies to offer such programs in the early 2010s. More recently, corporate accelerators have faced criticism as they might be less effective as regular seed accelerators. For example, the startup could be too focused on solving the problems of the sponsoring firm rather than finding external customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/corporate-accelerators-are-an-oxymoron/ |title=Corporate Accelerators Are An Oxymoron |last=Crichton |first=Danny |date=2014-08-25 |accessdate=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate accelerators differ from [[Business incubators]], which usually have a continuous intake, due to their fixed-term, cohort-based organization (similar to seed accelerators) and are distinct to [[corporate venture capital]] which is a direct, targeted investment.

{{Insolvency}}
'''Cross-border insolvency''' (sometimes called '''international insolvency''') regulates the treatment of financially distressed debtors where such debtors have assets or creditors in more than one country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency in Private International Law|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|author=Ian Fletcher|edition=2nd|year=2005|isbn=978-0199262502}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, cross-border insolvency is more concerned with the [[insolvency]] of [[corporation|companies]] that operate in more than one country rather than [[bankruptcy]] of individuals.  Like traditional [[conflict of laws]] rules, cross-border insolvency focuses upon three areas: choice of law rules, jurisdiction rules and enforcement of judgment rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=385|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in relation to insolvency, the principal focus tends to be the recognition of foreign insolvency officials and their powers.

==Theories of cross-border insolvency==
There are, broadly, three approaches to the administration of cross-border insolvency:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=386|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The territorial approach''', whereby each country exercises its own domestic insolvency laws in relation to all the debtor's property and all of the creditors located within its jurisdiction.  This approach does not recognise any extraterritorial dimension to insolvency law.
* '''The universalist approach''' (or ''universal approach''), whereby any cross-border insolvencies are administered pursuant to a single global insolvency regime, and all of the debtor's assets are distributed by a single insolvency office holder, regardless where the assets or claimants are located.
* '''Hybrid approach'''.  A number of hybrid approaches exist in theory or practice, including:
** [[Modified universalism]], whereby individual countries seek to identify the most relevant jurisdiction in which to conduct the proceedings, and all other states cooperate with and facilitate such proceedings (subject to limits of [[public policy]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jay Westbrook |date= |title=Global Solution to Multinational Default |url=http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/Insolvency%20Topics/Sovereign%20Insolvencies/18~_Global_Solution_to_Multinational_Default.pdf |journal=[[Michigan Law Review]] |year=2000 |volume=98 |page=2276 |doi=10.2307/1290306 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623122232/http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/Insolvency%20Topics/Sovereign%20Insolvencies/18~_Global_Solution_to_Multinational_Default.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or
** Co-operative territorialism, which is broadly predicated on territorialist approach supplemented by multi-lateral conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lynn LoPucki |date= |title=Cooperation in International Bankruptcy: A Post-Universalist Approach |url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Lopucki.pdf |journal=[[Cornell Law Review]] |year=1999 |volume=86 |page=696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universalist approach remains largely a holistic ideal and, for the most part, countries are divided into those with a purely territorial approach, and those that apply some form of hybrid approach.

==Development==

Historically, most legal systems have developed on a territorial basis, and this is as true in relation to bankruptcy laws as other areas.  However, from an early stage there have been piecemeal attempts to develop cross-border cooperation in insolvency matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=387|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In 1889 seven treaties were signed in Montevideo with the aim to harmonising [[private international law]] in the signatory states ([[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Uruguay]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=742785|title=The Treaties of Montevideo (1889)|author=Wyndham Bewes|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which related to the regulation of bankruptcies between member states.  The treaty was updated in 1930, and broadly provided for a system more closer to territorialism than universality, providing for multiple bankruptcy administrations in different states for multinational companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;pg=PT946&amp;lpg=PT946&amp;dq=Montevideo+Bankruptcy+Treaty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-jm4fRiV6&amp;sig=jibUcGANCJ2UJY03tYpmJyVIWFU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CPiIVfrIO4G2-QHt6YO4Dw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Montevideo%20Bankruptcy%20Treaty&amp;f=false|title=Principles of International Insolvency|author=Philip Wood|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|location=29-080| year=2007 |isbn=9781847032102 |accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1933 Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden signed into law the [[Nordic Bankruptcy Convention]] which, although not a lengthy document, is still in force today and facilitates administration of cross border bankruptcies in the Scandinavia region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/country%20resources/Norway/Articles/1~_Nordic_Bankruptcy.pdf|title=The Nordic Bankruptcy Convention - An Introduction|author=Carl Hugo Parment|date=|accessdate=23 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623141319/http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/country%20resources/Norway/Articles/1~_Nordic_Bankruptcy.pdf|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1980s the [[International Bar Association]] published a model law, the Model International Insolvency Co-operation Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth Somers |date= |title=The Model International Insolvency Cooperation Act: An International Proposal for Domestic Legislation |url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1571&amp;context=auilr |journal=[[American University International Law Review]] |year=2011 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately this model was not adopted by any country and the attempt was unsuccessful.

But from a comparatively early stage [[common law]] jurisdictions recognised the desirability of ensuring that insolvency officers from different jurisdictions received the necessary support to enable the efficient administration of estates.  Under English law one of the earliest recorded cases was ''Solomons v Ross'' (1764) 1 H Bl 131n.  In that case a firm in the Netherlands was declared bankrupt and assignees were appointed.  An English creditor had brought [[garnishment|garnishee proceedings]] in England to attach certain sums owing to the Dutch firm but Bathurst J held that the bankruptcy had vested all the firm's assets (including debts owed by English debtors) in the Dutch assignees, and the English creditor had  to surrender the fruits of the garnishee proceedings and prove in the Dutch bankruptcy.  In ''Re African Farms'' 1906 TS 373 an English company with assets in the [[Transvaal Colony]] was in [[winding-up]] in England, and the Chief Justice of the Transvaal confirmed that the English [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] would be recognised and that "recognition which carries with it the active assistance of the court", and that active assistance could include: "A declaration, in effect, that the liquidator is entitled to deal with the Transvaal assets in the same way as if they were within the jurisdiction of the English courts, subject only to such conditions as the court may impose for the protection of local creditors, or in recognition of the requirements of our local laws."  In ''Galbraith v Grimshaw'' [1910] AC 508 [[Andrew Murray, 1st Viscount Dunedin|Lord Dunedin]] stated that there should be only one universal process of the distribution of a bankrupt's property and that, where such a process was pending elsewhere, the English courts should not let actions in its jurisdiction interfere with that process.&lt;ref&gt;"Now so far as the general principle is concerned it is quite consistent with the comity of nations that it should be a rule of international law that if the court finds that there is already pending a process of universal distribution of a bankrupt's effects it should not allow steps to be taken in its territory which would interfere with that process of universal distribution." at 513&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first significant developments in relation to cross-border insolvency regimes which were widely adopted were (1) the UNCITRAL Model Law, and (2) the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000.

==Modern regimes==

Two current regimes for international insolvencies have been implemented on something wider than a regional basis: the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, and the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000.&lt;ref&gt;No 1346/2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Both regimes locate the ''centre of main interest'' (or "COMI") of the debtor.

===The UNCITRAL Model Law===
{{Main article|UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency}}
The [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] adopted a model law relating to cross-border insolvency on 30 June 1997.&lt;ref name=uncitral&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/insolvency/1997Model.html|title=UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (1997)|publisher=UNCITRAL|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At present 46 jurisdictions have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation, including a number of states with both significant economies and large volumes of cross border trade—such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, as well as leading emerging economies such as Mexico and [[South Africa]].

The basic concept of the Model Law is to establish what the "main proceedings" are in relation to any international insolvency.  All other proceedings are referred to as the "non-main proceedings".  The main proceedings are commenced where the debtor has its centre of main interest, or "COMI".&lt;ref name=uncitral /&gt;  Non-main proceedings may be commenced in any place where the debtor has a commercial establishment.  The Model Law does not require reciprocity between states, but focuses upon (i) ensuring that states give assistance to insolvency officials from other countries in relation to main proceedings and non-main proceedings, and (ii) eliminating preferences for local creditors over international ones.&lt;ref&gt;Model Law, Article 13, paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The following countries have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation.&lt;ref name=Countries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/insolvency/1997Model_status.html|title=Status - UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (1997)|publisher=UNCITRAL|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000===

{{Main article|Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000}}

The [[Regulation (European Union)|EC Regulation]] on Insolvency Proceedings 2000 was passed on 29 May 2000 and came into effect on 31 May 2002.&lt;ref name=ECReg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32000R1346|title=Council regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings|publisher=Eur-Lex|date=|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EC Regulation, as its name applies, operates between member states of the [[European Union]], and focuses upon creating a framework for the commencement of proceedings and for the automatic recognition and co-operation between the different member states.  Unusually for a European regulation, the EC Insolvency Regulation does not seek to harmonise insolvency laws between the different member states.

Like the UNCITRAL Model Law, the EC Regulation also employs the concept of a centre of main interest (or "COMI").  The definition of the COMI is left to member states in their implementation of the Regulation, but paragraph (13) of the preamble states: 'The "centre of main interests" should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.'  If the COMI of an entity is outside of the European Union then the insolvency proceedings are not subject to the Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;''Re the Arena Corporation Ltd'' [2003] EWHC 3032 (Ch.), affirmed on appeal ([2004] EWCA Civ 371).&lt;/ref&gt;  In relation to [[corporation|companies]] there is a [[presumption (law)|presumption]] that the registered office is the COMI of the company, but this presumption can be (and often is) [[rebuttal|rebutted]].&lt;ref&gt;''Re AIM Underwriting Agencies'' [2004] EWHC Civ 2114; ''Re TXU Europe German Finance BV'' [2005] BCC 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC Regulation does not define insolvency, but it does define insolvency proceedings as "...collective insolvency proceedings which entail the partial or total divestment of a debtor and the appointment of a liquidator."&lt;ref&gt;Article 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 3 divides proceedings into main proceedings and territorial proceedings.  Main proceedings are accorded extraterritorial effect throughout the European Union.  One of the concerns expressed in relation to the EC Regulation is that (other than a reference to the [[European Court of Justice]]) it provides no mechanism for determining which set of proceedings are the main proceedings if two or more jurisdictions claim their proceedings are the main proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd'' (Case C-341/04), [2006] ECR 1-701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=400|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of conflict==

In any attempt to harmonise or facilitate cross-border administration of insolvent companies, national insolvency regimes can take widely divergent approaches on certain key points:

* '''[[Secured creditor]]s.'''  Whether or not bankruptcy proceedings operate as a stay upon the enforcement of secured creditor's rights as a fundamental determinant in relation to the manner of conduct of any proceedings
* '''Corporate rehabilitation regimes.''' Bankruptcy systems predicated on trying to rehabilitate companies (such as [[Chapter 11]] in the United States, or [[administration order]]s in the United Kingdom) are fundamentally different in intent and effect to winding-up regimes that seeks to liquidate companies and distribute the proceeds to creditors.
* '''Set-off rights.''' Whilst certain countries allow creditors who have mutual claims with the debtor to [[set-off (law)|set-off]] those claims in full, others require the creditors to pay any sums owed to the debtor in full before claiming in the proceedings.  Within jurisdictions that do permit set-off, variations may arise as to whether set-off must be on an individual or group basis.&lt;ref&gt;In an insolvent liquidation, banks who provide loan finance are often key creditors. Similarly, most companies also have cash-at-bank as one of their assets.  The ability of banks to set-off those sums can be a material factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4982">'''Customer analytics''' is a process by which data from [[customer behavior]] is used to help make key business [[decision support system|decisions]] via [[market segment]]ation and [[predictive analytics]]. This information is used by businesses for [[direct marketing]], [[site selection]], and [[customer relationship management]]. Marketing provides services in order to satisfy customers. With that in mind, the productive system is considered from its beginning at the production level, to the end of the cycle at the consumer. Customer analytics plays an important role in the prediction of customer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kioumarsi et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
;Retail:Although until recently over 90% of retailers had limited visibility on their customers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The futre of retail supply chains |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/retail/articles/future_of_retail_supply_chains.ashx |website=www.mckinsey.com |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with increasing investments in loyalty programs, customer tracking solutions and market research, this industry started increasing use of customer analytics in decisions ranging from product, promotion, price and distribution management.{{cn|date=May 2016}} The most obvious use of customer analytics in retail today is the development of personalized communications and offers and/or different marketing programs by segment.{{cn|date=May 2016}} Additional reasons set forth by Bain &amp; Co. include: prioritizing product development efforts, designing distribution strategies and determining product pricing.&lt;ref&gt;Bain &amp; Co.{{clarify|research paper? publication?|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographic, lifestyle, preference, loyalty data, behavior, shopper value and predictive behavior data points are key to the success of customer analytics.{{cn|date=May 2016}}
;Finance: Banks, insurance companies and pension funds make use of customer analytics in understanding customer lifetime value, identifying below-zero customers which are estimated to be around 30% of customer base, increasing cross-sales, managing [[customer attrition]] as well as migrating customers to lower cost channels in a targeted manner.
;Community: Municipalities utilize customer analytics in an effort to lure retailers to their cities. Using [[psychographic]] variables, communities can be segmented based on attributes like personality, values, interests, and lifestyle. Using this information, communities can approach retailers that match their community’s profile.
;Customer relationship management: Analytical [[Customer Relationship Management]], commonly abbreviated as CRM, enables measurement of and prediction from customer data to provide a 360° view of the client.

==Predicting customer behaviour==
Forecasting [[Consumer behaviour|buying habits]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] preferences is a process of data mining and analysis. This information consists of many aspects like [[credit card]] purchases, [[magazine subscription]]s, [[loyalty card]] membership, [[survey (human research)|surveys]], and [[voter registration]]. Using these categories, [[consumer profile]]s can be created for any organization’s most profitable customers. When many of these potential customers are aggregated in a single area it indicates a fertile location for the business to situate. Using a drive time analysis, it is also possible to predict how far a given customer will drive to a particular location. Combining these sources of information, a dollar value can be placed on each household within a trade area detailing the likelihood that household will be worth to a company. Through customer analytics, companies can make decisions based on facts and objective data.

===Data mining===
There are two types of categories of [[data mining]]. [[Predictive model]]s use previous customer interactions to predict future events while [[data clustering|segmentation techniques]] are used to place customers with similar behaviors and attributes into distinct groups. This grouping can help marketers to optimize their campaign management and targeting processes.

'''Eagle Oil and Shipping Company''' was a [[United Kingdom]] merchant shipping company that operated [[Tanker (ship)|oil tankers]] between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the UK. [[Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray]] founded it as the '''Eagle Oil Transport Company''' in 1912 and sold it to [[Royal Dutch Shell]] in 1919. It was renamed Eagle Oil and Shipping Company in about 1930, and remained a separate company within the Royal Dutch Shell group until it was absorbed in 1959.

==Pearson oil interests in Mexico==
[[File:1st Viscount Cowdray.jpg|thumb|Weetman Pearson, Viscount Cowdray]]
Sir Weetman Pearson, [[Baronet|Bart.]] (ennobled as [[Viscount Cowdray]] in 1910) headed a successful civil engineering contractor, [[Pearson PLC|S. Pearson and Sons]], that had contracts in Mexico from 1889. He initiated oil prospecting there in 1901 and founded the [[Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company]] in 1909, which had its first major oil strike in 1910 (near [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast).

Before Pearson struck oil, he started to order [[History of the oil tanker#Breaking the Standard Oil monopoly|oil tankers]] to carry the oil that he hoped to produce. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] on the [[River Tyne]] launched ''San Cristobal'' (2,041 tons) in 1906 and [[Swan Hunter]], also on Tyneside, launched ''San Antonio'' (5,251 tons) in 1909. Pearson also bought ''James Brand'' (3,907 tons), which had been built by Armstrong Whitworth in 1893, and renamed her ''San Bernardo''.

==Eagle Oil Transport Company==
In 1912 Pearson founded the Eagle Oil Transport Company in the UK to take over his ships and carry Mexican Eagle's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= [[Marconi Company|Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph]] |date=1912-02-29 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |title= Form $5,000,000 Line.; Cowdray Interests to Build Fleet to Carry Mexican Oil Products |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE1DB123BE633A2575AC2A9649C946396D6CF |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the '''Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Company''' in the UK to sell Mexican Eagle's products outside Mexico.{{sfn|Godley|2007|pp=15, 16}}

Eagle Oil Transport immediately ordered 20 modern steam tankers{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=15}} at a cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]3 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=18}} The company gave all the ships the Spanish names of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[saint]]s, most of them ending in ''"o"''.{{sfn|Talbot-Booth|1942|p=460}} Swan Hunter launched {{SS|San Dunstano||2}} (6,238 tons)&lt;ref name=WreckSiteDunstano&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?113247 |title=SS San Dunstano [+1929] |last1=Lettens |first1=Jan |last2=Allen |first2=Tony |date=2011-10-13 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{SS|San Eduardo||2}} (6,225 tons) in 1912,&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930&gt;{{cite book |title=Lloyd's Register of Shipping |year=1930 |publisher=[[Lloyd's of London]] |location=London |page= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{SS|San Fraterno||2}} (11,929 tons)&lt;ref name=WreckSiteFraterno&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?136089 |title=SS San Fraterno [+1927] |last=Allen |first=Tony |date=2011-01-06 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''San Silvestre'' (6,223 tons), ''San Tirso'' (6,236 tons) and ''San Gregorio'' (12,093 tons) in 1913 and ''San Lorenzo'' (12,097 tons) in 1914. [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company]], also on the Tyne, launched {{SS|San Hilario||2}} (10,157 tons) and ''San Valerio'' (6,493 tons) in 1913 and {{SS|San Melito||2}} (12,286 tons) in 1914.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt; [[William Doxford &amp; Sons]] launched [[SS Southern Empress|''San Jeronimo'']] (12,398 tons), ''San Nazario'' (12,029 tons) and ''San Zeferino'' (6,433 tons) in 1914. Armstrong Whitworth launched ''San Ricardo'' (6,465 tons) and {{SS|San Urbano||2}} (6,458 tons) in 1913, {{SS|San Wilfrido|1914|2}} (6,458 tons), [[SS Dordogne|''San Isidoro'']] (9,718 tons) and {{SS|San Onofre||2}} (9,717 tons) in 1914 and [[SS Southern Princess|''San Patricio'']] (12,092 tons) in 1915.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt;

Eagle Oil Transport suffered significant war losses in the First World War. On 3 August 1914 ''San Wilfrido'' struck a [[Naval mine|mine]] and sank off Cuxhaven in the North Sea, making her the first merchant ship sunk in the [[World War I|First World War]]. German submarines torpedoed and sank ''San Hilario'' in April 1917 and ''San Urbano'' and ''San Onofre'' in May 1917, all in the [[North Atlantic]] to the west of Ireland. In 1915 the company had bought a [[Cargo ship|dry cargo]] [[steamship]], ''Drumlanrig'', which was renamed {{SS|Santa Amalia||2}}.&lt;ref name=WreckSiteAmalia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?63352 |title=SS Santa Amalia [+1917] |last=Lettens |first=Jan |date=2011-09-19 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1917 the German submarine  {{SMU|U-19|Germany|6}} torpedoed and sank ''Santa Amalia'' in the North Atlantic to the west of [[Islay]], with the loss of 43 officers and crew.&lt;ref name=WreckSiteAmalia/&gt; ''San Zeferino'' was damaged by enemy action during the war.

Eagle Oil Transport had at least one motor tanker by the end of the War; the {{MV|San Dario||2}} (1,137 tons), which had been launched in 1918 by [[Short Brothers of Sunderland]].&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt; The company continued to buy new steam tankers until at least 1928, when [[J.L. Thompson and Sons]] launched SS ''San Casto'' (2,446 tons) on the [[River Wear]] and Armstrong Whitworth launched SS ''San Claudio'' (2,712 tons).&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt;

In 1919 Viscount Cowdray sold his group of oil companies to [[Royal Dutch Shell]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=1}} Eagle Oil Transport renewed and expanded its fleet, and some of the new ships were very large by the standards of the day. Armstrong Whitworth launched {{SS|San Fernando||2}} (13,056 tons) in 1919, ''San Felix'' (13,037 tons) in 1921 and {{SS|San Fabian||2}} (13,013 tons) in 1922.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt; Swan Hunter launched {{SS|San Florentino||2}} (12,842 tons) in 1919 and Palmers launched ''San Gaspar'' (12,910 tons) in 1921 and {{SS|San Gerardo||2}} (12,915 tons) in 1922.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt;

Eagle Oil also bought new medium-sized tankers. Swan Hunter built the War Standard tanker ''War Kookri'' (5,582 tons) for the War Shipping Controller, but when she was launched in 1919 Cowdray bought her and renamed her ''San Zotico''.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt; Cowdray then turned to the USA for new ships of this size. Standard Shipbuilding Company of [[Shooters Island#Shipyard|Shooters Island]], New York launched ''San Teodoro'' (6,137 tons), {{SS|San Tiburcio||2}} (5,995 tons)&lt;ref name=WreckSiteTiburcio&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?10342 |title=MV San Tiburcio [+1940] |last1=Lettens |first1=Jan |last2=Vleggeert |first2=Nico |date=2010-01-06 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''San Ubaldo'' (5,999 tons) in 1921.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt;

After 1921 Cowdray reverted to UK shipyards. Armstrong Whitworth launched ''San Roberto'' (5,890 tons) and ''San Rosendo'' (5,891 tons) in 1922, ''San Quirino'' (5,843 tons) in 1923 and ''San Salvador'' (5,805 tons) in 1924.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt;

In 1927 ''San Fraterno'' was wrecked on a rock at Bonet Island in the [[Strait of Magellan]]&lt;ref name=WreckSiteFraterno/&gt; and in 1929 ''San Dunstano'' was wrecked at the entrance to Tampico harbour.&lt;ref name=WreckSiteDunstano/&gt;

In about 1930 the Eagle Oil Transport Company was renamed the Eagle Oil and Shipping Company.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1930/&gt; In about 1935 the company started adding a new generation of motor tankers including ''San Adolfo'' (7,365 tons) launched by the [[Furness Shipbuilding Company]] on the [[River Tees]], {{MV|San Alberto||2}} (7,397 tons) launched by [[Lithgows]] on the [[River Clyde]], {{MV|San Alvaro||2}} (7,385 tons) launched by Swan Hunter, ''San Amado'' (7,316 tons) launched by the Blythswood Shipbuilding Company on the Clyde, ''San Ambrosio'' (7,410 tons) launched by [[Hawthorn Leslie and Company#Shipbuilding|Hawthorn Leslie and Company]] on the Tyne and {{MV|San Arcadio||2}} (7,419 tons) launched by [[Harland and Wolff]] in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1935&gt;{{cite book |title=Lloyd's Register of Shipping |year=1935 |publisher=[[Lloyd's of London]] |location=London |page= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; New additions continued until 1939, when Lithgows launched MV ''San Eliseo'' (8,042 tons), Harland and Wolff launched {{MV|San Emiliano||2}} (8,071 tons) and Furness Shipbuilding launched {{MV|San Ernesto||2}} (8,078 tons).&lt;ref name=Lloyds1940&gt;{{cite book |title=Lloyd's Register of Shipping |year=1940 |publisher=[[Lloyd's of London]] |location=London |page= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eagle Oil and Shipping was registered in the United Kingdom. Therefore, after 1938 although the Mexican government had nationalised Mexican Eagle Petroleum, Eagle Oil and Shipping remained a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. After 1938 the fleet continued to carry oil from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the UK.{{sfn|Talbot-Booth|1942|p=461}} During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the company played an important role in supplying petroleum and petroleum products to the United Kingdom. Oil tankers were a particular target in Germany's economic warfare against the Allies. Enemy action sank 17 Eagle Oil ships, killing at least 206 officers, men and [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships#World War II|DEMS]] gunners.

{{MV|San Calisto||2}} (8,018 tons) was launched by Lithgows on the Clyde in 1937.&lt;ref name=WreckSiteCalisto&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?73908 |title=MV San Calisto [+1939] |last1=Lettens |first1=Jan |last2=Vleggeert |first2=Nico |date=2010-01-06 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 1939 she struck a mine off the [[Tongue Lightship]] in the [[Thames Estuary]] and sank with the loss of six men.&lt;ref name=WreckSiteCalisto/&gt; On 4 May 1940 ''San Tiburcio'' struck a mine and sank in the [[North Sea]] off the [[Moray Firth]].&lt;ref name=WreckSiteTiburcio/&gt;

{{MV|San Casimiro||2}} (8,045 tons) and {{MV|San Conrado||2}} (7,982 tons) were sister ships launched by Blythswood at [[Scotstoun]] in 1936. ''San Casimiro'' was captured off [[Cape Race]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]  by the German battleship ''[[German battleship Gneisenau|Gneisenau]]'' on 15 March 1941 and scuttled off the [[Azores]] five days later.&lt;ref name=WreckSiteCasimiro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?31291 |title=MV San Casimiro [+1941] |last1=Allen |first1=Tony |last2=Vleggeert |first2=Nico |date=2010-01-06 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''San Conrado'' was bombed and sunk by enemy aircraft off [[Smalls Lighthouse|The Smalls]] on the coast of west [[Wales]] on 1 April 1941.&lt;ref name=WreckSiteConrado&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?59067 |title=MV San Conrado [+1941] |last1=Allen |first1=Tony |last2=Vleggeert |first2=Nico |date=2010-01-06 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MT SAN DEMETRIO.jpg|thumb|300px|{{MV|San Demetrio||2}} reached the Clyde in 1940 carrying a cargo of aviation spirit, despite having been damaged and set on fire by shelling from the ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'']]
{{MV|San Demetrio||2}} (8,073 tons), which Blythswood had launched at [[Port Glasgow]] in 1938, became famous for surviving a naval bombardment by the German [[heavy cruiser]] ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' in 1940. ''San Demetrio''{{'}}s crew succeeded in extinguishing the resultant fire and bringing the ship and her cargo of aviation spirit to [[Glasgow]], Scotland. ''San Demetrio'' was repaired and returned to service, but the {{GS|U-404}} torpedoed and sank her in the western Atlantic off [[Virginia]] on 17 March 1942 with the loss of 19 lives.

In 1942 the [[Ministry of War Transport]] placed the [[Empire ship#Tankers|Empire ships]] {{SS|Empire Airman|1941|2}}, {{SS|Empire Cobbett||2}} and {{SS|Empire Norseman||2}}&lt;ref name=WreckSiteNorseman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?30614 |title=SS Empire Norseman [+1943] |last1=Claes |first1=Johnny |last2=Vleggeert |first2=Nico |date=2010-01-23 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; under Eagle Oil and Shipping's management. In 1943 two U-boats torpedoed and sank ''Empire Norseman'' (9,811 tons) in the Atlantic south of the Azores. After the Second World War the company bought ''Empire Airman'' and ''Empire Cobbett'' from the ministry, renamed them ''San Wenceslao'' and ''San Wilfrido'' respectively and kept them in service until 1959.

During the war Eagle Oil and Shipping bought several new tankers to replace war losses. Harland and Wolff launched ''San Veronico'' (8,198 tons) and ''San Vulframo'' (8,167 tons) in 1942 and ''San Vito'' (8,163 tons) in 1943.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1945&gt;{{cite book |title=Lloyd's Register of Shipping |year=1945 |publisher=[[Lloyd's of London]] |location=London |page= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorn Leslie launched ''San Venancio'' (8,152 tons) in 1942 and ''San Velino'' (8,210 tons) in 1944.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1945/&gt; After the War, Eagle Oil bought two US-built [[T2 tanker]]s: ''Bryce Canyon'' in 1948 and ''Laurel Hill'' in 1949. The company renamed them ''San Leonardo'' and ''San Leopoldo'' respectively and kept them in service until 1961.

Between 1950 and 1960 Eagle Oil acquired at least 16 new tankers. Two of the earliest were a second ''San Salvador'' (10,802 tons) and a second ''San Silvestre'' (10,953 tons), both launched by Furness Shipbuilding in 1950. Later ships included {{SS|San Flaviano||2}} (12,278 tons)&lt;ref name=WreckSiteFlaviano&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?108400 |title=SS San Flaviano [+1958] |last=Lettens |first=Jan |date=2011-01-06 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SS ''San Fortunato'' (12,257 tons), both launched in 1956 by [[Cammell Laird]] on the [[River Mersey]].

In April 1958 a [[Douglas A-26 Invader|Douglas B-26 Invader]] bomber aircraft, painted black and with no markings,{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=88}} bombed and sank ''San Flaviano'' in [[Balikpapan]] Harbour, [[Borneo]], killing two of her crew.&lt;ref name=WreckSiteFlaviano/&gt;{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=116}}&lt;ref name=Hansard&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1958/jun/11/indonesia-british-vessels#S5CV0589P0_19580611_HOC_160 |title=Indonesia (British Vessels) |house=Commons |date=1958-06-11 |column_start=202 |column_end=203 |speaker= [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|David Ormsby-Gore]] |position=Minister of State for Foreign Affairs |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=INDONESIA: The Mystery Pilots |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://search.time.com/results.html?N=55&amp;Nty=1&amp;Ns=p_date_range%7C1&amp;Ntt=San+Flaviano&amp;from_month=03&amp;from_day=01&amp;from_year=1958&amp;to_month=06&amp;to_day=01&amp;to_year=1958&amp;x=45&amp;y=14 |date=1958-05-12 |accessdate=2011-11-21 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft, its bombs and its pilot, [[William H.

The CIA pilots had orders to target commercial shipping in order to frighten foreign merchant ships away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy and destabilising the Indonesian government of President [[Sukarno]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=116}} In this they were at least partly successful: Royal Dutch Shell suspended its tanker service to Balikpapan and evacuated shore-based wives and families to [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=Hansard/&gt;

Several new ships delivered to Eagle Oil in the later 1950s were in the order of 18,000 to 19,500 tons. One of the last new ships to be delivered for the fleet was also one of the largest; the second {{MV|San Conrado|1960|2}} (34,750 tons), launched by Furness Shipbuilding in 1960. By then Royal Dutch Shell had absorbed Eagle Oil and Shipping, which ceased to be a separate member of the group in 1959.

==Career==
Ehsan Bayat is the Founder and Chairman of The Bayat Group,&lt;ref name="The Bayat Group"&gt;{{cite web | title=Official Website of The Bayat Group | publisher=bayat-group.com | date=2017-07-30 |url=http://bayat-group.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan's largest diversified services company.

*[[Afghan Wireless Communication Company]] (AWCC), which serves approximately 5,000,000 subscribers throughout Afghanistan. AWCC was Afghanistan's first wireless company and established Afghanistan's wireless telecommunications sector.

*[[Ariana Television Network]] is Afghanistan's largest private media organization, broadcasting to all 34 provinces and reaching an audience of approximately 25,000,000 Afghans.

*Bayat Energy&lt;ref name="The Bayat Energy"&gt;{{cite web | title=Official Website of The Bayat Energy | publisher=bayat-energy.com | date=2017-07-30 |url=http://bayat-energy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an oil and gas exploration, development and production company. In October 2016&lt;ref name="Bayat Power"&gt;{{cite news | title=Bayat Power Announces Three-Phase US$250M Investment Program To Accelerate Afghanistan's Gas-Fired Power Industry | work=Prnewswire.com | date=2016-10-03 |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bayat-power-announces-three-phase-us250m-investment-program-to-accelerate-afghanistans-gas-fired-power-industry-300337924.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Bayat Power, a division of Bayat Energy, signed an agreement with the Government of Afghanistan to build Bayat-1, a Gas Fired Power plant, located in Sheberghan, Jawzjan Province.  When all three phases of Bayat-1 are completed, the power plant will be capable of generating 200 Megawatts of electricity, sufficient power for approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. In 2018, Bayat Power also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) to sell 40MW of energy generated from the new plant to the Government of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bayat Power to build power plant in Afghanistan|url=https://www.power-technology.com/news/bayat-power-build-power-plant-afghanistan/|publisher=Power Technology|date=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these three enterprises, The Bayat Group also owns companies operating within the Construction, Security, Logistics and Consumer Goods sectors.
  
===As founder===
After graduating college, Ehsan Bayat maintained strong ties with family and friends living in [[Afghanistan]], and among the Afghan Diaspora living in [[Pakistan]], the United States and throughout the world. Committed to rebuilding [[Afghanistan]], Ehsan Bayat returned to [[Afghanistan]] in early 2002, shortly after the fall of Afghanistan's [[Taliban]] Government in November, 2001.
 
When Ehsan Bayat returned to Afghanistan in early 2002, decades of armed conflict had devastated the Afghan people and destroyed Afghanistan's economy. Ehsan Bayat, using his exceptional and unique experience as an Afghan American entrepreneur who had established highly successful companies in the United States, began immediately to plan the creation of a new generation of Afghan companies which would operate, based on the following principles:

* Each company would make a positive and long-term impact on the lives of ordinary [[Afghan]].

* Each company would be run by [[Afghan]], employ Afghans, contribute to building democracy in [[Afghanistan]] and help establish positive relations between Afghanistan and the wider world.

In 2002, Ehsan Bayat founded [[Afghan Wireless Communication Company]] (AWCC). The company operates in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, providing over 5,000,000 Afghan businesses and consumers with the world-class, high speed communications infrastructure, enabling Afghans to connect with the world. 

Building on the success of Afghan Wireless, in 2005, Ehsan Bayat founded [[Ariana Television Network]]. ATN is Afghanistan's largest privately-owned media network, reaching an estimated audience of approximately 25,000,000 Afghans. 

[[Afghan Wireless Communication Company]] and [[Ariana Television Network]] are the two largest divisions of The Bayat Group, which also owns and operates the following companies:

* Ariana Network Services&lt;ref name="Ariana Network Services"&gt;{{cite web | title=Official Website of Ariana Network Services | publisher=ans.af | date=2017-07-30 |url=http://ans.af}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bayat Energy
* Best Jobs
* Fine Media Consulting Group
* Fine Mineral Water
 
For over a decade, The Bayat Group has championed building the capabilities its workforce—and supported [[Afghan]] economic development—by dedicating significant resources to developing the educational, entrepreneurial and administrative capabilities of its executive, managerial and front line staffs. The Bayat Group provides scholarship assistance to employees attending Afghan Universities. In addition, The Company's internal professional development program offers over fifty-two professional development courses.

==Bayat Foundation==
In 2005, Ehsan Bayat and his wife, Fatema Bayat, established The Bayat Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Group of Thirty''', often abbreviated to '''G30''', is an international body of leading financiers and academics which aims to deepen understanding of economic and financial issues and to examine consequences of decisions made in the public and private sectors related to these issues.  Topical areas within the interest of the group include: the [[foreign exchange market]], international [[capital markets]], international [[financial institutions]], [[central bank]]s and their supervision of financial services and markets, and [[macroeconomic]] issues such as product and labor markets.

The group is noted for its advocacy of changes in global [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] and [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]].

==History==

The Group of Thirty was founded in 1978 by [[Geoffrey Bell]] at the initiative of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afponline.org/pub/res/news/ns_20050325_g30.html |title=G30 Members Discuss Critical Concerns For American Corporations|author=Karen Epper Hoffman|date=March 25, 2005|work=AFP Online |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205401/http://www.afponline.org/pub/res/news/ns_20050325_g30.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also provided initial funding for the body.  Its first chairman was [[Johannes Witteveen]], the former managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The G30's current Chairman is [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/G30%20November%2022%2011%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.pdf | title=G30 November 22 11 Press Release FINAL | publisher=Group of Thirty | format=PDF | accessdate=October 13, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113171606/http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/G30%20November%2022%2011%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.pdf | archivedate=January 13, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current Chairman of the Board of Trustees is [[Jacob Frenkel]], and [[Paul Volcker]] is Chairman Emeritus.

The Bellagio Group, formed by Austrian economist [[Fritz Machlup]], was the immediate predecessor to the Group of Thirty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n1/cj3n1-2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fritz Machlup: In Memoriam|author=[[Gottfried Haberler]]|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|work=[[Cato Journal]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316155055/https://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n1/cj3n1-2.pdf|archivedate=2008-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It first met in 1963, to investigate international currency problems, particularly the [[Bretton Woods Agreement#The U.S. balance of payments crisis (1958–68)|balance of payments crisis]] which America faced throughout the early 1960s.

In June 2011, the group  released a report that examines the most recent developments in the 2008 financial crisis, including the causes, the responses and the future outlook for the United States and other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://group30.org/publications/detail/151 | title=The 2008 Financial Crisis and Its Aftermath: Addressing the Next Debt Challenge | author=Russo, Thomas A. | author2=Katzel, Aaron J. | publisher=Group of Thirty | format=PDF | accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the European Ombudsman [[Emily O'Reilly]] requested that ECB President [[Mario Draghi]] resign from the group because his membership in the organization could be interpreted as undue influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = January 17, 2018|title = UPDATE 1 - EU ombudsman urges ECB's Draghi to leave G30 club of financiers|first = Francesco|last = Canepa|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-banks-ethics/update-1-eu-ombudsman-urges-ecbs-draghi-to-leave-g30-club-of-financiers-idUSL8N1PC2HX|agency = Reuters|access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The group consists of thirty members and includes the heads of major private banks and central banks, as well as members from academia and international institutions. Current members of the group include current and former heads of the central banks of Argentina, Brazil, [[Great Britain]], [[Canada]], China, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Poland]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]], and [[Switzerland]], as well as two chairmen of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], two presidents of the [[European Central Bank]], a chairman of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]], two chairmen of the [[Bank for International Settlements]], two chief economists of the [[International Monetary Fund]], a chief economist of the [[World Bank]], and the former President of Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4942">'''Hardware certification''' is the process through which computer hardware is tested to ensure it is compatible with specific software packages, and operates as intended in critical situations. With ever dropping prices of [[computer hardware|hardware]] devices, the market for networking devices and systems is undergoing a kind of change that can be loosely termed as ‘generalization’. Big established enterprises like [[Cisco]], [[Novell]], [[Sun Microsystems]] etc., no longer manufacture all the hardware required in the market, instead they ‘license’ or ‘certify’ small hardware players operating out from countries like [[Taiwan]] or [[China]].

==Certification process==

=== Vendor certification ===

To obtain certification, the hardware or software has to conform to a set of [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]] and [[quality standards]] that are put in place by the original creator of [[technology]]. Usually the certification process is done by a “Certification partner”.  Certification partners are selected by the original creators of the technology and these partners are given the authority to do the testing and certification process. After a product is found to be compatible, it is labelled as xxx certified where xxx is the name of the original creator of the technology. Vendors use a “label” on the products  to advertise the fact of compatibility with the said technology.

The process of certification ensures that the products made by different manufacturers are standardized and are [[Computer compatibility|compatible]] with each other as indicated in [[computer hardware|hardware]] or [[software]] platform.

=== Third-party certification ===

Third-party certification is undertaken by an independent body. To obtain third-party certification, the hardware or software has to confirm to a set of [[quality standards]] determined by the third-party.

==Various certifications==
* '''Cisco certification''': Cisco manufactures networking hardware devices and systems. Hardware and software companies use the certification issued by Cisco’s partners to ensure that their ware is compatible with the Cisco standards and protocols.
* '''Sun Certification''':This is for Independent Software vendors (ISV) involved in developing applications that are compatible with Java technology. Java was created by Sun Microsystems and is widely used to write enterprise and consumer application solutions.
* '''Novell Certification''': Novell began certifying partner hardware with NetWare in the 1980s.  The name of the certification is "YES Certified".   The Yes Certified program involves certification of Partner hardware with SUSE Linux Enterprise software.  Since 2005 the program has shifted from Novell NetWare to SuSE Linux and has become the SUSE YES Certified Program.  The certified Hardware is given a Yes Certification Bulletin which can be viewed online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.suse.com/yessearch/Search.jsp SUSE Yes Certification Bulletin Search Page]&lt;/ref&gt;  More information about the Yes Certification program can be found at SUSE's website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.suse.com/partners/ihv/yes/ SUSE Yes Certification program website]&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''Microsoft's certification''' for Vista: This certification is called "WHQL" Windows Hardware Quality Labs". The dominant position of Windows in the computing world ensured that there are enormous number of applications written and hardware manufactured. This WHQL signifies that the hardware or software works with the Vista operating system. 
* '''Real Certification''': This certification is given by RealNetworks for ensuring compatibility with its media player “RealPlayer”. Mobile computing devices like cell phones and PDAs are equipped with RealPlayer to enable them to play streaming content.
* '''Linux certification''' programs: Hardware vendors use this certification for their products to ensure compatibility with [[Linux]] based systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux-laptop.net/ Linux on Laptops]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''SpectraLink certification''': SpectraLink VIEW Certification Program is designed to ensure interoperability for enterprise Wi-Fi based infrastructure products that support NetLink Wireless Telephones.
* '''Altiris Developer Program Certification''': Altiris is a leading vendor of IT service-oriented management solutions.
* '''EMC Centera Proven''': This certification is a good way to demonstrate that your solution takes full advantage of EMC Centera Platform which can be crucial to sales.
* '''Skype Certification''': Skype-certified products satisfy both the Technical Requirements and the Design Guidelines of Skype.
* '''Linux-Tested Certification''': Hardware Vendors can use the Linux-Tested program from AppLabs to certify their products are compatible with the Linux OS and have been tested for complete functionality.

==Biography==
He entered the business world after 1990, setting up, alongside a Turkish partner, a chemical trade company – Interaction.

Accessed on March 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been subject to many controversies, stemming from his business practices in the oil and gas industry. He has denied all charges.

In 2012, The Romanian National Tax Administration accused Niculae of defrauding the national budget due to accusations that his tobacco company, Galaxy Tobacco, had failed to pay its taxes, amounting to an excess of €120 million.

'''James Henry Bradney''' (2 April 1853 – 26 May 1936) was a [[New Zealand Reform Party]] Member of Parliament, and shipping proprietor.

==Early life==
James Henry Bradney was born on 2 April 1853 at [[Wolverhampton]], [[Staffordshire]], the son of Joseph Bradney, coachsmith &amp; ironmonger, and Emily née Morris.  Joseph and Emily, with James Henry and three other children, emigrated on the ''Mermaid'' from [[Liverpool]] on 11 July 1859, arriving at [[Auckland]], New Zealand on 19 October.&lt;ref&gt;Passenger list of the ''Mermaid'', Liverpool to Auckland, July 1859 to October 1859 [http://www.yesteryears.co.nz/shipping/passlists/mermaid.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradney's early schooling was at [[Takapuna]]. At age 11 he went to work on a farm, and remained there three years. He later worked in a bakery, and as a butcher and grocer.

==Maritime activities==
Bradney ran away to sea and joined the small steamer ''Go Ahead'' as a deck hand. He later sailed round the coast for some time in the three-masted schooner ''Policeman'', then went bushfelling at [[Coromandel, New Zealand|Coromandel]], and gold mining at [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]]. 
[[File:James Henry Bradney cartoon Observer 20 Feb 1909.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Observer newspaper cartoon of Captain Bradney while on the Auckland Harbour Board in 1909.]] 
Still later he rowed ferry boats plying between Auckland and [[Northcote, New Zealand|Northcote]], on Auckland's [[North Shore City|North Shore]]. He served on the ''Lily'', the first steamer to enter the [[Kaipara Harbour|Kaipara]] service, and then went abroad on deep-sea vessels.&lt;ref name="Auckland Star"&gt;''Auckland Star'' 26 May 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

While in [[Geelong]], near [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], Bradney met his future wife, Mary Jane Haxton, whom he married in Auckland in 1878 when he was a pilot on the [[Kaipara Harbour|Kaipara bar]]. He then worked for the [[Auckland Harbour Board]], and finally became a [[Waterman (occupation)|waterman]], one of the hardy band of men whose boats formed the means of communication between shore and ship.

In 1884 Captain Bradney joined forces with his brother-in-law Ernest Charles Binns (who had emigrated to New Zealand on the same ship, the ''Mermaid'') forming the firm of Bradney &amp; Binns with the launch ''Despatch''. The ''Vivid'' was purchased in 1892, and on 26 March 1904 Captain Bradney's daughter Blanche launched the ''Pitoitoi I''. The replacement ''Pitoitoi II'' was brought into service in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Zealand Herald'' 27 May 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm was succeeded by J H Bradney &amp; Sons in 1934, and at the time of Captain Bradney's death in 1936 was operating the ''Onewa'', ''Kaipatiki'', ''Matareka'', and ''Presto'', the latter being used by the port health officer.

Bradney was elected to the [[Auckland West]] electorate in the [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911 general election]], but was defeated in [[New Zealand general election, 1914|1914]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wilson |first= James Oakley |title= New Zealand parliamentary record, 1840-1984 |edition= 4 |origyear= First ed. published 1913 |year= 1985 |publisher= V.R.

He was a member of the [[Auckland Harbour Board]] from 1907 to 1915, and 1922 to 1923.

==Later life==
Captain Bradney was at one time on the [[Mount Albert, New Zealand|Mt Albert Borough Council]]. He was a life member of the [[Auckland Choral Society]], with which he was associated for 50 years, and a member of the Amateur Opera Club &amp; Auckland Liedertafel.

He died at Epsom, Auckland on 26 May 1936, survived by his wife and six children, Henry Cooper, Horace Launcelot, Blanche Ada, Elizabeth Beatrice, Frederick Charles, and Douglas Eric, two other children having died as infants. He is buried at [[Hillsborough, Auckland|Hillsborough]] Cemetery, Auckland.&lt;ref name="Auckland Star" /&gt;

The Viscount '''Jean-Jacques Desandrouin''' (May 25, 1681 &amp;ndash; 16 November 1761) came from the district of Lodelinsart belonging to the Belgian city of Charleroi. His name is connected with the beginnings of the industrial revolution in Belgium and the massive expansion of coal mining in the area of Anzin in northern France. For the spelling of his name, there are the variants 'Désandrouin'' or 'Desandrouins'' or sometimes ''De Sandrouin'' and ''Androuins''.

His activities changed the face of this region. His economic success was based on his involvement in the manufacture of glass, in metal production in forging and in promotion and transport of coal. He co-founded and owned the most important mining company in his time the [[Compagnie des mines d'Anzin]], which was founded on November 19, 1757.

==Early career==
Being a graduated from [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]] in [[Trondheim]], Maldum has served in different technical and leadership positions before being appointed as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Infinitum in 2007. He has been a Department Manager at [[National Institute of Technology (Norway)]] Teknologisk Institutt 1990-2000, and CEO of Groceries' Environmental Forum or DMF (DAGLIGVAREHANDELENS MILJØFORUM in Norwegian) 2001–2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Going for recycling (English-translated title)|url=http://hmsmagasinet.no/g%C3%A5r-gjenvinning|website=HMSmagasinet.no|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sørheim|first1=Tone Iren|title=Falling oil price may make deposit bottles less profitable (English-translated title))|url=http://e24.no/naeringsliv/fallende-oljepris-kan-gjoere-panteflaskene-mindre-loennsomme/23429941|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eikernytt.no|url=http://www.eikernytt.no/nyhet.cfm?nyhetid=4839|website=www.eikernytt.no|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forum for fossil plastics strikes a blow for recyclable plastic as a good alternative (English-translated title)|url=http://packnews.no/default.asp?id=8646&amp;show=more|website=packnews.no|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Dagligvarehandelens miljøforum|url=http://www.etos.no/english/|website=www.etos.no|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocating for environment==
Through his career and especially in deposit-return system for bottles, he became a known figure for advocating for environment in Norway, lecturing at academic gatherings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Logistics Seminar in Bergen, February 2007|url=http://www.logistikkforeningen.no/file.php?id=271|website=Logistikkforeningen.no|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national TV programs to promote the idea of &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV - Søk - Kjell Olav Maldum|url=https://tv.nrk.no/sok?q=Kjell%20Olav%20Maldum&amp;filter=rettigheter|website=NRK TV|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he has promoted sustainable production with low impact on environment and recycling of one-way containers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vil heve panten på boks og flasker|url=https://www.nrk.no/rogaland/vil-heve-panten-pa-boks-og-flasker-1.7307823|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV 16.09.2011 (program nr 1435)|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/16.09.2011-_program-nr-1435_-1.7794618|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mangler 40 millioner bokser|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/mangler-40-millioner-bokser-1.5507016|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and avoid wasting food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right in the garbage with fruit and vegetables (English-translated title)|url=http://www.vg.no/forbruker/mat-og-drikke/mat/rett-i-soepla-med-frukt-og-groent/a/105074/|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Maldum has been behind the deposit-return TV commercials and "Infinitum movement"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infinitum Movement|url=http://infinitummovement.no/|website=Infinitum Movement|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Norway where a number of celebrities, artists and athletes advertise and encourage for recycling of the materials in the society. The movememnt encourages people to infinitely recycle instead the containers instead of just rhewoing them away.

==Special initiatives==
*Coca-Cola switching to deposit bottles
Until 2014 [[Coca-Cola]] has been using non-deposit bottle for its beverages in Norway. Kjell Olav Maldum played a central role in negotiations for Coca-Cola Norway switching from non-deposit refillable bottles to non-refillable deposit bottles. The move was considered as an environmentally friendly one to introduce deposit on bottles and decrease littering, but it also led to downsizing of Coca-Cola in Norway due to less labor needed for one-way bottles and made headline in Norwegian market about the job losses and also counter-arguments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cola-kutt kan gi nye arbeidsplasser|url=https://www.nrk.no/ostlandssendingen/cola-kutt-kan-gi-nye-arbeidsplasser-1.7991853|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola Norway also promised to invest in recycling facilities inside Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Packaging: Recycling|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/packaging-recycling|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Recycling cans in Norway
Maldum was also behind the efforts that finally led to the recycling of aluminum cans performed in Norway. The aluminum cans that have been collected in Norway were used to be sent to France for recycling but it has been recycled by Norsk Hydro in Holmestrand since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solholm|first1=Rolleiv|title=More environmentally friendly recycling|url=http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/culture/museums/29252|website=www.norwaypost.no|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was considered as environmentally friendly step vowing for recycling 60,000 mt of aluminium annually in Holmestrand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now recycled in Norway: drink cans get a shorter trip to their new life  - Norsk Hydro|url=http://www.hydro.com/en/Press-room/News/Archive/2013/Now-recycled-in-Norway-drink-cans-get-a-shorter-trip-to-their-new-life-/|website=www.hydro.com|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Laissez-faire''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɛ|s|eɪ|ˈ|f|ɛər}}; {{IPA-fr|lɛsefɛʁ|lang|Fr-Laissez-faire.oga}}; from {{Lang-fr|laissez faire|lit=let do}}) is an [[economic system]] in which transactions between private parties are free from [[government]] intervention such as [[regulation]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]], [[tariff]]s and [[Subsidy|subsidies]]. The phrase ''laissez-faire'' is part of a larger [[French language|French]] phrase and translates to "let (it/them) do", but in this context usually means "let go".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/laissez-faire.html Laissez-faire], Business Dict&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and usage ==
The term ''laissez faire'' likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful French [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Controller-General of Finances]] [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and a group of French [[businessmen]] headed by M. Le Gendre. When the eager [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] minister asked how the French state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce, Le Gendre replied simply "''laissez-nous faire''" ("leave it to us" or "let us do [it]", the French verb not having to take an object).&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AJournal_oeconomique_-_janvier_1751.djvu Journal Oeconomique] 1751, Article by the French minister of finance.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anecdote on the Colbert–Le Gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the ''Journal économique'', written by French minister and champion of [[free trade]] [[René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|René de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson]]—also the first known appearance of the term in print.&lt;ref&gt;M. d'Argenson, "Lettre au sujet de la dissertation sur le commerce du marquis de Belloni', Avril 1751, ''Journal Oeconomique'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=k4ABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA111#v=onepage p. 111]. See A. Oncken, ''Die Maxime Laissez faire et laissez passer, ihr Ursprung, ihr Werden'', 1866&lt;/ref&gt; Argenson himself had used the phrase earlier (1736) in his own diaries in a famous outburst: {{quote|''Laissez faire, telle devrait être la devise de toute puissance publique, depuis que le monde est civilisé&amp;nbsp;... Détestable principe que celui de ne vouloir grandir que par l'abaissement de nos voisins&amp;nbsp;! Il n'y a que la méchanceté et la malignité du cœur de satisfaites dans ce principe, et l’intérêt y est opposé. Laissez faire, morbleu&amp;nbsp;! Laissez faire !!''&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in J. M. Keynes, 1926, "The End of Laissez Faire". Argenson's ''Mémoirs'' were published only in 1858, ed. Jannet, Tome V, p. 362. See A. Oncken (''Die Maxime Laissez faire et laissez passer, ihr Ursprung, ihr Werden'', 1866)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Let go, which should be the motto of all public power, since the world was civilized ... (It is) a detestable principle of those that want to enlarge (themselves) but by the abasement of our neighbours. There is but the wicked and the malignant heart(s) (who are) satisfied by this principle and (its) interest is opposed. Let go, alas".&lt;ref&gt;Original somewhat literal translation using https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/laissez-faire#fr&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|source=}}

[[Vincent de Gournay]], a French [[Physiocracy|Physiocrat]] and intendant of commerce in the 1750s, popularized the term ''laissez faire'' as he allegedly adopted it from [[François Quesnay]]'s writings on China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Baghdiantz McCabe|first= Ina|title= Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|year= 2008|publisher= Berg Publishers|isbn= 978-1-84520-374-0|pages= 271–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quesnay coined the phrases ''laissez-faire'' and ''laissez-passer,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Encyclopædia Britannica|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/487095/Francois-Quesnay|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''laissez-faire'' being a translation of the Chinese term 無為 [[wu wei]].&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|last= Clarke|first= J.J.|title= Oriental Enlightenment: The Encounter Between Asian and Western Thought|year= 1997|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0415133760|page= 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in France. Delighted with the Colbert-Le Gendre anecdote,&lt;ref&gt;According to J. [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]]'s "Eloge de Vincent de Gournay," '' Mercure'', August, 1759 (repr. in ''Oeuvres of Turgot'', vol. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5KQALAckPr8C&amp;pg=PA288#v=onepage p. 288].&lt;/ref&gt; he forged it into a larger maxim all his own: "''Laissez faire et laissez passer''" ("Let do and let pass"). His motto has also been identified as the longer "''Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!''" ("Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!"). Although Gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas, he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries, notably his fellow Physiocrats, who credit both the ''laissez-faire'' slogan and the doctrine to Gournay.&lt;ref&gt;Gournay was credited with the phrase by [[Jacques Turgot]] ("Eloge a Gournay", ''Mercure'' 1759), the [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Marquis de Mirabeau]] (''Philosophie rurale'' 1763 and ''Ephémérides du Citoyen'', 1767.), the [[Comte d'Albon]] (,"Éloge Historique de M. Quesnay", ''Nouvelles Ephémérides Économiques'', May, 1775, pp. 136–37. ) and [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|DuPont de Nemours]] (Introduction to ''Oeuvres de Jacques Turgot'', 1808–11, Vol. I, pp. 257, 259 (Daire ed.)) among others&lt;/ref&gt;

Before d'Argenson or Gournay, [[Pierre Le Pesant, sieur de Boisguilbert|P. S. de Boisguilbert]] had enunciated the phrase "''on laisse faire la nature''" ("let nature run its course").&lt;ref&gt;"Tant, encore une fois, qu'on laisse faire la nature, on ne doit rien craindre de pareil", P.S. de Boisguilbert, 1707, ''Dissertation de la nature des richesses, de l'argent et des tributs''.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Argenson himself during his life was better known for the similar, but less-celebrated motto "''Pas trop gouverner''" ("Govern not too much").&lt;ref&gt;DuPont de Nemours, ''op cit'', p. 258. Oncken (''op.cit'') and Keynes (''op.cit''.) also credit the Marquis d'Argenson with the phrase "''Pour gouverner mieux, il faudrait gouverner moins''" ("To govern best, one needs to govern less"), possibly the source of the famous "That government is best which governs least" motto popular in American circles, attributed variously to [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Henry Thoreau]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gournay's use of the ''laissez-faire'' phrase (as popularized by the Physiocrats) gave it its cachet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Physiocrats proclaimed ''laissez-faire'' in eighteenth-century France, placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists, beginning with [[Adam Smith]], developed the idea.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"&gt;Fine, Sidney. ''Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State''. United States: The University of Michigan Press, 1964. Print&lt;/ref&gt; "It is with the physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term "''laissez faire''" is ordinarily associated".&lt;ref&gt;Macgregor, ''Economic Thought and Policy'' (London, 1949), pp. 54–67&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State'' states: &lt;blockquote&gt;The physiocrats, reacting against the excessive mercantilist regulations of the France of their day, expressed a belief in a "natural order" or liberty under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good. Since, in their view, this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government, they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty, to removing all artificial barriers to trade, and to abolishing all useless laws.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In England, a number of "free trade" and "non-interference" slogans{{which|date=December 2016}} had been coined{{By whom|date=December 2016}} as early as the 17th century,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} but the French phrase ''laissez-faire'' gained currency in English-speaking countries with the spread of Physiocratic literature in the late 18th century. [[George Whatley]]'s 1774 ''Principles of Trade'' (co-authored with [[Benjamin Franklin]]) re-told the Colbert-LeGendre anecdote—this may mark the first appearance of the phrase in an English-language publication.&lt;ref&gt;Whatley's ''Principles of Trade'' are reprinted in ''Works of Benjamin Franklin, Vol.2'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=C2QUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA401#v=onepage p. 401]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Spencer]] was opposed to a slightly different application of ''laissez faire''—to "that miserable ''laissez-faire''" that leads to men’s ruin: &lt;blockquote&gt;Along with that miserable laissez-faire which calmly looks on while men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims, there goes activity in supplying them, at other men's cost, with gratis novel-reading!&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Part IV of Ethics'' (1892). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Spencer's case, the right of private ownership was being assailed and it was that miserable spirit of ''laissez-faire'' in halls of legislation that exhausted men in the effort of protecting their right. So in effect, Spencer decried ''laissez-faire'' socialism.

''Laissez-faire'', a product of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], was "conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system, a system unhindered by the restrictions of government".&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"&gt;Gaspard, Toufick. ''A Political Economy of Lebanon 1948–2002: The Limits of Laissez-faire''. Boston: Brill, 2004. {{ISBN|978-9004132597}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Adam Smith{{When|date=December 2016}} viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system. Smith saw ''laissez-faire'' as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; By extension, [[free market]]s become a reflection of the natural system of liberty.&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; For Smith, ''laissez-faire'' was "a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market, a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth".&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt;

However, Smith&lt;ref name=asoae /&gt; and the notable [[Classical economics|classical economists]], such as [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[David Ricardo]], did not use the phrase. [[Jeremy Bentham]] used the term, but it was probably{{original research inline|date=December 2016}} [[James Mill]]'s reference to the ''laissez-faire'' maxim (together with "''pas trop gouverner''") in an 1824 entry for the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' that really brought the term into wider English usage. With the advent of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] (founded 1838), the term received much of its English meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Abbott P. Usher|title= Economic History – The Decline of Laissez Faire|year= 1931|journal= American Economic Review|volume= 22|issue= 1, Supplement|pages= 3–10|display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}}

Smith first used the metaphor of an "[[invisible hand]]" in his book ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Andres Marroquin, ''Invisible Hand: The Wealth of Adam Smith'', The Minerva Group, Inc., 2002, {{ISBN|1-4102-0288-7}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea lying behind the "invisible hand", though not the metaphor itself, belongs to [[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]] and his ''[[Fable of the Bees]]'' (1705). In [[political economy]], that idea and the doctrine of ''laissez-faire'' have long been{{By whom|date=December 2016}} closely related.&lt;ref&gt;John Eatwell, ''The Invisible Hand'', W.W. Norton&amp;Company, 1989, pp. Preface x1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have characterized the invisible-hand metaphor as one for ''laissez-faire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.google.com/books?id=zAIar8Ee80QC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=laissez%20faire%20invisible%20hand |title= The mathematical century: the 30 greatest problems of the last 100 years (2006) Piergiorgio Odifreddi, Arturo Sangalli, Freeman J Dyson, p. 122 |publisher= Google.com |accessdate= 2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Smith never actually used the term himself.&lt;ref name=asoae&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Third Millennium Capitalism'' (2000), Wyatt M. Rogers, Jr. notes a trend whereby recently "conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term '[[free-market capitalism]]' in lieu of ''laissez-faire''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Wyatt M.|chapter=1: Economic Forces in Modern Capitalism|title=Third Millennium Capitalism: Convergence of Economic, Energy, and Environmental Forces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7adF9D3OJ0EC|series=ABC-Clio ebook|location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|publication-date=2000|page=38|isbn=9781567203608|accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==
As a system of thought, ''laissez-faire'' rests on the following axioms:&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt;
# The individual is the basic unit in society.
# The individual has a natural right to freedom.
# The physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system.
# Corporations are creatures of the State and therefore the citizenry must watch them closely due to their propensity to disrupt the Smithian [[spontaneous order]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'', "The exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and all those laws which restrain, in particular employments, the competition to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same tendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopolies, and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of employments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the natural price, and maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits of the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate." p. 52, http://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_WealthNations_p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These axioms constitute the basic elements of ''laissez-faire'' thought. Another basic principle holds that markets should be [[Competition (economics)|competitive]], a rule that the early advocates of ''laissez-faire'' always emphasized.&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; With the aims of maximizing freedom and of allowing markets to self-regulate, early advocates of ''laissez-faire'' proposed a ''impôt unique'', a [[land value tax|tax on land rent]] to replace all taxes that they saw as damaging welfare by penalizing [[production (economics)|production]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History of ''laissez-faire'' debate==

===Europe===
In Europe, the ''laissez-faire'' movement was first widely promoted by the [[Physiocracy|Physiocrats]], a movement that originated with [[Vincent de Gournay]], a successful merchant. Gournay adopted the concept, which is the translation of Chinese philosophy [[wu wei]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Gerlach]], [http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/daten/2005/gerlach_christian_wu-wei.pdf Wu-Wei in Europe.

His ideas were taken up by [[François Quesnay]] and [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], Baron de l'Aulne. Quesnay had the ear of the King of France, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and in 1754 persuaded him to give ''laissez-faire'' a try. On September 17, the King abolished all tolls and restraints on the sale and transport of grain and for more than a decade the experiment was a success, but then in 1768 there was a poor harvest, and the cost of bread rose so high that there was widespread starvation while merchants exported grain in order to obtain the best profit. In 1770, the edict allowing [[free trade]] was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Will &amp; Ariel Durant, ''Rousseau and the Revolution'', pp. 71–77, Simon and Schuster, 1967, {{ISBN|067163058X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of ''laissez-faire'' became an integral part of [[Classical liberalism|nineteenth-century European liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt; Just as liberals supported [[freedom of thought]] in the intellectual sphere, so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of [[free trade]] and [[free competition]] in the sphere of economics. The state was to be merely a [[Night-watchman state|passive policeman]], protecting [[private property]] and administering justice, but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens. Businessmen and particularly British industrialists were quick to associate these principles with their own economic interests.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt; Many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout Europe and were adopted to a greater or lesser extent in [[Sweden]], [[Tuscany]], [[Spain]] and after 1776 in the newly created [[United States]]. [[Adam Smith]], author of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', met Quesnay and acknowledged his influence.&lt;ref&gt;Will &amp; Ariel Durant, ''Rousseau and the Revolution'', p. 76, Simon and Schuster, 1967, {{ISBN|067163058X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the newspaper ''[[The Economist]]'' was founded in 1843 and became an influential voice for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scott Gordon|title=The London Economist and the High Tide of Laissez Faire|year=1955|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=63|issue=6|pages=461–88|doi=10.1086/257722}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Laissez-faire'' advocates opposed food aid for famines occurring within the [[British Empire]]. In 1847, referring to the famine then underway in [[Ireland]], founder of ''The Economist'' [[James Wilson (businessman)|James Wilson]] wrote: "It is no man's business to provide for another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Cormac Ó Gráda]]|title=The Great Irish Famine|year=1995|chapter=section: ''Ideology and relief'' in Chpt. 2|isbn=9780521557870|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Economist'' campaigned against the [[Corn Laws]] that protected landlords in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland in 1845 led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high were repealed.&lt;ref&gt;George Miller. ''On Fairness and Efficiency''. The Policy Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-86134-221-8}} p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to stop Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy.

A group calling itself the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester Liberals]], to which [[Richard Cobden]] and Richard Wright belonged, were staunch defenders of free trade and their work was carried on, after the death of Richard Cobden in 1866, by ''The Cobden Club''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Clubs in the Late Nineteenth Century |url=http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/economics/history/paper28/28taddeiweb1.pdf |format=PDF|author=Antonia Taddei|year=1999|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, a [[Cobden-Chevalier Treaty|trade treaty]] was signed between Britain and France, after which several of these treaties were signed among other European countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The breakdown of the ''laissez-faire'' practised by the British Empire was partly led by British companies eager for state support of their positions abroad, in particular British oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Jones |first= G.

===United States===
Frank Bourgin's study of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]].&lt;ref name=bourgin&gt;{{Cite book|first=Frank|last=Bourgin|title=The Great Challenge: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic|isbn=0-06-097296-3|year=1989|publisher=George Braziller Inc.|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this was the economic and financial chaos the nation suffered under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. The goal was to ensure that dearly-won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to promote science, invention, industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny. One later result of this intent was the adoption of Richard Farrington's new plan (worked out with his co-worker John Jefferson) to incorporate new changes during the [[New Deal]]. Others, including Jefferson, view Bourgin's study, written in the 1940s and not published until 1989, as an over-interpretation of the evidence, intended originally to defend the New Deal and later to counter [[Ronald Reagan]]'s economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourgin |first=Frank |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/frank-bourgin/the-great-challenge-the-myth-of-laissez-faire-i/ |title=THE GREAT CHALLENGE: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic by Frank Bourgin &amp;#124; Kirkus |publisher=Kirkusreviews.com |date=1989-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism]] in the United States in the 19th century had distinctive characteristics and that "at the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean "no government intervention" at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers".

Notable examples of government intervention in the period prior to the Civil War include the establishment of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent Office]] in 1802; the establishment of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in 1830; the creation of the [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation; the various [[United States Army|Army]] expeditions to the west, beginning with [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]]'s [[Corps of Discovery]] in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s, almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]] and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed; the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals; and the establishment of the [[First Bank of the United States]] and [[Second Bank of the United States]] as well as various protectionist measures (e.g. the [[Tariff of Abominations|tariff of 1828]]). Several of these proposals met with serious opposition and required a great deal of horse-trading to be enacted into law. For instance, the First National Bank would not have reached the desk of President [[George Washington]] in the absence of an agreement that was reached between [[Alexander Hamilton]] and several Southern members of Congress to locate the capitol in the [[District of Columbia]]. In contrast to Hamilton and the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] was [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]'s opposing political party, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]].

Most of the early opponents of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the United States subscribed to the [[American School (economics)|American School]]. This school of thought was inspired by the ideas of Hamilton, who proposed the creation of a [[First Bank of the United States|government-sponsored bank]] and increased tariffs to favor Northern industrial interests. Following Hamilton's death, the more abiding [[Protectionism|protectionist]] influence in the antebellum period came from [[Henry Clay]] and his ''[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]''.

In the early 19th century, "it is quite clear that the ''laissez-faire'' label is an inappropriate one" to apply to the relationship between the United States government and industry.&lt;ref name="Prince Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prince|first1=Carl E.|last2=Taylor|first2=Seth|year=1982|title=Daniel Webster, the Boston Associates, and the U.S. Government's Role in the Industrializing Process, 1815–1830|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|volume=2|issue=3|pages=283–99|jstor=3122975|doi=10.2307/3122975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century, the United States followed the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] tradition of [[economic nationalism]], which included increased state control, regulation and [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] development of [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=guelzo&gt;{{cite book|first=Allen C.|last=Guelzo|title=Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President|isbn=0-8028-3872-3|year=1999|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=99466893|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public works]] such as the provision and regulation [[transportation]] such as railroads took effect. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] provided the development of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]].&lt;ref name="guelzo"/&gt; In order to help pay for its war effort in the [[American Civil War]], the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] imposed its first personal [[income tax]] on August 5, 1861 as part of the [[Revenue Act of 1861]] (3% of all incomes over US $800; rescinded in 1872).

Following the Civil War, the movement towards a [[mixed economy]] accelerated. Protectionism increased with the [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 and the [[Dingley Tariff]] of 1897. [[Government regulation]] of the economy expanded with the enactment of the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887]] and the [[Sherman Anti-trust Act]].

The [[Progressive Era]] saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the [[Woodrow Wilson]] administration's [[The New Freedom|New Freedom]] program.

Following [[World War I]] and the [[Great Depression]], the United States turned to a mixed economy which combined [[free enterprise]] with a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect American industry from competition from overseas. For example, in the 1980s the government sought to protect the automobile industry by "voluntary" export restrictions from [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert W. Crandall|year=1987|title=The Effects of U.S. Trade Protection for Autos and Steel|journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|volume=1987|issue=1|pages=271–88|doi=10.2307/2534518|publisher=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 1987, No. 1|jstor=2534518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pietro S. Nivola wrote in 1986:{{quote|By and large, the comparative strength of the dollar against major foreign currencies has reflected high U.S. interest rates driven by huge federal budget deficits. Hence, the source of much of the current deterioration of trade is not the general state of the economy, but rather the government's mix of fiscal and monetary policies – that is, the problematic juxtaposition of bold tax reductions, relatively tight monetary targets, generous military outlays, and only modest cuts in major entitlement programs. Put simply, the roots of the trade problem and of the resurgent protectionism it has fomented are fundamentally political as well as economic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pietro S. Nivola|year=1986|title=The New Protectionism: U.S. Trade Policy in Historical Perspective|journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]]|volume=101|issue=4|pages=577–600|doi=10.2307/2150795|publisher=Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 101, No. 4|jstor=2150795}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A more recent advocate of total ''laissez-faire'' has been [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] [[Ayn Rand]], who described it as "the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade, the separation of State and Economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of Church and State".&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,'' Ch. 7, New American Library, Signet, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the "Iron Law of Regulation", which states that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|date=2013-10-01|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296313000386|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Strategic Thinking in Marketing|volume=66|issue=10|pages=1922–1927|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raw capitalism==
A closely related conception is that of raw/pure capitalism or unrestrained capitalism that refers to capitalism free of social [[regulation]]s,&lt;ref name="capfree"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolan|first1=Peter|title=Capitalism and Freedom: The Contradictory Character of Globalisation|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781843312826|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQdQDJzOkBMC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with low, minimal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orchard|first1=Lionel|last2=Stretton|first2=Hugh|title=Public Goods, Public Enterprise, Public Choice: Theoretical Foundations of the Contemporary Attack on Government|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349235056|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwW_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or no government and operating almost entirely on the [[profit motive]]. Other than ''laissez-faire'' economics and [[anarcho-capitalism]] it is not associated with a school of thought and typically has a bad connotation which hints towards a perceived need for restraint due to social needs and securities that can not be adequately responded to by companies with just a motive for making profit.

[[Robert Kuttner]] states that "for over a century, popular struggles in the [[democracies]] have used the [[nation-state]] to temper raw capitalism. The power of voters has offset the power of capital. But as national barriers have come down in the name of freer commerce, so has the capacity of governments to manage capitalism in a broad public interest. So the real issue is not 'trade' but democratic governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuttner|first1=Robert|title=Globalization and Its Critics|url=|publisher=The American Prospect|accessdate=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main issues of raw capitalism are said to lie in its disregard for quality, [[durability]], [[sustainability]], respect for the [[Environmental protection|environment]] and human beings as well as a lack of [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerckhove|first1=Gilbert Van|title=Toxic Capitalism: The Orgy of Consumerism and Waste: Are We the Last Generation on Earth?|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477219065|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POefWmtaZcgC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this more critical angle, companies might (naturally) aim to "maximise profits" at the expense of workers' and broader social interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Müntefering's criticism of raw capitalism strikes a chord|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6af06832-bdda-11d9-87aa-00000e2511c8.html|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=9 February 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raw/hyper-capitalism is a prime motive of [[cyberpunk]] in dystopian works such as ''[[Syndicate (2012 video game)|Syndicate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paris|first1=Jeffrey|title=Rethinking the End of Modernity|journal=Social Philosophy Today|date=1 July 2005|volume=21|pages=173–189|doi=10.5840/socphiltoday20052120|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=socphiltoday&amp;id=socphiltoday_2005_0021_0000_0173_0192|accessdate=26 July 2017|publisher=Philosophy Documentation Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgore|first1=Christopher D.|title=Bad Networks: From Virus to Cancer in Post-Cyberpunk Narrative|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|date=2017|volume=40|issue=2|pages=165–183|doi=10.2979/jmodelite.40.2.10|jstor=10.2979/jmodelite.40.2.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Critiques==
{{Further|Criticism of capitalism}}
Over the years, a number of economists have offered critiques of ''laissez-faire'' economics.

[[Adam Smith]] acknowledges deep moral ambiguities towards the system of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"&gt;Spencer J. Pack. Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy. Great Britain: Edward Elgar, 2010. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Smith had severe misgivings concerning some aspects of each of the major character-types produced by modern capitalist society: the landlords, the workers and the capitalists.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt; Smith claimed "[t]he landlords' role in the economic process is passive. Their ability to reap a revenue solely from ownership of land tends to make them indolent and inept, and so they tend to be unable to even look after their own economic interests"&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt; and that "[t]he increase in population should increase the demand for food, which should increase rents, which should be economically beneficial to the landlords". According to Smith, the landlords should thus be in favour of policies which contribute to the growth in the wealth of nations. Unfortunately, they often are not in favour of these pro-growth policies because of their own indolent-induced ignorance and intellectual flabbiness.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt;

The British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] condemned ''laissez-faire'' economic policy on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Dostaler, Gilles, ''Keynes and His Battles'' (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2007), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The End of Laissez-faire'' (1926), one of the most famous of his critiques, Keynes argues that the doctrines of ''laissez-faire'' are dependent to some extent on improper deductive reasoning and Keynes says the question of whether a market solution or state intervention is better must be determined on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;Dostaler 2007, p. 91; Barnett, Vincent, ''John Maynard Keynes'' (Routledge, 2013), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian School|Austrian economist]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] stated that a freely competitive, ''laissez-faire'' banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical. He stated that the need for [[central banking]] control was inescapable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Lawrence H.|title=Why Didn't Hayek Favor Laissez Faire in Banking?|journal=History of Political Economy|year=1999|volume=31|issue=4|url=http://cameroneconomics.com/white-hayek-hope.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2013|doi=10.1215/00182702-31-4-753|pages=753–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before starting Data Resource Consulting, she was president and co-founder of Visiosonic, later known as PCDJ.COM, an mp3 music company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhollywood.com/NYWednesdayFour.html Digital.Hollywood&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020151807/http://www.digitalhollywood.com/NYWednesdayFour.html |date=20 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked with celebrities such as Ice T,&lt;ref&gt;http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/060309/0112576.html&lt;/ref&gt; Nile Rodgers, Jam Master Jay and Chaka Kahn.&lt;ref name="savvy"/&gt;

==Bulk mail or spam==
At Data Resource Consulting, on a typical day, her firm would send out 8-10 million emails daily, charging clients $600–$1,000 per million emails and about half that amount for a sending a second time. She also charged clients for lead responses to emails.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0322/p12s02-ussc.html You call it spam, they call it a living |csmonitor.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other mailers, Betterly said she did not forge headers, route messages through outside servers without permission, or use any of the other tricks that have drawn criticism of the spamming community. She also refused to send messages advertising adult products or services, or anything she believed to be illegal. She said that she only possessed the addresses of people who had expressed a desire to know more when signing up to other online services, and that she would honor any requests from recipients to unsubscribe from further mail.

Estimates indicate she may have earned at least [[US dollar|US$]]200,000 per year. She said that she was "just trying to make a living like everyone else."&lt;ref name="PesteringMillions"/&gt; Betterly publicly attacked those who were critical of her practices, “I have a beef against what I consider hate groups that are trying to shut down commercial e-mail”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3078650/ In the trenches of the ‘spam wars’ - The Spam Wars - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to what she did as "a win-win situation".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; To those who objected to what she did for a living she said, "I don't really care. As long as I'm not breaking any laws, you don't have to love me or like what I do for a living."&lt;ref name="PesteringMillions"/&gt;

Data Resource Consulting lost a legal case in [[Kansas]] small claims court on 9 September 2003 for failing to follow the spam laws in that state.

==Change of business model==
In September 2005, Betterly and the chairman of her corporation, [[Bob Cefail]], "fired" their radio station in Clearwater, Florida where her program,"The Profit Doctors" aired, because the station management discontinued the toll-free call-in number for their listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the pair "rehired" the same radio station to air a new program called [[Scooopradio]].

Betterly took her company ([[In Touch Media Group]]) public and announced her retirement from the bulk commercial e-mail business on 10 October 2005, referring to spam as "a four-letter word" and stating that bulk emailing had deteriorated into "a bunch of unprofessional, ineffective scams" due to its negative image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aunty-spam.com/email-spam-loses-spam-queen-laura-betterly/ Aunty-spam.com - antispam software 2008 Resources and Information.

Despite the investment, In Touch closed its doors in 2007.

==Recent activity==
Since 2007 Betterly has been running [[Yada Yada Marketing]] a boutique marketing firm that is Google certified for pay per click, and continues to speak at industry events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="99483">The following is a list of the volumes of the ''Auditing and Accounting Guide'' series published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The list was compiled using the resources of the University of Mississippi library.  The list also includes titles from the earlier series: ''AICPA Accounting Guides'' and ''AICPA Industry Audit Guides''. Links to full-text of the ''Guides'' are provided for many of the titles prior to 2000. 

The ''Comments'' column provides references to sections of ''Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)'' which complement or supersede a particular ''Audit and Accounting Guide''. The ASC is published by the [http://www.fasb.org/home Financial Accounting Standards Board], and access to the ASC is free through the Basic View on the FASB web site. The ASC became effective on July 1, 2009, and has since been the authoritative source for all U.S. GAAP, [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (USA)]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, James. "FASB Codification of U.S. GAAP Takes Effect." ''PCAOB Reporter,'' Vol 7, Issue 14 (July 21, 2009), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the ASC, accounting standards were scattered over a number of publications issued by the FASB and the AICPA. Some publications were considered more authoritative than others, and a GAAP hierarchy of five levels was recognized; see Statement on Auditing Standards No. 69 [http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/SAS,1336 full-text]..  The AICPA Industry Audit and Accounting Guides are part of the second tier of authoritative publications in the GAAP hierarchy. &lt;ref&gt; Thompson, James H. "The New GAAP Hierarchy." ''National Public Accountant,'' Vol. 38, Issue 10 (October 1993), pp. 18-20, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Saidler''' is a [[Vienna]]-born Swiss businessman and investor in internet and [[financial technology]] companies.  He has done most of his investing in central Europe, working mostly through a holding company called Centralway, and subsequently through a [[family office]] called Saidler &amp; Co.

== Career ==
Martin Saidler was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schneider|first1=Katharina|title=„Die Welt braucht nicht noch eine Bank“|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/anlagestrategie/trends/centralway-chef-saidler-im-interview-die-welt-braucht-nicht-noch-eine-bank/19306068-all.html|publisher=Handelsblatt|language=German ||archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122053624/https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/anlagestrategie/trends/centralway-chef-saidler-im-interview-die-welt-braucht-nicht-noch-eine-bank/19306068-all.html|archivedate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother came from [[Slovakia]] and he grew up speaking Slovak at home.&lt;ref name=Lupa/&gt;  He attended the [[University of Vienna]] where he studied journalism and political science.&lt;ref name=Lupa&gt;{{cite news|title=Martin Saidler: český Internet bude do dvou let patřit americkým firmám|url=https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/martin-saidler-cesky-internet-bude-patrit-americkym-firmam/|publisher=Lupa.cz|date=22 February 2007|language=Czech |archiveurl=http://www.lupa.cz/clanky/martin-saidler-cesky-internet-bude-patrit-americkym-firmam/|archivedate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to [[Berlin]] where in 1997 he founded the employment website Jobinteractive.com.&lt;ref name=boersen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brosy|first1=Martin|title=Martin Saidler – Der erfolgreichste Online-Unternehmer der Schweiz?|url=http://www.boersenpoint.de/boersenblog/blog/martin-saidler-der-erfolgreichste-online-unternehmer-der-schweiz-1793041/||publisher=Boersenpoint|date=29 July 2016|language=German ||archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530091312/http://www.boersenpoint.de:80/boersenblog/blog/martin-saidler-der-erfolgreichste-online-unternehmer-der-schweiz-1793041/|archivedate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, it became one of the major job portals in Germany.&lt;ref name=boersen/&gt; In 1999, Beisheim Holding Switzerland (BHS) acquired Jobinteractive.com.&lt;ref name=bilanz/&gt;  BHS combined it with other businesses in a company called Scout24.&lt;ref name=startwerk/&gt;  Saidler stayed with the company until around 2001, [[technology scouting|scouting]] opportunities for them in central Europe, and cashed out just before the [[dot-com bubble]] burst.&lt;ref name=bilanz/&gt;&lt;ref name=skinner/&gt;

Saidler used that money, along with money from a Luxembourg fund called Incubation Capital SARL, as capital for the investment company Centralway AG, based in [[Zug]], Switzerland, and developed it into one of the largest Internet corporate groups in central Europe.&lt;ref name=bilanz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kowalsky|first1=Mark|title=Centralway: Der Online-Zar in Osteuropa|url=http://www.bilanz.ch/unternehmen/centralway-der-online-zar-osteuropa|publisher=Billanz|date=9 April 2010|language=German ||archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014921/http://www.bilanz.ch/unternehmen/centralway-der-online-zar-osteuropa|archivedate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skinner/&gt;  Through 2010, his investment strategy was to invest mostly in central Europe, in companies controlled by their founders that were making money and leading in their field; he would help them grow for three to four years, then seek an exit.&lt;ref name=bilanz/&gt;  Many of these transactions were among private companies, so the sources of investment and the amounts of money spent and earned are not known.&lt;ref name=skinner&gt;{{cite news|last1=Skinner|first1=Barnaby|title=Der talentierte Mr. Saidler|work=SonntagsZeitung|date=19 January 2014}}; republished on author's website, as {{cite news|title=The talented Mr. Saidler|url=http://barnabyskinner.com/journal/2014/3/11/the-talented-mr-saidler.html|date=11 March 2014 |last1=Skinner |first1=Barnaby |publisher=Barnabyskinner.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629093857/http://barnabyskinner.com:80/journal/2014/3/11/the-talented-mr-saidler.html|archivedate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hässig|first1=Lukas|title=Die Ospels und der Dreihundert-Mio-Mann|url=https://insideparadeplatz.ch/2013/12/03/die-ospels-und-der-dreihundert-mio-mann/|date=3 December 2013|language=German |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301184900/https://insideparadeplatz.ch/2013/12/03/die-ospels-und-der-dreihundert-mio-mann/|archivedate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011 Saidler determined that the market for IT companies in central Europe had become overpriced, so Centralway sold off most of its investments, stopped making new investments there, and starting looking at investments inside Switzerland,&lt;ref name=bilanz2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Internetpionier Saidler investiert massiv in der Schweiz||publisher=Bilanz|date=28 July 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at a time when there was a rising market of internet-based startups in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kowalsky|first1=Marc|title=Internetszene Schweiz: Start up!|url=http://www.bilanz.ch/unternehmen/internetszene-schweiz-start|publisher=Bilanz|date=8 March 2012|language=German |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926191030/http://www.bilanz.ch/unternehmen/internetszene-schweiz-start|archivedate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Centralway entered the Swiss market by acquiring an internet agency called Netvision and making it a subsidiary of Centralway, initially called "Centralway Factory", intended to be a [[corporate accelerator]].&lt;ref name=startwerk&gt;{{cite news|title=Internet-investor Martin Saidler: «Wir wollen Startups bauen»|url=https://www.startwerk.ch/2012/03/07/internet-investor-martin-saidler-wir-wollen-startups-bauen/|publisher=Startwerk.ch|date=7 March 2012|language=German |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301005809/https://www.startwerk.ch/2012/03/07/internet-investor-martin-saidler-wir-wollen-startups-bauen/|archivedate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bilanz2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Aus Netvision wird Centralway Factory|url=http://www.werbewoche.ch/medien/2012-03-16/aus-netvision-wird-centralway-factory|date=16 March 2012 |publisher=Werbewoche|language=German |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926235523/http://www.werbewoche.ch/medien/2012-03-16/aus-netvision-wird-centralway-factory|archivedate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company [[Numbrs Personal Finance AG|Centralway Numbrs]] was founded in the accelerator in 2012 to create an [[Application software|app]] for [[mobile banking]]; its founder was Julien Arnold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=7 Questions with Julian Arnold, Founder and CEO of Numbrs|url=http://www.fintecforumdach.de/News_%26_Blogs-e/Eintrage/2013/10/18_7_Questions_with_Julian_Arnold,_Founder_of_Numbrs.html|work=Fintech Forum|date=18 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122033507/http://www.fintecforumdach.de/News_%26_Blogs-e/Eintrage/2013/10/18_7_Questions_with_Julian_Arnold,_Founder_of_Numbrs.html|archivedate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Saidler set up a [[venture capital]] fund called Centralway Ventures based in Switzerland but operating in the UK; it made an investment in [[Buttercoin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lomas|first1=Natasha|title=Swiss Company-Builder Centralway Opens $50M Fund, Invests $250k In Bitcoin Whitelabel Exchange Buttercoin|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/18/centralway-fund-buttercoin-seed/|publisher=Techcrunch|date=18 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706123136/https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/18/centralway-fund-buttercoin-seed/|archivedate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2018 the fund was closed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centralway Ventures: Private Company Information |accessdate=22 January 2018 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=246999706 |publisher=Bloomberg||archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122055205/https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=246999706|archivedate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Saidler founded Saidler &amp; Co. as a [[family office]] that operated through three arms; Statmentt, which invested in fintech companies, an investment fund, and a real estate investment fund operating in Switzerland, Austria and Hungary.&lt;ref name=globes-seeks&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tsipori|first1=Tali|title=Swiss entrepreneur seeks Israeli high-tech investments|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-swiss-entrepreneur-seeks-israeli-high-tech-investments-1001192731|publisher=Globes English|date=15 June 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120314/http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-swiss-entrepreneur-seeks-israeli-high-tech-investments-1001192731|archivedate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saidler &amp; Co.

The Numbrs app, which aggregated a person's banking and credit card information in one app, was demonstrated at a fintech conference in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sposito|first1=Sean|title=Reporter's Picks: Three Top Apps at FinovateFall|work=American Banker|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; then launched in Germany in 2014.&lt;ref name=datacenter/&gt;  Centralway began focusing on fintech.&lt;ref name=boersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=datacenter&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ostler|first1=Ulrike|title=Software-Hersteller Centralway baut sich eine Bank|url=http://www.datacenter-insider.de/software-hersteller-centralway-baut-sich-eine-bank-a-456227/|publisher=Datacenter-insider.de|date=19 April 2014|language=German |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122055941/https://www.datacenter-insider.de/software-hersteller-centralway-baut-sich-eine-bank-a-456227/|archivedate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By January 2017 the company said that people had entered about 1.5 million accounts into the Numbrs app and the company had raised about $125 million, and the majority shareholder was Saidler's family office.&lt;ref name=tcdubai/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Centralway Looks to Take On UK Banks with App for All Accounts.|publisher=Financial Times|last=Noonan|first=Laura|date=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Postbank und Norisbank kooperieren mit Centralway Numbrs|url=http://www.kreditwesen.de/bank-markt/ergaenzende-informationen/bank-markt-meldungen/postbank-norisbank-kooperieren-centralway-numbrs-id37425.html|publisher=Kreditwesen.de|date=26 January 2017|language=German |accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2017 the company cut about a third of its workforce.&lt;ref name=Hody&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hody|first1=Peter|title=Massenentlassung bei Schweizer Milliarden-Fintech|url=https://www.finews.ch/news/banken/27637-centralway-numbrs-fintech-zuerich-stellenabbau-martin-saidler-entlassungen|work=finews.ch|date=7 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120321/https://www.finews.ch/news/banken/27637-centralway-numbrs-fintech-zuerich-stellenabbau-martin-saidler-entlassungen|archivedate=19 January 2018|language=de-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swiss Fintech Giant Cuts a Third of its Jobs|url=https://www.finews.asia/finance/24781-swiss-fintech-giant-cuts-a-third-of-its-jobs|work=Finews|date=7 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714031036/https://www.finews.asia/finance/24781-swiss-fintech-giant-cuts-a-third-of-its-jobs|archivedate=14 July 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Master of Business Communication''''' (MBC) is a specialized [[academic degree]] typically conferred by a business school. The degree incorporates many elements of the [[Master of Business Administration]] [[MBA]] degree with a specialized focus on [[corporate communications]], [[public relations]] and [[marketing communications]].

The degree typically requires three years of full-time study but may take longer when undertaken on a part-time basis. It is evident that some institutions are offering the degree in similar structure to the MBA.  The aim of the program is to educate on the interdisciplinary principles of [[business management]] as they apply to the corporate communicator.

'''Max Ilgner''' (born 28 June 1899 in [[Biebesheim am Rhein]] – died 28 March 1966 in [[Schwetzingen]]) was a [[Germany|German]] industrialist. He was a member of the board of [[IG Farben]] and held the title ''Wehrwirtschaftsführer'' or war economy leader under the [[Nazi regime]]. After the war, he was convicted by the Allies of "spoilation and plunder", but released almost immediately, and continued his career as a political lobbyist and business executive, becoming chairman of a Swiss chemical company.

==Early life==
Ilgner came from an established military family, with his father and grandfather both officers, and followed in their footsteps by entering cadet school. He briefly served as a junior officer on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] at the very end of the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="Jeff154"&gt;Jeffreys, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined the [[Freikorps]] for a spell before being discharged from the new [[Reichswehr]] after its numbers were substantially reduced by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt;

The demobbed Ilgner took a doctorate in political science at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]], having also studied [[metallurgy]] and [[chemistry]] at the Technical College of Charlottenburg.&lt;ref name="memo"&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/max_ilgner_18991966 Wollheim Memorial Max Ilgner (1899–1966)]&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly worked in [[Stockholm]] following completion of his studies and whilst there he met Erna Hällström. The two were later married and had three children.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

==Rise in IG Farben==
Despite his extensive qualifications Ilgner found work hard to get in depressed post-war Germany, and so he called on his uncle [[Hermann Schmitz (industrialist)|Hermann Schmitz]], the financial chief at [[BASF]], who secured for Ilgner a position as a salesman at the chemical company.&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt; In 1926, having worked for BASF for two years, Ilgner was given a new role working with Schmitz at a newly established central finance unit for IG Farben on [[Berlin]]'s [[Unter den Linden]]. Although little more than a messenger boy Ilgner built up a strong network of contacts and, with his uncle's support, advanced through the ranks at the company.&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt;

By 1934 Ilgner had been appointed as a deputy member of the ''[[Vorstand]]'' of IG Farben and had a remit that gave him some control over not only financial and public relations decisions but also the company's dealings with central government.&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt; He led two important subsections of the central finance unit, namely the Department of Economic Research (known as ''Vowi'') which was established in 1929 and dealt with overseas investment opportunities and the Department of Economic Policy (''Wipo'') which was set up in 1932, under [[Heinrich Gattineau]] and then Ilgner, to keep an eye on legal, foreign policy and taxation issues that might impact on the relationship between the company and the government.&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt;

Ilgner's rapid rise, his naked ambition and the feeling that he was being pushed only because of his family connections made him unpopular with many of his fellow executives but Schmitz held too much power in the company for such objections to be raised publicly.&lt;ref name="Jeff155"&gt;Jeffreys, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working with the Nazis==
Ilgner was offered membership of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933 but refused on the grounds that he wished to retain his membership of [[Rotary International]], an organisation that [[Joseph Goebbels]] had declared incompatible with [[Nazism]]. Nevertheless, Ilgner was happy to work closely with the fledgling Nazi regime and encouraged public support for Nazism by the company's factory workers.&lt;ref name="Jeff155"/&gt; He also worked with Goebbels in an attempt to get the Minister of Propaganda to tone down some of his rhetoric, which Ilgner believed was damaging Germany's reputation internationally, an initiative which initially enjoyed some success until Goebells became angry at Ilgner telling him what to do and broke off communication.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt; Undeterred Ilgner hired the services of the [[United States|American]] public relations expert [[Ivy Lee]] to improve the reputation of [[Adolf Hitler]] on the world stage. After Lee's initial suggestion, the dropping of [[anti-Semitism]], was rejected out of turn by Hitler, they agreed on a programme of presenting Germany as a welcoming, historical destination to American investors whilst also plotting a policy of arranging for pro-Hitler articles to be added to American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Ilgner's work was criticised by other ''Vorstand'' members, who felt that he was undertaking too much government propaganda and not enough work for IG Farben, but his initiatives won Hitler's approval and increasingly IG Farben's overseas offices also became centres of Nazi Party propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; In return Ilgner was able to boost IG Farben's contracts with the government, notably their fading [[Leuna]] arm which was rejuvenated considerably when Ilgner was able to use contacts in the Reichswehr's Weapons Office to secure for this branch of the company the contract to produce fuel for the [[Luftwaffe]], which was being covertly built up in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles but which would have been discovered had they been forced to import large quantities of aircraft fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 161-162&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ilgner's much later claims his influence amongst the Nazi hierarchy even saved the life of Gattineau on [[Night of the Long Knives]] after his fellow executive had been arrested due to his membership of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' and his friendship with [[Ernst Röhm]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Ilgner would finally join the Nazi Party in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Weiß (ed.): ''Biographisches Lexikon zum Dritten Reich''. Fischer-Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1998, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ilgner's direction IG Farben would also play a role in the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] and the dismemberment of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Along with fellow executive [[Georg von Schnitzler]] Ilgner developed a scheme whereby IG Farben would fund pro-German newspapers in Czechoslovakia. The large scale publication of propaganda stories that accompanied the negotiations between Hitler and [[Neville Chamberlain]] helped to whip up strong support for the Nazis amongst the country's German community and the company continued to pour money into Sudeten German Relief Fund and the [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]]. When the fate of the country was sealed and the Nazis took over IG Farben were rewarded for their part in events by being allowed to take control of Aussiger Verein, a [[Prague]]-based chemical company that was the fourth largest in Europe, at a low price.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 205-207&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Immediately after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Ilgner handed over the company's extensive collection of geological maps to the government, informing them of the locations across Europe where chemicals might be extracted.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; As head of ''Vowi'' he had also built up extensive knowledge of IG Farben's main overseas competitors and he was able to supply the government with full details of the operations of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]], a British chemical company that Ilgner had one eye on in the event of [[Operation Sea Lion]] being launched.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war dragged on a Nazi defeat began to look inevitable Ilgner took steps to safeguard his own future. After a bomb struck the Unter den Linten offices in January 1945 Ilgner announced that he could not work under such conditions and, taking all sensitive documented material with him, relocated his office to [[Frankfurt am Main]]. In fact Ilgner was simply trying to avoid falling into the hands of the [[Soviet Union]] and so moved westwards and whilst in Frankfurt ensured the disappearance of the incriminating documents he had taken with him.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
Ilgner was one of 24 executives of the company indicted for "spoilation and plunder" by the Americans on 4 May 1947 in what became known as the [[IG Farben Trial]]. Ilgner in particular was singled out for the leading role he played in German rearmament&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; and at the trial it was noted that he was the only executive who continued to fraternise openly with [[Carl Krauch]] who was bearing the bulk of the guilt due to his close relationship to [[Hermann Göring]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Ilgner was one of nine defendants found guilty of "spoilation and plunder" in 1948, which was defined as the taking of property without the owner's full and non-coerced consent and was sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 337-338&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was released already in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/max_ilgner_18991966#cite_a Wollheim Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilgner announced his conversion to [[Christianity]] in prison and vowed to follow a missionary path following his release.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; For a time he followed this path, undertaking work on behalf of the [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945'', Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; This did not prove to be long-lived however and instead he became a professional political lobbyist.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 he was appointed the chairman of the board at a chemical company in [[Zug]].&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

An '''online research community''' (part of Research 2.0) is a part of an emerging and developing area in [[market research]] making  use of developments in [[Web 2.0]] technologies and [[online communities]]. They allow [[qualitative research]] to be conducted efficiently and deeply online.

Both public and private online communities offer opportunities for research, but many brands are wary of sharing company information openly. Invitation-only, private online communities centred on a single brand or customer segment may be the solution. These private communities can also engage customer groups or target consumers who might be difficult to reach using traditional off-line methodologies. Consumers enjoy this new, more participative research approach and the interaction with other users re-introduces the social context often missing from other research approaches that conceive of the consumer as an isolated individual.

Brands also benefit from online communities by having them on-hand to answer questions, test hypotheses, and observe. Online technology can adapt to almost any research need, be it showing creative stimulus material, gathering ideas for [[innovation]] and [[co-creation]] or simply an instant 'go/no go' needed. The continuity built through online networks brings new possibilities for supporting ideation processes. With a group of people on board, research can keep pace with internal development processes, providing a consumer feedback loop to check new ideas, such as product development, from inception to launch.

In an online research community members (rather than respondents) talk to each other – they exchange ideas and discuss issues with each other. Unlike a panel this lets researchers observe how people interact, the language they use, and lets them raise the questions they want to ask, which results in richer responses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9027">A '''Practice Enterprise''' (also known as a Practice Firm&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or Virtual Enterprise&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a practice company that runs like a real business silhouetting a real enterprise's business procedures, products and services. A Practice Enterprise resembles a real company in its form, organization and function. Each Practice Enterprise trades with other Practice Enterprises, following standard commercial business procedures in the Practice Enterprise worldwide economic environment. It offers a ‘learning-by-doing’ training programme with the aim to better prepare young people for their future careers and to increase their entrepreneurship potential through running their own Practice Enterprise.

==History==
The origins of the Practice Enterprise concept run back to the late 19th Century. Letter exchange clubs were formed in Europe as a way of training commercial communication. The letter exchange clubs became more and more popular and turned into the first practice bureaus around 1920 and were used in a number of countries across Europe.

The first structure to the practice bureaus was the “German Practice Economy” in 1934 and in 1948, the first central office for Practice Enterprises was established by the [[Trade unions in Germany|German Trade Unions]]. Thereby, a real practice firm market was formed which offered for example a database to connect, bank services resembling real bank systems, mail exchanges and trades with other countries, such as Austria, Sweden and Switzerland. In the 1960s, the first central office organising the services provided to the network was formed in the city of Heidelberg in Germany and the first fair for Practice Firms was held in a gymnastic hall in Northern Germany in 1964.

In 1993, a European project was funded by the [[European Social Fund]] and the German Federal State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia|North-Rhine Westphalia]] to connect the different networks around the world to an international association. The European project established the non-profit association EUROPEN which at that time was a department of the Bfz-Essen e.V. in Germany. As the association grew internationally and became an independent entity in 1997, it adjusted its name in 2005 to EUROPEN-PEN International emphasizing the members from across the world.

== Concept, Methodology and Skills ==
The Practice Enterprise concept is applied in different educational systems: from schools, colleges, universities, vocational training institutions&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, companies and further training centres worldwide. The primary target group is students from secondary schools and universities. Adults can also participate in the training programme, either as employees, jobseekers, and people with disabilities or women returning to work.

This applied way of learning, the ‘learning-by-doing’&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; methodology, allows people with all kinds of backgrounds to learn and improve their skills in a Practice Enterprise. Trainees get to know the real-life international business experience and learn and improve important skills such as language and communication skills, intercultural competences and various soft skills which are helpful in finding one’s own path and increase the employability.

Trainees learn many different [[entrepreneurship]] skills&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; such as Administration skills, Accountancy, Computer-based skills ([[Information and communications technology|ICT]]), Human resources management, Marketing and Sales, Purchasing, Business planning, International trade, and Time management. In addition, they also develop the necessary competences to become a better employee or entrepreneur, such as teamwork, problem solving, taking responsibility and developing self-initiative. Because of the international nature of the programme, trainees also learn about intercultural differences when doing business and additionally they have the opportunity to increase their language skills. The skills and competences gained in a Practice Enterprise can easily be transferred and adjusted to other markets, countries and potential work fields.

=== Training Environment and Activities ===
Generally a Practice Enterprise has the same key players and benefits wherever it is located. The trainees are the employees of the Practice Enterprise and run the business themselves whereas the teacher or trainer takes on the role of a mentor or coach.

The setting of a Practice Enterprise provides a way for trainees to learn practically through the ‘[[learning-by-doing]]’ methodology and also to get into the entrepreneurial mindset. The Practice Enterprise programme is designed in such a way that trainees take the responsibility for operating a virtual company and for the sale of products (for example pharmaceuticals, books, food, machinery) and services (for example, shipping, warehousing, events, travel, catering services) and for the revenues and expenditures of their company. Each company engages in business activities, both nationally and internationally with other companies within the Practice Enterprise network (for example, between Brazil and Spain), by following standard commercial business procedures and frameworks.

Each company carries out market research, places advertisements, buys raw materials and stock, plans logistics, manufactures simulated goods, sells simulated goods or services and pays wages, taxes, benefits, etc. The actual transfer of goods and money happens virtually but the following transactions take place for real: orders are made, invoices issued and financial records maintained, including information about creditors, debtors, stock holders, etc.

All trainers involved in the Practice Enterprise programme are trained on workplace facilitation. Trainers receive guidelines and practical handbooks to run the programme and to assess the trainees based on the same set of criteria. Trainers in a Practice Enterprise take on the role of a coach or mentor for trainees, instead of the traditional teacher role.

Most Practice Enterprises have a mentor company that comes from the real business world. A business mentor gives advice and ideas to the trainers and trainees about how a business is run and can advise on the sale of products and services within the virtual business. In some cases, business mentors are involved in the selection and recruitment of staff (e.g. students within the school or university).

There are standard requirements regarding equipment and IT (hardware and software) that need to be met for running the programme. To make the experience as realistic as possible, each classroom is divided into different sections that represent the different departments of a business such as reception, purchasing, human resources, operations and marketing.

Fairs for Practice Enterprises exist nationally as well as internationally and provide a good base to experience and test skills in another setting than the classroom or office. Through the participation in Practice Enterprise Trade Fairs, trainees get to represent their business to other national and international Practice Enterprises in person and also learn the preparation of a fair and booth, the professional representation in front of competitors and the follow-up after trades on the fair ground. During these fairs, a lot of competitions take place, varying from ‘Best Booth’ to other business challenges like elevator pitches and case studies.

'''Regina Margareten''' (1863–1959) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] entrepreneur, who became known as the "[[Matzoh]] Queen" of [[New York City]]. She immigrated to the United States in 1883, where the family set up a business which grew into [[Kosher food]] manufacturers Horowitz Brothers and Margareten Company. She was profiled several times by ''[[The New York Times]]'', and continued to attend the business until two weeks prior to her death.

==Career==
Regina Margareten was born in [[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]], on either December 20 or 25, 1863, to Jacob Horowitz and his wife Miral Chayah Horowitz (née Brunner), who went by the name of Mary. At birth, Margareten was known as both Rebush and Hannah Rivka. While pregnant, she emigrated with her husband Ignatz Margareten and her parents in 1883 to the United States, where they settled in [[New York City]]. They opened a grocery store on the [[Lower East Side]], as they wanted to continue following [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The made their own [[matzoh]] for their first [[Passover]] while in the United States, and this grew over the following years to become the sole object of the family's business in New York, which was known as Horowitz Brothers and Margareten Company.{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}}

The business grew from using a rented bakery in their first year, to having a turnover of more than a million [[US dollars|dollars]] in 1931. Margareten would make checks on the matzoh routinely throughout each day, and proposed the use of [[wheat]] from three different American states to improve the quality of the matzoh, and expand the business into other [[Kosher]] products.{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}} When her husband died in 1923, she became Treasurer of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rossner|first1=Toby|title=Jewish Women Entrepreneurs|url=http://www.jvhri.org/stories/jewish-women-entrepreneurs,2815?|accessdate=November 2, 2017|work=Jewish Voice|date=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 50's, she would speak on the local radio just prior to Passover in both [[Yiddish]] and English. When the city took over the original business location in 1945, Margareten oversaw the opening of a larger facility in [[Long Island]].{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}} Margareten was profiled on several occasions in later life by ''[[The New York Times]]'', on her 80th birthday in 1942, on her 91st in 1953 and finally on December 24, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New York Times profiles Kosher food matriarch Regina Margareten at age 95|url=https://jwa.org/thisweek/dec/24/1957/regina-margareten|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to visit the plant daily until two weeks prior to her death at the age of 96 on January 15, 1959.{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}} In her obituary, ''The New York Times'' described her as the "Matzoh Queen".{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}}

==Personal life==
Regina Margareten was the [[matriarch]] of the extended family. She owned property near to [[Hunter Mountain (New York)|Hunter Mountain]] in New York State, and established Margareten Park in [[Hunter, New York]]. During the 1920s and 30's, she returned to Hungary on a yearly basis to visit family, once flying the London to Paris part of the journey during the 1920s. Margareten invested in a [[coal mine]] in [[Edelény]], Hungary, in 1924, which resulted in jobs for many local family members.

It was briefly involved in [[Philippine Airlines]] from April 2012 to September 2014.&lt;ref name="rappler.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/171-aviation-tourism/68521-san-miguel-agrees-sell-pal-stake|title=San Miguel agrees to sell PAL stake back to Tan|work=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philstar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/09/16/1369587/tan-gets-back-pal-1.3-b|title=Tan gets back PAL for $1.3 B|work=philstar.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511201134/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/09/16/1369587/tan-gets-back-pal-1.3-b|archivedate=2015-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rappler.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/171-aviation-tourism/68580-philippine-airlines-san-miguel-lucio-tan-buyout-change-of-heart|title=PAL buyback: Lucio Tan’s change of heart|work=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:oldbrewery.jpg|left|thumb|San Miguel's old Manila brewery.]]

In 1889, a well-known Manila businessman, Enrique María Barretto de Ycaza y Esteban, applied for a royal grant from [[Spain]] to establish a [[brewery]] in the Philippines. He was awarded the grant for a period of twenty years. On September 29, 1890 ([[Michaelmas]], or the feast day of Saint [[Michael the Archangel]]), ''La Fábrica de Cerveza San Miguel'' was declared open for business. Located at 6 Calzada de [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañang]] (later called [[Jose Laurel Street|Calle Avilés]]), the brewery took its name from ''arrabal'' (suburb or district), [[San Miguel, Manila]]. The facility had two sections: one devoted to the production of [[ice]] with a daily capacity of 5 tons, and the other to [[beer]] production. The brewery was the first in Southeast Asia using the most modern equipment and facilities of the day. With 70 employees, the plant produced 3,600 hectolitres (about 47,000 cases) of lager beer during the first year and subsequently produced other types of beer, notably Cerveza Negra, Eagle Extra Stout and Doble Bock.

Early success led to the expansion of the business and Barretto decided to incorporate his brewery. On 6 June 1893, the company was incorporated and registered with a capital of P180,000.  Those forming the corporation were Barretto, Pedro Pablo Róxas y Castro, Gonzalo Tuasón y Patiño, Vicente D. Fernández y Castro, Albino Goyenechea, Benito Legarda y Tuáson and the heirs of Don Mariano Buenaventura y Chuidan.

Pedro Pablo Róxas was soon appointed manager, playing a prominent role in the development of the firm. He was the active member of the firm until 1896, when he left for Europe. Prior to his departure, he acquired Barretto's shares in the company worth P42,000.  After Barretto retired in May 1896, Róxas acquired the rest of Barretto’s stake in the business. In 1895, San Miguel Beer won the first of its many awards as a product of the highest quality at the Exposición Regional de Filipinas. By 1896, San Miguel Beer was outselling by more than five-to-one all imported beers in the country.

The 1900s ushered in a period of prosperity after the [[Philippine Revolution]] and the beginning of the [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American Occupation]]. Demand for beer increased, and for San Miguel, still under Róxas' leadership, modernization of their operations included installation of electric conveyors and automatic machines, with the brewery’s equipment modernised by 1910.

===San Miguel Brewery, Inc. (1913–1963)===

By 1913, imported beer represented only 12% of the total consumption in the Philippines; San Miguel held an 88% share of the industry. Róxas died in [[Paris]], [[France]] in 1913. Soon after, Benito Legarda and Gonzalo Tuasón made it advisable to change the form of the company from a firm of co-participants to a corporation ('''San Miguel Brewery, Inc.'''). Róxas's son, Antonio Róxas y de Ayala, was appointed president, with Enrique Brías y de Coya and Don Ramón J. Fernández as managers.

By 1914, San Miguel began to export, with its products finding ready markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Guam.  When the [[First World War]] broke out, exports came to a temporary halt due to difficulties such as shortage of raw materials and the consequent rise in manufacturing costs. It was not until [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was repealed in the [[United States]] that San Miguel was able to resume exports to [[Guam]] and later to [[Honolulu]], [[Territory of Hawaii]]. By the end of 1914, Enrique Brías, after seeing that his efforts and industry had resulted in a progressive and prosperous business, retired from active business life in favour of his son, Antonio Brías y Róxas.  In 1918, Antonio Róxas resigned from his position as president.

====Andrés Soriano Sr.: 1918–1964====
[[Image:San miguel advertisement.jpg|thumb|An ad that appeared in the Jan. 17, 1924 edition of the Manila-based Spanish-language satirical magazine ''Aray''.]]

[[Andrés Soriano]] (a grandson of Don Pedro Pablo Róxas and a nephew of Don Antonio Róxas) joined San Miguel as a clerk in the accounting department. In 1918, after the resignation of Antonio Róxas, Ramón J. Fernández assumed the presidency and Soriano was made acting manager. In 1923, Soriano was appointed manager and managed San Miguel together with Antonio Brías y Roxas with constantly increasing success.

Diversification into new lines of business began in the 1920s.  The company opened in 1922 the Royal Soft Drinks Plant in Manila producing [[Royal Tru]]-Orange, other Royal products and aerated water. (In 1919, the company acquired the Oriental Brewery and Ice Company and transformed the building into an ice plant and cold storage; later the Royal Soft Drinks Plant.) Five years later, the company secured the rights to bottle and distribute [[Coca-Cola]] in the Philippines.  In 1925, San Miguel went into the ice cream business with the purchase of the [[Magnolia Ice Cream|Magnolia]] Plant on [[Jose Laurel Street|Calle Avilés]] which was transferred a year later to a new site on Calle Echague (now, C. Palanca Sr. Street) in [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo District]], [[Manila]].  The new site used to house the Fábrica de Hielo de Manila which was bought by San Miguel in 1924.  To achieve greater self-sufficiency in its operations, the firm opened a new plant in 1930 to produce carbon dioxide for its soft drinks products and dry ice for the refrigeration needs of its ice cream products.  In 1932, a plant was set up to produce compressed yeast for bakeries and medical use. The following year, the company leased from the government the site for Insular Ice and Cold Storage for a period of ten years.

During the 1930s, San Miguel began investing in businesses overseas.  The company set up a short lived dairy business in Calcutta, India and Singapore (Cold Storage Creameries, Singapore), and invested in breweries in the United States (a stake in the [[George Muehlebach Brewing Company]] and majority holdings in the [[Lone Star Brewing Company]] located in San Antonio, Texas).

In 1939, the management of the company was reorganized along the lines of American corporations.  San Miguel's management team was made up of the board of directors (president, vice-president, treasurer and nine directors and the executive officers of the corporation).  Ramón J. Fernández was elected president of the board of directors and Antonio Róxas y Gargollo (a son of Antonio Róxas) was elected vice-president. Soriano was elected president of the corporation, with Antonio Brias y Róxas as vice president.  Eduardo Róxas y Gargollo (another son of Don Antonio Róxas) and Jacobo Zóbel y Róxas were appointed directors. Expanding and modernizing the company, however, meant diluting family control. San Miguel became the first Filipino company to be owned by thousands of shareholders. To retain control, Soriano relied on alliances with his Róxas relatives and associates.

Before [[World War II]] broke out, San Miguel built a glass factory in [[Paco, Manila|Paco]] and the [[Cebu]] Royal plant, its first installation outside [[Luzon]]. When the war reached the Philippines, Soriano was commissioned as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and served as an aide to General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. One of the first Filipino [[brewmasters]] was Dominador San Diego Santos, a chemist from [[Obando, Bulacan]].&lt;ref name=Kiwanis&gt;[http://kiwaniscebu.org/History.html Dominador Santos], His History, KiwanisCebu.org&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, San Miguel rebuilt and mounted a large scale expansion program. The company acquired and modernized a second brewery in Polo, [[Bulacán]] (now part of [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela City]]) in 1947. Two years later, five other plants were opened: the Manila glass plant in Farola, a carbon dioxide plant in Otis, a carton plant, the [[Iloilo|Iloílo]] Coca-Cola plant and the Farola power plant. Exports of [[San Miguel Brewery|San Miguel Pale Pilsen]] resumed. New soft drink plants followed in [[Davao City|Davao]] and [[Naga, Cebu|Naga]].

In 1953, Soriano signed the "Manila Agreement" which allowed the Spanish company La Segarra S.A. to brew and sell San Miguel Beer in Spain. This company, renamed "San Miguel, Fábricas de Cerveza y Malta" (now [[Mahou-San Miguel Group]]) in 1957, was a separate, independent company that had exclusive rights to use the San Miguel brand in Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;p4, Reinventing the San Miguel Corporation, Ivey Management Services, Version: (A)2009-09-22&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Miguel Corporation (1964–present)===

====Andrés Soriano Jr.: 1964–1984====

In 1964, the company's name was changed to '''San Miguel Corporation''' (SMC) and moved to a new head office along [[Ayala Avenue]] in [[Makati]].

Andrés Soriano died on December 30, 1964. At the time of his death, Soriano had parlayed his family's vast San Miguel fortune into [[mining]], [[dairy|dairies]], factories, a [[newspaper]] and a [[radio station]]. He had investments in [[Philippine Airlines]], held the largest Coca-Cola franchise, and owned five [[insurance]] agency distributorships, a [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] brewery that made [[Lone Star (beer)|Lone Star]] and [[Colt 45 (malt liquor)|Colt 45]], [[gold mine]]s in [[British East Africa]] and a development company in [[Spain]].

Antonio Róxas y Gargollo was elected chairman and [[Andres Soriano Jr.|Andrés Soriano Jr.]] became president. Soriano was credited with instituting modern management, including decentralisation along product lines.

The [[Mandaue]], [[Cebu]] complex was inaugurated in 1967 - its brewery and glass plant commenced operations a year later. Soriano continued to diversify the food business, building an [[ice cream]] plant in 1970 and expanding into [[poultry]] production in 1973 (it later added [[shrimp]] processing and freezing in 1984). By 1973, SMC sales exceeded a billion pesos for the first time and profits topped the hundred-million-peso mark.

A new corporate logo was adopted in 1975. The San Miguel ''escudo'' ([[Seal (emblem)|seal]]), symbol of the royal grant, was retained as the logo San Miguel Beer, its original grantee.

In the 1970s, [[Ferdinand Marcos|then Philippine President, Ferdinand Marcos]] imposed a tax on the production of coconuts, a major Philippine cash crop, with the proceeds supposed to fund that industry's development. It was alleged, however, that the money was funneled into United Coconut Planters Bank, controlled by [[Danding Cojuangco|Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.]], which Cojuangco then used much of the funds to help him purchase his controlling stake in San Miguel in 1983. The controlling interest carried nine of SMC's 15 directors seats with it.

SMC encountered its first major competitor in the Philippine beer market in 1982 with the entry of [[Asia Brewery]], Inc. The rivalry between Asia Brewery and SMC came to a head in 1988, when Asia Brewery cannily introduced a bargain-priced brand called simply, "Beer" (also known as Beer Pale Pilsen and "Beer na Beer"). The product looked and tasted like San Miguel Beer, playing upon the fact that in the Philippines, the San Miguel brand was synonymous with beer. It was a creative counter to SMC's notoriously aggressive and sometimes cutthroat competitive strategy, which had reportedly included "attempts to sabotage Asia Brewery's sales network and smash its empty bottles." Asia Brewery even hired away San Miguel's brewmaster.

At that time, the original San Miguel Brewery buildings in [[San Miguel, Manila]] were demolished upon transfer of ownership to the Philippine Government as part of the [[Malacañang Palace]] grounds. The site became a park while some became part of the government complex (as the new executive building).

In 1983, SMC sold its remaining minority interest in the Spanish company ([[Mahou-San Miguel Group|San Miguel, Fábricas de Cerveza y Malta, S.A.]]) The Philippine and Spanish companies have been operated independently of one another. The Spanish company enjoyed success with San Miguel in its home market. Also, it was the number one Spanish beer exported throughout Europe. Consequently, well-travelled consumers easily confuse the two San Miguel beers, even though they are brewed by two different companies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.: 1983–1986====

Soriano's administration also witnessed the battle for corporate control. A thorny issue of management transparency broke Soriano's longstanding alliance with his [[Zóbel de Ayala family|Zóbel de Ayala]] relatives. The historical corporate battle that resulted in the loss of effective control by the Sorianos and Zóbels.

In 1983, [[Enrique Zobel|Enrique J. Zóbel]] (a third cousin of Soriano), president of [[Ayala Corporation]] and was vice chairman of the SMC board, instigated a takeover of SMC. The seeds of the "family feud" lay in the refusal of the Soriano management to share corporate information with Zóbel, particularly regarding contracts that SMC management was entering into with [[ANSCOR]], a Soriano company. Soriano viewed his third cousin Zóbel as a competitor, while Zóbel (holding nearly 20% of SMC stake) viewed Soriano (with about 7%) as mismanaging the company and engaging in sweetheart deals. Unable to oust Soriano, Zóbel sold his group's 19.5% stake to businessman [[Danding Cojuangco|Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.]], an associate of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Cojuangco's Coconut Industry Investment Fund (a.k.a., [[United Coconut Planters Bank]]) accumulated an additional 31% of SMC, giving him effective control of SMC and leaving the Soriano family with a mere 3%. Funds used by Cojuangco to acquire Zóbel's stake came from [[Coco Levy Fund_scam|levies imposed by the Marcos dictatorship on coconut farmers]]. The Supreme Court has declared such levies to be public funds and therefore any assets bought using these funds are owned by coconut farmers.

After Soriano died of cancer in March 19, 1984, Cojuangco became the chairman of SMC in 1984. That same year, SMC moved to its new head office in [[Mandaluyong]]. Cojuangco brought coconut oil milling and refining operations into SMC's portfolio. His reign, however, was cut short when Marcos was toppled in 1986.

====Andrés Soriano III: 1986–1998====

After the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986, [[Corazón Aquino]], Cojuangco's estranged cousin, became president of the Philippines. Aquino rode on the crest of widespread public outrage over the assassination of her husband, [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], in 1983. One of the people blamed for her husband's death was Cojuangco, who fled on the same aircraft as Marcos to Hawaii in 1986. The Aquino administration sequestered Cojuangco's stake in SMC and agreed to let Andrés Soriano III, son of the late Soriano, run the company in spite of the Soriano family's holdings in San Miguel being a mere 1%.

Soriano launched a campaign to reclaim the family legacy, but when he tried to buy back the abandoned shares, he was blocked by the Aquino administration's Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). The PCGG assumed control (but not legal ownership) of the 51.4-percent stake and refused to relinquish it. The government asserted that the stake had been illegally obtained. The PCGG continued to tend its SMC stake into the early 1990s, but it acceded ''de facto'' control of the conglomerate to Soriano via a management contract with [[ANSCOR]]. Soriano continued the company's program of expansion, acquiring majority control of La Tondeña, Inc. (now, [[Ginebra San Miguel|Ginebra San Miguel, Inc.]]), the leading producer of hard liquor in the Philippines, in 1987 and adding beef and pork production (Monterey Meats) to the company's food operations in 1988.

Soriano embarked on an ambitious internationalization program, hoping to expand into other countries and mitigate the effects of the Philippines' unstable economy. He also wanted to head off encroaching competition from the world's biggest breweries, namely [[Anheuser-Busch]] and [[Miller Brewing|Miller]] of the United States, [[Kirin Brewery Company|Kirin]] of Japan, and [[Groupe Danone|BSN]] of France.

Soriano allocated $1 billion to a five-year strategic internationalization program that focused on shaping up domestic operations, then progressing to licensing and exporting, overseas production, and finally to distribution of non-beer products.

A subsequent decentralisation created a holding company structure, with 18 non-beer operations positioned as subsidiaries. This corporate reorganization freed the spun off businesses from the bureaucratic shackles of a large conglomerate. In the course of this multifaceted effort to attain optimum efficiency, SMC reduced its workforce by more than 16 percent, from a 1989 high of 39,138 to 32,832 by 1993.

With its domestic "ducks in a row," SMC turned to the next stage in its internationalization, beer licensing and exporting initiative. Although the company had exported beer for most of its history, this effort was intensified dramatically in the late 1980s. SMC's beer exports grew by 150 percent from 1985 to 1989 alone, and the brand was soon exported to 24 countries, including all of Asia's key markets as well as the United States, Australia, and the Middle East.

Once the core brand was established in a particular market, SMC would begin to create production facilities, sometimes on an independent basis and sometimes in concert with an indigenous joint-venture partner. By 1995, SMC had manufacturing plants in Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and had licensing partners in Taiwan, Guam and Nepal.

Thus, in spite of the overarching quarrel over SMC's ownership (not to mention other problems endemic to operating in the Philippines), the company's sales quintupled from P12.23 billion in 1986 to P68.43 billion by 1994. Net income increased twice as fast, from P1.11 billion to P 11.86 billion over the same period, although its overseas operations (as a whole) were not yet profitable.

In 1996 SMC purchased full control of its Hong Kong arm, [[San Miguel Brewery Hong Kong|San Miguel Brewery Hong Kong Ltd.]] In April of the following year, SMC's domestic soft-drink bottling unit, [[Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.]], was merged into the Australia-based [[Coca-Cola Amatil]] Ltd. (CCA). In effect, SMC exchanged its 70-percent interest in a Philippine-only operation for a 25-percent stake in CCA, which had operations in 17 countries. CCA soon demerged the latter operations into a UK-based firm called Coca-Cola Beverages plc (resulting in a reduction of SMC's stake in CCA to 22 percent).

From 1995 through 1997, SMC suffered a downturn in its main domestic businesses, while overseas operations were still in the red. Profits plummeted. In response, a major restructuring of the company's loss-making food businesses was undertaken. SMC's [[Magnolia ice cream|Magnolia ice cream and milk business]] was merged with the [[Nestlé]] Philippines group, to form Magnolia-Nestlé Corporation. By late 1998, SMC's stake in this business was acquired by Nestlé. SMC also exited from the ready-to-eat meal sector and curtailed the operations of its shrimp farming business. By late 1997, the company was also beginning to feel the effects of the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian economic crisis]].

====The Cojuangco-Ang era: 1998–present====

Andrés Soriano III resigned in July 1998 and [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.|Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr.]] was elected chairman of San Miguel Corporation.  Francisco C. Eizmendi Jr. stayed as president and [[Ramon S. Ang|Ramón S. Ang]] was elected vice-chairman in January 1999. Ang was appointed president and chief operating officer following the retirement of Eizmendi in 2002.

Confronted by greater competitive pressures as a result of the 1997 financial crisis, the pace of change quickened for San Miguel upon Cojuangco's return.  Amid an extremely difficult operating environment, working toward configuring the corporation to have better response to the highly competitive climate of the time.  The immediate goals upon assuming leadership was to ease the burden of the spiraling interest expense, pursue new strategic alliances to strengthen the business—particularly in the international arena—and strengthen its profitability and financial standing to position the company for new opportunities.  Progress was made on reducing costs, improving productivity and generating cash flow.

Having installed a critical mass of brewing capacity in China, Indonesia and Vietnam, the new management decided to continue the company’s investments in these areas, aggressively focusing on brand and volume building initiatives, most especially in China.  SMC revamped the selling and distribution organization resulting in higher distribution efficiency, improved coverage of key accounts, greater pricing stability and reduced overall costs.  In China, the company chose to focus on growth markets while still reaching close to 30 cities.  Where in the past, it had primarily concentrated on the premium market it then aggressively pushed its medium and low-end brands.

By the end of 1998, shuffling assets to find the ideal portfolio and looking to restructure our operations and focus on our core competencies, Cojuangco sold SMC's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages plc (Coca-Cola Amatil’s bottler in Europe), along with SMC's 45% stake in Nestlé Philippines.  The sale of its stake in both companies was part of the new management’s effort to restructure the San Miguel Group and focus its technological, managerial and financial strengths to ventures where it believed it could add the most value. A number of management changes were made in conjunction with a rightsizing program.

Management layers were flattened to restore the company to fighting trim.  In May, the San Miguel Brewing International (SMBIL) regional headquarters was transferred from Hong Kong to Manila and to reduce overhead expenses, the employees of SMBIL were repatriated. The organisational streamlining was meant to configure San Miguel to enable it to better respond to the competitive climate.  The goal was to speed up decision-making and have a flatter and more dynamic organisation, one that was more efficient and more responsive to the market.  The group-wide logistics and purchasing functions were realigned at the corporate level.  The food, liquor and international operations were recapitalized.  Metro Bottled Water Corporation,  manufacturers of Wilkins Distilled Water, was acquired. In February 2001, SMC re-acquired control of [[Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.]] Shortly after, SMC acquired [[San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc.|Pure Foods Corporation]], becoming the undisputed market leader in the Philippines’ fast growing food industry, owning two-thirds of the refrigerated and processed meat market, and over a third of the poultry and feeds industries.

Cojuangco and Ang have also been on an international shopping spree. For the next three years, SMC bought six companies in four neighboring countries. Its first major acquisition was Australian boutique brewer [[Boag's Brewery|J. Boag and Son]] for A$96 million in 2000. To shore up its war chest, SMC took in Japanese brewer [[Kirin Brewery|Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd.]], which acquired a 15-percent stake in SMC, for $540 million in 2002. SMC continued its international acquisitions, paying $97 million for Thai Amarit Brewery Ltd. and $35.5 million for food processor TTC (Vietnam) Co. in 2003. In 2004,it bought 51 percent of Berri Ltd., Australia's top juicemaker, for $97.9 million. By 2004, international sales comprised 13 percent of total revenues from 10 percent the previous year. In 2005, the company made its biggest overseas acquisition with the takeover of [[National Foods|National Foods Ltd.]], Australia's largest publicly traded dairy, which it bought for P80.38 billion. That was followed later in the year with its $420-million purchase of Singapore-based Del Monte Pacific Ltd., the region's largest pineapple canner. San Miguel merged National Foods' operation with Berri.

In 2006, SMC has sold its 65% stake at [[Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.]] (including its subsidiaries Cosmos Bottling and Philippine Beverage Partners) to [[The Coca-Cola Company]] (TCCC) for $590 million. In November 2007, SMC sold [[Boag's Brewery|Boag's]] to [[Lion Nathan]] for A$325 million. The same month, SMC also sold [[National Foods]] to [[Kirin Brewery Company|Kirin]] for ¥294 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/markets/2007/11/08/kirin-national-foods-markets-equity-cx_vk_1108markets02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While the global financial meltdown of 2008-2009 sent many companies into full retreat, San Miguel Corporation powered ahead, investing mightily in a strategy to reaccelerate growth and improve margins.

In 2010, SMC acquired majority control of [[Petron Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/12/16/10/san-miguel-acquires-majority-petron|title=San Miguel acquired majority of Petron|first=|last=|work=ABS-CBN News|date=17 December 2010|access-date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, SMC bought a 49% minority stake in [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL) Holdings, worth US$500 million, to revitalize PAL and [[Air Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/255691/economy/companies/pal-air-philippines-under-new-san-miguel-management|title=PAL, Air Philippines under new San Miguel management|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 15, 2014, SMC sold its stake in PAL holdings for approximately $1.3 billion and relinquished management control back to the group of [[Lucio Tan]].&lt;ref name="rappler.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philstar.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rappler.com1"/&gt;

SMC has also expanded its oil and energy business with the purchase of [[Esso]] Malaysia Berhad (65%), [[ExxonMobil]] Borneo Sdn Bhd (100%) and [[ExxonMobil]] Malaysia Sdn Bhd (100%) for US$577.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanmiguel.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SMC-PSE-Esso-Malaysia-completion-04.02.12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417143411/http://www.sanmiguel.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SMC-PSE-Esso-Malaysia-completion-04.02.12.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, SMC bought out the 24% of its shares from the government through Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) companies by paying CIIF P57.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/business/44840/end-of-an-era-govt-bows-out-of-san-miguel-with-buyback-of-24-percent-stake|title=END OF AN ERA: Gov't bows out of San Miguel with buyback of 24-percent stake|work=InterAksyon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, Iñigo Zóbel, son of Enrique Zóbel, became the largest common stock shareholder of SMC owning 66.1% through his holding company, Top Frontier Investment Holdings, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmiguel.com.ph/investor/Top_20_Stockholders.html|title=Top 20 Stockholders - San Miguel Corporation|work=sanmiguel.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In separate statements on May 30, 2016, [[Globe Telecom]] and [[Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company|PLDT]] will each acquire half of [[Vega Telecom]] from SMC for P69.1 billion. The acquisition entails P52.08 billion for 100% equity interest in Vega Telecom and the assumption of around P17.02 billion of liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/172-telecommunications-media/134713-san-miguel-corporation-selling-telco-assets-pldt-globe-telecom|title=San Miguel selling telco assets to PLDT, Globe|author=|date=|website=rappler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

San Miguel shares are also involved in the controversial Coco Levy Case (Sandiganbayan Civil Case No. 33), which is actually subdivided into a total of eight cases involving different parties and properties. Arguably the most important case is Case No. 33-F, which involves 51% of the shares of San Miguel. This majority stake at San Miguel has been further subdivided into three separate litigations, each of which reaching the Supreme Court in highly contentious proceedings.
 
The first case involved 4% of San Miguel shares, which, in the case of ''San Miguel Corporation vs. Sandiganbayan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2000/sept2000/104637_38.htm|title=San Miguel Corp vs Sandiganbayan : 104637-38 : September 14, 2000 : J. Puno : En Banc|work=judiciary.gov.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded by the Supreme Court to the government. The second case, ''Republic of the Philippines vs. Sandiganbayan and Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2011/april2011/166859.htm|title=G.R. No. 166859|work=judiciary.gov.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved a 20% block that the Supreme Court, voting 7-4, awarded to Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco. The most recent High Court pronouncement came early this year, ''Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. (COCOFED) vs. Republic of the Philippines'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2012/january2012/177857-58.htm|title=G.R. Nos. 177857-58|work=judiciary.gov.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court, voting 11-0, declared that the remaining 27% of San Miguel is owned by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/90526083/The-CenSEI-Report-Vol-2-No-15-April-16-22-2012#outer_page_11 The Coco Levy Funds: Is the Shell Game Approaching Its End?] The CenSEI Report, 16 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: The 27% had been diluted to 24% due the government’s failure to subscribe to the increased authorized capital stock of San Miguel)

'''Sir Hugh Fraser, 2nd Baronet''' (18 December 1936 – 5 May 1987), formerly '''2nd Baron Fraser of Allander''', was [[chairman]] of the [[House of Fraser]], [[Harrods]], George Outram (company), and [[Whyte and Mackay]]. He lived at [[Mugdock]], near [[Milngavie]], [[Scotland]]. He was the son of [[Hugh Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of Allander]], and inherited the [[Baron Fraser of Allander|Barony of Fraser of Allander]] on his father's death in 1966, but disclaimed it for life the same year. He has 3 daughters: Patricia, Belinda and Caroline. He was not related to the politician [[Hugh Fraser (British politician)|Sir Hugh Fraser]].

==Career==
Fraser was educated at [[St. Mary's School, Melrose]] and [[Kelvinside Academy]].&lt;ref name="burrowes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burrowes |first=John |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WHfmuGzpjU8C&amp;pg=PT28&amp;lpg=PT28&amp;dq=sir+hugh+fraser+st+mary's+school+melrose&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wUUTKPIend&amp;sig=hXLkvKSg3N0TnUuYdhvW6sz84tw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAt_3klfTZAhWE-aQKHVbXBfcQ6AEISjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=sir%20hugh%20fraser%20st%20mary's%20school%20melrose&amp;f=false |title=Glasgow: Tales of the City |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2011 |page= |isbn=178057343X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was given an [[honorary doctorate]] by the [[University of Stirling]],&lt;ref name=geo&gt;[http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst959.html Famous People]&lt;/ref&gt; where one of the student residences is now named Fraser of Allander after him. In 1981 he gifted the Mugdock Castle estate (purchased by his father) to the regional council as a [[country park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mugdock-country-park.org.uk/ Mugdock Castle]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960, he established the Hugh Fraser Foundation for charitable work.&lt;ref name=story&gt;[http://theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSA05107 The Glasgow Story]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a major benefactor to the Glasgow Scout Association and was chairman of [[Dumbarton Football Club]]. 
It was alleged by a [[Five (TV)|Channel 5]] documentary that Fraser put up the money for an attempted abduction of [[Ronnie Biggs]] from Brazil, so the latter could stand trial in Britain for his part in the [[Great train robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madfrankiefraser.co.uk/viewpoints/views47.htm|title=Channel 5 scores a bulls-eye|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717071150/http://www.madfrankiefraser.co.uk/viewpoints/views47.htm|archivedate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Unidad de Fomento''' ('''UF''') is a [[Unit of account]] that is used in [[Chile]].  The exchange rate between the UF and the [[Chilean peso]] is constantly adjusted for inflation so that the value of the Unidad de Fomento remains almost constant on a daily basis during low inflation.

It was created on 20 January 1967, for the use in determining principal  (monetary item) and interest (constant real value non-monetary item) in international secured loans (monetary items) for development, subject to revaluation according to the variations of inflation. Afterwards it was extended to all types of bank loans (monetary items), private or special financing (monetary items), purchases (trade debtors/trade creditors being constant real value non-monetary items) or investments on installments, contracts (constant real value non-monetary items), and some special situations. Also it is used in legal standards such as the par value of stock/capitalization (constant real value non-monetary items) of companies, fines (payables being constant real value non-monetary items), etc. 

It has become the preferred and predominant measure to determine the cost of Real Estate (variable items valued at Historical Cost being updated), values of housing (historical variable real value non-monetary items being updated) and any secured loan (monetary item), either private or of the Chilean government. Individual payments are made in [[Chilean peso]]s (the country's [[legal tender]]), according to the daily value of the UF.

For historical and current values of the Chilean '''Unidad de Fomento''' ('''UF'''), see government's [http://si3.bcentral.cl/Siete/secure/cuadros/arboles.aspx Central Bank of Chile].

A similar currency unit for use generally in payment of taxes, fines, or customs duty is the [[Unidad Tributaria Mensual]] (UTM) (literally: monthly tax unit).

==UF's calculation over time==

From its creation in 1967, each calendar quarter, the UF value of 100 [[Chilean escudo]] would be quoted based on the [[Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) of the past three months, which would be the official rate for the following quarter. In October 1975 with the currency changeover to pesos, the value of 1 UF was quoted in pesos and readjusted monthly. In July 1977 it was calculated daily by interpolation between the 10th of each month and the 9th of the following month, according to the monthly variation of the CPI. Since 1990 the [[Central Bank of Chile]] has determined its value. The values of the CPI are officially kept by the Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas de Chile (National Statistics Institute of Chile).

For historical and current values of the Chilean CPI (abbreviated as IPC in Spanish), see [http://si3.bcentral.cl/Siete/secure/cuadros/arboles.aspx Banco Central de Chile Statistics Database]

'''Valter Mainetti''' (Rome, 28 October 1947) is an Italian entrepreneur,  major shareholder of [[Sorgente Group]] Alternative Investment (US).

== Biography ==

He graduated in 1973 in [[Political Science]] at the [[Sapienza University]] in [[Rome]], with [[Aldo Moro]] as his thesis supervisor.

In the [[mid-seventies]] he began working in the family businesses, in activity since the beginning of the 1900s in Italy and the United States, operating within the industry of iron construction and [[real estate]]. His maternal grandfather, Luigi Binda, had in fact founded a company in [[New York City]] in 1919 specialized in the assembly of iron structures (amongst the work carried out there are also the [[Chrysler Building]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valtermainetti.com/uploads/Real_Estate2010.pdf ''Valter Mainetti - immobiliaristi si diventa con la tenacia''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134057/http://www.valtermainetti.com/uploads/Real_Estate2010.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}, intervista di Laura Lepri per RE Real Estate, dicembre 2010, pag. 109-117&lt;/ref&gt; and the expansion of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]). Even his paternal family’s company had been involved, since 1910,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.affaritaliani.it/fattieconti/sorgente-group-2-mln-mq-complessivi190214.html Sorgente Group, 2 mln mq complessiviPatrimonio immobiliare in espansione - Affaritaliani.it]&lt;/ref&gt; in the realization of works in iron, and then following [[World War II]] began building mechanical and industrial plants, such as the [[Sincrotrone in Frascati]], the [[Alfa Romeo]] in Arese, the [[Steelworks in Terni]] and Taranto.

In 1987 he assumed the leadership of SAGEFIM Partecipazioni Spa, the parent company of the real estate business. The company's activities had gradually been oriented towards social housing.

In 1999, with the introduction in Italy of the law on real estate funds, he completely restructured the businesses both in Italy and in the US under the brand [[Sorgente Group]], which he conceived, directing the activities towards real estate finance &lt;ref&gt;[http://economia.panorama.it/sorgente-group-valter-mainetti-palazzo-chigi Sorgente Group vuole Palazzo Chigi - Panorama]&lt;/ref&gt; and the acquisition of iconic buildings.

As CEO of Sorgente Sgr, in 2001 he launched the first real estate fund, "Michelangelo",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soldionline.it/notizie/azioni-italia/comunicato-stampa-fondi-immobiliari-michelangelo-valorizza-le-quote-a-108-818-euro Comunicato stampa - Fondi immobiliari: Michelangelo valorizza le quote a 108.818 euro]&lt;/ref&gt; intended for institutional investors, with portfolio investments in prestigious real estate such as the [[Chrysler Building]] and [[Flatiron Building]] in [[New York City]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casa24.ilsole24ore.com/art/mondo-immobiliare/2012-01-11/intervista-valter-mainetti-sorgente-164220.php?uuid=AazgwrcE&amp;fromSearch Intervista a Valter Mainetti, a.d. di Sorgente Group: «A New York abbiamo il Flat Iron e ora puntiamo all'Empire State Building»]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Through the funds managed by Sorgente Group, in 2004 Palazzo del Tritone in Rome was acquired. It is now the headquarters of Sorgente Group, hosting on the ground floor the Tritone Exhibition Space &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.060608.it/it/cultura-e-svago/beni-culturali/sedi-espositive/spazio-espositivo-tritone-della-fondazione-sorgente-group.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
In 2006 the Palazzo la Rinascente in Piazza Fiume (Rome) was also acquired. This is the only building designed in Rome by [[Franco Albini]], a modern-style work in the historical style of the Capital. 
The purchase of the Fine Arts Building in Los Angeles dates back to 2013, while the Clock Tower of Santa Monica to 2012. In 2014 a building was acquired in Lungotevere Aventino 4, 5, 6 in Rome, where now locates the headquarters of the Fondazione Sorgente Group. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.agi.it/cronaca/la_polizia_che_non_taspetti_nelle_foto_di_massimo_sestini-1152199/news/2016-10-10/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Today he is the major shareholder of Sorgente Group Alternative Investment (US) that includes Sorgente Group SpA (Italia), Sorgente Group of America (US), Sorgente Lux Holding Sarl (Luxembourg) and Holding Star (UK). The Group operates in the finance, real estate, investment management, infrastructures,  restoration works, hotels and clinics, communications and publishing.

By means of a subsidiary called 'Musa Comunicazione', the Group also holds 100% shares of the newspaper ‘Il Foglio Quotidiano’ and 40% shares of ‘Tempi’.

Sorgente Group manages an asset of more than €5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asca.it/news-Immobiliare__Sorgente_Group_arriva_a_un_patrimonio_di_2_milioni_di_mq-1365414-ECO.html Immobiliare: Sorgente Group arriva a un patrimonio di 2 milioni di mq - ASCA.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013 he was honored in Italy with the title “[[Cavaliere del Lavoro]]” for the Real Estate and Finance Industry sector; is the first time that an entrepreneur operating within real estate finance receives the Cavalierato title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asca.it/news-Cavalieri_Lavoro__Mainetti_1*_insignito_settore_finanziario_immobiliare-1283683.html Cavalieri Lavoro: Mainetti 1* insignito settore finanziario-immobiliare - ASCA.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, 18 regional Fedecámaras chapters complete the organisation. Fedecámaras represents small, medium and large-size companies. 

Fedecámaras’ mission is to strengthen Venezuela’s business system on the base of the principles of democracy and economic liberty. In practice this means acting as a concerting organism of Venezuela’s main policies (investment, development, employment, inflation, wages, interest rates, among other policy sectors) together with the government and other unions operating in the country. Its principal values are liberty, democracy, private property, professionalism and leadership.

This organization was at political odds with former Venezuelan [[President of Venezuela|President]] [[Hugo Chávez]]. During a failed [[coup d'état]] against him in April 2002, former Fedecámaras president [[Pedro Carmona]] assumed the role of interim [[de facto]] president of Venezuela for two days.

==Background==
Founded in 1944, '''Fedecámaras''' was formed with the main objective of protecting the free enterprise, by promoting the development and diversification of the country within a regulatory system that guarantees the rights of all individuals, and by defending its members and affiliates.

==President and leadership==
The current leadership for the 2017-2019 period is the following: Carlos Larrazábal Gonzalez is the President; Ricardo Cusanno is the first vice-president, Pedro Rivas is the second vice-president and Fernando Cepeda is the Treasurer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fedecamaras.org.ve/quienes-somos/directiva/|title=DIRECTIVA {{!}} Fedecamaras|work=Fedecamaras|access-date=2017-10-02|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
