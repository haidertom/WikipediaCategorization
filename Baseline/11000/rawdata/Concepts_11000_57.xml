[[File:Internal adapter circuit.jpg|thumb|Internal adapter circuitry]]

An '''AC adapter''', '''AC/DC adapter''', or '''AC/DC converter'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Richard M.L.|title=U.S. Patent 5245220|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=dTcgAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=5245220|work=USPTO|publisher=Google Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of external [[power supply]], often enclosed in a case similar to an [[AC power plugs and sockets|AC plug]]. Other common names include '''plug pack''', '''plug-in adapter''', '''adapter block''', '''domestic mains adapter''', '''line power adapter''', '''wall wart''', '''power brick''', and '''power adapter'''. Adapters for battery-powered equipment may be described as '''chargers''' or '''rechargers''' (see also [[battery charger]]).  AC adapters are used with electrical devices that require power but do not contain internal components to derive the required voltage and power from [[Mains electricity|mains power]].  The internal circuitry of an external power supply is very similar to the design that would be used for a built-in or internal supply.

External power supplies are used both with equipment with no other source of power and with [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered equipment, where the supply, when plugged in, can sometimes charge the battery in addition to powering the equipment.

Use of an external power supply allows portability of equipment powered either by mains or battery without the added bulk of internal power components, and makes it unnecessary to produce equipment for use only with a specified power source; the same device can be powered from 120&amp;nbsp;VAC or 230&amp;nbsp;VAC mains, vehicle or aircraft battery by using a different adapter. Another advantage of these designs can be increased safety; since the hazardous 120 or 240&amp;nbsp;volt [[mains power]] is transformed to a lower, safer voltage at the wall outlet and the appliance that is handled by the user is powered by this lower voltage.

==Modes of operation==
[[Image:Wall wart opened.JPG|thumb|An AC adapter disassembled to reveal a simple, unregulated linear DC supply circuit: a transformer, four diodes in a [[diode bridge|bridge rectifier]], and an [[electrolytic capacitor]] to smooth the waveform]]

Originally, most AC/DC adapters were [[Power supply|linear power supplies]], containing a [[transformer]] to convert the [[mains electricity]] voltage to a lower voltage, a [[rectifier]] to convert it to [[Pulsating direct current|pulsating DC]], and a filter to smooth the pulsating waveform to DC, with residual [[ripple (electrical)|ripple]] variations small enough to leave the powered device unaffected. Size and weight of the device was largely determined by the transformer, which in turn was determined by the power output and [[utility frequency|mains frequency]]. Ratings over a few watts made the devices too large and heavy to be physically supported by a wall outlet. The output voltage of these adapters varied with load; for equipment requiring a more stable voltage, [[linear circuit|linear]] [[voltage regulator]] circuitry was added. Losses in the transformer and the linear regulator were considerable; efficiency was relatively low, and significant power dissipated as heat even when not driving a load.

Early in the twenty-first century, [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] (SMPSs) became almost ubiquitous for this purpose. Mains voltage is rectified to a high direct voltage driving a switching circuit, which contains a transformer operating at a high frequency and outputs direct current at the desired voltage. The high-frequency ripple is more easily filtered out than mains-frequency. The high frequency allows the transformer to be small, which reduces its losses; and the switching regulator can be much more efficient than a linear regulator. The result is a much more efficient, smaller, and lighter device. Safety is ensured, as in the older linear circuit, because a transformer still provides [[galvanic isolation]].

A linear circuit must be designed for a specific, narrow range of input voltages (e.g., 220–240&amp;nbsp;VAC) and must use a transformer appropriate for the frequency (usually 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz), but a switched-mode supply can work efficiently over a very wide range of voltages and frequencies; a single 100–240&amp;nbsp;VAC unit will handle almost any mains supply in the world.

However, unless very carefully designed and using suitable components, switching adapters are more likely to fail than the older type, due in part to complex circuitry and the use of semiconductors.  Unless designed well, these adapters may be easily damaged by overloads, even [[transient (oscillation)|transient]] ones, which can come from [[lightning]], brief mains overvoltage (sometimes caused by an [[incandescent light]] on the same power circuit failing), component degradation, etc.  A very common mode of failure is due to the use of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s whose [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) increases with age; switching regulators are very sensitive to high ESR (the older linear circuit also used electrolytic capacitors, but the effect of degradation is much less dramatic). Well-designed circuits pay attention to the ESR, ripple current rating, pulse operation, and temperature rating of capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.your-book.co.uk/cap/esr.htm Article on capacitor ESR and its effects]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
External AC adapters are widely used to power small or portable electronic devices.  The advantages include:

* Safety – External power adapters can free product designers from worrying about some safety issues. Much of this style of equipment uses only voltages low enough not to be a [[safety hazard]] internally, although the power supply must out of necessity use dangerous mains voltage. If an external power supply is used (usually via a [[coaxial power connector|power connector, often of coaxial type]]), the equipment need not be designed with concern for hazardous voltages inside the enclosure. This is particularly relevant for equipment with lightweight cases which may break and expose internal electrical parts.
* Heat reduction – Heat reduces reliability and longevity of electronic components, and can cause sensitive circuits to become inaccurate or malfunction.  A separate power supply removes a source of heat from the apparatus.
* Electrical noise reduction – Because radiated electrical noise falls off with the square of the distance, it is to the manufacturer's advantage to convert potentially noisy AC line power or automotive power to "clean", filtered DC in an external adapter, at a safe distance from noise-sensitive circuitry.
* Weight and size reduction – Removing power components and the mains connection plug from equipment powered by rechargeable batteries reduces the weight and size which must be carried.
* Ease of replacement – Power supplies are more prone to failure than other circuitry due to their exposure to power spikes and their internal generation of [[waste heat]].  External power supplies can be replaced quickly by a user without the need to have the powered device repaired.
[[File:Steckernetzteil mit Adaptern IMGP2309 smial wp.jpg|thumb|AC adapter supporting four different AC plug systems]]
* Configuration versatility – Externally powered electronic products can be used with different power sources as needed (e.g. 120 VAC, 240 VAC, 12 VDC, or external battery pack), for convenient use in the field, or when traveling.
* Simplified product inventory, distribution, and certification – An electronic product that is sold and used internationally must be powered from a wide range of power sources, and must meet product safety regulations in many jurisdictions, usually requiring expensive certification by national or regional [[Safety standards|safety agencies]] such as [[Underwriters Laboratories]] or [[Technischer Überwachungsverein]]. A single version of a device may be used in many markets, with the different power requirements met by different external power supplies, so that only one version of the device need be manufactured, stocked, and tested. If the design of the device is modified over time (a frequent occurrence), the power supply design itself need not be retested (and vice versa).
*Constant voltage is produced by a specific type of adapter used for [[computers]] and [[laptops]]. These types of adapters are commonly known as eliminators.

==Problems==
[[File:Notebook-Computer-AC-Adapter.jpg|thumb|250px|"Power brick" in-line configuration, with [[IEC 60320|detachable AC cord]]]]
Problems with this type of power supply include, but are not limited to:

* Size – Power supplies which plug into the mains directly without using a plug on a cable (true wall warts) are bulkier than bare plugs; sometimes they are too large to plug into power sockets with restricted space, or into adjacent sockets on [[power strip]]s (due to the fact that they can block other plugs also).
* Weight – Some AC adapters can be heavy, exerting excess weight on the power socket (this depends on the socket design of the country in question). Some external power supplies are "power bricks" (also known as "line lumps") having a short AC cord so they can lie on the floor, thus relieving strain, at the expense of clutter. Other wall-hanging types are made long and thin, minimizing the leverage of their weight vector that pulls the plug out, but exacerbating the size problem. The weight for equipment that must be carried (e.g. for traveling) is not a disadvantage of external supplies, as the alternative is an equally heavy internal supply; but in many cases a single universal supply could replace several proprietary ones.
* Inefficiency – Some idling power is wasted as the power supply is left running when the equipment power switch is off or the equipment is disconnected from the power supply. In recent years, it has become common for equipment with internal supplies to share this problem due to the use of a "soft" power switch.
* Confusion – External power supplies are often generic and not clearly marked to identify the equipment they are designed to power. It is very easy to separate power supply and equipment, and can be difficult to re-match the many devices with their power supplies.
* Compatibility problems – There is no standardization of connectors; the same connector is often used for different voltages, and for both DC supplies and AC-to-AC transformers. Incompatible voltage or polarity may be present on physically interchangeable connectors. This easily leads to using the wrong power supply, which can destroy equipment.

A survey of consumers showed widespread dissatisfaction with the cost, inconvenience, and wastefulness of the profusion of power adapters used by electronic devices.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison|first=David|title=Survey Finds Consumers Grow Weary of Wall Warts|url=http://powerelectronics.com/power_systems/news/consumer-survey-wall-warts-0528/|work=Power Electronics Technology|publisher=Penton Media, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715111227/http://powerelectronics.com/power_systems/news/consumer-survey-wall-warts-0528/| archivedate= 15 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science fiction]] author and [[satirist]] [[Douglas Adams]] wrote an essay bemoaning the profusion and confusion of power adapters, and calling for more standardization.&lt;ref name=DouglasAdams&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Douglas|title=Dongly things|url=http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/980707-03-a.html|work=douglasadams.com|publisher=The Digital Village, Ltd.|accessdate=2011-06-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611092241/http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/980707-03-a.html| archivedate= 11 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dangerous and unreliable adapters===
Manufacturers of equipment supplied with AC adapters often supply replacements at high prices; this has encouraged the manufacture of compatible third-party [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] replacements, which may be of satisfactory quality and performance at significantly lower prices. However, some adapters, usually at very low prices, and sometimes with unknown brands or sometimes fraudulently marked with the name of a reputable manufacturer, have various deficiencies which can cause inadequate performance (e.g. poor regulation and ripple, maximum power capacity lower than specified, hot running), unreliability (e.g. overheating to temperatures exceeding component ratings), and electrical or fire danger to users (e.g. insulation which frays with wear, lack of fuse).&lt;ref name="bucks"&gt;[https://www.powerbanktalk.com/why-using-poor-quality-ac-adapters-is-hazards/ Buckinghamshire Trading Standards: What’s in your socket?, 2008.] Detailed article on hazards found due to poor-quality AC adapters. "The good news for the consumer is that there appears to be a cheap charger for any make or model of mobile phone, toy or hand-held games consoles that you might require{{snd}} the bad news is that it could kill you!"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/acadapter.html The perils of cheap AC Adapters]: article with detailed photographs of counterfeit Dell adapter not fused and running at 133&amp;nbsp;°C at rated current after 30 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialgadgets.co.uk/blog/how-choose-safe-replacement-laptop-charger/ How to Choose a Safe Replacement Laptop Charger]: article analysing a fake charger sold on an auction site and noting the story of a child getting burned by a poor quality Dell laptop charger in 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurious marks of conformity to standards may be present; in one case it was reported that "Chinese manufacturers were submitting well-engineered electrical products to obtain conformity testing reports, but then removing non-essential components in production to reduce costs".&lt;ref name=bucks/&gt; A test of 27 chargers found that all the eight legitimately branded with a reputable name met safety standards, but none of those unbranded or with minor names did, despite bearing the [[File:Conformité Européenne (logo).svg|16px|alt=CЄ]] [[CE marking|mark of conformity]].&lt;ref name=bucks/&gt;

==Efficiency (historical)==
[[Image:Steckernetzteile.jpg|thumb|250px|Millions of still-usable AC power adapters are thrown out annually, because of poor or unknown compatibility with new equipment.]]
The issue of inefficiency of some power supplies has become well known, with U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] referring in 2001 to such devices as "Energy Vampires".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,87100,00.asp Bush Takes Aim at "Wall Warts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113123837/http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0%2C1697%2C87100%2C00.asp |date=2007-11-13 }}{{snd}} Extreme Tech article&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation is being enacted in the EU and a number of U.S. states, to reduce the level of energy wasted by some of these devices. Such initiatives include [[standby power]] and the [[One Watt Initiative]].

But others {{who|date=November 2017}} have argued that these inefficient devices are low powered, e.g., devices that are used for small [[battery charger]]s, so even if they have a low efficiency, the amount of energy they waste is less than 1% of household consumption of electric energy.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Considering the total efficiency of power supplies for small electronic equipment, the older mains-frequency linear transformer-based power supply was found in a 2002 report to have efficiencies from 20–75%, and have considerable energy loss even when powered up but not supplying power. [[switched-mode power supply|Switched-mode power supplies]] (SMPSs) are much more efficient; a good design can be 80–90% efficient, and is also much smaller and lighter. In 2002 most external plug-in "wall wart" power adapters commonly used for low-power [[consumer electronics]] devices were of linear design, as well as supplies built into some equipment.

External supplies are usually left plugged in even when not in use, and consume from a few watts to 35 watts of power in that state. The report concluded that about 32 billion [[kilowatt-hours]] (kWh) per year, about 1% of total electrical energy consumption, could be saved in the United States by replacing all linear power supplies (average efficiency 40–50%) with advanced switching designs (efficiency 80–90%), by replacing older switching supplies (efficiencies of less than 70%) with advanced designs (efficiency of at least 80%), and by reducing standby consumption of supplies to not more than 1 watt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/app2.pdf Calwell, Chris and Travis Reeder (2002), ''Power Supplies: A Hidden Opportunity for Energy Savings''], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], pp. 4–9. Retrieved 2010-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the report was published, SMPSs have indeed replaced linear supplies to a great extent, even in wall warts. The 2002 report estimated that 6% of electrical energy used in the U.S. "flows through" power supplies (not counting only the wall warts).  The website where the report was published said in 2010 that despite the spread of SMPSs, "today's power supplies consume at least 2% of all U.S. electricity production. More efficient power supply designs could cut that usage in half".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efficientpowersupplies.org/ Efficiency of Power Supplies in the Active Mode]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since wasted electrical energy is released as [[heat]], an inefficient power supply is hot to the touch, as is one that wastes power without an electrical load. This waste heat is itself a problem in warm weather, since it may require additional air conditioning to prevent overheating, and even to remove the unwanted heat from large supplies.

==Reuse==
AC adapters are often reused on other appliances, but there are five parameters which all must suit the appliance:

* [[Voltage]]
* [[Electric current|Current]] capacity
* [[Polarity symbols|Polarity]] (not relevant with [[AC power|AC]])
* [[Voltage regulation]] (or stabilization)
* Connector type

==Universal power adapters==
{{See also|DC connector|Coaxial power connector}}

[[Image:Dcxconnector.jpg|thumb|250px|A six-way connector on a "universal" DC power supply, consisting of a four-way X connector and two separate individual connectors (one is the [[nine-volt battery]] connector). The X-connector here provides 3.5 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|phone plugs]] and two sizes of coaxial power connector]]

''External'' power adapters can fail, and can become separated from the product they are intended to power. Consequently, there is a market for replacement adapters. The replacement must match input and output voltages, match or exceed current capability, and be fitted with a matching connector.  Many electrical products are poorly labeled with information concerning the power supply they require, so it is prudent to record the specifications of the original power supply in advance, to ease replacement if the original is later lost.  Careful labeling of power adapters can also reduce the likelihood of a mixup which could cause equipment damage.

Some "universal" replacement power supplies allow output voltage and polarity to be switched to match a range of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://computertimes.com/may06edchoiceiGoeverywhere130.htm Computer Times: 2006 review of a satisfactory third-party universal AC adapter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013005435/http://computertimes.com/may06edchoiceiGoeverywhere130.htm |date=2014-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of switch-mode supplies, adapters which can work with any voltage from 110&amp;nbsp;VAC to 240&amp;nbsp;VAC became widely available; previously either 100–120&amp;nbsp;VAC or 200–240&amp;nbsp;VAC versions were used. Adapters which can also be used with motor vehicle and aircraft power ''(see [[EmPower (aircraft power adapter)|EmPower]])'' are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/laptop-universal-power-adapter,2852.html |work=Tom's Hardware |title=Universal Laptop Power Adapters For The Air, Road, And Wall |date=September 2, 2011 |author=Andrew Ku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four-way '''X connectors''' or six-way '''star connectors''', also known as '''spider connectors''', with multiple plug sizes and types are common on generic power supplies. Other replacement power supplies have arrangements for changing the power connector, with four to nine different alternatives available when purchased in a set. [[RadioShack]] sells universal AC adapters of various capacities, branded as "Enercell Adaptaplug", and fitted with two-pin female sockets compatible with their [[Adaptaplug]] connector lineup.  This allows many different configurations of AC adapters to be put together, without requiring soldering.  Philmore and other competing brands offer similar AC adapters with interchangeable connectors.

The label on a power supply may not be a reliable guide to the actual voltage it supplies under varying conditions.  Many low-cost power supplies are "[[Voltage regulator|unregulated]]", in that their voltage can change considerably with load.  If they are lightly loaded, they may put out much more than the nominal "name plate" voltage, which could damage the load. If they are heavily loaded, the output voltage may [[Voltage droop|droop]] appreciably, in some cases well below the nominal label voltage even within the nominal rated current, causing the equipment being supplied to malfunction or be damaged. Supplies with linear (as against switched) regulators are heavy, bulky, and expensive.

Modern [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] (SMPSs) are smaller, lighter, and more efficient. They put out a much more constant voltage than unregulated supplies as the input voltage and the load current vary. When introduced, their prices were high, but by the early 21st century the prices of switch-mode components had dropped to a degree which allowed even cheap supplies to use this technology, saving the cost of a larger and heavier mains-frequency transformer.

===Auto-sensing adapters===
Some universal adapters automatically set their output voltage and maximum current according to which of a range of interchangeable tips is fitted; tips are available to fit and supply appropriate power to many notebook computers and mobile devices. Different tips may use the same connector, but automatically supply different power; it is essential to use the right tip for the apparatus being powered, but no switch needs to be set correctly by the user.  The advent of switch-mode power supplies has allowed adapters to work from any AC mains supply from 100 to 240 V with an appropriate plug; operation from standard 12 V&amp;nbsp;DC vehicle and aircraft supplies can also be supported. With the appropriate adapter, accessories, and tips, a variety of equipment can be powered from almost any source of power.

A "Green Plug" system has been proposed, based on [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] technology, by which the consuming device would tell the external power supply what kind of power is needed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2008/05/10/swtched-on-green-plug-tries-to-replace-the-worry-warts-part-1/ Green Plug tries to replace the worry warts] Engadget May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of USB==
{{See also|Universal Serial Bus#Power}}
[[File:USB AC Adapters.JPG|thumb|269x269px|Common sizes of USB AC adapters]]

The [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connector (and voltage) has emerged as a de facto standard in low-power AC adapters for many portable devices.  In addition to serial [[digital data]] exchange, the USB standard also provides {{nowrap|5 VDC power}}, up to {{nowrap|500 mA}} ({{nowrap|900 mA}} over USB 3.0).  Numerous accessory gadgets ("[[USB decoration]]s") were designed to connect to USB only for DC power and not for data interchange.  The [[USB Implementers Forum]] in March, 2007 released the USB Battery Charging Specification which defines, "...limits as well as detection, control and reporting mechanisms to permit devices to draw current in excess of the USB 2.0 specification for charging ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usb.org/press/pressroom/2007_04_17_usbif3.pdf|title=USB-IF Enhances Battery Charging Capabilities with New Spec.|format=PDF |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Electric fans, lamps, alarms, coffee warmers, battery chargers, and even toys have been designed to tap power from a USB connector.  Plug-in adapters equipped with USB receptacles are widely available to convert {{nowrap|120 VAC}} or {{nowrap|240 VAC}} power or {{nowrap|12 VDC}} automotive power to {{nowrap|5 VDC}} USB power (see photo at right).

The trend towards more-compact electronic devices has driven a shift towards the [[micro-USB]] and [[mini-USB]] connectors, which are electrically compatible in function to the original USB connector but physically smaller.  

In 2012, a [[USB Power Delivery Specification]] was proposed to standardize delivery of up to 100 watts, suitable for devices such as [[laptop computer]]s that usually depend on proprietary adapters.

==Standards==
In 2009, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) announced support of the [[Open Mobile Terminal Platform]]'s (OMTP) "Common Charging and Local Data Connectivity" standard.&lt;ref&gt;OMTP: Common Charging and Local Data Connectivity ([http://www.gsmworld.com/documents/OMTP_CCLDC_v1_1_Final.pdf link]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}), 2009-02-11&lt;/ref&gt;  The ITU published Recommendation ITU-T L.1000, "Universal power adapter and charger solution for mobile terminals and other hand-held ICT devices",  which specifies a charger similar in most respects to that of the GSMA/OMTP proposal and to the European [[Common External Power Supply]]. The ITU recommendation was expanded and updated in June, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/recommendations/rec.aspx?rec=11348 |title=Universal power adapter and charger solution for mobile terminals and other hand-held ICT devices|publisher=International Telecommunications Union |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hope is to markedly reduce the profusion of non-interchangeable power adapters.

The [[European Union]] defined a [[Common External Power Supply]] for "hand-held data-enabled mobile phones" ([[smartphones]]) sold from 2010, intended to replace the many incompatible proprietary power supplies and eliminate waste by reducing the total number of supplies manufactured. Conformant supplies deliver 5&amp;nbsp;VDC via a micro-USB connector, with preferred input voltage handled ranging from 90 to 264&amp;nbsp;VAC.

In 2006 [[Larry Page]], a founder of [[Google]], proposed a {{nowrap|12 V}} and up to {{nowrap|15 A}} standard for almost all equipment requiring an external converter, with new buildings fitted with {{nowrap|12 VDC}} wiring, making external AC-to-DC adapter circuitry unnecessary.&lt;ref name="GooglePower"&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=Google to Push for More Electrical Efficiency in PC’s|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/technology/26google.html|accessdate=2011-06-03|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GooglePCPower"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alter|first=Lloyd|title=Google Pushes for PC Electrical Efficiency; Side Effect: No More Wall-Warts|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/09/google_pushes_f.php|work=treehugger.com|publisher=Discovery Communications, Ltd.|accessdate=2011-06-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717095723/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/09/google_pushes_f.php| archivedate= 17 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''affect heuristic''' is a  [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristic]], a mental shortcut that allows people to make decisions and solve problems quickly and efficiently, in which current [[emotion]]—[[fear]], [[pleasure]], [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]], etc.—influences decisions. In other words, it is a type of heuristic in which emotional response, or "[[Affect (psychology)|affect]]" in psychological terms, plays a lead role.  It is a subconscious process that shortens the decision-making process and allows people to function without having to complete an extensive search for information. It is shorter in duration than a [[Emotional mood|mood]], occurring rapidly and involuntarily in response to a [[Stimulation|stimulus]]. Reading the words "lung cancer" usually generates an affect of [[dread (fear)|dread]], while reading the words "mother's love" usually generates a feeling of [[affection]] and comfort.  The affect heuristic is typically used while judging the risks and benefits of something, depending on the positive or negative feelings that people associate with a stimulus. It is the equivalent of "going with your gut". If their feelings towards an activity are positive, then people are more likely to judge the risks as low and the benefits high. On the other hand, if their feelings towards an activity are negative, they are more likely to perceive the risks as high and benefits low.&lt;ref name=finucanearticle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finucane|first=M.L.|author2=Alhakami, A.|author3=Slovic, P.|author4=Johnson, S.M.|title=The Affect Heuristic in Judgment of Risks and Benefits|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=January 2000|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(200001/03)13:1&lt;1::AID-BDM333&gt;3.0.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The [[theory]] of affect heuristic is that a human being's affect can influence how he or she makes decisions. Research has shown that risk and benefits are negatively correlated in people's minds. This was found after researchers found that the inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit of an activity was linked to the strength of positive or negative affect associated with the activity as measured by rating the activity on bipolar scales (e.g. good/bad). This implies that people base their judgements of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it, but also on how they feel about it.  The affect heuristic gained early attention in 1980 when Robert B. Zajonc argued that affective reactions to stimuli are often the first reaction which occur automatically and subsequently influencing the way in which we process and judge information.&lt;ref name=zajoncarticle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=R. B.|title=Feeling and thinking: Preferences need no inferences|journal=American Psychologist|date=February 1980|volume=35|issue=2|pages=151–175|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.35.2.151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affect heuristic received more recent attention when it was used to explain the unexpected negative correlation between benefit and [[risk perception]]. Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic and Johnson theorized in 2000 that a good feeling towards a situation (i.e., positive affect) would lead to a lower risk perception and a higher benefit perception, even when this is logically not warranted for that situation.&lt;ref name=finucanearticle/&gt; This implies that a strong emotional response to a word or other stimulus might alter a person's [[judgment]]. He or she might make different decisions based on the same set of facts and might thus make an [[illogical]] decision. Overall, the affect heuristic is of influence in nearly every decision-making arena.

===Theoretical accounts of affect===
An alternative thought to the “gut feeling” response is [[Antonio Damasio]]'s [[somatic marker hypothesis]]. It is the opinion that thought is made largely from images which include perceptual and symbolic representations. These images then become “marked” by positive or negative feelings linked directly or indirectly to somatic states. When a negative somatic marker is linked to an image of a future outcome, it sounds an alarm in the brain. When a positive marker is linked to an image, it becomes a signal of incentive. He hypothesized that somatic markers increase the accuracy of the decision process and the absence of these markers, mostly seen in people with certain types of brain damage, degrades the ability to make good decisions. This hypothesis arose when observing patients with damage to their prefrontal cortex who had severe impairments in personal and social decision-making despite their other abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damasio|first=A.R.|title=The Somatic Marker Hypothesis and the Possible Functions of the Prefrontal Cortex|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=October 1996|volume=351|issue=1346|pages=1413–1420|doi=10.1098/rstb.1996.0125|pmid=8941953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought and feeling==
It has been argued by researchers that people use affect heuristics as a first response to an issue, they rely on spontaneous affective reactions which make it more efficient than having to research and analyze external information. Slovic, Finucane, Peters and MacGregor (2005) contrast two modes of thinking: the analytic system and the experiential system.&lt;ref name=finucanearticle/&gt;&lt;ref name=macgregorarticle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slovic|first=P|author2=Finucane, M.|author3=Peters, E.|author4=MacGregor, D.|title=Risk as Analysis and Risk as Feelings: Some Thoughts about Affect, Reason, Risk, and Rationality|journal=Risk Analysis|volume=24|issue=2|pages=311–322|date=13 April 2004|doi=10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00433.x|pmid=15078302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analytic system, also referred to as the rational system, is thought that is considered to be slow and requires effort; it requires consciousness, probabilities, logical reasoning, and substantial evidence. The experiential system is the exact opposite. It is intuitive and mostly automatic which makes it more convenient for people because it does not require effort or consciousness. It relies on images, metaphors, and narratives which are then used to estimate the probability of a hazard.&lt;ref name=kellerarticle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Carmen|author2=Siegrist, Michael|author3=Gutscher, Heinz|title=The Role of Affect and Availability Heuristics in Risk Analysis|journal=Risk Analysis|date=June 2006|volume=26|issue=3|pages=631–639|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2006.00773.x|pmid=16834623}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the experience of affect, in other words, a “gut feeling.” Affective reactions that accompany judgements are not necessarily voluntary, but are automatic responses. Zajonc states that “one might be able to control the expression of emotion, but not the experience of it itself.”  However, he also clarifies that feelings are not free of thought and that thoughts are not free of feeling.&lt;ref name=zajoncarticle/&gt; The experiential system also takes past experiences into account. In other words, if a person has already experienced a certain issue, he or she is more likely to take more precautions towards the issue.

==Experimental findings==
Many studies have been done to further look into affect heuristics and many have found that these heuristics shape our attitudes and opinions towards our decisions, especially risk perception. These studies demonstrate how affect is an important characteristic of the decision-making process in many different domains and aspects as well as how it can lead to a strong conditioner of preference. As demonstrated below, affect is independent of cognition which indicate that there are conditions where affect does not require cognition.

===Subliminal affective response===
The cause of affect does not necessarily have to be consciously perceived. A study conducted by Winkielman, Zajonc and Schwarz (1997) demonstrated the speed at which an affective reaction can influence judgements. To do this they used a subliminal priming paradigm where participants were "primed" through exposure to either a smiling face, a frowning face, or a neutral polygon presented at about {{frac|1|250}}  of a second. This was considered an amount of time where the nature of the stimuli could not be recalled. Participants were then exposed to an ideograph (e.g. a Chinese character) for two seconds and asked to rate the ideograph on a scale of liking. Researchers found that participants preferred the ideograph preceded with a smiling face as opposed to those preceded by a frowning face or neutral polygon despite the fact that the smiling face was only shown for {{frac|1|250}} of a second.

The same experiment demonstrated the persistence of initial affect. During a second session, participations were primed with the same characters, but these characters were preceded by a different face that they were not previously exposed to (e.g. those previously exposed to the smiling face were now exposed to the neutral polygon). Participants continued to show preference for the characters based on the first association, even though the second exposure was preceded by a different affective stimulus.  In other words, the second priming was ineffective because the effects of the first priming still remained. If the participant liked a character following exposure to a smiling face, they would continue to like the character even when it was preceded by a frowning face during the second exposure. (The experimental outcome was statistically significant and adjusted for variables such as non-affective preference for certain characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winkielman|first=P|author2=Zajonc, R.B.|author3=Schwarz, N.|title=Subliminal affective priming effects resists attributional interventions|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=1997|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–465|doi=10.1080/026999397379872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insensitivity to numbers===
Sometimes affective responses to certain stimuli are a result of a lack of sensitivity to other factors, for example, numbers. Slovic and Peters (2006) did a study on psychophysical numbing, the inability to discriminate change in a physical stimulus as the magnitude of the stimulus increases, and found that students more strongly supported an airport-safety measure that was expected to save a  high percentage of 150 lives at risk as opposed to a measure that was expected to save 150 lives. This is thought to have occurred because although saving 150 lives is good, it is somewhat harder to comprehend and thus the decision comes from the positive feeling associated with the higher percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slovic|first=P|author2=Peters, E.|title=Risk Perception and Affect|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2006|volume=15|issue=6|pages=322–325|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00461.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of time===
Research has been conducted in the influence that time plays in decision-making. In two experiments, Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic and Johnson (2000) studied the affect heuristic under time pressure and the influence that providing risk and benefit information has on the affect heuristic. The researchers compared individuals under no time pressure and those with time pressure. They predicted that individuals under time pressure would rely more heavily on their affect in order to be more efficient in their responses whereas those under no time pressure would use more logic in their decision-making. To do this, university students were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions (time pressure or no time pressure) and one of the two counterbalancing orders (risk judgements followed by benefit judgements or vice versa). They were then given a task in which they had to make judgements about the risk or benefit of certain activities and technologies. As predicted, individuals in the time-pressure condition took less time to make risk judgements than did individuals in the no time pressure condition. In the second experiment, students again had to make judgements about certain activities, but this time were given additional information about the risk and benefits. Information was framed as being high risk, low risk, high benefit or low benefit. The researchers found that this additional information did in fact influence their judgements.&lt;ref name=finucanearticle/&gt;

Two similar studies were conducted by Wilson and Arvai in 2006, in which they also looked at the affect heuristic affects high and low risk options.{{clarify|date=June 2012|reason=This is not a real sentence in English.}} These experiments examine the affect heuristic and the “evaluability hypothesis”, the joint evaluation when options are evaluated in a side-by-side comparison and separate evaluation where options are evaluated on their own. They take this concept and discuss how it relates to the affect heuristic by specifically looking at making traits of an option more or less meaningful in terms of the context of choice, more specifically, affect. To examine this relationship more closely, they conducted two experiments where participants received quantitative information about the nature of risks and were placed in one of two groups: ''affect-poor'' combined with high risks and ''affect-rich'' combined with low risks. In their first study, they looked how the influence of affect on evaluability in joint evaluations as compared to separate evaluations. To this, participants were asked to make choices about the ''affect-rich'' problem of crime and the ''affect-poor'' problem of deer overpopulation. Participants were asked to rate how they perceived crime and deer overpopulation by rating  on a scale from "very good" to "very bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Robyn S.|author2=Arvai, Joseph L.|title=When Less Is More: How Affect Influences Preferences When Comparing Low and High-risk Options|journal=Journal of Risk Research|date=March 2006|volume=9|issue=2|pages=165–178|doi=10.1080/13669870500419503}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that participants ignored the quantitative information and focused on the affect characteristics.

===Fear appeals===
Health campaigns often use “fear appeals” to grab the attention of their audience.  Fear appeals are a type of advertising that specifically uses methods of creating anxiety in the consumer which results in the consumer wanting to cure this fear by purchasing the product. In a study by Averbeck, Jones, and Robertson (2011), researchers look at how prior knowledge influences one's response to fear appeals. Surveys were distributed which manipulated prior knowledge as low or high and two different topics: sleep deprivation or spinal meningitis. Various scale were used to test how prior knowledge affects certain health-related issues. Researchers found that individuals who had prior knowledge in a certain subject exhibited less fear and were least likely to fall prey to the affect heuristic as opposed to individuals that did not have prior knowledge who exhibited more fear and were more likely to fall prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Averbeck|first=J|author2=Jones, A.|author3=Robertson, K.|title=Prior Knowledge and Health Messages: An Examination of Affect as Heuristics and Information as Systematic Processing for Fear Appeals|journal=Southern Communication Journal|year=2011|volume=76|issue=1|pages=35–54|doi=10.1080/10417940902951824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change===
Research has shown that Americans are aware of climate change, but do not consider it to be a serious problem due to the lack of an affective response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bostrom|first=A.|author2=Morgan, M. G.|author3=Fischhoff, B.|author4=Read, D.|title=What Do People Know About Global Climate Change?|journal=Risk Analysis|year=1994|volume=14|issue=6|pages=959–970|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1994.tb00065.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people report as not having experienced the consequences of climate change or that it is a long-term consequence that will not happen in the near future. Therefore, it is considered to be of lower priority and not much is done as a solution to global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kempton, W. |author2=Boster, J. S. |author3=Hartley, J. A. |title=Environmental Values in American Culture|year=1995|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-262-61123-7|pages=1–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk communication===
Research on the affect heuristic had its origin in risk perception. Communicating risk is meant to improve the correspondence between the magnitude of the risk of an issue and the magnitude to which people respond to that risk. Affect, specifically negative affect, is an important method for increasing perceived risk considering its influences on perceived risk and thus has been utilized as essential for communicating risk to the public.

Raising risk awareness is thought to be increased when risk information is presented in the form of frequences (e.g. “Within 40 years there is a 33% probability of flood”) or probabilities (e.g. “Each year there is a 1% probability of flood). This method is thought to evoke an affective response which then increases the availability of risk which results in greater perceived risk.&lt;ref name=kellerarticle/&gt; This demonstrates how the way in which information is presented influences the way in which people interpret the information, more specifically, potential risks. Research also shows that people's financial risk taking is affected by their emotional state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(83)90120-4|title=The effect of positive feelings on risk taking: When the chips are down|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|volume=31|issue=2|pages=194–202|year=1983|last1=Isen|first1=Alice M.|last2=Patrick|first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 12781345 |year= 2003 |author1= Yuen |first1= K. S. |title= Could mood state affect risk-taking decisions? |journal= Journal of Affective Disorders |volume= 75 |issue= 1 |pages= 11–18 |last2= Lee |first2= T. M. |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00022-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cancer====
Researchers have looked at the affective and experiential modes of thinking in terms of cancer prevention. Research has shown that affect plays a significant role in whether people choose to get screened for certain types of cancer. Current research is now looking into how to communicate the risks and benefits of cancer prevention and treatment options. So far research has shown that the way in which information is framed does play a role in the way in which the information is interpreted. Research has also shown that treatment options may not have significant meaning to patients unless it has an affective connection. It is for this reason that researchers are looking into using affective coding such as icon arrays to make numerical information easier to understand and process.&lt;ref name=kellerarticle/&gt;

===Smiling===
Research has been done on how smiling can cause affective responses and thus influence our opinions of others. An experiment by LaFrance and Hecht (1995) investigated  whether a smiling target would elicit more leniency than those that do not. Participants judged a case of potential academic misconduct and were asked to rate a list of subjects. Materials included photos of a female target either showing a neutral expression, felt smile, false smile, or miserable smile. Researchers found that the student pictured as smiling received less punishment than did the student who did not smile despite the fact that the smiling student was not seen as less guilty. They did not find a significant difference between the different smiles. Smiling students were also rated as more trustworthy, honest, genuine, good, obedient, sincere, and admirable compared to the student that did not smile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaFrance|first=M.|author2=Hecht, M.A.|title=Why Smiles Generate Leniency|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=March 1995|volume=21|issue=3|pages=207–214|doi=10.1177/0146167295213002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory load===
Researchers have studied how one's memory load increases one's chances of using the affect heuristic. In a study by Stiv and Fedorikhin (1999), participants were asked to either memorize a two-digit number (low cognitive demand) or a seven-digit number (high cognitive demand). Participants were then asked to enter another room where they would report their number. On the way there, they were asked for their preference for two snacks: chocolate cake (more favorable affect, less favorable cognition) or fruit salad (less favorable affect, more favorable cognition). Researchers predicted that participants given the seven-digits to remember (high cognitive load) would reduce their deliberation process due to having to remember a large amount of information. This would increase the chances of these participants choosing the cake over the fruit salad due to it being the more affectively favorable option. This hypothesis proved true with participants choosing the chocolate cake 63% of the time when given a high cognitive load and only 41% when given a low cognitive load. In the same study they also tested the impulsiveness of the participants in moderating the effects of processing-resources of choice and at the time they were asked for their preference for the two snacks high cognitive demand chose the chocolate cake 84.2%. This provides evidence that people's decisions  can be influenced by affect heuristic in a relatively spontaneous manner from the stimulus, with little involvement of higher-order cognitive demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shiv|first=B.|author2=Fedorikin, A.|title=Heart and Mind in Conflict: The Interplay of Affect and Cognition in Consumer Decision Making|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=December 1999|volume=26|issue=3|pages=278–292|doi=10.1086/209563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasting effects===
Another common situation involving affect heuristic is where a strong, emotional first impression can inform a decision, even if subsequent evidence weight cognitively against the original decision made. In a study by Sherman, Kim and Zajonc (1998), they investigated how long the induced effects of an affective response could last. Participants were asked to study Chinese characters and their English meanings. Half of the meanings were positive (e.g. beauty) and the other half negative (e.g. disease). Participants were then tested on these meanings, which was followed by a task in which they were given pairs of characters and asked to choose which character they preferred. Researchers found that participants preferred the character with a positive meaning.

In the same experiment, participants were given a new task where the characters were presented with a neutral meaning (e.g. linen) and participants were told that these were the true meanings of the character. The testing procedure was the same and despite exposing participants with the new meanings, their preferences in characters remained the same. Characters that were paired with positive meanings continued to be preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Affective Perseverance: The Resistance of Affect to Cognitive Invalidation|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=February 2002|volume=28|issue=2|pages=224–237|doi=10.1177/0146167202282008|last1=Sherman|first1=D. K.|last2=Kim|first2=H. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
While heuristics can be helpful in many situations, it can also lead to biases which can result in poor decision-making habits. Like other heuristics, it{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} can provide efficient and adaptive responses, but relying on affect can also cause decisions to be misleading.

===Smoking===
Studies have looked at how the affect influences smoking behavior. Smokers tend to act experientially in the sense that they give little conscious thought to the risks before they start. It is usually as a result of affective responses in the moment that occur when seeing others partake in the behavior. Epstein (1995) found that there has been quite a bit of manipulation of consumers when it comes to packaging and marketing products. This is especially the case with tobacco companies. Research has shown that cigarette advertisements were designed to increase the positive affect associated with smoking and decrease the perceptions of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=S|title=Integration of the cognitive and psychodynamic unconscious|journal=American Psychologist|date=August 1994|volume=49|issue=8|pages=709–724|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.49.8.709|pmid=8092614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10558427|ssrn=1286703|year=1999|author1=Hanson|first1=J. D.|title=Taking behavioralism seriously: Some evidence of market manipulation|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=112|issue=7|pages=1420–1572|last2=Kysar|first2=D. A.|doi=10.2307/1342413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, seeing this advertisement could lead people astray to start smoking because of its induced appeal. In a study by Slovic et al. (2005), he released a survey to smokers in which he asked “If you had it to do all over again, would you start smoking?” and more than 85% of adult smokers and about 80% of young smokers (between the ages of 14-22) answered “No.” He found that most smokers, especially those that start at a younger age, do not take the time and think about how their future selves will perceive the risks associated with smoking. Essentially, smokers give little conscious thought to smoking before they start and it is usually after they have started smoking and have become addicted that they learn new information about health risk.&lt;ref name=macgregorarticle/&gt;

'''Biodegradable waste''' includes any [[organic matter]] in  [[type of waste|waste]] which can be broken down into carbon dioxide, water, methane or simple organic molecules by micro-organisms and other living things by [[compost]]ing, [[aerobic digestion]], [[anaerobic digestion]] or similar processes. In waste management, it also includes some inorganic materials which can be decomposed by bacteria. Such materials include [[gypsum]] and its products such as [[plasterboard]] and other simple organic [[sulfate]]s which can decompose to yield [[hydrogen sulphide]] in anaerobic land-fill conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why can't I put my leftover gyproc/drywall in the garbage? |publisher=Recycling Council of British Columbia|url=https://www.rcbc.ca/resources/faqs/hazard9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Fact Sheet: Methane and Hydrogen Sulfide Gases at C&amp;DD Landfills|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency. State of Ohio, U.S.|url= http://epa.ohio.gov/portals/34/document/guidance/gd_669.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In domestic waste collection, the scope of biodegradable waste may be narrowed to include only those degradable wastes capable of being handled in the local waste handling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|publisher=Christchurch City Council|title=Organics -Green Bin|access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Biodegradable waste can be found in [[municipal solid waste]] (sometimes called biodegradable municipal waste, or BMW) as [[green waste]], [[food waste]], [[paper]] waste, and [[biodegradable plastics]]. Other [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] wastes include [[human waste]], [[manure]], [[sewage]], [[sewage sludge]] and [[slaughterhouse waste]]. In the absence of [[oxygen]], much of this waste will decay to [[methane]] by [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cslondon.org/downloads/2010_Waste_Review.pdf CSL London Olympics Waste Review]. cslondon.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of the developed world, biodegradable waste is separated from the rest of the waste stream, either by separate kerb-side collection or by waste sorting after collection. At the point of collection such waste is often referred to as ''green waste''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|title=Organics - Green Bin|publisher= Christchurch City Council|access-date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing such waste from the rest of the waste stream substantially reduces waste volumes for disposal and also allows biodegradable waste to be [[compost]]ed.

==Uses of biodegradable waste==
Biodegradable waste can be used for composting or a resource for heat, electricity and fuel by means of [[incineration]] or [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 NNFCC report on Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=2011-07-20 }}. nnfcc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss ''Kompogas'' and the Danish ''AIKAN'' process are examples of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kompogas-utzenstorf.ch/pdf/kreislauf.pdf Recycling chain]. kompogas-utzenstorf.ch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aikantechnology.com/ AIKAN website]. aikantechnology.com&lt;/ref&gt; While incineration can recover the most energy, anaerobic digestion plants retain nutrients and make compost for soil amendment and still recover some of the contained energy in the form of [[biogas]]. Kompogas produced 27 million [[Kwh]] of electricity and biogas in 2009. The oldest of the company's lorries has achieved 1,000,000 kilometers driven with biogas from household waste in the last 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zuonline.ch/storys/storys.cfm?vID=1585|title=Gesundheit, Kraft und Energie für 2002|date=3 January 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020902075207/http://www.zuonline.ch/storys/storys.cfm?vID=1585|work=zuonline.ch|archivedate=2 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas relying on organic waste==

Featured in an edition of ''[[The Economist]]'' that predicted events in 2014, it was revealed that [[Massachusetts]] creates roughly 1.4 million tons of organic waste every year&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/2013/11/18/waste-not-want-not&lt;/ref&gt;. Massachusetts, along with [[Connecticut]] and [[Vermont]], are also going to enact laws to divert food waste from landfills.

In small and densely populated states, landfill capacity is limited so disposal costs are higher ($60–90 per ton in MA compared to national average of $49&lt;ref&gt;https://nrra.net/sweep/cost-to-landfill-waste-continues-to-rise-through-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;). Decomposing food waste generates methane, a notorious [[greenhouse gas]]. However, this biogas can be captured and turned into energy through anaerobic digestion, and then sold into the electricity grid.

Anaerobic digestion grew in Europe, but is starting to develop in America. Massachusetts is increasing its production of anaerobic digesters.


==Climate change impacts==

The main environmental threat from biodegradable waste is the production of [[methane]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/compost/index.htm Biodegradable waste]. European Commission

'''Christia V. Daniels Adair''' (October 22, 1893 – December 31, 1989) was an [[African Americans|African-American]] [[suffragist]] and civil rights worker based in Texas. There is a mural in Texas about her life, displayed in a county park which is named for her.

==Early life and education==
Christia V. Daniels was born in 1893 in [[Victoria, Texas]] and grew up in [[Edna, Texas]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=African American Women|last=Salem|first=Dorothy C.|publisher=Garland Publishing|year=1993|isbn=0-8240-9782-3|location=New York and London|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the daughter of Hardy Daniels and Ada Crosby Daniels. Her father had a hauling business, and her mother was a laundress.&lt;ref name="Pruitt"&gt;Bernadette Pruitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-YSzAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;ots=7OA7SlXOmA&amp;dq=Christia%20Adair&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=Christia%20Adair&amp;f=false ''The Other Great Migration: The Movement of Rural African Americans to Houston, 1900-1941''] (Texas A&amp;M University Press 2013): 176. {{ISBN|9781603449489}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had an older, half-sister who had been legally adopted by her mother as well as two younger brothers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/digital_objects/95362|title=Christia Adair.

==Career==
Christia Daniels taught at public schools in Edna for three years and then left teaching in 1918 after she married Elbert H. Adair, a [[brakeman]] for the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri-Pacific Railroad]], and moved to [[Kingsville, Texas]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Here, she joined a women's group and fought against gambling establishments and organized petition drives for women's suffrage. Despite the success of the [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement,]] she was prevented from voting in Texas and turned away from a polling place due to state stating that black Americans cannot vote in primaries, even though she was allowed to register to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U6o0ttZqgtUC&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Christia%20Adair&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=Christia%20Adair&amp;f=false ''African-American Women in the Struggle for the Vote, 1850-1920''] (Indiana University Press 1998): 147-148. {{ISBN|9780253211767}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This incident prompted Adair to begin working with the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] movement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/aalgs/00016/aal-00016.html|title=Christia Adair Collection MSS.0017 An Inventory of her Records at the African American Library at the Gregory School, Houston Public Library|website=legacy.lib.utexas.edu|language=en|others=Adair, Christia V.

Allwright]] case. After the case was decided in the favor of Smith, the Houston chapter of the NAACP became a popular target for bomb threats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She refused to divulge the group's membership rolls to police due to the belief that the Houston police were trying to procure the list in order to break up the chapter, under the guise of claims of [[Barratry (common law)|barratry]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was one of the chapter members who testified during the trial regarding the attempted seizure of the chapter's records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Adair worked on desegregation of the [[Houston Public Library]], airport, hospital, and public transit facilities, as well as department store dressing rooms.&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt; She was part of the effort to make black Texans eligible to serve on juries, and to be hired for county jobs.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Adair co-founded the Harris County Democrats, an integrated organization, and in 1966 was the first African-American woman elected to the state's Democratic Executive Committee (though she refused her seat on the committee in protest).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5789044/cv_adair_and_others_refuse_to_be_seated/ "Liberal Demos Refuse to Serve on Committee"] ''Abilene Reporter-News" (September 23, 1966): 31. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Gibson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i5ZmBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;ots=EU2u2-98ya&amp;dq=Harris%20County%20Democrats%20Adair&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q=Harris%20County%20Democrats%20Adair&amp;f=false ''Texas History for Kids: Lone Star Lives and Legends, with 21 Activities''] (Chicago Review Press 2015): 104. {{ISBN|9781613749920}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also active in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] from childhood, and was the first woman on the denomination's general board.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5310">'''Circulus''' was a [[socioeconomics]] doctrine devised by nineteenth-century French [[Utopian socialism|utopian]] [[socialist]] [[Pierre Leroux]] (1797-1871), who proposed that human [[excrement]] be collected by the state in the form of a [[tax]] and used as [[fertiliser]], thereby increasing agricultural production sufficiently to prevent [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

== The theory ==
According to Leroux, human excrement has remarkable fertilising properties, which society fails to harness. The human waste that is otherwise discarded would fertilise agricultural production sufficient to cover society's progressively increasing food consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[Pierre Jannet, J. F. Payen, Auguste Alexandre Veinant] ''Bibliotheca Scatologica, ou catalogue raisonné des livres traitant des vertus faits et gestes de très noble et très ingénieux'' [Paris: Imprimerie Guiraudet et Jouaust, 1849], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux posits the existence of a natural law dependent on the circulation of human excrement back through the agricultural process and which maintains a necessary balance between soil fertility and inexorable population growth.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Revue de l'ordre social'' (No. 1, 1850, p.&amp;nbsp;6), Leroux responded to his critics, summing up his theory as follows: "Si les hommes étaient croyants, savants, religieux, ajoute-t-il, au lieu de rire, comme ils le font, du socialisme, ils professeraient avec respect et vénération la doctrine du circulus. Chacun recueillerait ''religieusement'' son fumier pour le donner à l’état, c’est-à-dire au percepteur, en guise d’impôt ou de contribution personelle. La production agricole serait immédiatement doublée, et la misère disparaîtrait du globe"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; (If men were believers, learned, religious, then, rather than laughing at socialism, as they do, they would profess the doctrine of circulus with respect and veneration. Each would religiously collect his dung to give it to the state, that is, to the tax-collector, by way of an impost or personal contribution. Agricultural production would instantly be doubled, and poverty would vanish from the globe).

== Origin and history of the theory ==
Leroux first put forward his theory of circulus in 1834, as part of an attempt to explain the failure of a [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] [[phalanstery]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Reid, ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen: Realities and Representations'', Harvard University Press, 1991, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Madame Baudet-Dulary, astonished at the failure of the utopian community established on her land, Fourier himself is supposed to have said: "Madame, donnez-moi fumier" (Madame, give me dung).&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Laporte, ''Histoire de la Merde'', Christian Bourgois, Editeur, Paris, 1978, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite public ridicule,&lt;ref&gt;See for example Alfred Sudre, who derides Leroux's theory in ''Histoire du communisme: ou, Réfutation historique des utopies socialistes'' (4th edition, Alfred Pagny, Éditeur, Brussels, 1850, p. 309), as follows: "M. Pierre Leroux s’écrie: Pour renverser le Léviathan de l’économie politique, il me suffit… d’un détritus" (Monsieur Pierre Leroux cries out: to overturn the Leviathan of the political economy, all I need is... a piece of waste).&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux held firm to his theory in the decades that followed and, while living in exile in [[Jersey]] after the fall of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], he carried out experiments using his own excrement as fertiliser in an attempt to persuade the local authorities to adopt the doctrine of circulus.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Leroux's theory did gain the sympathetic ear of fellow exile [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the digression on the sewers of Paris in ''[[Les Misérables]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"L'intestin de Léviathan", Book Five, Part Two.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo would seem to have been influenced by Leroux's diagnosis of socio-economic ills when he declares that the present sewerage system is "a misunderstanding" ("Un égout est un malentendu"), a negligent waste ("coulage") of public wealth ("la richesse publique"), and that were the "givens of a new social economy" ("les données d'une économie sociale nouvelle") applied to human waste, then the problem of poverty would be attenuated.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Misérables'', ed. Guy Rosa and Nicole Savy, Le Livre de Poche, 1985, vol. 2, p. 1685.&lt;/ref&gt; But in practical terms, rather than by Leroux's vision of individual members of society willingly paying a tax in their own excrement for the sake of the common weal, Hugo's collector sewers were sooner inspired by the ideas of English social reformer [[Edwin Chadwick]], who proposed that human waste be pumped from cities to the countryside to provide fertiliser for crops to feed those very cities, thereby completing "the circle and [realising] the Egyptian type of eternity by bringing as it were the serpent's tail into the serpent's mouth".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">'''Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy''' ('''CEBT''') is an extended version of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) aimed at helping individuals to evaluate the basis of their emotional distress and thus reduce the need for associated dysfunctional [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] behaviors (e.g., eating behaviors including binging, purging, restriction of food intake, and substance misuse). This psychotherapeutic intervention draws on a range of models and techniques including [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[mindfulness meditation]], [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), and experiential exercises.

CEBT has been used primarily with individuals suffering from eating disorders, as it offers an alternative when standard CBT is unsuccessful in relieving symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slyter|first=Marty|title=Treating eating disorders with the buddhist tradition of mindfulness|journal=American Counselling Association: Ideas and Research You Can Use|year=2012|volume=32|issue=1|url=http://www.counseling.org/resources/library/vistas/vistas12/Article_32.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that CEBT may help reduce emotional eating, depression, and anxiety and also improve [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Holly|title=Managing emotional eating|journal=Mental Health Practice|year=2012|volume=8|issue=15|url=http://mentalhealthpractice.rcnpublishing.co.uk/archive/article-managing-emotional-eating|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CEBT was developed in 2006 by British psychologist Emma Gray (née Corstorphine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corstorphine|first=Emma|title=Cognitive Emotional Behavioural Therapy for the eating disorders; working with beliefs about emotions|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|year=2006|volume=14|issue=6|pages=448–461|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.747/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+23+February+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance|doi=10.1002/erv.747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its key components include psychological education; techniques to enhance awareness of emotions and motivation to change; and strategies to restructure beliefs about the experience and expression of emotions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6597">'''Culture change''' is a term used in [[public policy]] making that emphasizes the influence of [[cultural capital]] on individual and community behavior. It has been sometimes called repositioning of culture,&lt;Ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13668803.2014.981506&lt;/ref&gt; which means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chigbu|first1=Uchendu Eugene|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|date=2015|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13668803.2014.981506}}&lt;/ref&gt; It places stress on the social and cultural capital determinants of decision making and the manner in which these interact with other factors like the availability of information or the financial incentives facing individuals to drive behavior.
[[Image:culture change model.jpg|thumb|Model of culture change]] 

These cultural capital influences include the role of parenting, families and close associates; organizations such as schools and workplaces; communities and neighborhoods; and wider social influences such as the media. It is argued that this cultural capital manifests into specific values, attitudes or social norms which in turn guide the behavioral ''intentions'' that individuals adopt in regard to particular decisions or courses of action. These behavioral intentions interact with other factors driving behavior such as financial incentives, regulation and legislation, or levels of information, to drive actual behavior and ultimately feed back into underlying cultural capital.

In general, cultural stereotypes present great resistance to change and to their own redefinition. Culture, often appears fixed to the observer at any one point in time because cultural mutations occur incrementally.&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Petrakis, P.C. Kostis (2013) “[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218#! Economic Growth and Cultural Change]”, Journal of Socio-Economics, Issue C, Vol. 47, pp. 147-157, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.011.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural change is a long-term process. Policymakers need to make a great effort to improve some basics aspects of a society’s cultural traits.

==Achieving culture change==
The term is used by Knott et al. of the [[Prime Minister's Strategy Unit]] in the publication: ''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100125070726/http://cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/achieving_culture_change.pdf Achieving Culture Change: A Policy Framework]'' (Knott et al., 2008). The paper sets out how public policy can achieve social and cultural change through 'downstream' interventions including fiscal incentives, legislation, regulation and information provision and also 'upstream' interventions such as parenting, peer and mentoring programs, or development of social and community networks.

The key concepts the paper is based on include:

* ''Cultural capital'' - such as the attitudes, values, aspirations and sense of self-efficacy which influence behavior. Cultural capital is itself influenced by behavior over time
* The shifting ''social zeitgeist'' - whereby social norms and values that predominate within the cultural capital in society evolve in over time
* The process by which political narrative and new ideas and innovations shift the social zeitgeist over time within the constraint of the 'elastic band' of public opinion
* The process of ''behavioral normalization'' - whereby behavior and actions pass through into social and cultural norms (for example, Knott et al. argue that the UK experience of seat belt enforcement established and reinforced this as a social norm)
* The use of [[customer insight]]
* The importance of tailoring policy programmes around an ecological model of human behavior to account for how policy will interact with cultural capital and affect it over time

Knott et al. use examples from a range of policy areas to demonstrate how the culture change framework can be applied to policymaking. For example:

* To encourage educational aspiration they recommend more use of early years and parenting interventions, an improved childhood offer, and development of positive narratives on education as well as integrated advisory systems, financial assistance and targeted social marketing approaches.
* To promote healthy living and personal responsibility they recommend building healthy living into community infrastructure, building partnerships with schools and employers, more one-to-one support for wellbeing alongside use of regulation and legislation on unhealthy products, provision of robust health information and health marketing to promote adaptive forms of behaviour.
* To develop environmentally sustainable norms they recommend reinforcing sustainability throughout policy narratives, using schools and the voluntary sector to promote environmental messages, development of infrastructure that make sustainable choices easy, together with a wider package of measures on fiscal incentives, regulation, advisory services and coalition movements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61241">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[differential geometry]] and [[tensor calculus]], '''differential forms''' are an approach to [[multivariable calculus]] that is independent of [[coordinate]]s.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define [[integrand]]s over curves, surfaces, volumes, and higher-dimensional [[manifold]]s.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by [[Élie Cartan]].  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.

For instance, the expression {{math|''f''(''x'') ''dx''}} from one-variable calculus is an example of a {{math|1}}-form, and can be [[integral|integrated]] over an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} in the domain of {{math|''f''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the expression {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' + ''g''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dz'' + ''h''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dy'' ∧ ''dz''}} is a {{math|2}}-form that has a [[surface integral]] over an [[oriented]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]] {{math|''S''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S f(x,y,z)\,dx\wedge dy + g(x,y,z)\,dx\wedge dz + h(x,y,z)\,dy\wedge dz.&lt;/math&gt;
The symbol {{math|∧}} denotes the [[exterior product]], sometimes called the ''wedge product'', of two differential forms. Likewise, a {{math|3}}-form {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' ∧ ''dz''}} represents a [[volume element]] that can be integrated over a region of space. In general, a {{mvar|k}}-form is an object that may be integrated over {{mvar|k}}-dimensional sets, and is homogeneous of degree {{mvar|k}} in the coordinate differentials.

The [[exterior algebra|algebra]] of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the domain of integration.  There is an operation {{math|''d''}} on differential forms known as the [[exterior derivative]] that, when acting on a {{math|''k''}}-form, produces a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-form.  This operation extends the [[differential of a function]], and is directly related to the [[divergence]] and the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector field in a manner that makes the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], the [[divergence theorem]], [[Green's theorem]], and [[Stokes' Theorem#Kelvin–Stokes theorem|Stokes' theorem]] special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized [[Stokes' theorem]].  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the [[topology]] of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as [[de Rham's theorem]].

The general setting for the study of differential forms is on a [[differentiable manifold]].  Differential {{math|1}}-forms are naturally dual to [[vector field]]s on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and {{math|1}}-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the [[interior product]].  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the [[change of variables formula]] for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.

==History==
Differential forms are part of the field of differential geometry, influenced by linear algebra.  Although the notion of a differential is quite old, the initial attempt at an algebraic organization of differential forms is usually credited to [[Élie Cartan]] with reference to his 1899 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Sur certaines expressions différentielles et le problème de Pfaff | first=Élie  |last=Cartan |journal=Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure |url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=ASENS_1899_3_16__239_0|year=1899 |pages=239–332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspects of the exterior algebra of differential forms appears in [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s 1844 work, ''Die Lineale&lt;!--sic--&gt; Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik''&lt;ref&gt;''Tr''. The rulers extension theory, a new branch of mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; [The Theory of Linear Extension, a New Branch of Mathematics]

==Concept==

Differential forms provide an approach to [[multivariable calculus]] that is independent of [[coordinate]]s.

===Integration===
A differential {{math|''k''}}-form can be integrated over a [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] of dimension {{math|''k''}}.  A differential one-form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal (oriented) length, or one-dimensional density.  A differential two-form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal (oriented) area, or two-dimensional density.  And so on.

Integration of differential forms is well-defined only on [[Orientability|oriented]] [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]].  An example of a one dimensional manifold is an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, and intervals can be given an orientation: they are positively oriented if {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}, and negatively oriented otherwise.  If {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}} then the integral of the differential one-form {{math|''f''(''x'') ''dx''}} over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} (with its natural positive orientation) is
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
which is the negative of the integral of the same differential form over the same interval, when equipped with the opposite orientation.  That is:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_b^a f(x)\,dx = -\int_a^b f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
This gives a geometrical context to the [[Integral#Conventions|conventions]] for one-dimensional integrals, that the sign changes when the orientation of the interval is reversed.  A standard explanation of this in one-variable integration theory is that, when the limits of integration are in the opposite order ({{math|''b'' &lt; ''a''}}), the increment {{math|''dx''}} is negative.  The integrals are negatives of one another because the oriented lengths "''dx''" have opposite directions.

More generally, an {{math|''m''}}-form is an oriented density that can be integrated over an {{math|''m''}}-dimensional oriented manifold.  (For example, a {{math|1}}-form can be integrated over an oriented curve, a {{math|2}}-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, etc.)  If {{math|''M''}} is an oriented {{math|''m''}}-dimensional manifold, and {{math|''M''′}} is the same manifold with opposed orientation and {{math|''ω''}} is an {{math|''m''}}-form, then one has:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \omega = - \int_{M'} \omega \,.&lt;/math&gt;
These conventions correspond to interpreting the integrand as a differential form, integrated over a [[Chain (algebraic topology)|chain]]. In [[measure theory]], by contrast, one interprets the integrand as a function {{mvar|f}} with respect to a measure {{mvar|μ}} and integrates over a subset {{mvar|A}}, without any notion of orientation; one writes &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_A f\,d\mu = \int_{[a,b]} f\,d\mu}&lt;/math&gt; to indicate integration over a subset {{mvar|A}}. This is a minor distinction in one dimension, but becomes subtler on higher-dimensional manifolds; see [[#Relation with measures|below]] for details.

Making the notion of an oriented density precise, and thus of a differential form, involves the [[exterior algebra]].  The basic {{math|1}}-forms are the differentials of the coordinates: {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}}.  Each of these represents a [[covector]] that measures a small displacement in the corresponding coordinate direction.  A general {{math|1}}-form is a linear combination of these differentials
:&lt;math&gt;f_1dx^1+\cdots+f_ndx^n&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the coordinates.  A differential {{math|1}}-form is integrated along an oriented curve as a line integral.

The basic two-forms are expressions {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''i''}} ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|''j''}}}}, where {{math|''i'' &lt; ''j''}}.  This represents an infinitesimal oriented square parallel to the {{math|''x''{{i sup|''i''}}}}–{{math|''x''{{i sup|''j''}}}}-plane.  A general two-form is a linear combination of these, and it is integrated just like a surface integral.

A fundamental operation defined on differential forms is the [[exterior product]] (the symbol is the [[Wedge (symbol)|wedge]] {{math|∧}}).  This is similar to the [[cross product]] from vector calculus, in that it is an alternating product.  For instance,
:&lt;math&gt;dx^1\wedge dx^2=-dx^2\wedge dx^1&lt;/math&gt;
because the square whose first side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and second side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is to be regarded as having the opposite orientation as the square whose first side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and whose second side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The exterior product allows higher dimensional differential forms to be built out of lower-dimensional ones, in much the same way that the cross product in vector calculus allows one to compute the area vector of a parallelogram from vectors pointing up the two sides.

In addition to the exterior product, there is also the [[exterior derivative]] operator {{math|''d''}}.  Like the [[differential of a function]], the exterior derivative gives a way of quantifying a differential form's sensitivity to change.  In {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, if {{math|1=''ω'' = ''f'' ''dx''{{i sup|''a''}}}} is a {{math|''k''}}-form, then {{math|''dω''}} is a {{math|''k'' + 1}}-form defined by

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i \wedge dx^a.&lt;/math&gt;

with extension to general {{math|''k''}}-forms occurring linearly.

This more general approach allows for a more natural coordinate-free approach to integration on [[manifold]]s. It also allows for a natural generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] (see {{section link||Stokes' theorem}}).

===Differential calculus===
Let {{math|''U''}} be an [[open set]] in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A differential {{math|0}}-form ("zero-form") is defined to be a [[smooth function]] {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''U''}}. If {{math|''v''}} is any vector in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then {{math|''f''}} has a [[directional derivative]] {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''}}, which is another function on {{math|''U''}} whose value at a point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}} is the rate of change (at {{math|''p''}}) of {{math|''f''}} in the {{math|''v''}} direction:

:&lt;math&gt; (\partial_v f)(p) = \left. \frac{d}{dt} f(p+tv)\right|_{t=0} .&lt;/math&gt;

(This notion can be extended to the case that {{math|''v''}} is a [[vector field]] on {{math|''U''}} by evaluating {{math|''v''}} at the point {{math|''p''}} in the definition.)

In particular, if {{math|1=''v'' = ''e''{{sub|''j''}}}} is the {{math|''j''}}th [[coordinate vector]] then {{math|∂{{sub|''v''}} ''f''}} is the [[partial derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} with respect to the {{math|''j''}}th coordinate function, i.e., {{math|∂''f'' / ∂''x''{{i sup|''j''}}}}, where {{math|''x''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''x''{{i sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''x''{{i sup|''n''}}}} are the coordinate functions on {{math|''U''}}. By their very definition, partial derivatives depend upon the choice of coordinates: if new coordinates {{math|''y''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''y''{{i sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''y''{{i sup|''n''}}}} are introduced, then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j} = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y^i} .&lt;/math&gt;

The first idea leading to differential forms is the observation that {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' (''p'')}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''v''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  (\partial_{v + w} f)(p) &amp;= (\partial_v f)(p) + (\partial_w f)(p) \\
    (\partial_{c v} f)(p) &amp;= c (\partial_v f)(p)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for any vectors {{math|''v''}}, {{math|''w''}} and any real number {{math|''c''}}. This [[linear map]] from {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|'''R'''}} is denoted {{math|''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and called the [[derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''p''}}. Thus {{math|1=''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'') = ∂&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' (''p'')}}. The object {{math|''df''}} can be viewed as a function on {{math|''U''}}, whose value at {{math|''p''}} is not a real number, but the linear map {{math|''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This is just the usual [[Fréchet derivative]] – an example of a differential [[1-form|{{math|1}}-form]].

Since any vector {{math|''v''}} is a [[linear combination]] {{math|∑ ''v''{{i sup|''j''}}''e''{{sub|''j''}}}} of its [[Euclidean vector#Vector components|components]], {{math|''df''}} is uniquely determined by {{math|''df''{{sub|''p''}}(''e''{{sub|''j''}})}} for each {{math|''j''}} and each {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}}, which are just the partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''U''}}. Thus {{math|''df''}} provides a way of encoding the partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}}. It can be decoded by noticing that the coordinates {{math|''x''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''x''{{sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''x''{{i sup|''n''}}}} are themselves functions on {{math|''U''}}, and so define differential {{math|1}}-forms {{math|''dx''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''dx''{{i sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}}. Let {{math|1=''f'' = ''x''{{i sup|''i''}}}}. Since {{math|1=∂''x''{{i sup|''i''}} / ∂''x''{{i sup|''j''}} = ''δ''{{i sup|''j''}}{{sub|''i''}}}}, the [[Kronecker delta function]], it follows that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;df = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i .&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|*|&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}}}

The meaning of this expression is given by evaluating both sides at an arbitrary point {{math|''p''}}: on the right hand side, the sum is defined "[[pointwise]]", so that
:&lt;math&gt;df_p = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(p) (dx^i)_p .&lt;/math&gt;
Applying both sides to {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the result on each side is the {{math|''j''}}th partial derivative of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''p''}}. Since {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''j''}} were arbitrary, this proves the formula {{EquationNote|*|(*)}}.

More generally, for any smooth functions {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''U''}}, we define the differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|1=''α'' = ∑&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''dh''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} pointwise by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_p = \sum_i g_i(p) (dh_i)_p&lt;/math&gt;

for each {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}}. Any differential {{math|1}}-form arises this way, and by using {{EquationNote|*|(*)}} it follows that any differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|''α''}} on {{math|''U''}} may be expressed in coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n f_i\, dx^i&lt;/math&gt;

for some smooth functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''U''}}.

The second idea leading to differential forms arises from the following question: given a differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|''α''}} on {{math|''U''}}, when does there exist a function {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''U''}} such that {{math|1=''α'' = ''df''}}? The above expansion reduces this question to the search for a function {{math|''f''}} whose partial derivatives {{math|∂''f'' / ∂''x''{{i sup|''i''}}}} are equal to {{math|''n''}} given functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}, such a function does not always exist: any smooth function {{math|''f''}} satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i \, \partial x^j} =  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^j \, \partial x^i} ,&lt;/math&gt;

so it will be impossible to find such an {{math|''f''}} unless

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x^j} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}}.

The [[skew symmetry|skew-symmetry]] of the left hand side in {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} suggests introducing an antisymmetric product {{math|∧}} on differential {{math|1}}-forms, the [[exterior product]], so that these equations can be combined into a single condition

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i \wedge dx^j = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∧}} is defined so that:

: &lt;math&gt; dx^i \wedge dx^j = - dx^j \wedge dx^i. &lt;/math&gt;

This is an example of a differential {{math|2}}-form.  This {{math|2}}-form is called the [[exterior derivative]] {{math|''dα''}} of {{math|1=''α'' = ∑{{su|b=''j''=1|p=''n''}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''dx''{{i sup|''j''}}}}.  It is given by

:&lt;math&gt; d\alpha = \sum_{j=1}^n df_j \wedge dx^j = \sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i \wedge dx^j .&lt;/math&gt;

To summarize: {{math|1=''dα'' = 0}} is a necessary condition for the existence of a function {{math|''f''}} with {{math|1=''α'' = ''df''}}.

Differential {{math|0}}-forms, {{math|1}}-forms, and {{math|2}}-forms are special cases of differential forms. For each {{math|''k''}}, there is a space of differential {{math|''k''}}-forms, which can be expressed in terms of the coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i_1,i_2\ldots i_k=1}^n f_{i_1i_2\ldots i_k} dx^{i_1} \wedge dx^{i_2} \wedge\cdots \wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

for a collection of functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Antisymmetry, which was already present for {{math|2}}-forms, makes it possible to restrict the sum to those sets of indices for which {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Differential forms can be multiplied together using the exterior product, and for any differential {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''α''}}, there is a differential {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-form {{math|''dα''}} called the exterior derivative of {{math|''α''}}.

Differential forms, the exterior product and the exterior derivative are independent of a choice of coordinates. Consequently, they may be defined on any [[smooth manifold]] {{math|''M''}}. One way to do this is cover {{math|''M''}} with [[coordinate chart]]s and define a differential {{math|''k''}}-form on {{math|''M''}} to be a family of differential {{math|''k''}}-forms on each chart which agree on the overlaps. However, there are more intrinsic definitions which make the independence of coordinates manifest.

==Intrinsic definitions==
{{see also|Exterior algebra}}

Let {{math|''M''}} be a [[smooth manifold]]. A smooth differential form of degree {{math|''k''}} is a [[section (fiber bundle)|smooth section]] of the {{math|''k''}}th [[exterior algebra|exterior power]] of the [[cotangent bundle]] of {{math|''M''}}.  The set of all differential {{math|''k''}}-forms on a manifold {{math|''M''}} is a [[vector space]], often denoted {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}.

The definition of a differential form may be restated as follows.  At any point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}}, a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''β''}} defines an element
:&lt;math&gt; \beta_p \in \bigwedge^k T_p^* M,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} is the [[tangent space]] to {{math|''M''}} at {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M''}} is its [[dual space]].  This space is naturally isomorphic to the fiber at {{math|''p''}} of the dual bundle of the {{math|''k''}}th exterior power of the [[tangent bundle]] of {{math|''M''}}.  That is, {{math|''β''}} is also a linear functional

: &lt;math&gt;\beta_p \colon \bigwedge^k T_pM \to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the universal property of exterior powers, this is equivalently an [[alternating form|alternating]] [[multilinear map]]
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_p\colon \bigoplus_{n=1}^k T_p M \to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, a differential {{math|''k''}}-form may be evaluated against any {{math|''k''}}-tuple of tangent vectors to the same point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''M''}}.  For example, a differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|''α''}} assigns to each point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} a [[linear functional]] {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}. In the presence of an [[inner product]] on {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} (induced by a [[Riemannian metric]] on {{math|''M''}}), {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be [[Riesz representation theorem|represented]] as the inner product with a [[tangent vector]] {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Differential {{math|1}}-forms are sometimes called [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant vector fields]], covector fields, or "dual vector fields", particularly within physics.

The exterior algebra may be embedded in the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map.  The alternation map is defined as a mapping  
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt} \colon \bigotimes^k T^*M \to \bigotimes^k T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
For a tensor at a point {{math|''p''}},
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt}(\omega_p)(x_1, \dots, x_k) = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma \in S_k} \sgn(\sigma) \omega_p(x_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, x_{\sigma(k)}),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[symmetric group]] on {{math|''k''}} elements.  The alternation map is constant on the cosets of the ideal in the tensor algebra generated by the symmetric 2-forms, and therefore descends to an embedding
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt} \colon \bigwedge^k T^*M \to \bigotimes^k T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;

This map exhibits {{math|''β''}} as a [[antisymmetric tensor|totally antisymmetric]] [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] [[tensor field]] of rank {{math|''k''}}. The differential forms on {{math|''M''}} are in one-to-one correspondence with such tensor fields.

==Operations==

As well as the addition and multiplication by scalar operations which arise from the vector space structure, there are several other standard operations defined on differential forms. The most important operations are the [[exterior product]] of two differential forms, the [[exterior derivative]] of a single differential form, the [[interior product]] of a differential form and a vector field, the [[Lie derivative]] of a differential form with respect to a vector field and the [[covariant derivative]] of a differential form with respect to a vector field on a manifold with a defined connection.

=== Exterior product ===
The exterior product of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''α''}} and an {{math|''l''}}-form {{math|''β''}} is a ({{math|''k'' + ''l''}})-form denoted {{math|''α'' ∧ ''β''}}. At each point {{math|''p''}} of the manifold {{math|''M''}}, the forms {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} are elements of an exterior power of the tangent space at {{math|''p''}}. When the exterior algebra is viewed as a quotient of the tensor algebra, the exterior product corresponds to the tensor product (modulo the equivalence relation defining the exterior algebra).

The antisymmetry inherent in the exterior algebra means that when {{math|''α'' ∧ ''β''}} is viewed as a multilinear functional, it is alternating. However, when the exterior algebra embedded a subspace of the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map, the tensor product {{math|''α'' ⊗ ''β''}} is not alternating. There is an explicit formula which describes the exterior product in this situation.  The exterior product is
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge \beta = \frac{(k + \ell)!}{k!\ell!}\operatorname{Alt}(\alpha \otimes \beta).&lt;/math&gt;
This description is useful for explicit computations. For example, if {{math|1=''k'' = ''l'' = 1}}, then {{math|''α'' ∧ ''β''}} is the {{math|2}}-form whose value at a point {{math|''p''}} is the [[alternating bilinear form]] defined by
:&lt;math&gt; (\alpha\wedge\beta)_p(v,w)=\alpha_p(v)\beta_p(w) - \alpha_p(w)\beta_p(v)&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|''v'', ''w'' ∈ T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}.

The exterior product is bilinear: If {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, and {{math|''γ''}} are any differential forms, and if {{math|''f''}} is any smooth function, then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge (\beta + \gamma) = \alpha \wedge \beta + \alpha \wedge \gamma,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge (f \cdot \beta) = f \cdot (\alpha \wedge \beta).&lt;/math&gt;

It is ''skew commutative'' (also known as ''graded commutative''), meaning that it satisfies a variant of [[anticommutativity]] that depends on the degrees of the forms: if {{math|''α''}} is a {{math|''k''}}-form and {{math|''β''}} is an {{math|''l''}}-form, then

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge \beta = (-1)^{kl} \beta \wedge \alpha .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Riemannian manifold ===
On a [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], the metric defines a fibre-wise isomorphism of the tangent and cotangent spaces.  This makes it possible to convert vector fields to covector fields and vice versa.  It also enables the definition of additional operations such as the [[Hodge star operator]] &lt;math&gt;\star \colon \Omega^k(M)\ \stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ \Omega^{n-k}(M)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Hodge star#Codifferential|codifferential]] &lt;math&gt;\delta\colon \Omega^k(M)\rightarrow \Omega^{k-1}(M)&lt;/math&gt;, which has degree {{math|−1}} and is adjoint to the exterior differential {{math|''d''}}.

==== Vector field structures ====
On a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, {{math|1}}-forms can be identified with vector fields; vector fields have additional distinct algebraic structures, which are listed here for context and to avoid confusion.

Firstly, each (co)tangent space generates a [[Clifford algebra]], where the product of a (co)vector with itself is given by the value of a quadratic form – in this case, the natural one induced by the [[metric tensor|metric]]. This algebra is ''distinct'' from the [[exterior algebra]] of differential forms, which can be viewed as a Clifford algebra where the quadratic form vanishes (since the exterior product of any vector with itself is zero). Clifford algebras are thus non-anti-commutative ("quantum") deformations of the exterior algebra. They are studied in [[geometric algebra]].

Another alternative is to consider vector fields as derivations. The (noncommutative) algebra of [[differential operator]]s they generate is the [[Weyl algebra]] and is a noncommutative ("quantum") deformation of the ''symmetric'' algebra in the vector fields.

===Exterior differential complex===
One important property of the exterior derivative is that {{math|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}. This means that the exterior derivative defines a [[cochain complex]]:

:&lt;math&gt;0\ \to\ \Omega^0(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^1(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^2(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^3(M)\ \to\ \cdots \ \to\ \Omega^n(M)\ \to \ 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This complex is called the de Rham complex, and its [[cohomology]] is by definition the [[de Rham cohomology]] of {{math|''M''}}.  By the [[Poincaré lemma]], the de Rham complex is locally [[exact sequence|exact]] except at {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}.  The kernel at {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} is the space of [[locally constant function]]s on {{math|''M''}}.  Therefore, the complex is a resolution of the constant [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathbf{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn implies a form of de Rham's theorem: de Rham cohomology computes the [[sheaf cohomology]] of &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathbf{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Pullback==
{{see also|Pullback (differential geometry)}}

Suppose that {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is smooth.  The differential of {{math|''f''}} is a smooth map {{math|''df'' : ''TM'' → ''TN''}} between the tangent bundles of {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}.  This map is also denoted {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} and called the '''pushforward'''.  For any point {{math|''p'' &amp;isin; ''M''}} and any {{math|''v'' &amp;isin; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}, there is a well-defined pushforward vector {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'')}} in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''f''(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt;''N''}}.  However, the same is not true of a vector field.  If {{math|''f''}} is not injective, say because {{math|''q'' &amp;isin; ''N''}} has two or more preimages, then the vector field may determine two or more distinct vectors in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;''N''}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is not surjective, then will be a point {{math|''q'' &amp;isin; ''N''}} at which {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not determine any tangent vector at all.  Since a vector field on {{math|''N''}} determines, by definition, a unique tangent vector at every point of {{math|''N''}}, the pushforward of a vector field does not always exist.

By contrast, it is always possible to pull back a differential form.  A differential form on {{math|''N''}} may be viewed as a linear functional on each tangent space.  Precomposing this functional with the differential {{math|''df'' : ''TM'' → ''TN''}} defines a linear functional on each tangent space of {{math|''M''}} and therefore a differential form on {{math|''M''}}.  The existence of pullbacks is one of the key features of the theory of differential forms.  It leads to the existence of pullback maps in other situations, such as pullback homomorphisms in de Rham cohomology.

Formally, let {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} be smooth, and let {{math|''ω''}} be a smooth {{math|''k''}}-form on {{math|''N''}}.  Then there is a differential form {{math|''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω''}} on {{math|''M''}}, called the '''pullback''' of {{math|''ω''}}, which captures the behavior of {{math|''ω''}} as seen relative to {{math|''f''}}.  To define the pullback, fix a point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''M''}} and tangent vectors {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''M''}} at {{math|''p''}}.  The pullback of {{math|''ω''}} is defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(f^*\omega)_p(v_1, \ldots, v_k) = \omega_{f(p)}(f_*v_1, \ldots, f_*v_k).&lt;/math&gt;

There are several more abstract ways to view this definition.  If {{math|''ω''}} is a {{math|1}}-form on {{math|''N''}}, then it may be viewed as a section of the cotangent bundle {{math|''T''{{i sup|∗}}''N''}} of {{math|''N''}}.  Using {{i sup|∗}} to denote a dual map, the dual to the differential of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|(''df''){{i sup|∗}} : ''T''{{i sup|∗}}''N'' → ''T''{{i sup|∗}}''M''}}.  The pullback of {{math|''ω''}} may be defined to be the composite
:&lt;math&gt;M\ \stackrel{f}{\to}\ N\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ T^*N\ \stackrel{(df)^*}{\longrightarrow}\ T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a section of the cotangent bundle of {{math|''M''}} and hence a differential {{math|1}}-form on {{math|''M''}}.  In full generality, let &lt;math&gt;\wedge^k (df)^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the {{math|''k''}}th exterior power of the dual map to the differential.  Then the pullback of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} is the composite
:&lt;math&gt;M\ \stackrel{f}{\to}\ N\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ \wedge^k T^*N\ \stackrel{\wedge^k (df)^*}{\longrightarrow}\ \wedge^k T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;

Another abstract way to view the pullback comes from viewing a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} as a linear functional on tangent spaces.  From this point of view, {{math|''ω''}} is a morphism of [[vector bundle]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^k TN\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ N \times \mathbf{R},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''N'' × '''R'''}} is the trivial rank one bundle on {{math|''N''}}.  The composite map
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^k TM\ \stackrel{\wedge^k df}{\longrightarrow}\ \wedge^k TN\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ N \times \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
defines a linear functional on each tangent space of {{math|''M''}}, and therefore it factors through the trivial bundle {{math|''M'' × '''R'''}}.  The vector bundle morphism &lt;math&gt;\wedge^k TM \to M \times \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined in this way is {{math|''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω''}}.

Pullback respects all of the basic operations on forms.  If {{math|''ω''}} and {{math|''η''}} are forms and {{math|''c''}} is a real number, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
             f^*(c\omega) &amp;= c(f^*\omega), \\
       f^*(\omega + \eta) &amp;= f^*\omega + f^*\eta, \\
  f^*(\omega \wedge \eta) &amp;= f^*\omega \wedge f^*\eta, \\
             f^*(d\omega) &amp;= d(f^*\omega).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The pullback of a form can also be written in coordinates. Assume that {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are coordinates on {{math|''M''}}, that {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are coordinates on {{math|''N''}}, and that these coordinate systems are related by the formulas {{math|1=''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for all {{math|''i''}}. Locally on {{math|''N''}}, {{math|''ω''}} can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} \omega_{i_1\cdots i_k} \, dy^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dy^{i_k},&lt;/math&gt;

where, for each choice of {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a real-valued function of {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Using the linearity of pullback and its compatibility with exterior product, the pullback of {{math|''ω''}} has the formula

:&lt;math&gt;f^*\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} (\omega_{i_1\cdots i_k}\circ f) \, df_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge df_{i_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Each exterior derivative {{math|''df''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be expanded in terms of {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The resulting {{math|''k''}}-form can be written using [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] matrices:

:&lt;math&gt; f^*\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} \sum_{j_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; j_k} (\omega_{i_1\cdots i_k}\circ f)\frac{\partial(f_{i_1}, \ldots, f_{i_k})}{\partial(x^{j_1}, \ldots, x^{j_k})} \, dx^{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{j_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(f_{i_1}, \ldots, f_{i_k})}{\partial(x^{j_1}, \ldots, x^{j_k})}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the determinant of the matrix whose entries are &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_{i_m}}{\partial x^{j_n}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1\leq m,n\leq k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Integration==
A differential {{math|''k''}}-form can be integrated over an oriented {{math|''k''}}-dimensional manifold.  When the {{math|''k''}}-form is defined on an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold with {{math|''n'' &amp;gt; ''k''}}, then the {{math|''k''}}-form can be integrated over oriented {{math|''k''}}-dimensional submanifolds.  If {{math|1=''k'' = 0}}, this is just evaluation of a function at points. Other values of {{math|1=''k'' = 1, 2, 3, ...}} correspond to line integrals, surface integrals, volume integrals, and so on.  There are several equivalent ways to formally define the integral of a differential form, all of which depend on reducing to the case of Euclidean space.

===Integration on Euclidean space===
Let {{math|''U''}} be an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Give {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} its standard orientation and {{math|''U''}} the restriction of that orientation.  Every smooth {{math|''n''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} on {{math|''U''}} has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = f(x)\,dx^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt;
for some smooth function {{math|''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''}}.  Such a function has an integral in the usual Riemann or Lebesgue sense.  This allows us to define the integral of {{math|''ω''}} to be the integral of {{math|''f''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_U \omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \int_U f(x)\,dx^1 \cdots dx^n.&lt;/math&gt;
Fixing an orientation is necessary for this to be well-defined.  The skew-symmetry of differential forms means that the integral of, say, {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ∧ ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} must be the negative of the integral of {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∧ ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Riemann and Lebesgue integrals cannot see this dependence on the ordering of the coordinates, so they leave the sign of the integral undetermined.  The orientation resolves this ambiguity.

===Integration over chains===
Let {{math|''M''}} be an {{math|''n''}}-manifold and {{math|''ω''}} an {{math|''n''}}-form on {{math|''M''}}.  First, assume that there is a parametrization of {{math|''M''}} by an open subset of Euclidean space.  That is, assume that there exists a diffeomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \colon D \to M&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''D'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Give {{math|''M''}} the orientation induced by {{math|''φ''}}.  Then {{Harv|Rudin|1976}} defines the integral of {{math|''ω''}} over {{math|''M''}} to be the integral of {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''ω''}} over {{math|''D''}}.  In coordinates, this has the following expression.  Fix a chart on {{math|''M''}} with coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_n} a_{i_1,\dots,i_n}({\mathbf x})\,dx^{i_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dx^{i_n}.&lt;/math&gt;
Suppose that {{math|''φ''}} is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi({\mathbf u}) = (x^1({\mathbf u}),\dots,x^n({\mathbf u})).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the integral may be written in coordinates as
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \omega = \int_D \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_n} a_{i_1,\dots,i_n}(\varphi({\mathbf u})) \frac{\partial(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_n})}{\partial(u^{1},\dots,u^{n})}\,du^1 \cdots du^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_n})}{\partial(u^{1},\dots,u^{n})}&lt;/math&gt;
is the determinant of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]].  The Jacobian exists because {{math|''φ''}} is differentiable.

In general, an {{math|''n''}}-manifold cannot be parametrized by an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  But such a parametrization is always possible locally, so it is possible to define integrals over arbitrary manifolds by defining them as sums of integrals over collections of local parametrizations.  Moreover, it is also possible to define parametrizations of {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets for {{math|''k'' &amp;lt; ''n''}}, and this makes it possible to define integrals of {{math|''k''}}-forms.  To make this precise, it is convenient to fix a standard domain {{math|''D''}} in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, usually a cube or a simplex.  A {{math|''k''}}-'''chain''' is a formal sum of smooth embeddings {{math|''D'' → ''M''}}.  That is, it is a collection of smooth embeddings, each of which is assigned an integer multiplicity.  Each smooth embedding determines a {{math|''k''}}-dimensional submanifold of {{math|''M''}}.  If the chain is
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sum_{i=1}^r m_i \varphi_i,&lt;/math&gt;
then the integral of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} over {{math|''c''}} is defined to be the sum of the integrals over the terms of {{math|''c''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_c \omega = \sum_{i=1}^r m_i \int_D \varphi_i^*\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

This approach to defining integration does not assign a direct meaning to integration over the whole manifold {{math|''M''}}.  However, it is still possible to assign such a meaning indirectly because every smooth manifold may be smoothly [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulated]] in an essentially unique way, and the integral over {{math|''M''}} may be defined to be the integral over the chain determined by a triangulation.

===Integration using partitions of unity===
There is another approach, expounded in {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}, which does directly assign a meaning to integration over {{math|''M''}}, but this approach requires fixing an orientation of {{math|''M''}}.  The integral of an {{math|''n''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} on an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold is defined by working in charts.  Suppose first that {{math|''ω''}} is supported on a single positively oriented chart.  On this chart, it may be pulled back to an {{math|''n''}}-form on an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Here, the form has a well-defined Riemann or Lebesgue integral as before.  The change of variables formula and the assumption that the chart is positively oriented together ensure that the integral of {{math|''ω''}} is independent of the chosen chart.  In the general case, use a partition of unity to write {{math|''ω''}} as a sum of {{math|''n''}}-forms, each of which is supported in a single positively oriented chart, and define the integral of {{math|''ω''}} to be the sum of the integrals of each term in the partition of unity.

It is also possible to integrate {{math|''k''}}-forms on oriented {{math|''k''}}-dimensional submanifolds using this more intrinsic approach.  The form is pulled back to the submanifold, where the integral is defined using charts as before.  For example, given a path {{math|''γ''(''t'') : [0, 1] → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, integrating a {{math|1}}-form on the path is simply pulling back the form to a form {{math|''f''(''t'')&amp;thinsp;''dt''}} on {{math|[0, 1]}}, and this integral is the integral of the function {{math|''f''(''t'')}} on the interval.

===Integration along fibers===
{{main|Integration along fibers}}

[[Fubini's theorem]] states that the integral over a set that is a product may be computed as an iterated integral over the two factors in the product.  This suggests that the integral of a differential form over a product ought to be computable as an iterated integral as well.  The geometric flexibility of differential forms ensures that this is possible not just for products, but in more general situations as well.  Under some hypotheses, it is possible to integrate along the fibers of a smooth map, and the analog of Fubini's theorem is the case where this map is the projection from a product to one of its factors.

Because integrating a differential form over a submanifold requires fixing an orientation, a prerequisite to integration along fibers is the existence of a well-defined orientation on those fibers.  Let {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} be two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}, respectively.  Suppose that {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a surjective submersion.  This implies that each fiber {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} is {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-dimensional and that, around each point of {{math|''M''}}, there is a chart on which {{math|''f''}} looks like the projection from a product onto one of its factors.  Fix {{math|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} and set {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}.  Suppose that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\omega_x &amp;\in \wedge^m T_x^*M, \\
\eta_y &amp;\in \wedge^n T_y^*N,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and that {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not vanish.  Following {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}, there is a unique
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \in \wedge^{m-n} T_x^*(f^{-1}(y))&lt;/math&gt;
which may be thought of as the fibral part of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  More precisely, define {{math|''j'' : ''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'') → ''M''}} to be the inclusion.  Then {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is defined by the property that,
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_x = (f^*\eta_y)_x \wedge \sigma'_x \in \wedge^m T_x^*M,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma'_x \in \wedge^{m-n} T_x^*M&lt;/math&gt;
is any {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-covector for which
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = j^*\sigma'_x.&lt;/math&gt;
The form {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may also be notated {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Moreover, for fixed {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} varies smoothly with respect to {{math|''x''}}.  That is, suppose that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega \colon f^{-1}(y) \to T^*M&lt;/math&gt;
is a smooth section of the projection map; we say that {{math|''ω''}} is a smooth differential {{math|''m''}}-form on {{math|''M''}} along {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}}.  Then there is a smooth differential {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-form {{math|''σ''}} on {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} such that, at each {{math|''x'' ∈ ''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}},
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \omega_x / \eta_y.&lt;/math&gt;
This form is denoted {{math|''ω'' / ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  The same construction works if {{math|''ω''}} is an {{math|''m''}}-form in a neighborhood of the fiber, and the same notation is used.  A consequence is that each fiber {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} is orientable.  In particular, a choice of orientation forms on {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} defines an orientation of every fiber of {{math|''f''}}.

The analog of Fubini's theorem is as follows.  As before, {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} are two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}, and {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a surjective submersion.  Fix orientations of {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}, and give each fiber of {{math|''f''}} the induced orientation.  Let {{math|''θ''}} be an {{math|''m''}}-form on {{math|''M''}}, and let {{math|''ζ''}} be an {{math|''n''}}-form on {{math|''N''}} that is almost everywhere positive with respect to the orientation of {{math|''N''}}.  Then, for almost every {{math|''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, the form {{math|''θ'' / ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a well-defined integrable {{math|''m'' &amp;minus; ''n''}} form on {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}}.  Moreover, there is an integrable {{math|''n''}}-form on {{math|''N''}} defined by
:&lt;math&gt;y \mapsto \bigg(\int_{f^{-1}(y)} \theta / \zeta_y\bigg)\,\zeta_y.&lt;/math&gt;
Denote this form by
:&lt;math&gt;\bigg(\int_{f^{-1}(y)} \theta / \zeta\bigg)\,\zeta.&lt;/math&gt;
Then {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}} proves the generalized Fubini formula
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \theta = \int_N \bigg(\int_{f^{-1}(y)} \theta / \zeta\bigg)\,\zeta.&lt;/math&gt;

It is also possible to integrate forms of other degrees along the fibers of a submersion.  Assume the same hypotheses as before, and let {{math|''α''}} be a compactly supported {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'' + ''k'')}}-form on {{math|''M''}}.  Then there is a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''γ''}} on {{math|''N''}} which is the result of integrating {{math|''α''}} along the fibers of {{math|''f''}}.  The form {{math|''α''}} is defined by specifying, at each {{math|''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, how {{math|''α''}} pairs against each {{math|''k''}}-vector {{math|'''v'''}} at {{math|''y''}}, and the value of that pairing is an integral over {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} that depends only on {{math|''α''}}, {{math|'''v'''}}, and the orientations of {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}.  More precisely, at each {{math|''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, there is an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^k T_yN \to \wedge^{m-k} T_y^*N&lt;/math&gt;
defined by the interior product
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \mapsto \mathbf{v}\,\lrcorner\,\zeta_y.&lt;/math&gt;
If {{math|''x'' ∈ ''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}}, then a {{math|''k''}}-vector {{math|'''v'''}} at {{math|''y''}} determines an {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''k'')}}-covector at {{math|''x''}} by pullback:
:&lt;math&gt;f^*(\mathbf{v}\,\lrcorner\,\zeta_y) \in \wedge^{m-k} T_x^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
Each of these covectors has an exterior product against {{math|''α''}}, so there is an {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-form {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''M''}} along {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} defined by
:&lt;math&gt;(\beta_{\mathbf{v}})_x = \left(\alpha_x \wedge f^*(\mathbf{v}\,\lrcorner\,\zeta_y)\right) \big/ \zeta_y \in \wedge^{m-n} T_x^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
This form depends on the orientation of {{math|''N''}} but not the choice of {{math|''ζ''}}.  Then the {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''γ''}} is uniquely defined by the property
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\gamma_y, \mathbf{v}\rangle = \int_{f^{-1}(y)} \beta_{\mathbf{v}}(x),&lt;/math&gt;
and {{math|''γ''}} is smooth {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}.  This form also denoted {{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;♭&lt;/sup&gt;}} and called the '''integral of {{math|''α''}} along the fibers of ''f'''''.  Integration along fibers is important for the construction of Gysin maps in de Rham cohomology.

Integration along fibers satisfies the '''projection formula''' {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}.  If {{math|''λ''}} is any {{math|''ℓ''}}-form on {{math|''N''}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^\flat \wedge \lambda = (\alpha \wedge f^*\lambda)^\flat.&lt;/math&gt;

===Stokes' theorem===
{{main|Stokes' theorem}}
The fundamental relationship between the exterior derivative and integration is given by the [[Stokes' theorem]]: If {{math|''ω''}} is an ({{math|''n'' − 1}})-form with compact support on {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''∂M''}} denotes the [[manifold|boundary]] of {{math|''M''}} with its induced [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

A key consequence of this is that "the integral of a closed form over homologous chains is equal": If {{math|''ω''}} is a closed {{math|''k''}}-form and {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} are {{math|''k''}}-chains that are homologous (such that {{math|''M'' − ''N''}} is the boundary of a ({{math|''k'' + 1}})-chain {{math|''W''}}), then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_M \omega = \int_N \omega}&lt;/math&gt;, since the difference is the integral &lt;math&gt;\int_W d\omega = \int_W 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if {{math|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} is the derivative of a potential function on the plane or {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then the integral of {{math|''ω''}} over a path from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''b''}} does not depend on the choice of path (the integral is {{math|''f''(''b'') − ''f''(''a'')}}), since different paths with given endpoints are [[homotopic]], hence homologous (a weaker condition). This case is called the [[gradient theorem]], and generalizes the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. This path independence is very useful in [[contour integration]].

This theorem also underlies the duality between [[de Rham cohomology]] and the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of chains.

=== Relation with measures ===
{{details|Density on a manifold}}

On a ''general'' differentiable manifold (without additional structure), differential forms ''cannot'' be integrated over subsets of the manifold; this distinction is key to the distinction between differential forms, which are integrated over chains or oriented submanifolds, and measures, which are integrated over subsets. The simplest example is attempting to integrate the {{math|1}}-form {{math|''dx''}} over the interval {{math|[0, 1]}}. Assuming the usual distance (and thus measure) on the real line, this integral is either {{math|1}} or {{math|&amp;minus;1}}, depending on ''orientation:'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_0^1 dx = 1}&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_1^0 dx = - \int_0^1 dx = -1}&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the integral of the ''measure'' {{math|{{abs|''dx''}}}} on the interval is unambiguously {{math|1}} (formally, the integral of the constant function {{math|1}} with respect to this measure is {{math|1}}). Similarly, under a change of coordinates a differential {{math|''n''}}-form changes by the [[Jacobian determinant]] {{math|''J''}}, while a measure changes by the ''absolute value'' of the Jacobian determinant, {{math|{{abs|''J''}}}}, which further reflects the issue of orientation. For example, under the map {{math|''x'' ↦ −''x''}} on the line, the differential form {{math|''dx''}} pulls back to {{math|−''dx''}}; orientation has reversed; while the [[Lebesgue measure]], which here we denote {{math|{{abs|''dx''}}}}, pulls back to {{math|{{abs|''dx''}}}}; it does not change.

In the presence of the additional data of an ''orientation'', it is possible to integrate {{math|''n''}}-forms (top-dimensional forms) over the entire manifold or over compact subsets; integration over the entire manifold corresponds to integrating the form over the [[fundamental class]] of the manifold, {{math|[''M'']}}. Formally, in the presence of an orientation, one may identify {{math|''n''}}-forms with [[densities on a manifold]]; densities in turn define a measure, and thus can be integrated {{Harv |Folland |1999 |loc = Section 11.4, pp.&amp;nbsp;361&amp;ndash;362}}.

On an orientable but not oriented manifold, there are two choices of orientation; either choice allows one to integrate {{math|''n''}}-forms over compact subsets, with the two choices differing by a sign. On non-orientable manifold, {{math|''n''}}-forms and densities cannot be identified —notably, any top-dimensional form must vanish somewhere (there are no [[volume form]]s on non-orientable manifolds), but there are nowhere-vanishing densities— thus while one can integrate densities over compact subsets, one cannot integrate {{math|''n''}}-forms. One can instead identify densities with top-dimensional [[Volume form#Relation to measures|pseudoform]]s.

Even in the presence of an orientation, there is in general no meaningful way to integrate {{math|''k''}}-forms over subsets for {{math|''k'' &lt; ''n''}} because there is no consistent way to use the ambient orientation to orient {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets.  Geometrically, a {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subset can be turned around in place, yielding the same subset with the reserve orientation; for example, the horizontal axis in a plane can be rotated by a half-circle.  Compare the [[Gram determinant]] of a set of {{math|''k''}} vectors in an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space, which, unlike the determinant of {{math|''n''}} vectors, is always positive, corresponding to a squared number.  An orientation of a {{math|''k''}}-submanifold is therefore extra data not derivable from the ambient manifold.

On a Riemannian manifold, one may define a {{math|''k''}}-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] for any {{math|''k''}} (integer or real), which may be integrated over {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets of the manifold. A function times this Hausdorff measure can then be integrated over {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets, providing a measure-theoretic analog to integration of {{math|''k''}}-forms. The {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Hausdorff measure yields a density, as above.

===Currents===
The differential form analog of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] or generalized function is called a '''current'''.  The space of {{math|''k''}}-currents on {{math|''M''}} is the dual space to an appropriate space of differential {{math|''k''}}-forms.  Currents play the role of generalized domains of integration, similar to but even more flexible than chains.

Differential forms arise in some important physical contexts. For example, in Maxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]], the '''Faraday 2-form''', or [[electromagnetic field strength]], is

:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F} = \frac 1 2 f_{ab}\, dx^a \wedge dx^b\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are formed from the electromagnetic fields &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec B&lt;/math&gt;; e.g., {{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;/''c''}}, {{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; = −''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or equivalent definitions.

This form is a special case of the [[curvature form]] on the {{math|[[U(1)]]}} [[principal bundle]] on which both electromagnetism and general [[gauge theories]] may be described.  The [[connection form]] for the principal bundle is the vector potential, typically denoted by {{math|'''A'''}}, when represented in some gauge.  One then has
:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F} = d\textbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''current {{math|3}}-form''' is

: &lt;math&gt; \textbf{J} = \frac 1 6 j^a\, \varepsilon_{abcd}\, dx^b \wedge dx^c \wedge dx^d\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''j''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the four components of the current density. (Here it is a matter of convention to write {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}} instead of {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e. to use capital letters, and to write {{math|''J''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}} instead of {{math|''j''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. However, the vector rsp. tensor components and the above-mentioned forms have different physical dimensions. Moreover, by decision of an international commission of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]], the magnetic polarization vector is called &lt;math&gt;\vec J&lt;/math&gt; since several decades, and by some publishers {{math|'''J'''}}, i.e. the same name is used for different quantities.)

Using the above-mentioned definitions, [[Maxwell's equations]] can be written very compactly in [[geometrized units]] as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
        d {\textbf{F}} &amp;= \textbf{0} \\
  d {\star \textbf{F}} &amp;= \textbf{J},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Hodge star]] operator.  Similar considerations describe the geometry of gauge theories in general.

The {{math|2}}-form &lt;math&gt;{\star} \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;, which is [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the Faraday form, is also called '''Maxwell 2-form'''.

Electromagnetism is an example of a {{math|[[U(1)]]}} [[gauge theory]].  Here the [[Lie group]] is {{math|U(1)}}, the one-dimensional [[unitary group]], which is in particular [[abelian group|abelian]].  There are gauge theories, such as [[Yang–Mills theory]], in which the Lie group is not abelian.  In that case, one gets relations which are similar to those described here. The analog of the field {{math|'''F'''}} in such theories is the curvature form of the connection, which is represented in a gauge by a [[Lie algebra]]-valued one-form {{math|'''A'''}}.  The Yang–Mills field {{math|'''F'''}} is then defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = d\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A}\wedge\mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the abelian case, such as electromagnetism, {{math|1='''A''' ∧ '''A''' = 0}}, but this does not hold in general.  Likewise the field equations are modified by additional terms involving exterior products of {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''F'''}}, owing to the [[Maurer–Cartan form|structure equations]] of the gauge group.

==Applications in geometric measure theory==

Numerous minimality results for complex analytic manifolds are based on the [[Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)|Wirtinger inequality for 2-forms]].  A succinct proof may be found in [[Herbert Federer]]'s classic text ''Geometric Measure Theory''.  The Wirtinger inequality is also a key ingredient in [[Gromov's inequality for complex projective space]] in [[systolic geometry]].

'''Domestic violence against men''' deals with [[domestic violence]] experienced by [[Man|men]] or [[boy]]s in a domestic setting, such as in [[marriage]] or [[cohabitation]]. As with [[Violence against women|domestic violence against women]], violence against men may constitute a [[crime]], but laws vary between jurisdictions.

Men who report domestic violence can face [[social stigma]] regarding their perceived lack of [[machismo]] and other denigrations of their [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lupri |first1=Eugene |last2=Grandin |first2=Elaine |title=Intimate partner abuse against men |year=2004 |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/familyviolence/pdfs/Intimate_Partner.pdf|publisher=National Clearinghouse on Family Violence |accessdate=2014-06-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104074211/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/familyviolence/pdfs/Intimate_Partner.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="Marginalizing"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Marginalizing the Battered Male |journal=[[The Journal of Men's Studies]] |last=Migliaccio |first=Todd A. |volume=9 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2001 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.3149/jms.0902.205}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV) against men is generally less recognized by society than IPV against women, which can act as a further block to men reporting their situation.&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Framework"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das Dasgupta |first1=Shamita |authorlink=Shamita Das Dasgupta |title=A Framework for Understanding Women's Use of Nonlethal Violence in Intimate Heterosexual Relationships |date=November 2002 |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1364–1389 |doi=10.1177/107780102237408}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative prevalence of IPV against men to that of women is highly disputed between different studies, with some countries having no data at all. Some researchers believe the actual number of male victims may be greater than law enforcement statistics suggest due to the number of men who do not report their abuse.&lt;ref name="Crime Council"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.crimecouncil.gov.ie/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |title=Domestic Abuse of Women and Men in Ireland: Report on the National Study of Domestic Abuse |last1=Watson |first1=Dorothy |last2=Parsons |first2=Sara |publisher=National Crime Council of Ireland |location=Dublin |date=2005 |page=169 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for both men and women, domestic violence is among the most underreported crimes worldwide.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Strong |first1=Bryan |last2=DeVault |first2=Christine |last3=Cohen |first3=Theodore |title=The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationships in a Changing Society |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=February 16, 2010 |page=447 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA447 |isbn=978-1133597469 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110213408/https://books.google.com/books?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA447 |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Diana |title=Kidnapping: An Investigator’s Guide |publisher=Newnes |date=July 11, 2013 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KdueQed_sgC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0123740311 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110194423/https://books.google.com/books?id=-KdueQed_sgC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPV against men is a controversial area of research, with terms such as ''gender symmetry'', ''battered husband syndrome'' and ''bidirectional IPV'' provoking a great deal of debate. The lines of the debate tend to fall between two basic [[polemic]]s. The first of these argues that scholars who focus on female-perpetrated IPV are part of an [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] backlash, and are attempting to undermine the problem of male-perpetrated abuse by championing the cause of the man, over the much more serious cause of the abused woman.&lt;ref name="Kersti"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yllö |first=Kersti |chapter=Political and Methodological Debates in Wife Abuse Research |title=Feminist Perspectives on Wife Abuse |year=1988 |editor1-last=Yllö |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Bogard |editor2-first=Michele |pages=40–47 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA. |isbn=9780803930537}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worcester"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Worcester |first=Nancy |title=Women's Use of Force: Complexities and Challenges of Taking the Issue Seriously |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |date=November 2000 |pages=1390–1415 |doi=10.1177/107780102762478055}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second polemic argues that IPV against men is a significant problem and underreported, and that it puts women in even greater risk of victimization by abusive men, which domestic violence researchers and [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] have ignored in order to protect the fundamental gains of the battered women's movement, specifically, the view that intimate partner abuse is an extension of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal dominance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The gender paradigm in domestic violence research and theory: Part 1 — The conflict of theory and data |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |date=September 2005 |volume=10 |issue=6 |last1=Dutton |first1=Donald G. |last2=Nicholls |first2=Tonia L. |pages=680–714 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thirty years"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |date=June 2010 |title=Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=332–362 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YBVGswoPYqMC&amp;pg=PA79 |title=Current Controversies on Family Violence |last=Loseke |first=Donileen R. |last2=Gelles |first2=Richard J. |last3=Cavanaugh |first3=Mary M. |date=2005 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=9780761921066 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the tools used to generate statistics concerning IPV perpetration, the [[conflict tactics scale]], is especially contentious.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Estimation difficulties===
Determining the rate of [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV) against males can be difficult, as men may be reluctant to report their abuse or seek help.&lt;ref name="Crime Council"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Attitudes"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]] |volume=39 |issue=7 |title=Attitudes and Attributions Associated With Female and Male Partner Violence |last1=Robertson |first=Kristen |last2=Murachver |first2=Tamar |date=July 2009 |pages=1481–1512 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2009.00492.x}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delcotimes.com/general-news/20131007/help-domestic-abuse-victims-for-35-years |date=July 10, 2013 |first=Vince |last=Sullivan |accessdate=2014-06-30 |work=The Delco Times |title=Help domestic abuse victims for 35 years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male victims of IPV may face socio-cultural issues pertaining to [[hegemonic masculinity]] such as judgement by male peers, fear of coming out as LGBTQ, or having their masculinity questioned.&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse" /&gt; IPV against men is generally less recognized by society than IPV against women.&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Framework"/&gt; For a man to admit he is the victim of female perpetrated IPV necessitates the abandonment of the veneer of [[machismo]] which society expects from men, and to admit being submissive to a female partner.

On the other hand, many abusive men readily adopt a victim identity. For example, [[O. J. Simpson]] often referred to himself as a "battered husband".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PXvhE_AD084C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=fear+is+what+gives+battering+its+power+and+violence#v=onepage&amp;q=fear%20is%20what%20gives%20battering%20its%20power%20and%20violence&amp;f=false |title=When Men Batter Women: New Insights Into Ending Abusive Relationships |last=Jacobson |first=Neil S. |last2=Gottman |first2=John Mordechai |date=1998 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9780684814476 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases like this, reporting IPV victimization may lead to exposing themselves as batterers.&lt;ref name="pmid18624096"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Swan |first=Suzanne C. |last2=Gambone |first2=Laura J. |last3=Caldwell |first3=Jennifer E. |last4=Sullivan |first4=Tami P. |last5=Snow |first5=David L. |year=2008 |title=A Review of Research on Women’s Use of Violence With Male Intimate Partners |journal=Violence and victims |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=301–314 |pmc=2968709 |pmid=18624096 |doi=10.1891/0886-6708.23.3.301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male victims may fear people assuming that the woman is the real victim, and must have been acting in self-defense or retaliating for abuse.&lt;ref name="Marginalizing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abused Husbands: A Narrative Analysis |journal=[[Journal of Family Issues]] |last=Migliaccio |first=Todd A. |volume=23 |issue=1 |date=July 2002 |pages=26–52 |url=http://jfi.sagepub.com/content/23/1/26.abstract |accessdate=2014-06-20 |doi=10.1177/0192513X02023001002}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have demonstrated a degree of socio-cultural acceptance of aggression by women against men as opposed to a general condemnation of aggression by men against women. Male-on-female IPV has been shown to cause significantly more fear and more severe injuries than female-on-male violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=E. Caldwell |first=Jennifer |last2=C.

Some research has shown that women who assault their male partners are more likely to avoid arrest than men who assault their female partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Does the Criminal Justice System Treat Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Offenders Leniently? |pages=440; 447 |url=http://richardfelson.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/does-cj-treat-leniently.pdf |journal=Justice Quarterly |volume=24 |issue=3 |date=September 2007 |last1=Felson |first1=Richard B. |author1link=Richard Felson |last2=Pare |first2=Paul-Philippe |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1080/07418820701485601}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that female perpetrators of IPV tend to be viewed by law enforcement agencies and the courts as victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intimate Partner Violence: The Role of Suspect Gender in Prosecutorial Decision-Making |pages=460–494 |url=http://www.cj-resources.com/CJ_Female%20Offenders_pdfs/intimate%20partner%20violence%20the%20role%20of%20suspect%20gender%20-%20Kingsnorth%20et%20al%202007.pdf |journal=Justice Quarterly |volume=24 |issue=3 |date=September 2007 |last1=Kingsnorth |first1=Rodney F. |last2=MacIntosh |first2=Randall C. |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1080/07418820701485395}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, men may fear that if they do report to the police, they will be assumed to be the abuser, and placed under arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Abused Men: The Hidden Side of Domestic Violence |last=Cook |first=Phillip W. |authorlink=Philip W.

However, analyses of research indicates that frequently the legal system fails to view women who use IPV against controlling male partners as victims due to gendered high expectations on women to be the "perfect victim" and the culturally pervasive stereotype of the passive, "cowering" battered woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Goodmark |first=Leigh |year=2008 |title=When Is a Battered Woman Not a Battered Woman?

Statistics indicate that under-reporting is an inherent problem with IPV irrespective of gender. For example, in England and Wales, the 1995 "[[Home Office]] Research Study 191", carried out as a supplementary study to the British Crime Survey, reported 6.6 million incidents of IPV in the previous twelve months, compared with the 987,000 incidents found by the Crime Survey. The difference in the two reports was that Study 191 was a questionnaire of a random representative sample of people, while the Crime Survey attained its figures from crime records, i.e. actual reported cases of IPV.&lt;ref name="Survey 191"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/hors191.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110314171826/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/hors191.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-14 |title=Domestic Violence: Findings from a new British Crime Survey self-completion questionnaire |last=Mirrlees-Black |first=Catriona |pages=17–26 |date=1999 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-04 |isbn=9781840821932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supplementary studies carried out in 2001 and from 2004 onwards have consistently recorded significantly higher rates of IPV (committed against both men and women) than the standard crime surveys.&lt;ref name="Dewar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/websiteGovtStatsonDV1995-2013.pdf |title=Government Statistics on Domestic Violence |date=February 2014 |publisher=Dewar Research |accessdate=2014-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010–2011 report found that whilst 27% of women who experienced IPV reported it to the police, only 10% of men did so, and whilst 44% of women reported to some professional organization, only 19% of men did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116483/hosb0212.pdf |title=Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence, 2010/2011: Supplementary Volume 2 to Crime in England and Wales, 2010/2011 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Kevin |chapter=Intimate violence: 2010/11 BCS |last=Britton |first=Andrew |page=96 |date=2011 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 report carried out by the National Crime Council in the Republic of Ireland, it was estimated that 5% of men who had experienced IPV had reported it to the authorities, compared to 29% of women.&lt;ref name="Crime Council"/&gt;

===Estimates of male victimization===
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the 1995 "Home Office Research Study 191" surveyed 10,844 people (5,886 women and 4,958 men) between the ages of 16 and 59, finding that for the twelve-month period preceding the survey, 4.2% of men had experienced IPV. Over a lifetime, this figure increased to 14.9% of men. Of the 6.6 million incidents of IPV in 1995, 3.25 million involved male victims, with 1 million incidents resulting in injury.&lt;ref name="Survey 191"/&gt; Since 2004, more detailed annual records have been maintained as a supplementary survey attached to the annual Home Office ''Crime in England and Wales'' reports. These reports have consistently recorded significantly higher rates of both male and female victims of IPV than the standard crime surveys. In the case of male victims, the figures range from a high of 4.5% in 2007/2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb0209.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110220105210/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb0209.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-02-20 |title=Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence, 2010/2011: Supplementary Volume 2 to Crime in England and Wales, 2007/2008 |editor-last=Povey |editor-first=David |chapter=Intimate violence: 2007/08 BCS |last=Roe |first=Stephen |page=66 |date=2009 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a low of 3.1% in 2009/2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116512/hosb0111.pdf |title=Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence, 2009/2010: Supplementary Volume 2 to Crime in England and Wales, 2009/2010 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Kevin |chapter=Intimate violence: 2009/10 BCS |last=Hall |first=Philip |page=82 |date=2011 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a 2005 report carried out by the National Crime Council found that 15% of women and 6% of men had suffered severe IPV in their lifetime, equating to roughly 213,000 women and 88,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.crimecouncil.gov.ie/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |title=Domestic Abuse of Women and Men in Ireland: Report on the National Study of Domestic Abuse |last1=Watson |first1=Dorothy |last2=Parsons |first2=Sara |publisher=National Crime Council of Ireland |location=Dublin |date=2005 |page=24 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northern Ireland]], police records for 2012 listed 2,525 male victims of domestic violence, an increase of 259 cases from 2011.&lt;ref name="McNeilly"&gt;{{cite news |title=Domestic violence against men at its highest level in Northern Ireland since police began recording statistics |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/domestic-violence-against-men-at-its-highest-level-in-northern-ireland-since-police-began-recording-statistics-29707051.html |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-30 |work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |first=Claire |last=McNeilly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CDC Director Tom Frieden stated, "This report suggests that lesbians, gay men and bisexuals in this country suffer a heavy toll of sexual violence and stalking committed by an intimate partner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/us-usa-gays-violence-idUSBRE90O11W20130125 |first=Susan |last=Heavey |title=Data shows domestic violence, rape an issue for gays |agency=Reuters |date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Zealand]], the twenty-one year [[Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study]], published in 1999, reported that of their sample of 1,037 people, 27% of women and 34% of men reported being physically abused by a partner, with 37% of women and 22% of men reporting they had perpetrated IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moffitt |first=Terrie E. |author1link=Terrie Moffitt |last2=Caspi |first2=Avshalom E. |date=July 1999 |title=Findings About Partner Violence From the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/170018.pdf |page=2 |journal=National Institute of Justice: Research in Brief |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in New Zealand, a 2009 report by the ''[[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]]'' evaluated samples of university students (35 female, 27 male), general population (34 female, 27 male), and incarcerated participants (15 female, 24 male), and found that 16.7% of the male respondents reported physical abuse (12.9% for students and 15.4% for convicts), while 29.5% reported bidirectional (i.e. both partners commit IPV) violence (14.5% for students and 51.3% for convicts).&lt;ref name="Attitudes"/&gt;

The 2006 International Dating Violence Study, which investigated IPV amongst 13,601 students across thirty-two-nations found that "about one-quarter of both male and female students had physically attacked a partner during that year". It reported that 24.4% of males had experienced minor IPV and 7.6% had experienced "severe assault".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Straus |first=Murray A. |date=March 2008 |title=Dominance and symmetry in partner violence by male and female university students in 32 nations |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID41-PR41-Dominance-symmetry-In-Press-07.pdf |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=30 |issue=3 |page=258 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2007.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender symmetry==
[[File:Femme battant mari Durer XVII e siecle.jpg|thumb|right|"Femme battant son mari"; [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
The theory that women perpetrate IPV at roughly similar rates as men has been termed "gender symmetry". The earliest empirical evidence of gender symmetry was presented in the 1975 U.S. National Family Violence Survey carried out by Murray A. Straus and [[Richard Gelles|Richard J. Gelles]] on a nationally representative sample of 2,146 "intact families". The survey found 11.6% of men and 12% of women had experienced some kind of IPV in the last twelve months, while 4.6% of men and 3.8% of women had experienced "severe" IPV.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite book |title=Intimate Violence: The Causes and Consequences of Abuse in the American Family |last1=Gelles |first1=Richard J. |last2=Straus |author1link=Richard James Gelles |first2=Murray A. |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |pages=104 |year=1988 |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/Straus-Intimate%20Partner%20Violence-Book.pdf |accessdate=2014-07-05 |isbn=978-0-671-68296-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332 |title=Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=332–62 |year=2010 |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A}}&lt;/ref&gt; These unexpected results led Suzanne K.

Since 1975, numerous other empirical studies have found evidence of gender symmetry in IPV.

An especially controversial aspect of the gender symmetry debate is the notion of bidirectional or reciprocal IPV (i.e. when both parties commit violent acts against one another). Findings regarding bidirectional violence are particularly controversial because, if accepted, they can serve to undermine one of the most commonly cited reasons for female perpetrated IPV; self-defense against a controlling male partner. Despite this, many studies have found evidence of high levels of bidirectionality in cases where women have reported IPV. For example, social activist [[Erin Pizzey]], who established the first [[women's shelter]] in the U.K. in 1971, found that 62 of the first 100 women admitted to the centre were "violence-prone," and just as violent as the men they were leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=From the Personal to the Political |last=Pizzey |first=Erin |authorlink=Erin Pizzey |title=Women or Men: Who Are the Victims? |editor1-last=Pizzey |editor1-first=Erin |editor2-last=Shackleton |editor2-first=J.R. |editor3-last=Urwin |editor3-first=Peter |publisher=Civitas |location=London |date=2000 |page=27 |url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/cs09.pdf |accessdate=2014-06-28 |isbn=978-1-903386-09-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 National Family Violence Survey found that 27.7% of IPV cases were perpetrated by men alone, 22.7% by women alone and 49.5% were bidirectional.

Whitaker,  Tadesse Haileyesus, Monica Swahn,  and Linda S. Saltzman, of 11,370 heterosexual U.S. adults aged 18 to 28 found that 24% of all relationships had some violence. Of those relationships, 49.7% of them had reciprocal violence. In relationships without reciprocal violence, women committed 70% of all violence.

As both Fiebert and Archer point out, although the numerical tally of physical acts in these studies has found similar rates of IPV amongst men and women, and high rates of bidirectionality, there is general agreement amongst researchers that male violence is a more serious phenomenon, primarily, but not exclusively, because male violence tends to inflict more psychological and physical damage than female violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vivian |first1=Dina |last2=Langhinrichsen-Rohling |first2=Jennifer |title=Are bi-directionality violent couples mutually victimized?

From 2010 to 2012, scholars of domestic violence from the U.S., Canada and the U.K. assembled The Partner Abuse State of Knowledge, a research database covering 1700 peer-reviewed studies, the largest of its kind. Among its findings:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerpub.com/media/springer-journals/FindingsAt-a-Glance.pdf Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project Findings At-a-Glance], Sponsored by the Journal Partner Abuse, John Hamel, LCSW, Editor-in-Chief, www.springerpub.com/pa, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* More women (23%) than men (19.3%) have been assaulted at least once in their lifetime.
* Rates of female-perpetrated violence are higher than male-perpetrated (28.3% vs. 21.6%).
* Male and female IPV are perpetrated from similar motives.
* Studies comparing men and women in the power/control motive have mixed results overall.

A 2013 review examined studies from five [[continents]] and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Esquivel-Santovena |first1=Esteban Eugenio | last2=Lambert | first2=Teri | last3=Hamel | first3=John | title = Partner abuse worldwide | journal = Partner Abuse | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1891/1946-6560.4.1.e14 |url =http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables14.Revised.pdf| date = January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict tactics scale===
{{anchor|The CTS}}
In a 2002 review of the research presenting evidence of gender symmetry, [[Michael Kimmel]] noted that more than 90% of "systematic, persistent, and injurious" violence is perpetrated by men. He was especially critical of the fact that the majority of the empirical studies reviewed by Fiebert and Archer used the [[conflict tactics scale]] (CTS) as the sole measure of domestic violence, and that many of the studies used samples composed entirely of single people under the age of thirty, as opposed to older married couples.&lt;ref name="Kimmel"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kimmel |first=Michael S. |author-link=Michael Kimmel |title='Gender symmetry' in domestic violence: a substantive and methodological research review |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1332–1363 |publisher=[[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1177/107780102237407 |date=November 2002 |ref=harv |postscript=.}} [http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016110040/http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf |date=October 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the CTS is the most widely used domestic violence measurement instrument in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |last2=Douglas |first2=Emily M. |author-link1=Murray A.

Kimmel argues that the CTS is particularly vulnerable to reporting bias because it depends on asking people to accurately remember and honestly report incidents which have occurred up to a year previously. Even Straus admitted that the data indicates men tend to underestimate their use of violence, and women tend to overestimate their use of violence. "He attempts to control for this by examining only reports from women. Yet this does not correct the bias, because women also tend to underestimate men’s use of violence. Furthermore, men and women alike tend to overestimate women’s use of violence. Violence by men is expected, so it is not reported; violence by women is not expected, so it is notable and reported."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Thus men will overestimate their victimization and underestimate their perpetration, while women will underestimate their victimization and overestimate their perpetration.&lt;ref name="Kimmel"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Barbara J. Morse and Malcolm J. George have presented data suggesting that male underestimation of their partner's violence is more common in CTS based studies than overestimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morse |first=Barbara J. |title=Beyond the Conflict Tactics Scale: assessing gender differences in partner violence |journal=[[Violence &amp; Victims|Violence and Victims]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |date=December 1995 |pages=251–272 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/vav/1995/00000010/00000004/art00001 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |accessdate=2014-06-21 |pmid=8703839}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=George |first=Malcolm J. |title=Invisible touch |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=8 |year=2003 |pages=34, 36 |doi=10.1016/S1359-1789(01)00048-9}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda L. Kelly|Linda Kelly]] has noted that even when dividing the data provided by CTS based studies into that given by men and that given by women (such as in the 2001 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health), the rate of female perpetrated IPV remains at roughly the same level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Disabusing the definition of domestic abuse: how women batter men and the role of the feminist state |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/flsulr30&amp;div=43 |last=Kelly |first=Linda |authorlink=Linda L.

Indeed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to expectations, agreement between partners did not vary with the perpetrator’s gender or with the type of abusive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moffitt |first1=Terrie |last2=Caspi |first2=Avshalom |title=Findings About Partner Violence From the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study |journal=Research in Brief |date=July 1999 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

R. Emerson Dobash and Russell P. Dobash have also criticized the CTS, arguing that it is improper to equate male IPV with female IPV. They question the methodology behind the CTS, the data which stems from it and the theoretical framework used by investigators who champion it, arguing that male aggression is much more severe than female aggression and the two should not be measured by the same tool on the same scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R.

Another critic, Kersti Yllö, who holds Straus and those who use the CTS accountable for damaging the gains of the battered women's movement, by releasing their findings into the "marketplace of ideas". She argues that, as sociologists committed to ending domestic violence, they should have foreseen the controversy such statistics would cause and the damage it could potentially do to battered women.&lt;ref name="Kersti"/&gt; Similarly, Nancy Worcester refers to studies which find evidence of gender symmetry and high levels of bidirectionality as part of the "[[Antifeminism|anti-feminist backlash]]", arguing that studies which use the CTS demonstrate the "limitations and dangers of a gender-neutral approach to anti-violence work".&lt;ref name="Worcester"/&gt;

Straus argues that it is more harmful to women to attempt to tackle the problem of domestic abuse without proper strategy based on facts: "The research shows that this so-called harmless violence by women because a meta-analysis by Stith and colleagues (2004) found that a woman's perpetration of violence was the strongest predictor of her being a victim of partner violence."&lt;ref name="Symmetry"/&gt;

Straus responded to criticism of the CTS by arguing that it is driven by [[Radical feminism|radical-feminists]] who are uncomfortable with any evidence that women can be as violent as men because it undermines their belief that IPV is an extension of men's desire to subjugate women; "one of the explanations for denying the evidence on gender symmetry is to defend feminism in general. This is because a key step in the effort to achieve an equalitarian society is to bring about recognition of the harm that a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal system]] causes. The removal of patriarchy as the main cause of IPV weakens a dramatic example of the harmful effects of patriarchy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |date=June 2010 |title=Thirty years of denying the evidence on gender symmetry in partner violence: implications for prevention and treatment |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=349 |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332}} [http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718174010/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf |date=July 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Straus also points out that despite being critical of the CTS, numerous feminist researchers use it for their own research, and that it was CTS based studies which first illustrated and brought to the public's attention the extent of the battered women problem in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Symmetry"/&gt;

==Battered husband syndrome==
The most controversial aspect of female perpetrated IPV is the theory of "battered husband syndrome". In reaction to the findings of the U.S. National Family Violence Survey in 1975,&lt;ref name="National"/&gt; Suzanne K. Steinmetz wrote an article in 1977 in which she coined the term as a correlative to "battered wife syndrome".&lt;ref name="Steinmetz_1977" /&gt; Steinmetz conducted several empirical investigations prior to writing her article. Using a broad-based non-representative sample of fifty-four couples, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 47% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 43%. She further found that while 39% of husbands had thrown objects, 31% of wives had done likewise; 31% of husbands had pushed or shoved their partner, compared to 32% of wives; 20% of husbands had hit their wives, 20% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 10% of wives had hit their husbands with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinmetz |first1=Suzanne K. |date=1977 |title=Cycle of Violence: Assertive, Aggressive and Abusive Family Interactions |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |isbn=9780275914769}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, using a sample of fifty-two Canadian college students, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 23% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 21%. Further investigation found that 21% of both husbands and wives had thrown objects; 17% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 13% of wives; 13% of husbands had hit their wives, 13% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 12% of wives had hit their husbands with an object.&lt;ref name="Steinmetz_1977" /&gt;{{rp|501–503}} In a third study, using a random sample of ninety-four people, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 32% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 28%. Further investigation found that 31% of husbands had thrown objects compared to 25% of wives; 22% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 18% of wives; 17% of husbands had hit their wives, 12% of wives had hit their husbands; 12% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 14% of wives had hit their husbands with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinmetz |first1=Suzanne K. |title=The Use of Force for Resolving Family Conflict: The Training Ground for Abuse |journal=The Family Coordinator |volume=26 |issue=1 |date=January 1977 |pages=19–26 |doi=10.2307/581856 |jstor=581856}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings led Steinmetz to conclude that IPV was roughly reciprocal between husbands and wives, with a similar level of intentionality between men and women; "women are as likely to select physical conflict to resolve marital conflict as are men ... women have the potential to commit acts of violence and under certain circumstances, they do carry out these acts".&lt;ref name="Steinmetz_1977" /&gt;{{rp|505}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinmatz |first1=Suzanne K. |chapter=Wifebeating, husband beating — a comparison of the use of physical violence between spouses to resolve marital fights |title=Battered Women: A Psychosociological Study of Domestic Violence |editor1-last=Roy |editor1-first=Maria |date=1977 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |location=New York |pages=63–72 |isbn=9780442272012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malcolm J. George, Steinmetz' article "represented a point of departure and antithetical challenge to the otherwise pervasive view of the seemingly universality of female vulnerability in the face of male hegemony exposed by the cases of battered wives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=George |first=Malcolm J. |title=Invisible touch |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=8 |year=2003 |page=32 |doi=10.1016/S1359-1789(01)00048-9}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinmetz' colleague, [[Richard J. Gelles]], publicly addressed confusion caused by the research and [[Fathers' rights groups|father's rights groups]] "significant distortion" of the data in his public response ''Domestic Violence: Not An Even Playing Field'', "Indeed, men are hit by their wives, they are injured, and some are killed. But, are all men hit by women battered? No. Men who beat their wives, who use emotional abuse and blackmail to control their wives, and are then hit or even harmed, cannot be considered battered men. A battered man is one who is physically injured by a wife or partner and has not physically struck or psychologically provoked her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fathersmanifesto.net/gelles.htm |title=Richard Gelles:  oh so magnanimous, and dead wrong |website=''fathersmanifesto.net'' |access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinmetz' claims in her article, and her use of the phrase "battered husband syndrome" in particular, aroused a great deal of controversy, with many scholars criticizing research flaws in her work. In particular, she was criticized for not differentiating between verbal and physical aggression or between intentionality and action (wanting to hit was considered the same as actually hitting). For example, [[David Finkelhor]] argues that Steinmetz' methodology was unacceptably unscientific. He argues that her work looks at all violence as fundamentally similar; there is no differentiation between male and female violence, or violence against a child and violence against a wife, such as a mother spanking a child and a father breaking a mother's ribs. Finkelhor sees this as especially important insofar as it does not allow a differentiation between ongoing systemic abuse and once-off violence, or between disciplining a child and beating a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finkelhor |first1=David |authorlink=David Finkelhor |chapter=Common Features of Family Abuse |editor1-last=Finkelhor |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Hotaling |editor2-first=Gerald T. |editor3-last=Gelles |editor3-first=Richard J. |editor4-last=Straus |editor-first4=Murray A. |title=The Dark Side of Families: Current Family Violence Research |pages=17–30 |date=1983 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=9780803919358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of female-perpetrated IPV==
The question of what causes female perpetrated IPV is another controversial subject. Donald G. Dutton and Tonia L. Nicholls write that traditional feminist theory "views all social relations through the prism of gender relations and holds, in its [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] view, that men (the [[bourgeoisie]]) hold power advantages over women (the [[proletariat]]) in patriarchal societies and that all domestic violence is either male physical abuse to maintain that power advantage or female defensive violence, used for self-protection".&lt;ref name="Paradigm"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.amen.ie/reports/28004.pdf |title=The gender paradigm in domestic violence research and theory: Part 1 — The conflict of theory and data |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |date=September 2005 |volume=10 |issue=6 |last1=Dutton |first1=Donald G. |last2=Nicholls |first2=Tonia L. |page=682 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, any IPV committed by women against men is by way of self-defense. Linda Kelly writes that "in conceding that women do engage in acts of domestic violence, female use of violence is justified as self-defense—a lifesaving reaction of women who are being physically attacked by their male partners. The development of the battered woman syndrome as a defense for crimes committed against abusive male partners, including homicide, evidences the wide acceptance of a woman's use of violence as self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Disabusing the Definition of Domestic Abuse: How Women Batter Men and the Role of the Feminist State |url=https://ir.law.fsu.edu/lr/vol30/iss4/7 |last=Kelly |first=Linda |authorlink=Linda L. Kelly |journal=[[Florida State University Law Review]] |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=806 |date=Summer 2003 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that when women commit IPV, it is probably justified because they were previously victims and, therefore, the male was the "primary aggressor." Thus, the woman's violent behavior is caused by her background as a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Leonore E. |title=The Battered Woman Syndrome |publisher=Springer |location=New York |date=1984 |isbn=9780826102522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tower |first1=Leslie E. |last2=Fernandez |first2=Maria Elena |title=English- and Spanish-Speaking Women's Use of Violence |date=January 2008 |journal=[[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]] |pages=23–38 |volume=23 |issue=1 |url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/23/1/21.abstract |accessdate=2014-06-21 |doi=10.1177/0886260507307649}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Carlos Ramírez explains that given the socially accepted model of femininity as one of submission, passivity and abnegation, whatever behavior does not follow this stereotype will be perceived in an exaggerated manner as abnormal and violent. Thus, women will be perceived as disproportionately aggressive even if merely defending themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ramírez |first1=Juan Carlos |title=Madejas entreveradas: Violencia, masculinidad y poder |trans-title=Interlocked skeins: Violence, masculinity and power |year=2005 |publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara |location=Guadalajara |language=Spanish |isbn=978-970-722-360-8}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analyses of the research find that the overwhelming majority of women's IPV against male partners is in the context of being victimized.&lt;ref name="pmid18624096" /&gt; A 2010 systematic review of the literature on women's perpetration of IPV found that anger, [[self-defense]] and retaliation were common motivations but that distinguishing between self-defense and retaliation was difficult.&lt;ref name="pmid20823071"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bair-Merritt |first=Megan H |last2=Crowne |first2=Sarah Shea |last3=Thompson |first3=Darcy A |last4=Sibinga |first4=Erica |last5=Trent |first5=Maria |last6=Campbell |first6=Jacquelyn |year=2010 |title=Why Do Women Use Intimate Partner Violence?

For example, in a 1996 study of 1,978 people in England, 21% of women who admitted to committing IPV gave self-defense as a reason. More prevalent reasons were "Get through to" (53%), "Something said" (52%) and "Make do something" (26%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aggression in British Heterosexual Relationships: A Descriptive Analysis |last1=Carrado |first1=Michelle |last2=George |first2=Malcolm J. |last3=Loxam |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Jones |first4=L. |last5=Templar |first5=Dale |journal=Aggressive Behavior |volume=22 |issue=6 |date=June 1996 |pages=401–415 |url=http://www.batteredmen.com/carrgeo1.htm |accessdate=2014-06-21 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:6&lt;401::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a five-year study of 978 college students from California, concluded in 1997, Martin S. Fiebert and Denise M. Gonzalez found an IPV rate amongst women of 20%. Within this group, perpetrators were asked to select reasons as to why they assaulted their partner, with the option to choose multiple reasons. The breakdown of reasons had "my partner wasn't sensitive to my needs" as the most prevalent (46%). Also found more frequently than self-defense were "I wished to gain my partner's attention" (44%) and "My partner was not listening to me" (43%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Women who initiate assaults: The reasons offered for such behavior |last1=Fiebert |first1=Martin S. |last2=Gonzalez |first2=Denise M. |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=80 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=583–590 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1997.80.2.583 |pmid=9129375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking beyond self-defense, studies have found a range of causes for female-perpetrated IPV. Writing of the feminist theory which regards reinforcement of patriarchy as a primary cause of IPV, Murray A. Straus writes "Patriarchy and male dominance in the family are clearly among the causes [of IPV], but there are many others. However, with rare exceptions, current offender treatment programs are based on the assumption that the primary cause is male dominance. Thus, they proceed under an erroneous assumption. Illustrative of this fallacious single-cause approach are the state-mandated offender treatment programs that forbid treating other causes, such as inadequate [[anger management]] skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |date=June 2010 |title=Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=351 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Rose A. Medeiros and Murray A. Straus conducted a study using a sample of 854 students (312 men and 542 women) from two American universities. They identified fourteen specific risk factors common amongst both males and females who had committed IPV; poor anger management, [[antisocial personality disorder]]s, [[borderline personality disorder]]s, pattern of dominating relationships, [[substance abuse]], criminal history, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]s, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], communication problems, [[jealousy]], [[sexual abuse]] as a child, [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], and a general attitudinal approval of partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Medeiros |first1=Rose A. |last2=Straus |first2=Murray A. |chapter=Risk Factors for Physical Violence Between Dating Partners: Implications for Gender-Inclusive Prevention and Treatment of Family Violence |title=Family Approaches to Domestic Violence: A Practitioner's Guide to Gender-Inclusive Research and Treatment |editor1-last=Hamel |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Nicholls |editor2-first=Tonia |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |pages=59–87 |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID28-PR28.pdf |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straus states that most female perpetrated IPV is not motivated by self-defense, but by a desire to control their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.010 |title=Gender symmetry and mutuality in perpetration of clinical-level partner violence: Empirical evidence and implications for prevention and treatment |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=279 |year=2011 |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a study involving 1,104 male and female students in their late teens and early twenties found that women are more likely than men to be controlling and aggressive towards their partners, more likely to demonstrate a desire to control their partners, and more likely to use physical aggression in ensuring that control. The main author of the study, Elizabeth Bates, wrote "this suggests that intimate partner violence may not be motivated by patriarchal values and needs to be studied within the context of other forms of aggression, which has potential implications for interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Testing predictions from the male control theory of men's partner violence |date=January 2014 |journal=Aggressive Behavior |volume=40 |issue=1 |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth A. |last2=Graham-Kevan |first2=Nicholas |last3=Archer |first3=John |pages=46–50 |doi=10.1002/ab.21499 |pmid=23878077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other explanations for both male and female-perpetrated IPV include [[psychopathology]], anger, revenge, skill deficiency, head injuries, biochemical imbalances, feelings of powerlessness, lack of resources, and frustration.&lt;ref&gt;''Articles'':

Current literature on IPV has alternative viewpoints in relation to gender symmetry theory. A 2008 review published in journal of ''[[Violence &amp; Victims|Violence and Victims]]'' found that although less serious situational violence or altercation was equal for both genders, more serious and violent abuse was perpetrated by men. It was also found that women's physical violence was more likely motivated by self-defense or fear while men's was more likely motivated by control.&lt;ref name="pmid18624096" /&gt; A 2011 systematic review from the journal of ''Trauma Violence Abuse'' also found that the common motives for female on male domestic violence were anger, a need for attention, or as a response to their partner's own violence.&lt;ref name="pmid20823071" /&gt;  Another 2011 review published in the journal of ''[[Aggression and Violent Behavior]]'' also found that although minor domestic violence was equal, more severe violence was perpetrated by men. It was also found that men were more likely to beat up, choke or strangle their partners, while women were more likely to throw things at their partner, slap, kick, bite, punch, or hit with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf?accept=1 |title=Gender differences in self-reports of intimate partner violence: A review |last=Chan |first=KL |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |year=2011 |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.02.008 |volume=16 |pages=167–175 |access-date=2016-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223015704/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf?accept=1 |archive-date=2015-12-23 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also found different outcomes in men and women in response to intimate partner violence. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered disproportionately as a result of IPV especially in terms of injuries, fear, and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes |last=Caldwell |first=Jennifer E |journal=Psychology of Violence |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=42&amp;ndash;57 |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |doi=10.1037/a0026296 |year=2012 |ref=harv |postscript=.}} [http://people.cas.sc.edu/swansc/1.swan_web_articles/2012_CaldwellSwan_GenderDiffIPVOutcomes.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222165142/http://people.cas.sc.edu/swansc/1.swan_web_articles/2012_CaldwellSwan_GenderDiffIPVOutcomes.pdf |date=December 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42–45}} The review also found that 70% of female victims in one of their studies were "very frightened" in response to intimate partner violence from their partners, but 85% of male victims cited "no fear".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The review also found that IPV mediated the satisfaction of the relationship for women but it did not do so for men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Gender asymmetry is also consistent with government findings. According to government statistics from the US Department of Justice, male perpetrators constituted 96% of federal prosecution on domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Durose |first=Matthew R. |title=Family Violence Statistics Including Statistics on Strangers and Acquaintances |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs02.pdf |website=bjs.gov |publisher=US Department of Justice |year=2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054500/http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs02.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report by the US Department of Justice on non-fatal domestic violence from 2003–2012 found that 76 percent of domestic violence was committed against women and 24 percent were committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Truman |first=Jennifer L. |title=Nonfatal Domestic Violence, 2003–2012 |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf |website=bjs.gov |publisher=US Department of Justice |year=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117112249/http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf |archive-date=2016-01-17 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ruth M. Mann of the University of Windsor, an expert on sociology and criminology, stated her opposition to the gender symmetry theory of domestic violence on the grounds that women as well as children are the main victims in the "annual pile up" (Coyle, 2001) of victims being murdered by intimate partners and fathers throughout Canada (AuCoin, 2005; Ogrodnik, 2006).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;

==Responses==
Police services in several locations have expanded their domestic violence programs and response units in an effort to deal with IPV against men. [[Women's shelter|Shelters]] specifically for men have been set up in the UK; as of 2010, there are sixty refuge places available to men throughout England and Wales, compared to 7,500 places for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More than 40% of domestic violence victims are male, report reveals |first=Denis |last=Campbell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/05/men-victims-domestic-violence |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 5, 2010 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] has also campaigned to spread awareness of the problem of male victimization and to promote reporting of incidents. The country's first shelter for male abuse victims, Men's Aid NI, opened in early 2013. Chairman Peter Morris has remarked, "Domestic violence against men can take many forms, including emotional, sexual and physical abuse and threats of abuse. It can happen in heterosexual and same-sex relationships and, as with domestic abuse against females, can go largely unreported."&lt;ref name="McNeilly"/&gt;

'''Dāna''' ([[Devanagari]]: दान) is a [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] word that connotes the virtue of generosity, [[charity (practice)|charity]] or giving of [[alms]] in Indian philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole (1991), Moral Issues in Six Religions, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0435302993}}, pages 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ckc17/&gt; It is alternatively transliterated as ''daana''.&lt;ref name=shahsoulful&gt;Shah et al (2013), Soulful Corporations: A Values-Based Perspective on Corporate Social Responsibility, Springer, {{ISBN|978-8132212744}}, page 125, Quote: "The concept of Daana (charity) dates back to the Vedic period. The Rig Veda enjoins charity as a duty and responsibility of every citizen."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Hasan and J Onyx (2008), Comparative Third Sector Governance in Asia, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1441925961}}, page 227&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], dāna is the practice of cultivating generosity. It can take the form of giving to an individual in distress or need.&lt;ref name=ganguli311/&gt; It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.&lt;ref name=ganguli/&gt;

According to historical records, dāna is an ancient practice in Indian traditions, tracing back to [[Vedic]] traditions.&lt;ref name="shahsoulful"/&gt;&lt;ref name=birunihind/&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism}}
Dāna (Sanskrit: दान) means giving, often in the context of donation and charity.&lt;ref name=sedict&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dAna&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 दान] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In other contexts, such as rituals, it can simply refer to the act of giving something.&lt;ref name=sedict/&gt; Dāna is related to and mentioned in ancient texts with concepts of ''Paropakāra'' (परोपकार) which means benevolent deed, helping others;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=paropakAra&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 परोपकार] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helena Águeda Marujo and Luis Miguel Neto (2013), Positive Nations and Communities, Springer, {{ISBN|978-9400768680}}, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dakshina'' (दक्षिणा) which means gift or fee one can afford;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dakSiNA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 दक्षिणा] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James G. Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 169&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bhiksha'' (भिक्षा), which means alms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dakSiNA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 bhikSA] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Garcia Gomez et al. (2014), Religious Perspectives on Human Vulnerability in Bioethics, Springer, {{ISBN|978-9401787352}}, pages 170-171&lt;/ref&gt;

Dāna has been defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return.&lt;ref name=kandm3&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 361-382&lt;/ref&gt;

While dāna is typically given to one person or family, Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit, sometimes called ''utsarga''. This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house, school, drinking water or irrigation well, planting trees, and building care facility among others.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Agarwal (2010), Daan and Other Giving Traditions in India,{{asin|B00E0R033S}}, page 54-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dāna in Hindu scriptures===
The ''[[Rigveda]]'' has the earliest discussion of ''dāna'' in the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=rhdana&gt;R Hindery, Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol 2, Number 1, page 105&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rigveda'' relates it to ''satya'' "truth" and in another hymn points to the guilt one feels from not giving to those in need.&lt;ref name=rhdana/&gt; It uses ''da'', the root of word ''dāna'', in its hymns to refer to the act of giving to those in distress. [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]], for example, translates Book 10, Hymn 117 of the Rig veda as follows:
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;The Gods have not ordained hunger to be our death: even to the well-fed man comes death in varied shape,
The riches of the liberal never waste away, while he who will not give finds none to comfort him,
The man with food in store who, when the needy comes in miserable case begging for bread to eat,
Hardens his heart against him, when of old finds not one to comfort him.

Bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of food, and the feeble,
Success attends him in the shout of battle. He makes a friend of him in future troubles,
No friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring food, will offer nothing.

Let the rich satisfy the poor implorer, and bend his eye upon a longer pathway,
Riches come now to one, now to another, and like the wheels of cars are ever rolling,
The foolish man wins food with fruitless labour: that food – I speak the truth – shall be his ruin,
He feeds no trusty friend, no man to love him. All guilt is he who eats with no partaker.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The [[Upanishads]], composed before 500 BCE, present some of the earliest Upanishadic discussion of dāna. [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion or love for all sentient life (daya), and charity (dāna).&lt;ref name=kane/&gt;

[[Chandogya Upanishad]], Book III, similarly, states that a virtuous life requires: [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]] (asceticism), '''dāna''' (charity), arjava (straightforwardness), [[ahimsa]] (non-injury to all sentinent beings) and satyavacana (truthfulness).&lt;ref name=kane&gt;PV Kane, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n61/mode/2up Samanya Dharma], History of Dharmasastra, Vol. 2, Part 1, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' describes the right and wrong forms of ''dāna'' in verses 17.20 through 17.22.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pages 653-655&lt;/ref&gt; It defines ''sāttvikam'' (good, enlightened, pure) charity, in verse 17.20, as one given without expectation of return, at the proper time and place, and to a worthy person. It defines ''rajas'' (passion, ego driven, active) charity, in verse 17.21, as one given with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruits and results, or grudgingly. It defines ''tamas'' (ignorant, dark, destructive) charity, in verse 17.22, as one given with contempt, to unworthy person(s), at a wrong place and time. In Book 17, Bhadwad Gita suggests steadiness in ''sattvikam dāna'', or the good form of charity is better; and that ''tamas'' should be avoided.&lt;ref name=ckc17&gt;Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pages 634-661&lt;/ref&gt; These three psychological categories are referred to as the ''[[guṇa]]s'' in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Theos Bernard (1999), Hindu Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813731}}, pages 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Adi Parva]]'' of the Hindu Epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', in Chapter 91, states that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means, then embark on charity; be hospitable to those who come to him; never inflict pain on any living being; and share a portion with others whatever he consumes.&lt;ref&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n143/mode/2up Adi Parva], Chapter XCI, verses 3-4, page 132&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 87 of ''Adi Parva'', it calls sweet speech and refusal to use harsh words or wrong others even if you have been wronged, as a form of charity. In the ''[[Vana Parva]]'', Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must, "conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty".&lt;ref&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n737/mode/2up Vana Parva], Chapter CXCIV, verse 6, page 291&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Anushasana Parva]]'' in Chapter 58, recommends public projects as a form of dāna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data9/upload/0288/145&amp;first=1&amp;last=537&amp;barcode=99999990290213 Anushasana Parva]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062735/http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata9%2Fupload%2F0288%2F145&amp;first=1&amp;last=537&amp;barcode=99999990290213 |date=February 22, 2014 }} The Mahabharata, Translated by Manmatha Nath Dutt (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses the building of drinking water tanks for people and cattle as a noble form of giving, as well as giving of lamps for lighting dark public spaces.&lt;ref name=ganguli/&gt; In later sections of Chapter 58, it describes planting public orchards, with trees that give fruits to strangers and shade to travelers, as meritorious acts of benevolent charity.&lt;ref name=ganguli&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/306/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LVIII] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Published by P.C. Roy (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 59 of Book 13 of the ''Mahabharata'', [[Yudhishthira]] and Bhishma discuss the best and lasting gifts between people:

{{quote|An assurance unto all creatures with love and affection and abstention from every kind of injury, acts of kindness and favor done to a person in distress, whatever gifts are made without the giver's ever thinking of them as gifts made by him, constitute, O chief of Bharata's race, the highest and best of gifts (dāna).|The Mahabharata, XIII.59&lt;ref name=ganguli311&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/310/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LIX] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, pages 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original: −

The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' discusses when dāna is proper and when it is improper. In Book 8, Chapter 19, verse 36 it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one's biological dependents or of one’s own. Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the [[Puranas]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Agarwal (2010), Daan and Other Giving Traditions in India,{{asin|B00E0R033S}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu scriptures exist in many Indian languages. For example, the ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'', written between 200 BCE and 400 CE, is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It discusses charity, dedicating Chapter 23 of Book 1 on Virtues to it.&lt;ref name=gutenberg/&gt; ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' suggests charity is necessary for an virtuous life and happiness. He states in Chapter 23: "Giving to the poor is true charity, all other giving expects some return"; "Great, indeed, is the power to endure hunger.
Greater still is the power to relieve other's hunger"; "Giving alms is a great reward in itself to one who gives".&lt;ref name=gutenberg&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=December 16, 2014 }} see Chapter 23, Book 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tirukkural-tirukkural/oclc/777453934?referer=di&amp;ht=edition Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by V.V.R. Aiyar, Tirupparaithurai : Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 101, he states: "Believing wealth is everything, yet giving away nothing, is a miserable state of mind"; "Vast wealth can be a curse to one who neither enjoys it nor gives to the worthy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_101.htm Wealth That Benefits No One] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216063951/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_101.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} see Chapter 101, Book 1&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Mahabharata, Tirukkuṛaḷ also extends the concept of charity to deeds (body), words (speech) and thoughts (mind). It states that a brightly beaming smile, the kindly light of loving eye, and saying pleasant words with sincere heart is a form of charity that every human being should strive to give.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H. Drew, Rev John Lazarus, and Mr F W Ellis (1886), WH Allen &amp; Company; see section 1.2.6 Verse 93; page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dāna in rituals===
Dāna is also used to refer to [[ritual|rituals]]. For example, in a [[Hindu wedding]], ''kanyādāna'' (कन्यादान) refers to the ritual where a father gives his daughter's hand in marriage to the groom, after asking the groom to promise that he will never fail in his pursuit of [[dharma]] (moral and lawful life), [[artha]] (wealth) and [[kama]] (love). The groom promises to the bride's father, and repeats his promise three times in presence of all gathered as witness.&lt;ref&gt;P.H. Prabhu (2011), Hindu Social Organization, {{ISBN|978-8171542062}}, see pages 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, PV (1974), History of Dharmasastra: Ancient and Medieval Civil Law in India (Vol 2.1), Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. pages 531–538&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of charity includes donating means of economic activity and food source. For example, godāna (donation of a cow),&lt;ref&gt;Padma (1993), The Position of Women in Mediaeval Karnataka, Prasaranga, University of Mysore Press, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; bhudāna (भूदान) (donation of land), and ''vidyādāna'' or [[jnana|jñānadāna]] (विद्यादान, ज्ञानदान): Sharing knowledge and teaching skills, ''aushadhādāna'' (औषधदान): Charity of care for the sick and diseased, ''abhayadāna''(अभयदान): giving freedom from fear (asylum, protection to someone facing imminent injury), and ''anna dāna'' (अन्नादान): Giving food to the poor, needy and all visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Abbe Dubois and Henry Beauchamp (2007), Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies, {{ISBN|978-1602063365}}, pages 223, 483-495&lt;/ref&gt;

===The effect of dāna===
Charity is held as a noble deed in Hinduism, to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity.&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt; Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one's future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity principle]].&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt;
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Living creatures get influenced through dānam,
Enemies lose hostility through dānam,
A stranger may become a loved one through dānam,
Vices are killed by dānam.&lt;/poem&gt;
|A Hindu Proverb|&lt;ref name=krma365&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 365-366&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other Hindu texts, such as ''Vyasa Samhita'', state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but dāna is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives.&lt;ref&gt;MN Dutt (1979), {{Google books|tws7AAAAMAAJ|The Dharma-shastras}}, Volumes 3, Cosmo Publishers, pages 20-29&lt;/ref&gt; The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. Dāna, thus, is a [[dharma|dharmic]] act, requires idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context.&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt; The donor's intent and responsibility for diligence about the effect of dāna on the recipient is considered as important as the dāna itself. While the donor should not expect anything in return with dāna, the donor is expected to make an effort to determine the character of the recipient, likely return to the recipient and to the society.&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt; Some medieval era authors state that ''dāna'' is best done with ''shraddha'' (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without ''anasuya'' (finding faults in the recipient).&lt;ref name=bilimoriadaana/&gt; These scholars of Hinduism, states Kohler, suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of "unquestioning hospitality", where the ''dāna'' ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long term view.&lt;ref name=bilimoriadaana&gt;P Bilimoria et al. (2007), Dana as a Moral Category, in Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges, Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pages 196-197 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dāna in historical records===
[[Al-Biruni]], the Persian historian, who visited and lived in India for 16 years from about 1017, mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay. He wrote, "It is obligatory with them (Hindus) every day to give alms as much as possible."&lt;ref name=birunihind&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 2), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000157.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter LXVII, On Alms and how a man must spend what he earns], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), pages 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|After the taxes, there are different opinions on how to spend their income. Some destine one-ninth of it for alms.&lt;ref&gt;Al Biruni states that another one-ninth is put into savings/reserve, one-ninth in investment/trade for profits&lt;/ref&gt; Others divide this income (after taxes) into four portions. One fourth is destined for common expenses, the second for liberal works of a noble mind, the third for alms, and the fourth for being kept in reserve.| Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī, Tarikh Al-Hind, 11th century AD&lt;ref name="birunihind"/&gt;}}

''Satram''s, called ''Choultry'', ''Dharamsala'' or ''Chathram''s in parts of India, have been one expression of Hindu charity. Satrams are shelters (rest houses) for travelers and the poor, with many serving water and free food. These were usually established along the roads connecting major [[Hindu temple]] sites in [[South Asia]] as well as near major temples.&lt;ref&gt;KN Kumari (1998), History of the Hindu Religious Endowments in Andhra Pradesh, {{ISBN|978-8172110857}}, page 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kota Neelima (2012), Tirupati, Random House, {{ISBN|978-8184001983}}, pages 50-52; Prabhavati C.

[[Hindu temple]]s served as charitable institutions. [[Burton Stein]]&lt;ref name=burste/&gt; states that South Indian temples collected donations (melvarum) from devotees, during the [[Chola dynasty]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire]] periods in 1st millennium through first half of 2nd millennium AD.&lt;ref&gt;SK Aiyangar, Ancient India: Collected Essays on the Literary and Political History, Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|978-8120618503}}, pages 158-164&lt;/ref&gt; These ''dāna'' were then used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation.&lt;ref name=burste&gt;Burton Stein, The Economic Function of a Medieval South Indian Temple, The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19 (February, 1960), pp 163-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton Stein (February 4, 1961), The state, the temple and agriculture development, The Economic Weekly Annual,  pp 179-187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu treatises on dāna===
''[[Mitākṣarā]]'' by [[Vijñāneśvara]] is an 11th-century canonical discussion and commentary on dāna, composed under the patronage of [[Chalukya dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0521605137}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion about charity is included in its thesis on ''ācāra'' (moral conduct).

Major Sanskrit treatises that discuss ethics, methods and rationale for charity and alms giving in Hinduism include, states Maria Heim,&lt;ref name=heim45/&gt; the 12th-century ''Dāna Kānda'' "Book of Giving" by Laksmidhara of [[Kannauj]], the 12th-century ''Dāna Sāgara'' "Sea of Giving" by Ballālasena of [[Bengal]], and the 14th-century sub-book ''Dānakhanda'' in ''Caturvargacintamani'' "The Gem of the Four Aims of Human Life" by Hemadiri of Devagiri (modern [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra]]). The first two are few hundred page treatises each, while the third is over a thousand-page compendium on charity, from a region that is now part of modern-day eastern [[Maharashtra]] and [[Telangana]]; the text influenced Hindus of Deccan region and South India from 14th to 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=heim45&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0521605137}}, pages 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Dāna as a formal religious act is directed specifically to a monastic or spiritually-developed person. In Buddhist thought, it has the effect of purifying and transforming the mind of the giver.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, page 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generosity developed through giving leads to experience of material wealth and possibly being reborn in happy states. In the [[Pāli Canon]]'s ''[[Dighajanu Sutta]]'', generosity (denoted there by the Pāli word ''cāga'', which can be synonymous with ''dāna'') is identified as one of the four traits conditioning happiness and wealth in the next life. Conversely, lack of giving leads to unhappy states and poverty.

Dāna leads to one of the [[pāramitā]]s or "perfections", the ''dānapāramitā''. This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Buddhists believe that giving without seeking anything in return leads to greater spiritual wealth.

Dana is, as with Hindu texts like Mitaksara and Vahni Purana and in Buddhist texts, described as a virtue and [[duty]] in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0521605137}}, pages 47-49&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an act of compassion, and must be done with no desire for material gain.&lt;ref name=thomaswatts&gt;Thomas Watts (2006), Encyclopedia of World Poverty, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-1412918077}}, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; Four types of Dana are discussed in the texts of Jainism: ''Ahara-dana'' (donation of food), ''Ausadha-dana'' (donation of medicine), ''Jnana-dana'' (donation of knowledge) and ''Abhaya-dana'' (giving of protection or freedom from fear, asylum to someone under threat).&lt;ref name=thomaswatts/&gt; Dāna is one of ten means to gain positive karma, in the soteriological theories of Jainism. Medieval era texts of Jainism dedicate a substantial portion of their discussions to the need and virtue of Dāna.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2007), Dāna as a Moral Category, in Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges (Editors: P Bilimoria et al.), Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pages 193-205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
Dāna, called [[Vand Chhako]], is considered one of three duties of Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml Sikh Beliefs] BBC Religions (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The duty entails sharing part of one's earnings with others, by giving to charity and caring for others.

'''Egg donation''' is the process by which a woman donates [[ovum|eggs]] to enable another woman to conceive as part of an assisted reproduction treatment or for biomedical research. For assisted reproduction purposes, egg donation typically involves [[in vitro fertilization]] technology, with the eggs being fertilized in the laboratory; more rarely, unfertilized eggs may be frozen and stored for later use. Egg donation is a [[third party reproduction]] as part of [[assisted reproductive technology]].

In the United States, the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] has issued guidelines for these procedures, and the Food and Drug Administration has a number of guidelines as well. There are boards in countries outside of the US which have the same regulations. However, egg donation agencies in the U.S. can choose whether to abide by the society's regulations or not.

==History==
The first child born from egg donation was reported in Australia in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monashivf.com/treatment/qld/treatments-available/egg-donation/|title=Egg Donation|work=Monash IVF|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1983, a clinic in Southern California reported a pregnancy using egg donation, which led to the birth of the first American child born from egg donation on February 3, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9404EEDC143BF937A35751C0A962948260|title=Infertile Woman Has Baby Through Embryo Transfer|first=Sandra|last=Blakeslee|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1984-02-04|accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure was performed at the Harbor UCLA Medical Center and the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humc.edu/calendar/careacc.html|title=HUMC - Celebrating 50 Years of Caring|publisher=Humc.edu|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the procedure, which is no longer used today, a fertilized egg that was just beginning to develop was transferred from one woman in whom it had been conceived by artificial insemination to another woman who gave birth to the infant 38 weeks later. The sperm used in the artificial insemination came from the husband of the woman who bore the baby.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952517,00.html | work=Time |title=Medicine: A Legal, Moral, Social Nightmare |date=1984-09-10 |accessdate=2010-05-01 |first1=Otto |last1=Friedrich |first2=Anne |last2=Constable |first3=Raji |last3=Samghabadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="neworigins"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952514,00.html |title=The New Origins of Life |magazine=[[TIME]] |first=Claudia |last=Wallis |date=1984-09-10 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, thousands of infertile women, single men and gay male couples had adoption as the only path to parenthood. Advances in IVF and egg donation set the stage to allow open and candid discussion of oocyte and embryo donation as a common practice.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="neworigins"/&gt; This breakthrough has given way to the donation of human oocytes and embryos as a common practice similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations. At the time of this announcement the event was captured by major news carriers and fueled healthy debate and discussion on this practice which affected the future of reproductive medicine by creating a platform for further advancements in woman's health.

This scientific breakthrough changed the outlook for those who were unable to have children due to female infertility and for women who are at high risk for passing on genetic disorders. As IVF developed, the procedures used in egg donation paralleled that development: the egg donor's eggs are now harvested from her ovaries in an outpatient surgical procedure and fertilized in the laboratory, the same procedure used on IVF patients, but the resulting embryo or embryos is then transferred into the intended mother instead of into the woman who provided the egg. Donor oocytes thus give women a mechanism to become pregnant and give birth to a child that will be their biological child (assuming that the recipient woman carries the baby), but not their genetic child. In cases where the recipient's womb is absent or unable to carry a pregnancy, or in cases involving gay male couples, a gestational surrogate is used and the embryos are implanted into her per an agreement with the recipients. The combination of egg donation and surrogacy has enabled gay men, including singer Elton John and his partner, to have biological children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/8235149/Elton-John-baby-Thanks-to-Zacahary-gay-surrogacy-will-become-more-acceptable.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Olga | last=Craig | title=Elton John baby: "Thanks to Zacahary, gay surrogacy will become more acceptable" | date=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oocyte and embryo donation now account for approximately 18% of in vitro fertilization recorded births in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?ClinicPKID=0|title=Clinic Summary Report|publisher=Sartcorsonline.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/08/24/get-used-to-embryo-adoption |title=Get Used to Embryo Adoption[|magazine=TIME |first=Sarah Elizabeth |last=Richards |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work established the technical foundation and legal-ethical framework surrounding the clinical use of human oocyte and embryo donation, a mainstream clinical practice, which has evolved over the past 25 years.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952517-6,00.html | work=Time | title=Medicine: A Legal, Moral, Social Nightmare | date=1984-09-10 | accessdate=2010-05-01 | first1=Otto | last1=Friedrich | first2=Anne | last2=Constable | first3=Raji | last3=Samghabadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building upon this groundbreaking research and since the initial birth announcement in 1984, well over 47,000 live births resulting from donor oocyte embryo transfer have been and continue to be recorded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090220015146/http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm/pdf/first_live_birth_donation.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071008194941/http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm.asp?id=5030] &lt;/ref&gt; in the United States to infertile women, who otherwise would not have had children by any other existing method.

The legal status and cost/compensation models of egg donation vary significantly by country. It may be totally illegal (e.g., Italy, Germany, Austria);&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/13/fertility-treatment-bans-in-europe-draw-criticism/ | work=Fox News | title=Fertility treatment bans in Europe draw criticism | date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/germanys-egg-donation-prohibition-is-outdated-experts-say/a-2999675-1|title=Germany′s Egg Donation Prohibition Is Outdated, Experts Say - Germany - DW.DE - 12.12.2007|work=DW.DE|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal only if anonymous and gratuitous—that is, without any compensation for the egg donor (e.g., France);&lt;ref name="dondovocytes.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dondovocytes.fr/comment-faire/ce-que-dit-la-loi/|title=Ce que dit la loi - Don d'ovocytes|publisher=Dondovocytes.fr|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal only if ''non''-anonymous and gratuitous (e.g., Canada); legal only if anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (the compensation is often described as being to offset her inconvenience and expenses) (e.g., Spain, Czech Republic, South Africa, Greece); legal only if ''non''-anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the UK);&lt;ref name="ngdt.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdt.co.uk/donation-and-the-law|title=Donation and the Law|publisher=Ngdt.co.uk|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105151107/http://www.ngdt.co.uk/donation-and-the-law|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or legal whether or not it is anonymous, and egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the US).

==Indication==
A need for egg donation may arise for a number of reasons. Infertile couples may resort to egg donation when the female partner cannot have genetic children because her own eggs cannot generate a viable pregnancy, or because they could generate a viable pregnancy but the chances are so low that it is not advisable or not financially feasible to do IVF with her own eggs. This situation is often, but not always based on advanced reproductive age. It can also be due to early onset of menopause, which can occur as early as their 20s. In addition, some women are born without ovaries, while some women's reproductive organs have been damaged or surgically removed due to disease or other circumstances. Another indication would be a genetic disorder on part of the woman that either renders her infertile or would be dangerous for any offspring, problems that can be circumvented by using eggs from another woman. Many women have none of these issues, but continue to be unsuccessful using their own eggs—in other words, they have undiagnosed infertility—and thus turn to donor eggs or donor embryos. As stated above, egg donation is also helpful for gay male couples using [[surrogacy]] (see [[LGBT parenting]]).

In the US and UK, if desired (and if the egg donor agrees), the couple can meet and get acquainted with the egg donor, her children and family members. More often, egg donations are anonymous or semi-anonymous (i.e. the egg donor may provide personal and medical information, photographs of herself and/or family members, and an email or third party willing to convey communications between the donor and recipients). In some countries, the law requires non-anonymity (e.g., the UK). In other countries, the law requires anonymity (e.g., France, Spain, the Czech Republic, South Africa). In the US the choice between anonymity, semi-anonymity and non-anonymity is made by the donor and recipient, although some IVF clinics that maintain their own databases of egg donors strongly encourage or require anonymity.

==Types of donors==
Donors includes the following types:
*Donors unrelated to the recipients who do it for altruistic and/or monetary reasons. In the US they are ''anonymous donors'' or ''semi-anonymous donors'' recruited by ''egg donor agencies'' or IVF clinics. Such donors may also be ''non-anonymous donors'', i.e., they may exchange identifying and contact information with the recipients. In most countries other than the US and UK, the law requires such donors to remain anonymous.
*'''Designated donors''', e.g. a friend or relative brought by the patients to serve as a donor specifically to help them. In Sweden and France, couples who can bring such a donor still get another person as a donor, but instead get advanced on the waiting list for the procedure, and that donor rather becomes a "cross donor".&lt;ref&gt;''cross donor'' is termed ''korsdonator'' in Swedish.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the couple brings a designated donor, she donates anonymously to another couple, and the couple that brought her receives eggs from another anonymous donor much more quickly than they would have if they had not been able to provide a designated donor.
*Patients taking part in '''shared oocyte programmes'''. Women who go through [[in vitro fertilization]] may be willing to donate unused eggs to such a program, where the egg recipients together help paying the cost of the In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Check | first1 = JH | title = The shared donor oocyte program: the advantages and insights it provides in determining etiologic factors of infertility | url = http://www.ccivf.com/pdf_files/pdf%20articles/CATEGO~6/003.PDF | journal = Clinical and experimental obstetrics &amp; gynecology | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 229–34 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12635736 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708125320/http://www.ccivf.com/pdf_files/pdf%20articles/CATEGO~6/003.PDF | archivedate = 2011-07-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very cost-effective compared to other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/ViewResource.aspx?resID=245239 Cost analysis of shared oocyte in vitro fertilization]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Peskin B D, Austin C, Lisbona H, Goldfarb J M.

==Procedure==
{{Expert needed|Medicine|date=November 2008}}
Egg donors are first recruited, screened, and give consent before participating in the IVF process. Once the egg donor is recruited, she undergoes [[IVF]] stimulation therapy, followed by the egg retrieval procedure. After retrieval, the ova are fertilized by the sperm of the male partner (or sperm donor) in the laboratory, and, after several days, the best resulting embryo(s) is/are placed in the uterus of the recipient, whose [[uterine lining]] has been appropriately prepared for [[embryo transfer]] beforehand. The recipient is usually, but [[surrogacy|not always]], the person who requested the service and then will carry and deliver the [[pregnancy]] and keep the baby.

===The egg donor's process in detail===
Before any intensive medical, psychological, or genetic testing is done on a donor, they must first be chosen by a recipient from the profiles on agency or clinic databases (or, in countries where donors are required to remain anonymous, they are chosen by the recipient's doctor based on their physical and temperamental resemblance to the recipient woman). This is due to the fact that all of the mentioned examinations are expensive and the agencies must first confirm that a match is possible or guaranteed before investing in the process.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"&gt;Almeling, Rene. American Sociological Review. Vol. 72, No. 3 (Jun 2007), pp. 319-340.&lt;/ref&gt; Each egg donor is first referred to a psychologist who will evaluate if she is mentally prepared to undertake and complete the donation process. These evaluations are necessary to ensure that the donor is fully prepared and capable of completing the donation cycle safely and successfully. The donor is then required to undergo a thorough medical examination, including a pelvic exam, blood draw to check hormone levels and to test for infectious diseases, Rh factor, blood type, and drugs and an ultrasound to examine her ovaries, uterus and other pelvic organs. A family history of approximately the past three generations is also required, meaning that adoptees are usually not accepted because of the lack of past health knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; Genetic testing is also usually done on donors to ensure that they do not carry mutations (e.g., cystic fibrosis) that could harm the resulting children; however, not all clinics automatically perform such testing and thus recipients must clarify with their clinics whether such testing will be done.

Once the screening is complete and a legal contract signed, the donor will begin the donation cycle, which typically takes between three and six weeks. An egg retrieval procedure comprises both the '''Egg Donor's Cycle''' and the '''Recipient's Cycle'''. Birth control pills are administered during the first few weeks of the egg donation process to synchronize the donor's cycle with the recipient's, followed by a series of injections which halt the normal functioning of the donor's ovaries. These injections may be self-administered on a daily basis for a period of one to three weeks. Next, [[follicle-stimulating hormone]]s (FSH) are given to the donor to stimulate egg production and increases the number of mature eggs produced by the ovaries. Throughout the cycle the donor is monitored often by a physician using blood tests and ultrasound exams to determine the donor's reaction to the hormones and the progress of [[ovarian follicle|follicle]] growth.

Once the doctor decides the follicles are mature, he/she will establish the date and time for the egg retrieval procedure. Approximately 36 hours before retrieval, the donor must administer one last injection of [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|HCG]] hormone to ensure that her eggs are ready to be harvested. The egg retrieval itself is a minimally invasive surgical procedure lasting 20–30 minutes, performed under sedation (but sometimes without any). A small ultrasound-guided needle is inserted through the vagina to [[:wikt:aspirate|aspirate]] the follicles in both ovaries, which extracts the eggs. After resting in a recovery room for an hour or two, the donor is released. Most donors resume regular activities by the next day.

==Results==
In the United States, egg donor cycles have a success rate of over 60%. (See statistics at http://www.sart.org.) When a "fresh cycle" is followed by a "frozen cycle", the success rate with donor eggs is approximately 80%.

With egg donation, women who are past their reproductive years or [[menopause]] can still become pregnant. [[Adriana Iliescu]] held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and donated egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006.

==Recipient and donor motivation==

===Intended parent motivation===
Women may resort to egg donation because their ovaries may not be able to produce a substantial number of viable eggs. Women may experience premature ovarian failure and stop producing viable eggs during their reproductive years. Some women may be born without ovaries. Ovaries damaged by chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also no longer produce healthy eggs. Older women with diminished ovarian reserves or older women who are going through menopause could also become pregnant with egg donation.&lt;ref name="Sophia tsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dunyaivf.blogspot.gr/2014/11/why-people-choose-to-proceed-with-egg.html|title=Why people choose to proceed with egg donation? - Egg Donation|publisher=dunyaivf.co.uk|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who produce healthy eggs may also elect to use a donor egg so they will not pass on genetic diseases.

===Donor motivation===
An egg donor may be motivated to donate eggs for altruistic reasons. A survey of 80 American women showed that 30% were motivated by altruism alone, another 20% were attracted only by monetary compensation, while 40% of donors were motivated by both reasons. The same study found that 45% of egg donors were students the first time they donated and averaged $4,000 for each donation.&lt;ref name="Kara N. Maxwell 2008"&gt;Kara N. Maxwell, Ina N. Cholst, Zev Rosenwaks. (2008). The incidence of both serious and minor complications in young women undergoing oocyte donation, Fertility and Sterility. 90: 2165-2171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the donors may be motivated by both monetary and altruistic reasons, egg agencies desire and prefer to choose donors that are strictly providing eggs for altruistic reasons.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; The European Union limits any financial compensation for donors to at most $1500. In some countries, most notably Spain and Cyprus, this has limited donors to the poorest segments of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/it%E2%80%99s-not-altruism-it%E2%80%99s-selling|title=The Cyprus Scramble: An Investigation into Human Egg Markets - Pulitzer Center|publisher=Pulitzercenter.org|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, donors are paid regardless of how many eggs she produces. A donor’s compensation may increase for each additional time she provides eggs, especially if the donor’s eggs have a history of reliably resulting in the recipient becoming pregnant.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; In the United States, egg-broker agencies are known for advertising to college students who are more likely to be in financial situations that motivate them to participate for the financial compensation. It is not unusual for one student to donate many times. Often, this is done without consideration of potential long-term health consequences. Such a student is arguably not making the decision to donate her eggs autonomously due to her unfavorable financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483%2810%2960647-5/abstract|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|publisher=rbmojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==

===Egg donor===
The procedures for the donor and the medication given to her are identical to the procedures and medications used in autologous IVF (i.e., IVF on patients who are using their own eggs). The egg donor thus has the same low risk of complications from IVF as an autologous IVF patient would, such as bleeding from the oocyte recovery procedure and reaction to the hormones used to induce hyperovulation (producing more than one egg), including [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] (OHSS) and, rarely, liver failure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Techniques, Laboratory and Clinical Perspectives, edited by David K. Gardner, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jansen and Tucker, writing in the same assisted reproductive technologies textbook referenced above,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the risk of OHSS varies with the clinic administering the hormones, from 6.6 to 8.4% of cycles, half of them "severe." The most severe form of OHSS is life-threatening. Recent studies have found that donors were at less risk of OHSS when the final maturation of oocytes was induced by GnRH agonist than with recombinant hCG. Both hormones were comparable in the number of mature oocytes produced and fertilization rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/09513590802404013 | last1 = Galindo | first1 = A. | last2 = Bodri | first2 = D. | last3 = Guillen | first3 = J.J. | last4 = Colodron | first4 = M. | last5 = Vernaeve | first5 = V. | last6 = Coll | first6 = O. | year = 2009 | title = Triggering with HCG or GnRH agonist in GnRH antagonist treated oocyte donation cycles: a randomized clinical trial | url = | journal = Gynecol Endocrinol | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 60–6 | pmid = 19165664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.11.049 | last1 = Bodri | first1 = D. | last2 = Guillen | first2 = J.J. | last3 = Galindo | first3 = A. | last4 = Mataro | first4 = D. | last5 = Pujol | first5 = A. | last6 = Coll | first6 = O. | year = 2009 | title = Triggering with human chorionic gonadotropin or a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist-treated oocyte donor cycles:findings of large retrospective cohort study | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 91 | issue = 2| pages = 365–71 | pmid = 18367175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger study in the Netherlands found 10 documented cases of deaths from IVF, with a rate of 1:10,000.

The long-term effect of egg donation on donors has not been well studied, but because the same medications and procedures are used, it should be essentially the same as the long-term effect (if any) of IVF on patients using their own eggs. The evidence of increased cancer risk is equivocal; some studies have pointed to a slightly increased risk while other studies have found no such risk or even a slightly reduced risk in most patients (women with a family history of breast cancer, however, may have a higher risk).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2008/12/26/risks-and-benefits-of-egg-donation-reported.html?PageNr=1|title=Risks and Benefits of Egg Donation Reported|work=US News &amp; World Report|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In vitro fertilization and breast cancer risk: a review|first=M|last=Salhab|newspaper=International journal of fertility and women's medicine|date=November 2005|pmid=16526416|volume=50|issue=6|pages=259–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 in 5 women report psychological effects—which may be positive or negative—from donating their eggs, and two-thirds of egg donors were happy with the decision to donate their eggs.

Maxwell 2008"/&gt; In accordance with the American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines, female donors are given a limit of 6 cycles that they may donate in order to minimize the possible health risks.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt;

However, it appears that repetitive oocyte donation cycles does not cause accelerated ovarian aging, evidenced by absence of decreased [[anti-Müllerian hormone]] (AMH) in such women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bukulmez O |author2=Li Q |author3=Carr BR |author4=Leader B |author5=Doody KM |author6=Doody KJ |title=Repetitive oocyte donation does not decrease serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels |journal=Fertil.

===Intended parent===
The recipient has a minimal risk of contracting a transmittable disease. While the donor may test negative for HIV, such testing does not exclude the possibility that the donor has contracted [[HIV]] very recently, so the recipient faces a residual risk of exposure. However, the FDA governs this and requires full infectious disease testing no more than 30 days prior to retrieval and/or transfer. Most clinics now require, however, that donors be retested a few days prior to retrieval so the risk to the recipient is minimal. Intimate partners of both the egg donor and the recipient are also tested.

The recipient also trusts that the medical history of the donor and her family is accurate. This factor of trust should not be underestimated in importance. Donors in the US are paid thousands of dollars; such compensation may attract unscrupulous individuals inclined to conceal their true motivations. However, a full psychological evaluation is required by most IVF clinics, giving an indication if the donor is trustworthy or not.

In more cases than not, there is no ongoing relationship between the donor and recipient following the cycle. Both the donor and recipient agree in formal legal documents that the donation of the eggs is final at the time of retrieval, and typically both parties would like any "relationship" to conclude at that point; if they prefer continued contact, they may provide for that in the contract. Even if they prefer anonymity, however, it remains theoretically possible that in the future, some children may be able to identify their donor(s) using DNA databanks and/or registries (e.g., if the donor submits her DNA to a genealogy site and a child born from her donation later submits its DNA to the same site).

[[Multiple birth]] is a common complication. Incidence of twin births is very high. At the present time, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends that no more than 1 or 2 embryos be transferred in any given cycle. Remaining embryos are frozen, whether for future transfers if the first one fails, for siblings, or for eventual embryo donation.

There appears to be a slightly higher risk of [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] in pregnancies of egg donation.&lt;ref name="van-der-Hoorn2010"/&gt;

===Fetus===
Pregnancies with egg donation are associated with a slightly increased risk of [[placental pathology]].&lt;ref name="van-der-Hoorn2010"/&gt; The local and systemic immunologic changes are also more pronounced than in natural pregnancies, so it has been suggested that the association is caused by reduced [[maternal immune tolerance]] towards the fetus, as the genetic similarity between the carrier and fetus from an egg donation is less than in a natural pregnancy.&lt;ref name="van-der-Hoorn2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq017| last1 = Van Der Hoorn | first1 = M. L. P. | last2 = Lashley | first2 = E. E. L. O. | last3 = Bianchi | first3 = D. W. | last4 = Claas | first4 = F. H. J. | last5 = Schonkeren | first5 = C. M. C. | last6 = Scherjon | first6 = S.

===Custody===
Generally legal documents are signed renouncing rights and responsibilities of custody on the part of the donor. Most IVF doctors will not proceed with administering medication to any donor until these documents are in place and a legal "clearance letter" confirming this understanding is provided to the doctor.

==Legality and financial issues==
The legal status and cost/compensation models of egg donation vary significantly by country. It may be totally illegal (e.g., Italy, Germany);&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de"/&gt; legal only if anonymous and gratuitous—that is, without any compensation for the egg donor (e.g., France);&lt;ref name="dondovocytes.fr"/&gt; legal only if ''non''-anonymous and gratuitous (e.g., Canada); legal only if anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (the compensation is often described as being to offset her inconvenience and expenses) (e.g., Spain, Czech Republic, South Africa); legal only if ''non''-anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the UK);&lt;ref name="ngdt.co.uk"/&gt; or legal whether or not it is anonymous, and egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the US). Because most countries prohibit the sale of body parts, egg donors generally are paid for undergoing the necessary medical procedures rather than for their eggs. In other words, if they complete the cycle, they will be paid the agreed price regardless of how many (or how few) eggs are retrieved.

In countries that prohibit compensation there is an extreme dearth of young women willing to go through this procedure. Additionally, in most countries where it is legal and compensated, the law places a cap on the compensation and that cap tends to be in the vicinity of $1000–$2000. In the US, no law caps the compensation, but the American Society for Reproductive Medicine requires member clinics to abide by their standards, which provide that "sums of $5,000 or more require justification and sums above $10,000 are not appropriate."&lt;ref name="asrm.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/News_and_Publications/Ethics_Committee_Reports_and_Statements/financial_incentives.pdf|format=PDF|title=Financial compensation of oocyte donors|publisher=Asrm.org|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "justification" for payments over $5000 may include previous successful donations, unusually good family health history, or membership in minority ethnicities for which it is more difficult to find donors.

As a result of these legal and financial differences around the world, egg donation in the US is much more expensive than it is in other countries. For instance, at one top US clinic it costs more than $26,000 plus the donor's medications (another several thousand dollars).&lt;ref name="sdfertility.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdfertility.com/secure_fees.htm|title=San Diego IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) Guarantee|publisher=Sdfertility.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having an attorney draft a contract is recommended in order to ensure that the donor has no possible legal rights or responsibilities over the child or any frozen embryos. Hiring an attorney who specializes in reproductive law is thus strongly recommended, at least in the United States; other countries may have other procedures for clarifying the parties' rights, or may simply have legislation that defines the parties' rights. In the US, before the egg donor's IVF cycle begins she typically must sign the Egg Donor Contract, which specifies the rights of the donor and the recipient(s) with respect to the retrieved eggs, the embryos, and any children conceived from the donation. Such contracts should specify that the recipients are the legal parents of the child and the legal owners of any eggs or embryos resulting from the cycle; in other words, while the donor has the right to cancel the cycle at any time prior to egg donation (although if she does so the contract generally provides that she will not be paid), once the eggs are retrieved they belong to the recipient(s). In individual cases the donors and parents may also wish to negotiate terms relating to any unused embryos (e.g., some donors would prefer that unused embryos be destroyed or donated to science, while others would prefer or allow them to be donated to another infertile couple). Some states have also adopted the [[Uniform Parentage Act]], which provides that the recipient or recipients have complete parental responsibility of the conceived child.

In ''Buzzanca v. Buzzanca'', 72 Cal. Rptr.2d 280 (Cal. Ct. App. 1998), the court held that both the recipient and the father of a child conceived through anonymous sperm and egg donation and carried by a surrogate were the legal parents of the child by virtue of their procreative intent. Therefore, the father was required to pay child support even though he sought a divorce before the child was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/Reproductive/980408Child.html|title=California Appellate Court Holds Divorcing Spouses Who Were Intended Parents of Child Resulting from Anonymous Egg and Sperm Donors and Brought to Term by Surrogate to Be Legal Parents of Child|publisher=Law.uh.edu|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donor registries==
{{Main article|Donor registration}}
A donor registry is a registry to facilitate [[donor conceived people]], sperm donors and [[egg donor]]s to establish contact with genetic kindred. They are mostly used by donor conceived people to find genetic half-siblings from the same egg- or sperm donor.

Some donors are non-anonymous, but most are anonymous, i.e. the donor conceived person doesn't know the true identity of the donor. Still, he/she may get the donor number from the fertility clinic. If that donor had donated before, then other donor conceived people with the same donor number are thus genetic half-siblings. In short, donor registries match people who type in the same donor number.

Alternatively, if the donor number isn't available, then known donor characteristics, e.g. hair, eye and skin color may be used in matching.

Donors may also register, and therefore, donor registries may also match donors with their genetic children.

The largest registry is the Donor Sibling Registry- with more than 25,000 members, the DSR has matched almost 7,000 donor conceived people with their egg and sperm donors, as well as with their half siblings. Alternate methods of providing an information link between the donor and recipient (both agreeing to stay registered on the DSR) are often provided for in the legal document (referred to as the "Egg Donor Agreement".)

==Embryo donation==
An alternative to egg donation in some couples, especially those in whom the male partner cannot provide viable sperm, is [[embryo donation]]. Embryo donation is the use of embryos remaining after a couple’s IVF treatments have been completed, to another individual or couple, followed by the placement of those embryos into the recipient woman’s uterus, to facilitate pregnancy and childbirth. Embryo donation is more cost-effective than egg donation on a "per live birth" basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Finger R, Sommerfelt C, Freeman M, Wilson CK, Wade A, Daly D | year = 2010 | title = A cost-effectiveness comparison of embryo donation with oocyte donation | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 379–81 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.03.019 | pmid=19406398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study has found that embryos created for one couple, using an egg donor, are often made available for donation to another couple if the first couple chooses not to use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill GA, Freeman MR | year = 2011 | title = Embryo disposition: Choices made by patients and donor oocyte recipients | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 940–3 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological and social issues==
{{Further information|Donor conceived people#Psychological and social}}

&lt;big&gt;'''Quality of Parent-Infant Relationships'''&lt;/big&gt; 

Quality of parent-child attachment in early infancy has been recognized as a crucial influencer of a child’s socioemotional development. The formation of a quality and secure attachment is largely influenced by parental representations of the parent-child relationship (Imrie, Jadva, Golombok, &amp; Fishel, 2018). Concern regarding relationship quality and attachment security in egg donor families is understandable and typically stems from the absence of genetic material shared between the mother and child. In recent years, researchers have begun to question if lack of genetic commonality between mother and child inhibits the ability to form a quality attachment. 

In a recent study, quality of infant-parent relationships was examined among egg donor families in comparison to in vitro fertilization families (Imrie et al., 2018). Infants were between the ages of 6-18 months. Through use of the Parent Development Interview (PDI) and observational assessment, the study found few differences between family types on the representational level, yet significant differences between family types on the observational level (Imrie et al., 2018). Egg donation mothers were less sensitive and structuring than IVF mothers, and egg donation infants were less emotionally responsive, and involving than IVF infants (Imrie et al., 2018). No differences were found in relationship quality between egg donor fathers and IVF fathers representationally or observationally. Due to the developmental implications of forming healthy parent-child relationships in early infancy, the finding that egg donor mothers were less sensitive and structuring towards their infants raises concern about attachment styles among egg donor families, and the impacts it may have on infants’ future socioemotional development. 


===Telling the child===
Most psychologists recommend being open and honest with children from an early age. Groups for donor conceived children make a strong case for the rights of children to have access to information about their genetic background. For donor conceived children who find out after a long period of secrecy, their main grief is usually not the fact that they are not the genetic child of the mother who raised (and, usually, gave birth to) them, but the fact that their parents lied to them, causing loss of trust.&lt;ref name=barratt/&gt; Furthermore, assuming that egg-donor conceived children have essentially the same reaction as sperm-donor conceived children, the overturning of one's lifelong understanding of who one's genetic parents were may cause a lasting sense of imbalance and loss of control.

Telling the children that they were donor conceived is recommended, based on decades of experience with adoption (and more recent feedback from donor-conceived children) showing that not telling children is harmful to the parent-child relationship and to the child psychologically.&lt;ref name="aboutourkids.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutourkids.org/articles/where_did_i_come_answering_kids039_questions_about_donor_eggs_or_sperm|title=Where did I come from?

*When anyone other than the parents know about the donation, such that the child might find it out from somebody else.&lt;ref name=barratt&gt;Donor insemination Edited by C.L.R. Barratt and I.D. Cooke. Cambridge (England): Cambridge University Press, 1993. 231 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
*When the recipient carries a significant genetic disease, since telling the child will reassure the child that he or she does not carry the disease.&lt;ref name=barratt/&gt;
*Where the child is found to suffer from a genetically-transmitted disorder and it is necessary to take legal action which then identifies the donor.

Conversely, when the child is being raised in a religion or a culture that strongly disapproves of donor conception (e.g., a Catholic country where egg donation is illegal), that may counsel against telling the child, at least until the child is much older and clearly capable of understanding why he or she was not told earlier and of keeping that information to him or herself.

A systematic review of factors contributing to parental decision-making in disclosing donor conception has shown that parents cite the child’s best interest as the main factor they use to make the decision &lt;ref&gt;A. Indekeu, K. Dierickx, P. Schotsmans, K.R. Daniels, P. Rober, and T. D'Hooghe
Factors contributing to parental decision-making in disclosing donor conception: a systematic review.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents who disclose donor conception to the child emphasize the importance of an honest parent-child relationship, while parents who do not disclose express their desire to protect the child from social stigma or other trauma.

===Families sharing same donor===

===Other family members===
Parents of donors may regard the donated eggs as a family asset and may regard the donor conceived people as grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/my-scattered-grandchildren/article1286201/|title=My scattered grandchildren|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donor marketing==
For a donor to be accepted by an agency and repeatedly used she must be marketable and appealing to the recipients. Although egg donation is a significant, life-giving act, the companies participating in this industry still have to operate with an economical mind-set. Matches between egg recipients and egg donors are what make the profit for the company and achievable to continue these processes for others. The most sought-after donors tend to be those who are (1) proven (i.e., have donated before and produced a pregnancy from it, proving themselves both fertile and reliable); (2) conventionally attractive; (3) healthy, with good family health histories; and (4) smart, well educated. 
 
Donor profiles presented on agency websites are their primary marketing tool to find recipients and learn what these future consumers want. On the donor profiles listed on the agency website for recipients, or "clients", to peruse for their desired egg match, "physical characteristics, family health history, educational attainment (in some cases, standardized test scores, GPA, and IQ scores are requested), as well as open-ended questions about hobbies, likes and dislikes, and motivations for donating"&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; are included. Donors are encouraged to submit attractive photos and are advised of what the recipient finds as desirable. Profiles that are at some point deemed unacceptable are deleted, whether it be because their personalities did not stand out or their portrayals were viewed as negative in some way. Overweight volunteers for donation are also most often not accepted, not just because of conventional views on physical attractiveness but also because women with a higher body-mass index tend to respond differently (less well) to ovarian stimulation drugs and IVF clinics thus generally recommend that patients not use donors with higher BMIs. Egg donors also have a higher standard of physical appearance than sperm donors; many sperm donors are not required to provide adult photographs of themselves, or in some cases, any photographs.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt;

== Religious views ==
Some Christian leaders indicate that IVF is acceptable (provided that no fertilized embryos are discarded in the process). Many Christian couples who cannot have children thus can go for IVF, with both the husband's sperm and the wife's egg and this is in line with the church's teaching.

However the issue is more problematic with donor eggs.

There are also some Christian leaders (especially Catholic) who are concerned about all in vitro fertility therapies because they disrupt the natural act of conceiving a child where gamete donations, both egg and [[sperm donation]]s, are seen to "compromise the marital bond and family integrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/commentary_read.php?cdate=2006-05-10|title=AlbertMohler.com|work=AlbertMohler.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they encourage infertile couples to consider adoption instead.

In the Orthodox Jewish community there is no consensus as to whether an egg donor needs to be Jewish in order for the child to be considered Jewish from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=112|title=Egg Donation|publisher=Yoatzot.org|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105174451/http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=112|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s religious authorities said that if the birth mother was Jewish that the child would be Jewish as well, but in the past few years rabbis in Israel have begun to reconsider, which in turn is causing more debate around the world. Conservative Rabbi Elliot Dorff has suggested that there are arguments for both sides (birth mother or genetic mother) in religious scripture. Dean of the Center for the Jewish Future at Yeshiva University believes that any child where the birth mother or the genetic mother isn't Jewish should go through a conversion process in infancy, to be sure that their Judaism isn't questioned later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/what-makes-a-jewish-mother/|title=What Makes a Jewish Mother|first=Caren|last=Chesler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not an issue in the reform community for two reasons. First, only one parent must be Jewish for the child to be considered Jewish; thus, if the father is Jewish, the mother's religion is irrelevant. Second, if the mother who carries the pregnancy and gives birth is Jewish, reform Jews will generally consider that child to be Jewish from birth because it was born of a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html|title=Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent (March 1983) - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emasculation''' of a human male is to deprive (a man) of his male role or identity.

The word also has other meanings which are more commonly used. See below.

==Genital modification and mutilation==
:''For removal of the penis alone, see [[penis removal]].
:''For removal of the testicles alone, see [[castration]].

===In history===
;Europe
In [[Medieval Europe]], emasculation was used as a form of punishment. It was sometimes done when a person was [[hanged, drawn, and quartered]] (a form of execution by [[torture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;China
In ancient [[China]], emasculation was performed as a punishment up until the [[Sui Dynasty]] and [[Tang Dynasty]]. Additionally, some men underwent the procedure as means of becoming employed as an imperial servant or bureaucrat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XuX-MGTZnJoC&amp;pg=PA248 |title=Encyclopedia of birth control|author=Vern L.

;Vietnam
The ancient [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]] adopted China's practice of emasculation and the use of eunuchs as servants and slaves for the monarchy. The procedure was reportedly very painful as both the testicles and penis were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa |url=http://vietbao.vn/Suc-khoe/Chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/2131549871/70/ |newspaper=Viet Bao |date=October 5, 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, the Emperor of Vietnam made a law that said only adult men of high social standing could be emasculated. In the end, most eunuchs ended up being men who had been born with genital abnormalities and then handed over to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Andaya (2006), p. 177  {{Google books|tClCMl7hswQC|The Flaming Womb: Repositioning Women in Early Modern Southeast Asia|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodside (1971), p. 66 {{Google books|0LgSI9UQNpwC|Vietnam and the Chinese Model: A Comparative Study of Nguyen and Ch'ing Civil Government in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 19th century, the French used the existence of eunuchs in Vietnam to degrade the Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (2006), p. 1  {{Google books|oJFrN5tRlCgC|Aching for Beauty: Footbinding in China|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information on emasculation in Vietnam, see [[Castration#Vietnam]].

;Khitan
The [[Khitan people]] of northeast Asia adopted the Chinese practice of emasculating slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLNrqn4WLZYC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en |title= Peterson(2000), 259 |publisher= Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Russia
In 19th century [[Russia]], the [[Skoptsy]] sect of [[Christianity]] performed emasculation, which they termed the "greater seal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Skoptsi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Middle East and Africa
In the [[Arab slave trade]], enslaved men and boys from [[East Africa]] were often "castrated" by removing both the penis and testicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery in the Arab World|series=Companions to Asian Studies|author=Murray Gordon|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date=1989|isbn=9780941533300|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the modern day===
In The [[Indian Subcontinent]], some members of [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called ''nirwaan'' and seen as a [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, S. "Hijras: An Alternative Sex and Gender Role in India (in Herdt, G. (1996) Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History. Zone Books.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], males in the [[Nullo (body modification)|Nullo]] subculture voluntarily undergo emasculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/i-still-unload-this-man-is-a-nullo-who-removed-his-1645409616|title=&amp;quot;I Still Unload&amp;quot;: This Man Is a &amp;quot;Nullo&amp;quot; Who Removed His Penis and Balls|first=Simon|last=Davis|work=Gawker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Bible===
In the [[Old Testament]]:

''“No one whose testicles are crushed or whose male organ is cut off shall enter the assembly of the LORD.''
:~ [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 23:1 ([[ESV]])
:("''shall not enter the assembly of the Lord''," Explained by the Rabbis to mean that he cannot marry a daughter of Israel)&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulhan Arukh]], ''Eben ha-Ezer'' 5:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben Maimon |first=M.|author-link=Maimonides |title= Guide for the Perplexed |publisher= Dover Publishers |translator=Michael Friedländer |volume= |edition=2nd |date=1956|location=New York |pages=379 |language=English |url= |doi= |id= |isbn= |jfm= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other meanings==
{{Wiktionarypar|emasculation}}

By extension, the word ''emasculation'' has also come to mean rendering a male less [[masculine]], including by humiliation. It can also mean to deprive anything of vigour or effectiveness. This figurative usage has become more common than the literal meaning. For example: "[[William Lewis Hughes]] voted for Folkestone’s amendment to Curwen’s emasculated reform [[bill (law)|bill]], 12 June 1809..."&lt;ref&gt;Thorne R. (1986) [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/hughes-william-lewis-1767-1852 History of Parliament online]. Accessed 12 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[horticulture]], the removal of male (pollen) parts of a plant, largely for controlled pollination and breeding purposes, is also called emasculation.&lt;ref&gt;Hedhly A. et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423808003750 Flower emasculation accelerates ovule degeneration and reduces fruit set in sweet cherry].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12072">In [[abstract algebra]], an [[abelian group]] {{nowrap|(''G'', +)}} is called '''finitely generated''' if there exist finitely many elements ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''G'' such that every ''x'' in ''G'' can be written in the form
:''x'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;
with [[integer]]s ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, we say that the set {{nowrap|1={''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}{{null}}}} is a ''[[generating set of a group|generating set]]'' of ''G'' or that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; ''generate'' ''G''.

Every finite abelian group is finitely generated. The finitely generated abelian groups can be completely classified.

==Examples==
* The [[integers]], &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z},+\right)&lt;/math&gt;, are a finitely generated abelian group.
* The [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;]], &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},+\right)&lt;/math&gt;, are a finite (hence finitely generated) abelian group.
* Any [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of finitely many finitely generated abelian groups is again a finitely generated abelian group.
* Every [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] forms a finitely generated [[free abelian group]].

There are no other examples (up to isomorphism). In particular, the group &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q},+\right)&lt;/math&gt; of [[rational number]]s is not finitely generated:&lt;ref name="Silverman-Tate-1992"&gt;Silverman &amp; Tate (1992), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=mAJei2-JcE4C|page=102|text=not finitely generated}} p. 102]&lt;/ref&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are rational numbers, pick a [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; [[coprime]] to all the denominators; then &lt;math&gt;1/k&lt;/math&gt; cannot be generated by &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;. The group &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q}^*,\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; of non-zero rational numbers is also not finitely generated. The groups of real numbers under addition &lt;math&gt; \left(\mathbb{R},+\right)&lt;/math&gt; and non-zero real numbers under multiplication &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{R}^*,\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; are also not finitely generated.&lt;ref name="Silverman-Tate-1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de la Harpe (2000), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=60fTzwfqeQIC|page=46|text=The multiplicative group Q}} p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The '''fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups''' can be stated two ways, generalizing the two forms of the [[fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups|fundamental theorem of ''finite'' abelian groups]]. The theorem, in both forms, in turn generalizes to the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]], which in turn admits further generalizations.

===Primary decomposition===
The primary decomposition formulation states that every finitely generated abelian group ''G'' is isomorphic to a [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of [[primary cyclic group]]s and infinite [[cyclic group]]s. A primary cyclic group is one whose [[order of a group|order]] is a power of a [[prime number|prime]]. That is, every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{q_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{q_t},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' ≥ 0 is the ''[[Rank of an abelian group|rank]]'', and the numbers ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are powers of (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers. In particular, ''G'' is finite if and only if ''n'' = 0.  The values of ''n'', ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are ([[up to]] rearranging the indices) uniquely determined by ''G''.

===Invariant factor decomposition===
We can also write any finitely generated abelian group ''G'' as a direct sum of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k_u},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [[divisor|divides]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which divides ''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and so on up to ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Again, the rank ''n'' and the ''[[invariant factor]]s'' ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; are uniquely determined by ''G'' (here with a unique order).  The rank and the sequence of invariant factors determine the group up to isomorphism.

===Equivalence===
These statements are equivalent as a result of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], which implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{jk}\simeq \mathbb{Z}_{j} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''j'' and ''k'' are [[coprime]].

===History===
The history and credit for the fundamental theorem is complicated by the fact that it was proven when group theory was not well-established, and thus early forms, while essentially the modern result and proof, are often stated for a specific case. Briefly, an early form of the finite case was proven in {{harv|Gauss|1801}}, the finite case was proven in {{harv|Kronecker|1870}}, and stated in group-theoretic terms in {{harv|Frobenius|Stickelberger|1878}}. The [[Finitely presented group|finitely ''presented'']] case is solved by [[Smith normal form]], and hence frequently credited to {{harv|Smith|1861}},&lt;ref name="fuchs"/&gt; though the finitely ''generated'' case is sometimes instead credited to {{harv|Poincaré|1900}}; details follow.

This generalized an earlier result of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] from ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), which classified quadratic forms; Kronecker cited this result of Gauss's. The theorem was stated and proved in the language of groups by [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]] and [[Ludwig Stickelberger]] in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;G. Frobenius, L. Stickelberger, Uber Grubben von vertauschbaren Elementen, J. reine u. angew. Math., 86 (1878), 217-262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wussing (2007), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp3JymnfAq4C&amp;pg=PA234 234–235]&lt;/ref&gt; Another group-theoretic formulation was given by Kronecker's student [[Eugen Netto]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;''Substitutionentheorie und ihre Anwendung auf die Algebra'',

The fundamental theorem for [[Finitely presented group|''finitely presented'']] abelian groups was proven by [[Henry John Stephen Smith]] in {{harv|Smith|1861}},&lt;ref name="fuchs"/&gt; as integer matrices correspond to finite presentations of abelian groups (this generalizes to finitely presented modules over a principal ideal domain), and [[Smith normal form]] corresponds to classifying finitely presented abelian groups. There is the additional technicality of showing that a finitely ''presented'' abelian group is in fact finitely ''generated'', so Smith's classification is not a complete proof for finitely generated abelian groups.

The fundamental theorem for ''finitely generated'' abelian groups was proven by [[Henri Poincaré]] in {{harv|Poincaré|1900}}, using a matrix proof (which generalizes to principal ideal domains). This was done in the context of computing the
[[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of a complex, specifically the [[Betti number]] and [[Torsion coefficient (topology)|torsion coefficient]]s of a dimension of the complex, where the Betti number corresponds to the rank of the free part, and the torsion coefficients correspond to the torsion part.&lt;ref name=stillwell175 /&gt;

Kronecker's proof was generalized to ''finitely generated'' abelian groups by Emmy Noether in {{harv|Noether|1926}}.&lt;ref name=stillwell175 /&gt;

==Corollaries==
Stated differently the fundamental theorem says that a finitely generated abelian group is the direct sum of a [[free abelian group]] of finite [[rank of an abelian group|rank]] and a finite abelian group, each of those being unique up to isomorphism. The finite abelian group is just the [[torsion subgroup]] of ''G''. The rank of ''G'' is defined as the rank of the torsion-free part of ''G''; this is just the number ''n'' in the above formulas.

A [[corollary]] to the fundamental theorem is that every finitely generated [[torsion-free abelian group]] is free abelian. The finitely generated condition is essential here: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is torsion-free but not free abelian.

Every [[subgroup]] and [[factor group]] of a finitely generated abelian group is again finitely generated abelian. The finitely generated abelian groups, together with the [[group homomorphism]]s, form an [[abelian category]] which is a [[Subcategory#Types_of_subcategories|Serre subcategory]] of the [[category of abelian groups]].

==Non-finitely generated abelian groups==
Note that not every abelian group of finite rank is finitely generated; the rank 1 group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is one counterexample, and the rank-0 group given by a direct sum of [[infinite set|countably infinitely many]] copies of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is another one.

'''Katherine "Flossie" Bailey''' (1895–February 6, 1952) was a civil rights and anti-lynching activist from Indiana. She established a local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] in [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]], Indiana, in 1918 and became especially active fighting for justice and equality following the double lynching of [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Thomas Shipp]] and [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Abram Smith]] in 1930. As president of the Indiana NAACP, Bailey was pivotal in lobbying for passage of a statewide [[Lynching in the United States#State laws|anti-lynching law]] in Indiana in 1931 and advocated for a similar bill at the national level. She was also a recipient of the national NAACP's [[Madam C. J. Walker]] Medal.

==Early life and education==
Katherine Harvey, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Harvey, was born in [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]], Indiana, in 1895. Known as "Flossie", she grew up in Kokomo and attended [[Kokomo High School]].&lt;ref name="Obit (1952)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Flossie K.

==Marriage and family==
Flossie married Walter T. Bailey, a physician, in 1917. The couple resided in [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]], Indiana.&lt;ref name=IN200-10/&gt; Doctor Bailey died on February 10, 1950.&lt;ref name="W.T. obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colored Circles: 'Friends have received word...' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2239881/the_kokomo_tribune_kokomo_indiana_11/|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=''The Kokomo Tribune''|date=11 February 1950|location=Kokomo, Indiana|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their only surviving child was a son, named Walter Charles Bailey.&lt;ref name=IN200-10/&gt;

While living in Marion, Bailey also became actively involved in the Marion community. She was a member of the city's Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church congregation.&lt;ref name="Obit (1952)"/&gt;

==Career==
Bailey spent her adult life seeking equality and justice as a civil rights activist. In 1918 Bailey established the Marion branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). Initially it did not receive much support. In June 1930 it had 96 members; however, after the Marion community was the site of a [[lynching]] in August 1930, the local chapter's membership increase to 155 members by the end of 1930.&lt;ref name=Traces24/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James H. Madison |year=2001 |title=A Lynching in the Heartland: Race and Memory in America |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=9781403961211 |pages=58–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IN200-11&gt;Madison, "Katherine 'Flossie' Bailey" in ''Indiana's 200'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 1930, a mob broke into the [[Grant County, Indiana|Grant County]], Indiana, jail in Marion, dragged two African American men, [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Thomas Shipp]] and [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Abram Smith]], to the Courthouse Square and lynched (hanged) them from a tree. Bailey, who was the president of the local branch of the NAACP, tried to obtain police protection for the jailed men prior to the lynching. Afterwards, she was actively involved in organizing a [[Hoosier]] delegation of NAACP members to speak to Indiana governor [[Harry Leslie]] and persuade him to intervene in the investigation of the men's murders.&lt;ref name=IN200-11/&gt;

Bailey and a number of others worked hard to obtain a fair investigation into the double lynching. Despite objections from those in the Marion community who wanted to forget about the event, Bailey and the NAACP played an important role in seeking justice for the murders of Shipp and Smith, as well as to restore calm in Marion. Two men were indicted and went on trial for the lynching, but neither one was found guilty of the crime and no one was ever punished for the deaths of Shipp and Smith.&lt;ref name=IN200-11/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madison_2000-23-25"&gt;Madison, "Flossie Bailey," ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Bailey was elected president of the Indiana NAACP and helped plan its second annual meeting. The Bailey home in Marion became the Indiana headquarters for the NAACP.&lt;ref name=IN200-11/&gt; The national organization recognized Bailey's efforts by awarding her the [[Madam C. J. Walker]] Medal for "the person who has done the best work in the NAACP during the year."&lt;ref name="Madison_2000-25"&gt;Madison, "Flossie Bailey", ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey worked to ensure nothing like the lynching in Marion would occur again. She lobbied the [[Indiana General Assembly]] to pass stricter anti-lynching laws. When opponents to the bill rejected many of the safety measures, Bailey organized a statewide effort, calling on chapters of the NAACP, Optimist Clubs, Exchange Clubs, and Democratic organizations to lobby state legislators. Bailey's efforts were successful and the governor signed a stricter anti-lynching law in March 1931. Once the Indiana bill became law, Bailey began lobbying for a national anti-lynching law, as well as for the fair treatment of African Americans in other sectors of American life. Bailey especially focused on fighting to end the segregation of schools, hospitals, and other public spaces such as movie theaters.&lt;ref name="Madison_2000-25-26"&gt;Madison, "Flossie Bailey", ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Bailey and the NAACP struggled during the years of the [[Great Depression]]. Her husband, who suffered a stroke, closed his medical practice in Marion around 1940, and the couple moved to Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=IN200-12&gt;Madison, "Katherine 'Flossie' Bailey" in ''Indiana's 200'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Bailey died in Indianapolis on February 6, 1952.&lt;ref name="Obit (1952)" /&gt; As an activist and president of the Indiana NAACP in the 1930s, her leadership helped establish a foundation for the civil rights movement of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=IN200-12/&gt;

{{New Netherland}}
The '''Flushing Remonstrance''' was a 1657 [[petition]] to [[Director-General of New Netherland|Director-General]] of [[New Netherland]] [[Peter Stuyvesant]], in which some thirty residents of the small settlement at [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] requested an exemption to his ban on [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] worship. It is considered a precursor to the [[United States Constitution]]'s provision on [[freedom of religion]] in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}  Its 350th anniversary was celebrated in 2007 in ceremonies throughout [[Queens, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirshon, Nicholas. 1657 Flushing Remonstrance recalled on anniversary by descendants. ''New York Daily News'' http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/1657-flushing-remonstrance-recalled-anniversary-descendants-article-1.274227 December 11, 2007, Accessed January 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Kenneth T. Jackson]], the Flushing Remonstrance was remarkable for four reasons:
* it articulated a fundamental right that is as basic to American freedom as any other, 
*the authors backed up their words with actions by sending it to an official not known for tolerance, 
*they stood up for others in articulating a principle that was of little discernible benefit to themselves, 
*and the language of the remonstrance was as beautiful as the sentiments they expressed.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite news |title=A Colony With a Conscience |first=Kenneth T. |last=Jackson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/opinion/27jackson.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The village, originally named as [[Vlissingen]], then Vlishing, and now [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Queens, New York]], had been part of the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. It was originally settled by English people operating under a patent, issued by Governor [[Willem Kieft]] in 1645, granting them the same state of religious freedom existing in Holland, then the most tolerant of European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=James|author2= The Voelker Orth Museum Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden |title=Flushing: 1880–1935|date=2005|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738538426|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuyvesant, however, with his 1656 ordinance against illegal religious meetings, had formally banned the practice of all religions outside of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], the established church of the Netherlands, in the colony.&lt;ref name="Liberty Mag"/&gt; His often-derided decision flew against the approximate hundred-year evolution of religious tolerance in the Netherlands. During this time the country was revolting against Spanish rule, rebelling against an imposed Inquisition, attempting to form a national identity, and trying to unify Calvinist and Catholic provinces. The Dutch toleration debates were lengthy, bumpy, heated, and full of political intrigue and even assassination. The writer Thomas Broderick states, "I believe the true Dutch legacy is not one of toleration but of discussion. New Amsterdam and the Republic show us that a robust, open public discourse is the surest way to eventual social improvement. Toleration and acceptance are political and moral imperatives, and the Flushing remonstrance and great Dutch toleration debates in Europe and North America teach us that social change takes time, open dialogue, disagreement, and failure before progress is to be made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broderick|first1=Thomas|title=New Amsterdam and the Great Dutch Toleration Debates|url=http://www1.umassd.edu/euro/2013papers/broderick.pdf|website=University of Massachusetts|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuyvesant's policy was not much different from the one evolving in the Netherlands: an official recognition of the Dutch Reformed Church bundled with broad tolerance within the church and a policy of [[connivance]], turning a blind eye to non-conformist religious practices. On another front, the Stuyvesant family was broadly tolerant.  Judith, Stuyvesant's wife, was a fierce advocate for New York's slaves, promoting the practice of baptism as a first step toward freedom.&lt;ref name=nycreligion&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Stuyvesant’s relentless quest for order in New Amsterdam pushes Africans out of the church|date=March 7, 2012|url=http://www.nycreligion.info/peter-stuyvesant-relentless-quest-order-push-africans-church/|publisher=NYCReligion.info|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His policy met with resistance from some English settlers in the towns of Vlissingen (currently [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]]), Rustdorp (currently [[Jamaica, Queens]]), and 's-Gravesend (currently [[Gravesend, Brooklyn]]), places where [[Quaker]] missions were sent.  Stuyvesant's actions, however, also met with the support of other English settlers and magistrates who informed on those embracing unorthodox teachings and meeting in small and unsanctioned religious meetings of lay people called [[conventicle]]s.  Thus, Stuyvesant found himself drawn into the religious debates and bickering of the English community in the Atlantic colonies&lt;ref name=Haefeli&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haefeli|first1=Evan|title=New Netherland and the Dutch origins of American religious liberty|date=2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0812244087|page=222|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and debates in England which culminated in the [[Conventicle Act 1664]].

This policy resulted in numerous acts of religious persecution and harassment.  In 1656 [[William Wickenden]], a Baptist minister from Rhode Island, was arrested by Dutch colonial authorities, jailed, fined, and exiled for baptizing Christians in Flushing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformedreader.org/history/armitage/ch09.htm ''A History of the Baptists'' by Thomas Armitage]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year Robert Hodgson was arrested, tried, and sentenced to two years of manual labor with slaves for his preaching of Quakerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haefeli|first1=Evan|title=New Netherland and the Dutch origins of American religious liberty|date=2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0812244087|pages=61–68|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1661, in the town of Rustdorp, [[Henry Townsend (Norwich)]] and Samuel Spicer were fined for holding Quaker conventicles and Townsend was banished as well.  Stuyvesant sent three new magistrates, all Englishmen, and a half dozen soldiers to gather information on dissidents.  The soldiers were [[billet]]ed in the homes of the dissidents until they agreed to conform.  In 1662, in 's-Gravesande, Samuel Spicer and his mother, Micha, along with John and Mary Tilton were imprisoned and later banished.  They moved to [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], then outside of the authority of New Netherland, and returned to their town after 1664 when the British took control of the colony.&lt;ref name=Haefeli/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Descendants of John Tilton|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cathie/ctilton.htm|website=RootsWeb|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The Flushing Remonstrance was signed on December 27, 1657, by a group of Dutch citizens who were affronted by [[persecution]] of Quakers and the religious policies of Stuyvesant.&lt;ref name="Liberty Mag"&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Peabody |coauthors= |title=The Flushing Remonstrance |url=http://www.libertymagazine.org/article/articleview/532/1/86/ |publisher= Liberty Magazine |date=November–December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204215137/http://www.libertymagazine.org/article/articleview/532/1/86/ |archivedate =December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Collins |title=Precursor of the Constitution Goes on Display in Queens |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/nyregion/05remonstrance.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of them were [[Quakers]].&lt;ref name=jackson /&gt;  The Remonstrance ends with:

:The law of love, peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews, Turks and Egyptians, as they are considered sonnes of Adam, which is the glory of the outward state of Holland, soe love, peace and liberty, extending to all in Christ Jesus, condemns hatred, war and bondage. And because our Saviour sayeth it is impossible but that offences will come, but woe unto him by whom they cometh, our desire is not to offend one of his little ones, in whatsoever form, name or title hee appears in, whether Presbyterian, Independent, Baptist or Quaker, but shall be glad to see anything of God in any of them, desiring to doe unto all men as we desire all men should doe unto us, which is the true law both of Church and State; for our Saviour sayeth this is the law and the prophets.

:Therefore if any of these said persons come in love unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free egresse and regresse unto our Town, and houses, as God shall persuade our consciences, for we are bounde by the law of God and man to doe good unto all men and evil to noe man. And this is according to the patent and charter of our Towne, given unto us in the name of the States General, which we are not willing to infringe, and violate, but shall houlde to our patent and shall remaine, your humble subjects, the inhabitants of Vlishing.

In response Stuyvesant dismissed the local government and chose new Dutch replacements as leaders.  Four who signed were arrested by order of Stuyvesant. Two immediately recanted, but the writer of the remonstrance, [[Edward Hart (settler)|Edward Hart]], and sheriff of Flushing Tobias Feake remained firm in their convictions. Both men were remanded to prison where they survived in isolation on rations of bread and water for over a month. After friends and family petitioned Stuyvesant on behalf of the elderly Hart, the clerk was released on penalty of banishment. Feake held out for a few more weeks, but eventually recanted and was pardoned after being fined and banned from holding public office.

Stuyvesant asserted that he wasn't violating the signers' "freedom of conscience," only their right to worship outside of family prayer meetings. In addition he proclaimed March 13, 1658 a Day of Prayer for the purpose of repenting from the sin of religious tolerance.&lt;ref name=nycreligion/&gt;

Subsequently, [[John Bowne]] of the colony allowed Quakers to meet in his [[John Bowne House|house]]. He was arrested in 1662 and brought before Stuyvesant. Unrepentant, Bowne was sentenced to banishment to Holland, though he was of English descent and spoke no Dutch. After several months in the foreign land, Bowne petitioned the directors of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. After a month of deliberation, the Dutch West India Company agreed to support Bowne, and advised Stuyvesant by a letter (1663) that he was to end religious persecution in the colony. One year later, in 1664, the colony fell to British control. The [[John Bowne House]], built before 1662, still stands in historic preservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.BowneHouse.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Quaker Meeting House (Queens)|Quaker Meeting House]] in Flushing, built 1694, is now the oldest house of worship in continuous use in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.FlushingFriends.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Account of John Bowne==
John Bowne's account of the Flushing Remonstrance and its aftermath is found in his journal of events.  Bowne, who had arrived in 1651, soon began to host Quaker meetings in his home, although he did not convert until 1659.  He was to become a leader of American Quakers and a correspondent of Quaker founder [[George Fox]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Later history==
The earliest copy of the document dates also from 1657 as an official copy of the original, but the original has been lost.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; This early copy is in longhand, on moderately severely damaged and degraded paper, yet essentially complete. It has seldom been in public anywhere.

The Queens Borough President's Office held a celebration of the 350th anniversary of the Remonstrance in 2007. Descendants of the signers, Bowne, Stuyvesant, and the arresting officer were invited and in attendance, and the original copy of the Remonstrance was brought down from the State Archives in Albany for several weeks' public display.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

A park, high school and an elementary school in [[Flushing, Queens]] are named in [[John Bowne]] 's honor.

PS 21 in Flushing is named after Edward Hart, the writer of the Remonstrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/25/Q021/default.htm | title=P.S. 021 Edward Hart | publisher=New York City Department of Education | accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species [[extinction]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Pimm &amp; Raven, 2000, pp. 843-845&lt;/ref&gt; It is a process of natural environmental change that may be caused by [[habitat fragmentation]], geological processes, [[climate change]]&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; or by human activities such as the introduction of [[invasive species]], ecosystem nutrient depletion, and other human activities.

The terms '''habitat loss''' and '''habitat reduction''' are also used in a wider sense, including loss of habitat from other factors, such as [[water pollution|water]] and [[noise pollution]].

==Impacts on organisms==
In the simplest term, when a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced [[carrying capacity]] so that populations decline and [[extinction]] becomes more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes &amp; Biggs, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity is the process of habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Barbault &amp; Sastrapradja, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Temple (1986) found that 82% of [[Endangered species|endangered bird species]] were significantly threatened by habitat loss. Most amphibian species are also threatened by habitat loss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beebee|first1=Trevor J.C.|last2=Griffiths|first2=Richard A.|title=The amphibian decline crisis: A watershed for conservation biology?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=31 May 2005|volume=125|issue=3|page=271|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.04.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320705001825}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Jang|first2=Yikweon|title=Description of a seminatural habitat of the endangered Suweon treefrog Hyla suweonensis|journal=Animal Cells and Systems|date=28 April 2015|volume=19|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[endemism|Endemic]] organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction, mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world, and thus have less chance of recovering. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem, resulting in their extinction. Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]]. Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations. This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of [[infertile]] youths, as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population, or different species. One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China's [[giant panda]], once found across the nation. Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country, as a result of widespread [[deforestation]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-sichuan-panda-deforestation-habitat-mountain-conservation|title=The Panda's Forest: Biodiversity Loss|date=24 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

[[Biodiversity hotspot]]s are chiefly [[tropical]] regions that feature high concentrations of [[Endemism|endemic]] species and, when all hotspots are combined, may contain over half of the world’s [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] species.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"&gt;Cincotta &amp; Engelman, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction.
Most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed (WRI, 2003). Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include [[New Zealand]], [[Madagascar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Primack"&gt;Primack, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; South and East Asia — especially [[China]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and Japan — and many areas in [[West Africa]] have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat. Marine areas close to highly populated [[coast]]al cities also face degradation of their [[coral reef]]s or other marine habitat. These areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa, northern coasts of [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its associated [[island]]s.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Regions of un[[sustainable agriculture]] or unstable governments, which may go hand-in-hand, typically experience high rates of habitat destruction.  [[Central America]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and the [[Amazonian tropical rainforest]] areas of [[South America]] are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and/or government mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction.  In the U.S., less than 25% of native vegetation remains in many parts of the [[Eastern United States|East]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;Stein et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Only 15% of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

==Ecosystems==
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|Jungle burned for agriculture in southern Mexico]]
[[Tropical rainforest]]s have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat. From the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide, less than 9 million square kilometers remain today.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The current rate of [[deforestation]] is 160,000 square kilometers per year, which equates to a loss of approximately 1% of original forest habitat each year.&lt;ref name="Laurance"&gt;Laurance, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forest [[ecosystem]]s have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical [[rainforest]]s.  [[Farming]] and [[logging]] have severely disturbed at least 94% of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forests]]; many [[old growth forest]] stands have lost more than 98% of their previous area because of human activities.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Tropical deciduous dry forests]] are easier to [[Slash and burn|clear and burn]] and are more suitable for agriculture and [[cattle ranching]] than tropical rainforests; consequently, less than 0.1% of [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forests in Central America's Pacific Coast]] and less than 8% in [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|Madagascar]] remain from their original extents.&lt;ref name="Laurance"/&gt;

[[File:Farmland-batang bungo.jpg|thumb|left|Farmers near newly cleared land within Taman Nasional Kerinci Seblat ([[Kerinci Seblat National Park]]), [[Sumatra]].]]
Plains and [[desert]] areas have been degraded to a lesser extent. Only 10-20% of the world's [[drylands]], which include [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]], [[Scrubland|scrub]], and [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forests]], have been somewhat degraded.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman &amp; Pyke, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  But included in that 10-20% of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry-lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The [[tallgrass prairie]]s of North America, on the other hand, have less than 3% of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland.&lt;ref&gt;White et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wetland]]s and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction. More than 50% of wetlands in the U.S. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; Between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have been completely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenga et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years. The rising sea levels and temperatures have caused [[soil erosion]], [[coastal flooding]], and loss of quality in the UK [[marine ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=535|title=United Kingdom: Environmental Issues, Policies and Clean Technology|date=2015-06-08|website=AZoCleantech.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-fifth (20%) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Burke et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; One-fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed, and another fifth has been severely degraded by [[overfishing]], pollution, and [[invasive species]]; 90% of the Philippines’ coral reefs alone have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"&gt;MEA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, over 35% of the [[Coastal ecosystems|mangrove ecosystems]] worldwide have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Natural causes==
Habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, [[fire]], and climate change is well documented in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

==Human causes==
[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|Deforestation and roads in Amazonia, the [[Amazon Rainforest]].]]

Habitat destruction caused by humans includes [[land conversion]] from forests, etc. to [[arable land]], [[urban sprawl]], [[Public works|infrastructure development]], and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land. Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and [[pollution]] are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat, yet result in habitat collapse. [[Desertification]], [[deforestation]], and [[Coral bleaching|coral reef degradation]] are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas ([[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[coral reef]]s).

Geist and Lambin (2002) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation. Their results, yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor, provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant. The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of [[agricultural expansion]] (96%), [[infrastructure expansion]] (72%), and [[wood extraction]] (67%). Therefore, according to this study, [[forest conversion]] to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation. The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation: transport extension (64%), commercial wood extraction (52%), [[permanent cultivation]] (48%), [[cattle ranching]] (46%), shifting ([[slash and burn]]) cultivation (41%), [[subsistence agriculture]] (40%), and [[fuel wood]] extraction for domestic use (28%). One result is that [[shifting cultivation]] is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions, while transport extension (including the [[Road construction|construction of new roads]]) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;

=== Global warming ===
Rising global temperatures, caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], contribute to habitat destruction, endangering various species, such as the [[polar bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Predicting 21st-century polar bear habitat distribution from global climate models|url=|journal=Ecological Monographs|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1890/07-2089.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melting [[ice cap]]s promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Jason D.|last2=Littnan|first2=Charles L.|last3=Johnston|first3=David W.|date=2006-05-24|title=Potential effects of sea level rise on the terrestrial habitats of endangered and endemic megafauna in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v2/p21-30/|journal=Endangered Species Research|volume=2|pages=21–30|doi=10.3354/esr002021|issn=1863-5407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galbraith|first=H.|last2=Jones|first2=R.|last3=Park|first3=R.|last4=Clough|first4=J.|last5=Herrod-Julius|first5=S.|last6=Harrington|first6=B.|last7=Page|first7=G.|date=2002-06-01|title=Global Climate Change and Sea Level Rise: Potential Losses of Intertidal Habitat for Shorebirds|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1675/1524-4695%282002%29025%5B0173%3AGCCASL%5D2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Waterbirds|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–183|doi=10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0173:GCCASL]2.0.CO;2|issn=1524-4695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers==
[[File:Crowded Nanjing Road in Shanghai.jpeg|thumb|Nanjing Road in Shanghai]]
While the above-mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat, this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat.  The forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as ''drivers'' of habitat destruction.  [[Demographic]], economic, sociopolitical, scientific and technological, and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

Demographic drivers include the [[Human overpopulation|expanding human population]]; rate of [[Population growth|population increase]] over time; [[Population density|spatial distribution]] of people in a given area ([[List of urban areas by population|urban]] versus rural), ecosystem type, and country; and the combined effects of poverty, age, family planning, gender, and education status of people in certain areas.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;  Most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to [[biodiversity hotspots]].&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  This may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9% of the variation in numbers of [[threatened species]] across 114 countries, providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;McKee et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The boom in human population and migration of people into such species-rich regions are making [[conservation biology|conservation efforts]] not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  The high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people, most of whom lacking an education and family planning.&lt;ref name="Geist"&gt;Geist &amp; Lambin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Geist and Lambin (2002) study described in the previous section, the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows (with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in): economic factors (81%), institutional or policy factors (78%), technological factors (70%), cultural or socio-political factors (66%), and demographic factors (61%).  The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets (68%), which are driven by national and international demands; urban industrial growth (38%); low domestic costs for land, labor, fuel, and timber (32%); and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops (25%).  Institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development (40%), economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement (34%), and subsidies for land-based activities (26%); property rights and land-tenure insecurity (44%); and policy failures such as corruption, lawlessness, or mismanagement (42%).  The main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry (45%), which leads to wasteful logging practices.  Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values (63%), individual/household behavior (53%), public unconcern toward forest environments (43%), missing basic values (36%), and unconcern by individuals (32%).  Demographic factors were the in-migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas (38%) and growing population density—a result of the first factor—in those areas (25%).

There are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process. Road construction has the largest feedback effect, because it interacts with—and leads to—the establishment of new settlements and more people, which causes a growth in wood (logging) and food markets.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;  Growth in these markets, in turn, progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries. When these industries become commercialized, they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often has a worse effect on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods. Either way, more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets. This common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other.

==Impact on human population==
[[File:KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded edit2.jpg|thumb|The draining and development of coastal wetlands that previously protected the Gulf Coast contributed to severe flooding in New Orleans, Louisiana in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Habitat destruction vastly increases an area's vulnerability to [[natural disaster]]s like [[flood]] and [[drought]], [[crop failure]], [[spread of disease]], and [[water contamination]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; On the other hand, a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening, or will at least mitigate adverse impacts.

Agricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape. Over the past 50 years, the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40% of agricultural land worldwide via [[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[Soil compaction|compaction]], [[Natural resource#Depletion|nutrient depletion]], [[pollution]], and [[urbanization]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed. Aesthetic uses such as [[birdwatching]], recreational uses like [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], and [[ecotourism]] usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat. Many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide.

Probably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable [[ecosystem services]]. Habitat destruction has altered nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and [[carbon cycle]]s, which has increased the frequency and severity of [[acid rain]], [[algal bloom]]s, and [[fish kill]]s in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; One ecosystem service whose significance is becoming better understood is [[Climate|climate regulation]]. On a local scale, trees provide windbreaks and shade; on a regional scale, [[Transpiration|plant transpiration]] recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall; on a global scale, plants (especially trees from tropical rainforests) from around the world counter the accumulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere by [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestering carbon dioxide]] through [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; Other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include [[watershed management]], [[nitrogen fixation]], oxygen production, [[pollination]] (see [[pollinator decline]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=5|year=2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0063421|pmc=3661593|title=Plant Pollinator Networks along a Gradient of Urbanisation|author1=Benoît Geslin|author2=Benoit Gauzens|author3=Elisa Thébault|author4=Isabelle Dajoz|pmid=23717421|page=e63421|bibcode=2013PLoSO...863421G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[waste treatment]] (i.e., the [[Decomposition|breaking down]] and immobilization of [[toxic]] pollutants), and [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient recycling]] of [[sewage]] or [[agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earth’s ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide. These services are becoming even more important as increasing [[carbon dioxide]] levels is one of the main contributors to global [[climate change]].

The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] may not directly affect humans, but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous. When biodiversity is lost, the environment loses many species that perform valuable and unique roles in the ecosystem. The environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions. When too much biodiversity is lost, a catastrophic event such as an earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash, and humans would obviously suffer from that. Loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher-yielding crop varieties, pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer, and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide-resistant insects or virulent strains of [[fungi]], [[virus]]es, and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Across the globe, poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed, because less natural habitat means fewer natural resources per capita, yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources.

Another way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of destroying a given habitat. In other words, what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat? A country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row-crop agriculture, but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water, timber, ecotourism, or flood regulation and drought control.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Outlook==
The [[Human overpopulation|rapid expansion of the global human population]] is increasing the world’s food requirement substantially. Simple logic dictates that more people will require more food. In fact, as the world’s population increases dramatically, agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50%, over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Tilman"&gt;Tilman et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to meet the global food demand. That easy fix will no longer be available, however, as more than 98% of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The impending global [[food crisis]] will be a major source of habitat destruction. Commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land, so they will use more [[fertilizer]]s and show less concern for the environment to meet the market demand. Others will seek out new land or will convert other land-uses to agriculture. Agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants. Species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation, [[environmental degradation|degradation]], or [[pollution]]. Any efforts to protect the world’s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans’ growing demand for natural resources, especially new agricultural lands.&lt;ref name="Tilman"/&gt;

==Solutions==
[[File:Hawaii turtle.JPG|thumb|''[[Chelonia mydas]]'' on a Hawaiian coral reef. Although the endangered species is protected, habitat loss from human development is a major reason for the loss of [[green turtle]] nesting beaches.]]
In most cases of tropical deforestation, three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; Before any local, national, or international deforestation policies are written and enforced, governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This concept, along with many other results of tropical deforestation from the Geist and Lambin study, can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general. Governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces, rather than merely regulating the proximate causes. In a broader sense, governmental bodies at a local, national, and international scale need to emphasize the following:

#Considering the many irreplaceable ecosystem services provided by natural habitats.
#Protecting remaining intact sections of natural habitat.
#Educating the public about the importance of natural habitat and biodiversity.
#Developing [[family planning]] programs in areas of rapid population growth.
#Finding ecological ways to increase agricultural output without increasing the total land in production.
#Preserving habitat corridors to minimize prior damage from fragmented habitats.
#Reducing [[human population]] and expansion. Apart from improving access to contraception globally, furthering gender equality also has a great benefit. When women have the same education (decision-making power), this generally leads to smaller families.

'''Inherent jurisdiction''' is a doctrine of the [[England|English]] [[common law]] that a [[superior court]] has the [[jurisdiction]] to hear any matter that comes before it, unless a [[statute]] or rule limits that authority or grants [[exclusive jurisdiction]] to some other court or [[tribunal]]. The term is also used when a governmental institution derives its jurisdiction from a fundamental governing instrument such as a [[constitution]]. In the English case of ''Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau und Maschinenfabrik v. South India Shipping Corporation Ltd'', [[Lord Diplock]] described the court's inherent jurisdiction as a general power to control its own procedure so as to prevent its being used to achieve injustice. 

Inherent jurisdiction appears to apply to an almost limitless set of circumstances. There are four general categories for use of the court's inherent jurisdiction:

#to ensure convenience and fairness in legal proceedings;
#to prevent steps being taken that would render judicial proceedings inefficacious;
#to prevent abuses of process;
#to act in aid of superior courts and in aid or control of inferior courts and tribunals.

As such, the exercise of inherent jurisdiction is a broad doctrine allowing a court to control its own processes and to control the procedures before it. The power stems not from any particular statute or legislation, but rather from inherent powers invested in a court to control the proceedings brought before it.

==Inherent jurisdiction in Canada==
According to the [[case law]] in [[Canada]], the key restriction on the application of inherent jurisdiction is that the [[doctrine]] cannot be used to [[override power|override]] an existing [[statute]] or [[Procedural law|rule]]. The clearest articulation of such restriction is set out in the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision in ''[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1975/1975canlii164/1975canlii164.html College Housing Co-operative Ltd. v Baxter Student Housing Ltd. (1976)]'' which was a case dealing with whether a judge had exceeded jurisdiction in determining the [[mortgagee]] should have priority over other charges and encumbrances. The Supreme Court of Canada stated that a court cannot negate the unambiguous expression of legislative will and further held that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inherent jurisdiction cannot, of course, be exercised so as to conflict with statute or rule. Moreover, because it is a special and extraordinary power, it should be exercised only sparingly and in a clear case.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another restriction on the application of the doctrine of inherent jurisdiction appears to be that inherent jurisdiction cannot be used to create new rules of [[substantive law]].

The [[rules of civil procedure]] in various provinces in Canada have varying relationships with the inherent jurisdiction of their courts. In [[Ontario]] the Rules of Civil Procedure are considered to be regulations of the [[Courts of Justice Act]], and thus an expression of legislative will. They are created and amended by a "Civil Rules Committee" which consists of fourteen judges and thirteen other persons involved in the legal community including the [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorney General]] or his representative. The rules are subject to the approval of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor in Council]]. The judges of the Court obviously have a part in the making of the rules, but the rules are regulations under the Act. Inherent jurisdiction cannot be used to conflict with the unambiguous expression of the Rules.

In [[Nova Scotia]], on the other hand, the Rules of Civil Procedure are made by the judges of the [[Supreme Court of Nova Scotia|Superior Court]] and the [[Nova Scotia Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] pursuant to s.46 of the [[Judicature Act]]. The [[Attorney General of Nova Scotia|Attorney General]] does not have a hand in their creation, and they are not subject to approval by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia|Lieutenant Governor in Council]]. The Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia has taken the position that a single judge of the court may use the inherent jurisdiction of the court to manage its own procedures.

[[File:James Mark Baldwin 1917.jpg|thumb|James Mark Baldwin in 1917]]
'''James Mark Baldwin ''' (January 12, 1861, [[Columbia, South Carolina]] – November 8, 1934, [[Paris]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.distantcousin.com/cemetery/nj/mercer/princetoncem/b.html Archive of Genealogical Data]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.distantcousin.com/cemetery/nj/mercer/princetoncem/_Photo.asp?Photo=790 Princeton Cemetery Gravemarker]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Americans|American]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[psychology|psychologist]] who was educated at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] under the supervision of Scottish philosopher [[James McCosh]] and who was one of the founders of the [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]] at the university. He made important contributions to early [[psychology]], [[psychiatry]], and to the theory of [[evolution]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Baldwin was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina. His father, who was from Connecticut, was an [[abolitionist]] and was known to purchase slaves in order to free them. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] his father moved north, but the family remained in their home until the time of [[Sherman's March]]. Upon their return after the war, Baldwin's father was part of the [[Reconstruction Era]] government. Baldwin was sent north to receive his secondary education in New Jersey. As a result, he chose to attend the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]).

Baldwin started in theology under the tutelage of the college's president, [[James McCosh]], but soon switched to philosophy. He was awarded the Green Fellowship in Mental Science (named after his future father-in-law, the head of the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]) and used it to study in Germany with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at Leipzig and with [[Friedrich Paulsen]] at Berlin (1884–1934).

In 1885 he became Instructor in French and German at the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]. He translated [[Théodule-Armand Ribot]]'s ''German Psychology of Today'' and wrote his first paper "The Postulates of a Physiological Psychology". Ribot's work traced the origins of psychology from [[Immanuel Kant]] through [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], [[Hermann Lotze]] to Wundt.

In 1887, while working as a professor of philosophy at [[Lake Forest College]] he married Helen Hayes Green, the daughter of the President of the Seminary, [[William Henry Green]]. At Lake Forest he published the first part of his ''Handbook of Psychology (Senses and Intellect)'' in which he directed attention to the new experimental psychology of [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]], Fechner and Wundt.

In 1889 he went to the [[University of Toronto]] as the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics. His creation of a laboratory of experimental psychology at Toronto (which he claimed was the first in the [[British Empire]]) coincided with the birth of his daughters Helen (1889) and Elizabeth (1891) which inspired the quantitative and experimental research on [[infant development]] that was to make such a vivid impression on [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] through Baldwin's ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes'' (1894) dedicated to the subject.
A second part of ''Handbook of Psychology (Feeling and Will)'' appeared in 1891.

During this creative phase Baldwin traveled to France (1892) to visit the important psychologists [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]] (at the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière]]), [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] (at Nancy), and [[Pierre Janet]].

===Mid-career===
In 1893 he was called back to his alma mater, [[Princeton University]], where he was offered the Stuart Chair in Psychology and the opportunity to establish a new psychology laboratory. He would stay at Princeton until 1903 working out the highlights of his career reflected in ''Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development: A Study in Social Psychology'' (1897) where he took his previous ''Mental Development'' to the critical stage in which it survived in the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]], through Vygotsky in the crucial work of [[Alexander Luria]], and in the synthesis of both by [[Aleksey Leontyev]]. He also edited the English editions of [[Karl Groos]]'s ''Play of Animals'' (1898) and ''Play of Men'' (1901).

It was during this time that Baldwin wrote "A New Factor of Evolution" (June 1896/''The American Naturalist'') which later became known as the "[[Baldwin Effect]]". But other important contributors should not be overlooked. [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]] was perhaps closest to understanding the so-called "Baldwin Effect". In his ''Habit and Instinct'' (1896) he phrased a comparable version of the theory, as he did in an address to a session of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] (February 1896) in the presence of Baldwin. (1896/"Of modification and variation".'' Science'' 4(99) (November 20):733-739). As did [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] (1896/"A mode of evolution requiring neither natural selection nor the inheritance of acquired characteristics". ''Transactions of the New York Academy of Science'' 15:141-148). The "Baldwin Effect", building in part on the principle of "organic selection" proposed by Baldwin in "Mental Development" did only receive its name from [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in 1953. (in: ''Evolution'' 7:110-117) (see: David J. Depew in "Evolution and Learning" M.I.T. 2003)

Baldwin complemented his psychological work with philosophy, in particular [[epistemology]] his contribution to which he presented in the presidential address to the American Psychological Association in 1897. By then the work on the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' (1902) had been announced and a period of intense philosophical correspondence ensued with the contributors to the project: [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Josiah Royce]], [[George Edward Moore]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], [[James McKeen Cattell]], [[Edward B. Titchener]], [[Hugo Münsterberg]], [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]], [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]], [[George Stout]], [[Franklin Henry Giddings]], [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] and others.

In 1899 Baldwin went to Oxford to supervise the completion of the ''Dictionary''... (1902). He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Science at [[Oxford University]]. (In the light of the foregoing, the deafening silence with which J. M. Baldwin was later treated in Oxford publications on the mind may well come to be regarded as one of the significant omissions in the history of ideas for the 20th century. Compare for example [[Richard Gregory]]: ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'', first edition, 1987.)

===Later life===
In 1903, partly as a result of a dispute with Princeton president [[Woodrow Wilson]] and in part due to an offer involving more pay and less teaching, he moved to a professorship of philosophy and psychology at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Here, he re-opened the experimental laboratory that had been founded by [[G. Stanley Hall]] in 1884 (but had closed with Hall's departure to take over the presidency of [[Clark University]] in 1888).

In Baltimore Baldwin started to work on ''Thoughts and Things: A Study of the Development and Meaning of Thought, Or Genetic Logic'' (1906), a densely integrative rendering of his ideas culminating in ''Genetic Theory of Reality: Being the Outcome of Genetic Logic as Issuing in the Aesthetic Theory of Reality called Pancalism'' (1915). This book introduced the concept that knowledge grows through childhood in a series of distinct stages that involve interaction between innate abilities and environmental feedback. He further stated that the initial physical development gives way to language and cognitive abilities such that the child emerges as a result of social and physical growth.

In Baltimore also Baldwin was arrested in a raid on a "colored" brothel (1908), a scandal that put an end to his American career. Forced to leave Johns Hopkins he looked for residence in Paris. He was to reside in France till his death in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Hothersall, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

His first years (1908–1912) in France were interrupted by long stays in [[Mexico]] where he advised on university matters and lectured at the School of Higher Studies at the National University in [[Mexico City]]. His ''Darwin and the Humanities'' (1909) and ''Individual and Society'' (1911) date from this period.
In 1912 he took permanent residence in Paris.

Baldwin's residence in France resulted in his pointing out the urgency of American non-neutral support for his new hosts on the French battlefields of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. He published ''American Neutrality, Its Cause and Cure'' (1916) for the purpose, and when in 1916 he survived a German torpedo attack on the {{ship|SS|Sussex||2}} in the [[English Channel]]&amp;nbsp;– on the return trip from a visit to [[William Osler]] at Oxford&amp;nbsp;– his open telegram to the President of the United States on the affair became frontpage news (''New York Times''). With the entry of America in the war (1917) he helped to organize the Paris branch of the American Navy League, acting as its Chairman till 1922. In 1926 his memoirs ''Between Two Wars (1861-1921)'' were published. He died in Paris on November 8, 1934.

==Ideas==
Baldwin was prominent among early experimental psychologists and was voted by his peers as the fifth most important psychologist in America in a 1903 survey conducted by [[James McKeen Cattell]],&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, J. M. (1933). American Men of Science. New York: Science Press, pp.1277-1278.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was his contributions to [[developmental psychology]] that were the most important. His stepwise theory of cognitive development was a major influence on the later, and much more widely known, developmental theory of [[Jean Piaget]]. Equally important is his contribution to the development of what is currently known as Theory of Mind (ToM).&lt;ref&gt;Obiols JE and Berrios GE (2009): The historical roots of Theory of Mind: the work of James Mark Baldwin ''History of Psychiatry'', 20(3): 377-392&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas on the relationship of Ego and Alter were developed by [[Pierre Janet]];&lt;ref&gt;Henri Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970), p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; while his stress on how "My sense of self grows by imitation of you...an imitative creation"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ellenberger, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to the [[mirror stage]] of [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits'' (1997), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

His contributions to the young discipline's early journals and institutions were highly significant as well. Baldwin was a co-founder (with [[James McKeen Cattell]]) of ''[[Psychological Review]]'' (which was founded explicitly to compete with [[G. Stanley Hall]]'s ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]''), ''[[Psychological Monographs]]'' and ''[[Psychological Index]].'' He was also the founding editor of ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''.

In 1892 he was vice-president of the [[International Congress of Psychology]] held in [[London]], and in 1897–1898 president of the [[American Psychological Association]]; he received a gold medal from the [[Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences of Denmark]] (1897), and was honorary president of the [[International Congress of Criminal Anthropology]] held in [[Geneva]] in 1896.

===Organic selection===
The idea of organic selection came from the interpretation of the observable data in Baldwin's experimental study of infant reaching and its role in [[Developmental disorder|mental development]]. Every practice of the infant's movement intended to advance the integration of [[behavior]] favorable to development in the experimental framework appeared to be selected from an excess of movement in the trial of imitation.

In further stages of development&amp;nbsp;– the ones most critical to an understanding of the evolution of mind&amp;nbsp;– this was graphically illustrated in the child's efforts to draw and learning to write. (''Mental Development in the Child and the Race'')

In later editions of ''Mental Development'' Baldwin changed  the term "''organic'' selection" into "''functional'' selection".

So, from the outset the idea was well linked to the [[philosophy of mind]] Baldwin was emancipating from the models inspired by divine pre-establishment. ([[Spinoza]]) (Wozniak, 2001)

It is the communication of this insight into the practice-related nature of dynamogenic development, above all its integration as a creative factor in the fabric of society, that helped the students of Baldwin to understand what was left of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck's]] signature. Singularly illustrated by [[Gregory Bateson]] in ''Mind and Nature'' (1979) and reintegrated in contemporary studies by [[Terrence Deacon]] (''[[The Symbolic Species]]: The [[co-evolution]] of [[language]] and the [[human brain]]'', 1997) and other scholars of [[biosemiotics]].

In the [[human species]] the faculty of niche building is favored by a practical intelligence able to design the circumstances that will put its vital acquirements out of harm's way in terms of (linearly predicted) [[natural selection]]. It is precisely in the fields of study relating to massive [[selection pressure]]s against which other species seem to be without defenses&amp;nbsp;– biological development in the face of novel [[pandemic]]s ([[AIDS]], [[mad cow disease]])&amp;nbsp;– that the arguments relative to the natural [[heredity]] of intelligent acquirements have resurfaced in a way most challenging to science.

===Baldwin effect===
{{Main|Baldwin effect}}
Baldwin's most important theoretical legacy is the concept of the [[Baldwin effect]] or "Baldwinian evolution". Baldwin proposed, against the [[Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckian]]s of his day (most notably [[Edward Drinker Cope]]), that there is a mechanism whereby [[epigenetic]] factors come to shape the congenital endowment as much as&amp;nbsp;– or more than&amp;nbsp;– [[natural selection]] pressures.  In particular, human behavioral decisions made and sustained across generations as a set of [[culture|cultural]] practices ought to be considered among the factors shaping the human genome.

For example, the [[incest taboo]], if powerfully enforced, removes the natural [[natural selection|selection pressure]] against the possession of incest-favoring instincts. After a few generations without this natural selection pressure, unless such genetic material were profoundly fixed, it would tend to diversify and lose its function. Humans would no longer be innately averse to incest, but would rely on their capacity to internalize such rules from cultural practices.

The opposite case can also be true: cultural practice might [[Artificial selection|selectively breed]] humans to meet the fitness conditions of new environments, cultural and physical, which earlier hominids could not have survived. Baldwinian evolution might strengthen or weaken a genetic trait.

==Influence==
Baldwin's contribution to this field places him at the heart of contemporary controversies in the fields of [[evolutionary psychology]] and wider [[sociobiology]]. Few people did more than Robert Wozniak, Professor of Psychology at [[Bryn Mawr College]], for the rediscovery of the significance of James Mark Baldwin in the [[history of ideas]].

==Work==
Apart from articles in the ''[[Psychological Review]]'', Baldwin wrote:
*''Handbook of Psychology'' (1890), translation of Ribot’s ''German Psychology of To-day'' (1886);
*''Elements of Psychology'' (1893);
*''Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development'' (1898);
*''Story of the Mind'' (1898);
*''Mental Development in the Child and the Race'' (1896);
*''Thought and Things'' ([[London]] and [[New York City|New York]], 1906).

He also largely contributed to the ''[[Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]]'' (1901–1905), of which he was [[editing|editor]] in-chief.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">The idea that there are specific '''marine counterparts to land creatures''',&lt;ref&gt;Succinctly expressed by [[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], "It used to be a common belief that everything on the earth had its counterpart in the sea" ([[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], Kenneth Frazier, ''Bestiary: Being a Translation of a Latin Bestiary of the Twelfth Century'' (London, 1954), reissued as ''The Book of Beasts'' 1960:250ff).&lt;/ref&gt; inherited from the writers on [[natural history]] in [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]], was firmly believed in [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;See Hasan M. El-Shamy, ''Folk traditions of the Arab world: a guide to motif classification'', 1995, under F133.1, Marine counterpart to land.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medieval Europe]], and is exemplified by the creatures represented in the medieval animal encyclopedias called [[Bestiary|bestiaries]] and in the parallels drawn in the moralising attributes attached to each. "The creation was a mathematical diagram drawn in parallel lines," T. H. White said a propos the bestiary he translated. "Things did not only have a moral they often had physical counterparts in other strata. There was a horse in the land and a sea-horse in the sea. For that matter there was probably a [[Pegasus]] in heaven".&lt;ref&gt;T.H. White, ''op. cit'' p 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of perfect analogies in the fauna of land and sea was considered part of the perfect [[symmetry]]&lt;ref&gt;The "perfection" of symmetry was an idea highly developed in the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean tradition]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Creator_deity|Creator]]'s plan, offered as the "[[book of nature]]" to mankind, for which a text could be found in ''[[Book of Job|Job]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you. Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Job 12:7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea appears in the Jewish Tannaic sources as well, as brought down in Babylonian Talmud, Chulin 127a. Rashi (Psalms 49:2) traces this to a biblical source – the land is referred to as "Chaled", from the weasel (chulda), because the weasel is the only animal on dry land that does not have its counterpart in the sea.
 
All of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] was considered to reflect the Creator, and Man could learn about the Creator through studying the Creation, an assumption that underlies the "[[watchmaker analogy]]" offered as a proof of God's existence.

The correspondence between the realms of earth and sea, extending to its denizens, offers examples of the taste for [[allegory]] engendered by Christian and Islamic methods of [[exegesis]], which also encouraged the [[doctrine of signatures]], a "key" to the meaning and use of herbs.

The source text that was most influential in compiling the bestiaries of the 12th and 13th centuries was the ''[[Physiologus]]'', one of the most widely read and copied secular texts of the Middle Ages. Written in Greek in Alexandria the 2nd century CE and accumulating further "exemplary" beasts in the next three centuries and more, ''Physiologus'' was transmitted in the West in Latin, and eventually translated into many vernacular languages: many manuscripts in various languages survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestiary.ca/intro.htm David Badke, "The Medieval Bestiary: Introduction"]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the Characteristics of Animals'' (A. F. Scholfield, in [[Loeb Classical Library]], 1958).

Christian writers, trained in [[Anagoge|anagogical thinking]] and expecting to find spiritual instruction inherent in the processes of Nature, disregarded the caveat in [[Pliny's Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Naturalis''IX.2.&lt;/ref&gt; where the idea is presented as a "vulgar opinion": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hence it is that the vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while, at the same time, many other productions are there to be found which nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in the sea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimate objects even, is easily to be understood by all who will take the trouble to examine the grape-fish, the sword-fish, the sawfish, and the cucumber-fish, which last so strongly resembles the real cucumber both in colour and in smell.&lt;ref&gt;Translation of [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] points out that many more things are found in the sea than on the land, and also mentions the correspondences that may be discovered between many non-living objects of the land and living creatures in the sea. 

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] reasons based on [[analogy]], that since there is a serpent in the grass, there must be an eel in the sea; because there is a [[Leviathan]] in the sea, there must be a [[Behemoth]] on the land. (''City of God''? xi.15?)

&lt;!--this doctrine doesn't appear in the on-line translation of excerpts:[[Isidore of Seville]]'s encyclopedic ''Etymologiae'',&lt;ref&gt;''Etymologiae'' XII?&lt;/ref&gt; contained a section about animals, derived from Classical authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]].--&gt; 
The reaction to such anagogical thinking set in with the unfolding of critical [[Scientific thinking|scientific thought]] in the 17th century. Sir [[Thomas Browne]] devoted a chapter of his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' to dispelling such a belief: Chapter XXIV: "That all Animals in the land are in their kinde&lt;!--kinde in original--&gt; in the Sea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo324.html On-line text].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] the ancient conception was given an innovative and rationalized cast by [[Benoît de Maillet]] in describing the transformations and metamorphoses undergone by creatures of the sea to render them fit for life on land, a proto-evolutionist concept, though it was based on superficial morphological similarities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are in the Sea, Fish of almost all the Figures of Land-Animals, and even of Birds. She includes Plants, Flowers, and some Fruits; the Nettle, the Rose, the [[Dianthus|Pink]], the Melon and the Grape, are to be found there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the Quadrupeds, we not only find in the Sea, Species of the same Figure and Inclinations, and in the Waves living on the same Aliments by which they are nourished on Land, we have also Examples of those Species living equally in the Air and in the Water. Have not the Sea-Apes precisely the same figure with those of the Land?&lt;ref&gt;Maillet, ''Telliamed'': "Sixth Day: Origin of Man and Animals"; this and several further passages are quoted in Mary Efrosini Gregory, ''Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought'' :22f., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' Ishmael, with a nod to Sir Thomas Browne's wording, denies the claim that land animals find their counterparts in the sea,&lt;blockquote&gt;For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Moby-Dick'', ch. 58 "Brit".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
in discussing [[dolphin]]s trained to aid scuba divers, a 1967 ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' article could still casually state: "It's hoped that the marine counterparts of some land animals can be trained to become useful members of the [[SEALAB (United States Navy)|Man-in-the-Sea program]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stimson, "Lifeguards: Friendly dolphins— the mammals with the high IQ— are being trained for undersea rescue missions", ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maxwell’s thermodynamic surface''' is an 1874 sculpture&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbNK9lRLHPEC&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=148 |quote=I have just finished a clay model of a fancy surface, showing the solid, liquid, and gaseous states, and the continuity of liquid and gaseous states."

Last winter I made several attempts to model the surface which he suggests, in which the three coordinates are volume, entropy and energy. The numerical data about entropy can only be obtained by integration from data which are for most bodies very insufficient, and besides it would require a very unwieldy model to get all the features, say of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, well represented, so I made no attempt at accuracy, but modelled a fictitious substance, in which the volume is greater when solid than when liquid; and in which, as in water, the saturated vapour becomes superheated by compression. When I had at last got a plaster cast I drew on it lines of equal pressure and temperature, so as to get a rough motion of their forms. This I did by placing the model in sunlight, and tracing the curve when the rays just grazed the surface... I send you a sketch of these lines..."

It was based on the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]’ graphical [[thermodynamics]] papers of 1873.&lt;ref name="siggraph"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas G.West |title=James Clerk Maxwell, Working in Wet Clay |url=http://www.siggraph.org/publications/newsletter/v33n1/columns/west.html |journal=SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Newsletter |volume=33 |issue=1 |date=February 1999 |pages=15–17 |doi=10.1145/563666.563671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC&amp;pg=PA118 |page=118 |title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking |isbn=9780195173246 |author1=Cropper |first1=William H |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model, in Maxwell's words, allowed "the principal features of known  substances [to] be represented on a convenient scale."&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell and Harman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JbNK9lRLHPEC&amp;pg=PA230 pp. 230-231]: "I enclose a rough sketch of the lines on Gibbs' surface, co-ordinates Volume Entropy Energy in an imaginary substance in which the principal features of known substances can be represented on a convenient scale." (letter to [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], 8 July, 1875)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of the model ==
Gibbs' papers defined what Gibbs called the "thermodynamic surface," which expressed the relationship between the volume, entropy, and energy of a substance at different temperatures and pressures. However, Gibbs did not include any diagrams of this surface.&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iowa"&gt;[http://www.eng.iastate.edu/coe/feature/jolls.asp Iowa State Chemical Engineer Drives Issue of New Stamp Honoring Father of Thermodynamics: Iowa State University – College of Engineering, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030193200/http://www.eng.iastate.edu/coe/feature/jolls.asp |date=2012-10-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving reprints of Gibbs' papers, Maxwell recognized the insight afforded by Gibbs' new point of view and set about constructing physical three-dimensional models of the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Garber, Brush, and Everitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hA-oIDR0eXkC&amp;pg=PA49 p. 49].&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected Maxwell's talent as a strong visual thinker&lt;ref&gt;Ken Brodlie, "Scientific visualization — past, present and future," Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Neutron Scattering Data Analysis, ''Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment'', Volume 354, Issue 1, 15 January 1995, Pages 104-111, {{doi|10.1016/0168-9002(94)01031-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and prefigured modern [[scientific visualization]] techniques.&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt;

Maxwell sculpted the original model in clay and made three [[plaster cast]]s of the clay model, sending one to Gibbs as a gift, keeping the other two in his laboratory at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt; Maxwell's copy is on display at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] of Cambridge University,&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Museum at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]: [http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/museum/area1/cabinet1.htm Maxwell's Apparatus].&lt;/ref&gt; while Gibbs' copy is on display at the Sloane Physics Laboratory of [[Yale University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth R. Jolls |chapter=Gibbs and the art of thermodynamics |title=Proceedings of the Gibbs Symposium, Yale University, May 15–17, 1989 |page=321 |editor=D. G. Caldi |editor2=George D. Mostow |publisher= American Mathematical Society |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-8218-0157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Gibbs held a professorship. A number of historic photographs were taken of these plaster casts during the middle of the twentieth century – including one by James Pickands II, published in 1942&lt;ref name="Rukeyser"/&gt; – and these photographs exposed a wider range of people to Maxwell's visualization approach.

== Uses of the model ==
[[File:Maxwell's letters plate IV.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maxwell's sketch of the isothermals and isopiestics on his surface (Plate IV of his collected letters).]]

Maxwell drew lines of equal pressure (isopiestics) and of equal temperature (isothermals) on his plaster cast by placing it in the sunlight, and "tracing the curve when the rays just grazed the surface."&lt;ref name="onheat"/&gt; He sent sketches of these lines to a number of colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Garber, Brush, and Everitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hA-oIDR0eXkC&amp;pg=PA50 pp. 50].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, his letter to [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]] of 15 July 1875 included sketches of these lines.&lt;ref name="onheat"/&gt; Maxwell provided a more detailed explanation and a clearer drawing of the lines in the revised version of his book ''Theory of Heat'',&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell]], ''[https://archive.org/details/theoryofheat00maxwrich Theory of Heat]'', revised in 1891 by [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh]]: the drawing of the lines appears as Figure 26d on page 207.&lt;/ref&gt; and a version of this drawing appeared on a 2005 US postage stamp in honour of Gibbs.&lt;ref name="Iowa"/&gt;

As well as being on display in two countries, Maxwell's model lives on in the literature of thermodynamics, and books on the subject often mention it,&lt;ref name="mt"&gt;See, for example, Don S. Lemons, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WFZf2G80tNcC&amp;pg=PA146 Mere Thermodynamics]'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-8018-9015-2}}, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; though not always with complete historical accuracy. For example, the thermodynamic surface represented by the sculpture is often reported to be that of water,&lt;ref name="mt"/&gt; contrary to Maxwell's own statement.&lt;ref name="onheat"/&gt;

Maxwell's model was not the first plaster model of a thermodynamic surface: in 1871, even before Gibbs' papers, [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] had constructed a plaster [[pressure]]-[[volume]]-[[temperature]] plot, based on data for [[carbon dioxide]] collected by [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anneke Levelt Sengers|Johanna Levelt Sengers]], ''[http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/fluids_complete.pdf How Fluids Unmix: Discoveries by the School of Van der Waals and Kamerlingh Onnes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530063315/http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/fluids_complete.pdf |date=2007-05-30 }}'', [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 2002, pp. 56 &amp; 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical physics]], '''Minkowski space''' (or '''Minkowski spacetime''') is a combining of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] and [[time]] into a four-dimensional [[manifold]] where the [[spacetime interval]] between any two [[Event (relativity)|events]] is independent of the [[inertial frame of reference]] in which they are recorded. Although initially developed by mathematician [[Hermann Minkowski]] for [[Maxwell's equations]] of electromagnetism, the mathematical structure of Minkowski spacetime was shown to be an immediate consequence of the [[postulates of special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minkowski space is closely associated with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[special relativity]], and is the most common mathematical structure on which special relativity is formulated. While the individual components in Euclidean space and time may differ due to [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]], in Minkowski spacetime, all frames of reference will agree on the total distance in spacetime between events.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This makes spacetime distance an [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because it treats time differently than it treats the 3 spatial dimensions, Minkowski space differs from [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional Euclidean space]].

In 3-dimensional Euclidean space (e.g. simply ''space'' in [[Galilean relativity]]), the [[isometry group]] (the maps preserving the regular [[Euclidean distance]]) is the [[Euclidean group]]. It is generated by [[Rotation matrix|rotations]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]]. When time is amended as a fourth dimension, the further transformations of translations in time and [[Galilean boost]]s are added, and the group of all these transformations is called the [[Galilean group]]. All Galilean transformations preserve the ''3-dimensional'' Euclidean distance. This distance is purely spatial. Time differences are ''separately'' preserved as well. This changes in the spacetime of special relativity, where space and time are interwoven.

Spacetime is equipped with an indefinite [[Degenerate bilinear form|non-degenerate]] [[bilinear form]], variously called the ''Minkowski metric'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Minkowski norm squared'' or ''Minkowski inner product'' depending on the context.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Consistent use of the terms "Minkowski inner product", "Minkowski norm" or "Minkowski metric" is intended for the bilinear form here, since it is in widespread use. It is by no means "standard" in the literature, but no standard terminology seems to exist.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minkowski inner product is defined as to yield the [[spacetime interval]] between two events when given their coordinate difference vector as argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Independent Axioms for Minkowski Space-Time |edition=illustrated |first1=John W. |last1=Schutz |publisher=CRC Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-582-31760-4 |pages=184–185 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOO1SWD17GIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=eOO1SWD17GIC&amp;pg=PA184 Extract of page 184]&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with this inner product, the mathematical model of spacetime is called Minkowski space. The analogue of the Galilean group for Minkowski space, preserving the spacetime interval (as opposed to the spatial Euclidean distance) is the [[Poincaré group]].

In summary, Galilean spacetime and Minkowski spacetime are, when viewed as manifolds, actually ''the same''. They differ in what further structures are defined ''on'' them.  The former has the Euclidean distance function and time (separately) together with inertial frames whose coordinates are related by Galilean transformations, while the latter has the Minkowski metric together with inertial frames whose coordinates are related by Poincaré transformations.

{{Spacetime|cTopic=Types}}

===Four-dimensional Euclidean spacetime===
{{See also|Four-dimensional space}}
In 1905&amp;ndash;06 [[Henri Poincaré]] showed&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poincaré|1905–1906|pp=129&amp;ndash;176}} Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:On the Dynamics of the Electron (July)|On the Dynamics of the Electron]]&lt;/ref&gt; that by taking time to be an imaginary fourth [[spacetime]] coordinate {{math|''ict''}}, where {{mvar|c}} is the [[speed of light]] and {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]], a [[Lorentz transformation]] can formally be regarded as a rotation of coordinates in a four-dimensional space with three real coordinates representing space, and one [[imaginary time|imaginary coordinate]] representing time, as the fourth dimension. In physical spacetime special relativity stipulates that the quantity

:&lt;math&gt;- t^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2&lt;/math&gt;

is invariant under coordinate changes from one inertial frame to another, i. e. under Lorentz transformations. Here the speed of light {{mvar|c}} is, following Poincaré, set to unity. In the space suggested by him (Poincaré mentions this only in passing) where physical spacetime is ''coordinatized'' by {{math|(''t'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ↦ (''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''it'')}}, call it ''coordinate space'', Lorentz transformations appear as ordinary rotations preserving the quadratic form

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2&lt;/math&gt;

on coordinate space. The naming and ordering of coordinates, with the same labels for space coordinates, but with the imaginary time coordinate as the ''fourth coordinate'', is conventional. The above expression, while making the former expression more familiar,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The surface {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0}} is a [[3-sphere]] in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} and linear transformations preserving {{math|''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} are either [[Rotation group|rotations]] or reflections.&lt;/ref&gt; may potentially be confusing because it is ''not'' the same {{mvar|t}} that appears in the latter (''time coordinate'') as in the former (''time itself'' in some inertial system as measured by clocks stationary in that system).

Rotations in planes spanned by two space unit vectors appear in coordinate space as well as in physical spacetime appear as Euclidean rotations and are interpreted in the ordinary sense. The "rotation" in a plane spanned by a space unit vector and a time unit vector, while formally still a rotation in coordinate space, is a [[Lorentz boost]] in physical spacetime with ''real'' inertial coordinates (see also [[Lorentz transformation#Hyperbolic rotation of coordinates|hyperbolic rotation]]). The analogy with Euclidean rotations is thus only partial.

This idea was elaborated by [[Hermann Minkowski]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Minkowski|1907–1908|pp=53&amp;ndash;111}} *Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies|The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies]].&lt;/ref&gt; who used it to restate the [[Maxwell equations]] in four dimensions, showing directly their invariance under the Lorentz transformation. He further reformulated in four dimensions the then-recent theory of special relativity of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. From this he concluded that time and space should be treated equally, and so arose his concept of events taking place in a unified four-dimensional [[spacetime continuum]].

===Minkowski space===
In a further development in his 1908 "Space and Time" lecture,&lt;ref name=raumzeit&gt;{{harvnb|Minkowski|1907–1909|pp=75&amp;ndash;88}} Various English translations on Wikisource: "[[s:Translation:Space and Time|Space and Time]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Minkowski gave an alternative formulation of this idea that used a real time coordinate instead of an imaginary one, representing the four variables {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t'')}} of space and time in coordinate form in a four dimensional real [[vector space]]. Points in this space correspond to events in spacetime. In this space, there is a defined [[light-cone]] associated with each point, and events not on the light-cone are classified by their relation to the apex as ''spacelike'' or ''timelike''. It is principally this view of spacetime that is current nowadays, although the older view involving imaginary time has also influenced special relativity. 

In the English translation of Minkowski's paper, the Minkowski metric as defined below is referred to as the ''line element''. The Minkowski inner product of below appears unnamed when referring to orthogonality (which he calls ''normality'') of certain vectors, and the Minkowski norm squared is referred to (somewhat cryptically, perhaps this is translation dependent) as "sum".

Minkowski's principal tool is the [[Minkowski diagram]], and he uses it to define concepts and demonstrate properties of Lorentz transformations (e.g. [[proper time]] and [[length contraction]]) and to provide geometrical interpretation to the generalization of Newtonian mechanics to [[relativistic mechanics]]. For these special topics, see the referenced articles, as the presentation below will be principally confined to the mathematical structure (Minkowski metric and from it derived quantities and the Poincaré group as symmetry group of spacetime) ''following'' from the invariance of the spacetime interval on the spacetime manifold as consequences of the postulates of special relativity, not to specific application or ''derivation'' of the invariance of the spacetime interval. This structure provides the background setting of all present relativistic theories, barring general relativity for which flat Minkowski spacetime still provides a springboard as curved spacetime is locally Lorentzian.

Minkowski, aware of the fundamental restatement of the theory which he had made, said
{{quote|The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.| Hermann Minkowski, 1908, 1909&lt;ref name=raumzeit/&gt;}}

Though Minkowski took an important step for physics, [[Einstein]] saw its limitation:
:At a time when Minkowski was giving the geometrical interpretation of special relativity by extending the Euclidean three-space to a [[pseudo-Euclidean space|quasi-Euclidean]] four-space that included time, Einstein was already aware that this is not valid, because it excludes the phenomenon of [[gravitation]]. He was still far from the study of curvilinear coordinates and [[Riemannian geometry]], and the heavy mathematical apparatus entailed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornelius Lanczos]] (1972) "Einstein's Path from Special to General Relativity", pages 5—19 of ''General Relativity: Papers in Honour of J.L. Synge'', L. O’Raifeartaigh editor, [[Clarendon Press]], see page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical structure ==
[[Image:Image Tangent-plane.svg|thumb|A pictorial representation of the tangent space at a point, {{mvar|x}}, on a [[sphere]]. This vector space can be thought of as a subspace of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} itself. Then vectors in it would be called ''geometrical tangent vectors''. By the same principle, the tangent space at a point in flat spacetime can be thought of as a subspace of spacetime which happens to be ''all'' of spacetime.]]
It is assumed below that spacetime is endowed with a coordinate system corresponding to an [[inertial frame]]. This provides an ''origin'', which is necessary in order to be able to refer to spacetime as being modeled as a vector space. This is not really ''physically'' motivated in that a canonical origin ("central" event in spacetime) should exist. One can get away with less structure, that of an [[affine space]], but this would needlessly complicate the discussion and would not reflect how flat spacetime is normally treated mathematically in modern introductory literature.

For an overview, Minkowski space is a {{math|4}}-dimensional [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] equipped with  a nondegenerate, [[symmetric bilinear form]] on the [[tangent space]] at each point in spacetime, here simply called the ''Minkowski inner product'', with [[metric signature]] either {{math|(+ − − −)}} or {{math|(− + + +)}}. The tangent space at each event is a vector space of the same dimension as spacetime, {{math|4}}.

=== Tangent vectors ===
In practice, one need not be concerned with the tangent spaces. The vector space nature of Minkowski space allows for the canonical identification of vectors in tangent spaces at points (events) with vectors (points, events) in Minkowski space itself. See e.g. {{harvtxt|Lee|2003|loc=Proposition 3.8.}} These identifications are routinely done in mathematics. They can be expressed formally in Cartesian coordinates as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) \leftrightarrow x^0\mathbf e_0|_p + x^1\mathbf e_1|_p + x^2\mathbf e_2|_p + x^3\mathbf e_3|_p \leftrightarrow x^0\mathbf e_0|_q + x^1\mathbf e_1|_q + x^2\mathbf e_2|_q + x^3\mathbf e_3|_q,&lt;/math&gt;

with basis vectors in the tangent spaces defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_\mu|_p = \left .\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}\right|_p \text{ or } \mathbf e_0|_p = \left(\begin{matrix} 1\\0\\0\\0\end{matrix}\right) \text{, etc}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are any two events and the last identification is referred to as [[parallel transport]]. The first identification is the canonical identification of vectors in the tangent space at any point with vectors in the space itself. The appearance of basis vectors in tangent spaces as first order differential operators is due to this identification. It is motivated by the observation that a geometrical tangent vector can be associated in a one-to-one manner with a [[directional derivative]] operator on the set of smooth functions. This is promoted to a ''definition'' of tangent vectors in manifolds ''not'' necessarily being embedded in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This definition of tangent vectors is not the only possible one as ordinary n-tuples can be used as well.
{{Hidden begin| titlestyle = color:green;background:lightgrey;|title=Definitions of tangent vectors as ordinary vectors}}
A tangent vector at a point {{mvar|p}} may be defined, here specialized to Cartesian coordinates in Lorentz frames, as {{math|4 × 1}} column vectors {{mvar|v}} associated to ''each'' Lorentz frame related by Lorentz transformation {{math|Λ}} such that the vector {{mvar|v}} in a frame related to some frame by {{math|Λ}} transforms according to {{math|''v'' → Λ''v''}}. This is the ''same'' way in which the coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} transform. Explicitly,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x'^\mu &amp;= {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu x^\nu,\\ v'^\mu &amp;= {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu v^\nu.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This definition is equivalent to the definition given above under a canonical isomorphism.
{{Hidden end}}

For some purposes it is desirable to identify tangent vectors at a point {{math|''p''}} with ''displacement vectors'' at {{math|''p''}}, which is, of course, admissible by essentially the same canonical identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2003|loc=See Lee's discussion on geometric tangent vectors early in chapter 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identifications of vectors referred to above in the mathematical setting can correspondingly be found in a more physical and explicitly geometrical setting in {{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1970}}. They offer various degree of sophistication (and rigor) depending on which part of the material one chooses to read.

=== Metric signature ===
The metric signature refers to which sign the Minkowski inner product yields when given space (''spacelike'' to be specific, defined further down) and time basis vectors (''timelike'') as arguments. Further discussion about this theoretically inconsequential, but practically necessary choice for purposes of internal consistency and convenience is deferred to the hide box below.
{{Hidden begin| titlestyle = color:green;background:lightgrey;|title=The choice of metric signature}}
In general, but with several exceptions, mathematicians and general relativists prefer spacelike vectors to yield a positive sign, {{math|(− + + +)}}, while particle physicists tend to prefer timelike vectors to yield a positive sign, {{math|(+ − − −)}}. Authors covering several areas of physics, e.g. [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Course of Theoretical Physics|Landau and Lifshitz]] ({{math|(− + + +)}} and {{math|(+ − − −)}} respectively) stick to one choice regardless of topic. Arguments for the former convention include "continuity" from the Euclidean case corresponding to the non-relativistic limit {{math|''c'' → ∞}}. Arguments for the latter include that minus signs, otherwise ubiquitous in particle physics, go away. Yet other authors, especially of introductory texts, e.g. {{harvtxt|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1978}}, do ''not'' choose a signature at all, but instead opt to coordinatize spacetime such that the time ''coordinate'' (but not time itself!) is imaginary. This removes the need of the ''explicit'' introduction of a [[metric tensor]] (which may seem as an extra burden in an introductory course), and one needs ''not'' be concerned with [[covariant vector]]s and [[contravariant vector]]s (or raising and lowering indices) to be described below. The inner product is instead effected by a straightforward extension of the [[dot product]] in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × ℂ}}. This works in the flat spacetime of special relativity, but not in the curved spacetime of general relativity, see {{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1970|loc=Box 2.1, Farewell to ''ict''}} (who, by the way use {{math|(− + + +)}}). MTW also argues that it hides the true ''indefinite'' nature of the metric and the true nature of Lorentz boosts, which aren't rotations. It also needlessly complicates the use of tools of [[differential geometry]] that are otherwise immediately available and useful for geometrical description and calculation &amp;ndash; even in the flat spacetime of special relativity, e.g. of the electromagnetic field.
{{Hidden end}}

=== Terminology ===
Mathematically associated to the bilinear form is a [[tensor]] of type {{math|(0,2)}} at each point in spacetime, called the ''Minkowski metric''.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For comparison and motivation of terminology, take a [[Riemannian metric]], which provides a positive definite symmetric bilinear form, i. e. an [[inner product]] proper at each point on a manifold.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minkowski metric, the bilinear form, and the Minkowski inner product are actually all the very same object; it is a bilinear function that accepts two (contravariant) vectors and returns a real number. In coordinates, this is the {{math|4×4}} matrix representing the bilinear form.

For comparison, in [[general relativity]], a [[Lorentzian manifold]] {{math|''L''}} is likewise equipped with a [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] {{math|''g''}}, which is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on the tangent space {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''L''}} at each point {{mvar|p}} of {{math|''L''}}. In coordinates, it may be represented by a {{math|4×4}} matrix ''depending on spacetime position''. Minkowski space is thus a comparatively simple special case of a Lorentzian manifold. Its metric tensor is in coordinates the same symmetric matrix at every point of {{math|''M''}}, and its arguments can, per above, be taken as vectors in spacetime itself.

Introducing more terminology (but not more structure), Minkowski space is thus a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]] with total dimension {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}} and signature {{math|(3, 1)}} or {{math|(1, 3)}}. Elements of Minkowski space are called [[Event (relativity)|events]]. Minkowski space is often denoted {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,1&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1,3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to emphasize the chosen signature, or just {{math|''M''}}. It is perhaps the simplest example of a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].

An interesting example of non-inertial coordinates for (part of) Minkowski spacetime are the [[Born coordinates]]. Another useful set of coordinates are the [[Light-cone coordinates|lightcone coordinates]].

=== Pseudo-Euclidean metrics ===
{{main article|Pseudo-Euclidean space|Lorentzian manifolds}}

The Minkowski metric&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The Minkowski inner product is not an [[inner product]], since it is not [[Definite bilinear form|positive-definite]], i.e. the [[quadratic form]] {{math|''η''(''v'', ''v'')}} need not be positive for nonzero {{mvar|v}}. The positive-definite condition has been replaced by the weaker condition of non-degeneracy. The bilinear form is said to be ''indefinite''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{mvar|η}} is the metric tensor of Minkowski space. It is a pseudo-Euclidean metric, or more generally a ''constant'' pseudo-Riemannian metric in Cartesian coordinates. As such it is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form, a type {{math|(0,2)}} tensor. It accepts two arguments {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, vectors in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'', ''p'' ∈ ''M''}}, the tangent space at {{math|''p''}} in {{math|''M''}}. Due to the above-mentioned canonical identification of {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} with {{math|''M''}} itself, it accepts arguments {{math|''u'', ''v''}} with both {{math|''u''}} and {{math|''v'' }} in {{math|''M''}}.

As a notational convention, vectors {{mvar|v}} in {{mvar|M}}, called [[4-vector]]s, are denoted in sans-serif italics, and not, as is common in the Euclidean setting, with boldface {{math|'''v'''}}. The latter is generally reserved for the {{math|3}}-vector part (to be introduced below) of a {{math|4}}-vector.

The definition

:&lt;math&gt;u \cdot v =\eta(u, v)&lt;/math&gt;

yields an inner product-like structure on {{math|''M''}}, previously and also henceforth, called the ''Minkowski inner product'', similar to the Euclidean [[inner product]], but it describes a different geometry. It is also called the ''relativistic dot product''. If the two arguments are the same,

:&lt;math&gt;u \cdot u =\eta(u, u) \equiv ||u||^2 \equiv u^2,&lt;/math&gt;

the resulting quantity will be called the ''Minkowski norm squared''. The Minkowski inner product satisfies the following properties.

*&lt;math&gt;\eta(au + v, w) = a\eta(u, w) + \eta(v,  w), \quad \forall  u, v \in M, \forall a \in \mathbb R \qquad \text{(linearity in first slot)}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\eta( u,  v) = \eta( v,  u) \qquad \text{(symmetry)}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\eta( u,  v) = 0 \quad \forall v \in M \Rightarrow u = 0 \qquad \text{(non-degeneracy)}&lt;/math&gt;

The first two conditions imply bilinearity. The defining ''difference'' between a pseudo-inner product and an [[inner product]] proper is that the former is ''not'' required to be positive definite, that is, {{math|''η''(''u'', ''u'') &lt; 0}} is allowed.

The most important feature of the inner product and norm squared is that ''these are quantities unaffected by Lorentz transformations''. In fact, it can be taken as the defining property of a Lorentz transformation that it preserves the inner product (i.e. the value of the corresponding bilinear form on two vectors). This approach is taken more generally for ''all'' classical groups definable this way in [[classical group]]. There, the matrix {{math|Φ}} is identical in the case {{math|O(3, 1)}} (the Lorentz group) to the matrix {{math|''η''}} to be displayed below.

Two vectors {{math|''v''}} and {{math|''w''}} are said to be [[orthogonal]] if {{math|''η''(''v'', ''w'') {{=}} 0}}. For a geometric interpretation of orthogonality in the special case when {{math|''η''(''v'', ''v'') ≤ 0}} and {{math|''η''(''w'', ''w'') ≥ 0}} (or vice versa), see [[hyperbolic orthogonality]].

A vector {{math|''e''}} is called a [[unit vector]] if {{math|''η''(''e'', ''e'') {{=}} ±1}}. A [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for {{math|''M''}} consisting of mutually orthogonal unit vectors is called an [[orthonormal basis]].{{cn|reason=M not inner product space|date=October 2017}}

For a given [[inertial frame]], an orthonormal basis in space, combined by the unit time vector, forms an orthonormal basis in Minkowski space. The number of positive and negative unit vectors in any such basis is a fixed pair of numbers, equal to the signature of the bilinear form associated with the inner product. This is [[Sylvester's law of inertia]].

More terminology (but not more structure): The Minkowski metric is a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]], more specifically, a [[Lorentzian metric]], even more specifically, ''the'' Lorentz metric, reserved for {{math|4}}-dimensional flat spacetime with the remaining ambiguity only being the signature convention.

=== Minkowski metric ===
From the [[Postulates of special relativity|second postulate of special relativity]], together with homogeneity of spacetime and isotropy of space, it follows that the [[spacetime interval]] between two arbitrary events called {{math|1}} and {{Math|2}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;\pm\left[c^2(t_1 - t_2)^2 - (x_1 - x_2)^2 - (y_1 - y_2)^2 - (z_1 - z_2)^2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The interval is independent of the inertial frame chosen, as is shown [[Derivations of the Lorentz transformations#Invariance of interval|here]]. The factor {{math|±1}} determines the choice of the [[metric signature]] as an arbitrary [[sign convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Flat and Curved Space-times |edition=illustrated |first1=G. F. |last1=Rayner Ellis |first2=Ruth M. |last2=Williams |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-19-850656-0 |page=209 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hos31wty5WIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hos31wty5WIC&amp;pg=PA209 Extract of page 209]&lt;/ref&gt; The numerical values of {{mvar|η}}, viewed as a matrix representing the Minkowski inner product, follow from the theory of [[bilinear form]]s.

Just as the signature of the metric is differently defined in the literature, this quantity is not consistently named. The interval (as defined here) is sometimes referred to as the interval squared.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sard|1970|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the square root of the present interval occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When signature and interval are fixed, ambiguity still remains as which coordinate is the time coordinate. It may be the fourth, or it may be the zeroth. This is not an exhaustive list of notational inconsistencies. It is a fact of life that one has to check out the definitions first thing when one consults the relativity literature.

The invariance of the interval under coordinate transformations between inertial frames follows from the invariance of

:&lt;math&gt;\pm\left[c^2t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;

(with either sign {{math|±}} preserved), provided the transformations are linear. This [[quadratic form]] can be used to define a bilinear form

:&lt;math&gt; u \cdot  v = \pm\left[c^2t_1t_2 - x_1x_2 - y_1y_2 - z_1z_2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

via the [[polarization identity]]. This bilinear form can in turn be written as

:&lt;math&gt; u \cdot  v =  u^{\mathrm T}[\eta] v,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|[''η'']}} is a {{math|4×4}} matrix associated with {{mvar|η}}. Possibly confusingly, denote {{math|[''η'']}} with just {{mvar|η}} as is common practice. The matrix is read off from the explicit bilinear form as

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \pm \begin{pmatrix}-1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

and the bilinear form

:&lt;math&gt;u \cdot v =\eta(u, v),&lt;/math&gt;

with which this section started by assuming its existence, is now identified.

For definiteness and shorter presentation, the signature {{math|(− + + +)}} is adopted below. This choice (or the other possible choice) has no (known) physical implications. The symmetry group preserving the bilinear form with one choice of signature is isomorphic (under the map given [[Classical group#O(p, q) and O(n) – the orthogonal groups|here]]) with the symmetry group preserving the other choice of signature. This means that both choices are in accord with the two postulates of relativity. Switching between the two conventions is straightforward. If the metric tensor {{math|''η''}} has been used in a derivation, go back to the earliest point where it was used, substitute {{math|''η''}} for {{math|''–η''}}, and retrace forward to the desired formula with the desired metric signature.

=== Standard basis ===
A standard basis for Minkowski space is a set of four mutually orthogonal vectors {{math|{ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; } }} such that
:&lt;math&gt;-\eta(e_0, e_0) = \eta(e_1, e_1) = \eta(e_2, e_2) = \eta(e_3, e_3) = 1 .&lt;/math&gt;
These conditions can be written compactly in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\eta(e_\mu, e_\nu) = \eta_{\mu \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

Relative to a standard basis, the components of a vector {{math|''v''}} are written {{math|(''v''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ''v''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} where the [[Einstein notation]] is used to write {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The component {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called the '''timelike component''' of {{math|''v''}} while the other three components are called the '''spatial components'''. The spatial components of a {{math|4}}-vector {{math|''v''}} may be identified with a {{math|3}}-vector {{math|'''v''' {{=}} (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

In terms of components, the Minkowski inner product between two vectors {{math|''v''}} and {{math|''w''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(v, w) = \eta_{\mu \nu} v^\mu w^\nu =  v^0 w_0 + v^1 w_1 + v^2 w_2 + v^3 w_3 = v^\mu w_\mu = v_\mu w^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(v, v) = \eta_{\mu \nu} v^\mu v^\nu =  v^0v_0 + v^1 v_1 + v^2 v_2 + v^3 v_3 = v^\mu v_\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''lowering of an index''' with the metric was used.

====Raising and lowering of indices====
{{main|Raising and lowering indices|tensor contraction}}

[[File:1-form linear functional.svg|thumb|400px|Linear functionals (1-forms) '''α''', '''β''' and their sum '''σ''' and vectors '''u''', '''v''', '''w''', in [[three-dimensional space|3d]] [[Euclidean space]]. The number of (1-form) [[hyperplane]]s intersected by a vector equals the [[inner product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Technically, a non-degenerate bilinear form provides a map between a vector space and its dual, in this context, the map is between the tangent spaces of {{math|''M''}} and the [[cotangent space]]s of {{math|''M''}}. At a point in {{math|''M''}}, the tangent and cotangent spaces are [[dual vector space]]s (so the dimension of the cotangent space at an event is also {{math|4}}). Just as an authentic inner product on a vector space with one argument fixed, by [[Riesz representation theorem]], may be expressed as the action of a [[linear functional]] on the vector space, the same holds for the Minkowski inner product of Minkowski space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2003}}. One point in Lee's proof of existence of this map needs modification (Lee deals with [[Riemannian metric]]s.). Where Lee refers to positive definiteness to show injectivity of the map, one needs instead appeal to non-degeneracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus if {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the components of a vector in a tangent space, then {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the components of a vector in the cotangent space (a linear functional). Due to the identification of vectors in tangent spaces with vectors in {{math|''M''}} itself, this is mostly ignored, and vectors with lower indices are referred to as '''covariant vectors'''. In this latter interpretation, the covariant vectors are (almost always implicitly) identified with vectors (linear functionals) in the dual of Minkowski space. The ones with upper indices are '''contravariant vectors'''. In the same fashion, the inverse of the map from tangent to cotangent spaces, explicitly given by the inverse of {{math|''η''}} in matrix representation, can be used to define '''raising of an index'''. The components of this inverse are denoted {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. It happens that {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. These maps between a vector space and its dual can be denoted {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x266D;&lt;/sup&gt;}} (eta-flat) and {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x266F;&lt;/sup&gt;}} (eta-sharp) by the musical analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2003|loc=The tangent-cotangent isomorphism p. 282.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contravariant and covariant vectors are geometrically very different objects. The first can and should be thought of as arrows. A linear functional can be characterized by two objects: its [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]], which is a [[hyperplane]] passing through the origin, and its norm. Geometrically thus, covariant vectors should be viewed as a set of hyperplanes, with spacing depending on the norm (bigger = smaller spacing), with one of them (the kernel) passing through the origin. The mathematical term for a covariant vector is 1-covector or [[1-form]] (though the latter is usually reserved for covector ''fields'').

{{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1970}} uses a vivid analogy with wave fronts of a [[de Broglie wave]] (scaled by a factor of Planck's reduced constant) quantum mechanically associated to a [[momentum four-vector]] to illustrate how one could imagine a covariant version of a contravariant vector. The inner product of two contravariant vectors could equally well be thought of as the action of the covariant version of one of them on the contravariant version of the other. The inner product is then how many time the arrow pierces the planes. The mathematical reference, {{harvtxt|Lee|2003}}, offers the same geometrical view of these objects (but mentions no piercing).

The [[electromagnetic field tensor]] is a [[2-form|differential 2-form]], which geometrical description can as well be found in MTW.

One may, of course, ignore geometrical views all together (as is the style in e.g. {{harvtxt|Weinberg|2002}} and {{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002}}) and proceed algebraically in a purely formal fashion. The time-proven robustness of the formalism itself, sometimes referred to as [[index gymnastics]], ensures that moving vectors around and changing from contravariant to covariant vectors and vice versa (as well as higher order tensors) is mathematically sound. Incorrect expressions tend to reveal themselves quickly.

====The formalism of the Minkowski metric====
The present purpose is to show semi-rigorously how ''formally'' one may apply the Minkowski metric to two vectors and obtain a real number, i.e. to display the role of the differentials, and how they disappear in a calculation. The setting is that of smooth manifold theory, and concepts such as convector fields and exterior derivatives are introduced.
{{Hidden begin| titlestyle = color:green;background:lightgrey;|title=A formal approach to the Minkowski metric}}
A full-blown version of the Minkowski metric in coordinates as a tensor field on spacetime has the appearance

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu \otimes dx^\nu = \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu \odot dx^\nu = \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu  dx^\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

Explanation: The coordinate differentials are 1-form fields. They are defined as the [[exterior derivative]] of the coordinate functions {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. These quantities evaluated at a point {{mvar|p}} provide a basis for the cotangent space at {{mvar|p}}. The [[tensor product]] (denoted by the symbol {{math|⊗}}) yields a tensor field of type {{math|(0, 2)}}, i.e. the type that expects two contravariant vectors as arguments. On the right hand side, the [[Symmetric tensor#Symmetric part of a tensor|symmetric product]] (denoted by the symbol {{math|⊙}} or by juxtaposition) has been taken. The equality holds since, by definition, the Minkowski metric is symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation on the far right is also sometimes used for the related, but different, [[line element]]. It is ''not'' a tensor. For elaboration on the differences and similarities, see {{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=Box 3.2 and section 13.2.}}

''Tangent'' vectors are, in this formalism, given in terms of a basis of differential operators of the first order,

:&lt;math&gt;\left .\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} \right|_p,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|p}} is an event. This operator applied to a function {{mvar|f}} gives the [[directional derivative]] of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}} in the direction of increasing {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''ν'' ≠ ''μ''}} fixed. They provide a basis for the tangent space at {{mvar|p}}.

The exterior derivative {{math|''df''}} of a function {{mvar|f}} is a '''covector field''', i.e. an assignment of a cotangent vector to each point {{math|p}}, by definition such that

:&lt;math&gt;df(X) = Xf,&lt;/math&gt;

for each [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}}. A vector field is an assignment of a tangent vector to each point {{math|p}}. In coordinates {{mvar|X}} can be expanded at each point {{mvar|p}} in the basis given by the {{math|∂/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Applying this with {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the coordinate function itself, and {{math|''X'' {{=}} ∂/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, called a ''coordinate vector field'', one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;dx^\mu\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}\right) = \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial x^\nu} = \delta_\nu^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this relation holds at each point {{mvar|p}}, the {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} provide a basis for the cotangent space at each {{mvar|p}} and the bases {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|∂/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[dual basis|dual]] to each other,

:&lt;math&gt;\left .dx^\mu\right|_p\left(\left .\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}\right|_p\right) = \delta^\mu_\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

at each {{mvar|p}}. Furthermore, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \otimes \beta (a, b) = \alpha(a)\beta(b)&lt;/math&gt;

for general one-forms on a tangent space {{math|''α'', ''β''}} and general tangent vectors {{math|''a'', ''b''}}. (This can be taken as a definition, but may also be proved in a more general setting.)

Thus when the metric tensor is fed two vectors fields {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, both expanded in terms of the basis coordinate vector fields, the result is

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu \otimes dx^\nu(a, b) = \eta_{\mu\nu} a^\mu b^\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''b''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the ''component functions'' of the vector fields. The above equation holds at each point {{mvar|p}}, and the relation may as well be interpreted as the Minkowski metric at {{mvar|p}} applied to two tangent vectors at {{mvar|p}}.

As mentioned, in a vector space, such as that modelling the spacetime of special relativity, tangent vectors can be canonically identified with vectors in the space itself, and vice versa. This means that the tangent spaces at each point are canonically identified with each other and with the vector space itself. This explains how the right hand side of the above equation can be employed directly, without regard to spacetime point the metric is to be evaluated and from where (which tangent space) the vectors come from.

This situation changes in [[general relativity]]. There one has

:&lt;math&gt;g(p)_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu|_p dx^\nu|_p(a, b) = g(p)_{\mu\nu} a^\mu b^\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

where now {{math|''η'' → ''g''(''p'')}}, i.e. {{mvar|g}} is still a metric tensor but now depending on spacetime and is a solution of [[Einstein's field equation]]s. Moreover, {{math|''a'', ''b''}} ''must'' be tangent vectors at spacetime point {{mvar|p}} and can no longer be moved around freely.

== Lorentz transformations and symmetry ==

[[Image:Standard conf.png|right|thumb|250px|Standard configuration of coordinate systems for Lorentz transformations.]]

The [[Poincaré group]] is the group of all transformations preserving the interval. The interval is quite easily seen to be preserved by the [[translation group]] in {{math|4}} dimensions. The other transformations are those that preserve the interval and leave the origin fixed. Given the bilinear form associated with the Minkowski metric, the appropriate group follows directly from the theory (in particular the definition) of [[classical group#O(p, q) and O(n) – the orthogonal groups|classical group]]s. In the linked article, one should identify {{math|''η''}} (in its a matrix representation) with the matrix {{math|Φ}}.

The appropriate group is {{math|O(3,1)}}, in this context called the [[Lorentz group]]. Its elements are called (homogeneous) [[Lorentz transformation]]s. For other methods of derivation, with a more physical twist, see [[derivations of the Lorentz transformations]].

Among the simplest Lorentz transformations is a [[Lorentz boost]]. For reference, a boost in the {{math|''x''}}-direction is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
U'_0 \\ U'_1 \\ U'_2 \\ U'_3
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\gamma&amp;-\beta \gamma&amp;0&amp;0\\
-\beta \gamma&amp;\gamma&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
U_0 \\ U_1 \\ U_2 \\ U_3
\end{bmatrix}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = { 1 \over \sqrt{1 - {v^2 \over c^2}} }&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]], and

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = { v \over c} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Other Lorentz transformations are pure rotations, and hence elements of the {{math|[[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3)]]}} subgroup of {{math|O(3,1)}}. A general homogeneous Lorentz transformation is a product of a pure boost and a pure rotation. An ''inhomogeneous'' Lorentz transformation is a homogeneous transformation followed by a translation in space and time. Special transformations are those that invert the space coordinates [[Parity (physics)#|({{math|P}})]] and time coordinate [[time reversal symmetry|({{math|T}})]] respectively, or both {{math|(PT)}}.

All [[four-vector]]s in Minkowski space transform, by definition, according to the same formula under Lorentz transformations. [[Minkowski diagram]]s illustrate Lorentz transformations.

==Causal structure==
[[File:World line.svg|250px|thumb|right|Subdivision of Minkowski spacetime with respect to an event in four disjoint sets. The [[light cone]], the '''absolute future''', the '''absolute past''', and '''elsewhere'''. The terminology is from {{harvtxt|Sard|1970}}.]]

{{Main article|Causal structure}}
Where v is velocity, and x, y, and z are [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] coordinates in 3-dimensional space, and c is the constant representing the universal speed limit, and t is time, the four-dimensional vector {{math|''v'' {{=}} (''ct'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} (''ct'', '''r''')}} is classified according to the sign of {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A vector is '''timelike''' if {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, '''spacelike''' if {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and '''null''' or '''lightlike''' if {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This can be expressed in terms of the sign of {{math|''η''(''v'',''v'')}} as well, but depends on the signature. The classification of any vector will be the same in all frames of reference that are related by a Lorentz transformation (but not by a general Poincaré transformation because the origin may then be displaced) because of the invariance of the interval.

The set of all null vectors at an event&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Translate the coordinate system so that the event is the new origin.&lt;/ref&gt; of Minkowski space constitutes the [[light cone]] of that event. Given a timelike vector {{math|''v''}}, there is a [[worldline]] of constant velocity associated with it, represented by a straight line in a Minkowski diagram.

Once a direction of time is chosen,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This corresponds to the time coordinate either increasing or decreasing when proper time for any particle increases. An application of {{mvar|T}} flips this direction.&lt;/ref&gt; timelike and null vectors can be further decomposed into various classes. For timelike vectors one has
# future-directed timelike vectors whose first component is positive, (tip of vector located in absolute future in figure) and
# past-directed timelike vectors whose first component is negative (absolute past).
Null vectors fall into three classes:
# the zero vector, whose components in any basis are {{math|(0, 0, 0, 0)}} (origin),
# future-directed null vectors whose first component is positive (upper light cone), and
# past-directed null vectors whose first component is negative (lower light cone).
Spacelike vectors are in elsewhere. The terminology stems from the fact that spacelike separated events are connected by vectors requiring [[faster-than-light]] travel, and so cannot possibly influence each other. Together with spacelike and lightlike vectors there are 7 classes in all.

An [[orthonormal]] basis for Minkowski space necessarily consists of one timelike and three spacelike unit vectors. If one wishes to work with non-orthonormal bases it is possible to have other combinations of vectors. For example, one can easily construct a (non-orthonormal) basis consisting entirely of null vectors, called a '''null basis'''.

[[Vector field]]s are called timelike, spacelike or null if the associated vectors are timelike, spacelike or null at each point where the field is defined.

===Chronological and causality relations===

Let {{math|''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''M''}}. We say that

#{{math|''x''}} '''''chronologically precedes''''' {{math|''y''}} if {{math|''y'' − ''x''}} is future-directed timelike. This relation has the [[transitive property]] and so can be written {{math|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}. 
#{{math|''x''}} '''''causally precedes''''' {{math|''y''}} if {{math|''y'' − ''x''}} is future-directed null or future-directed timelike. It gives a [[partial ordering]] of space-time and so can be written {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}}.

Suppose ''x'' ∈ ''M'' is timelike. Then the '''simultaneous hyperplane''' for x is &lt;math&gt;\{y : \eta(x, y ) = 0\}.&lt;/math&gt; Since this [[hyperplane]] varies as ''x'' varies, there is a [[relativity of simultaneity]] in Minkowski space.

===Reversed triangle inequality===

If {{math|''v''}} and {{math|''w''}} are both future-directed timelike four-vectors, then in the {{math|(+ − − −)}} sign convention for norm, 
:&lt;math&gt; \left\| v+w \right\| \ge \left\| v \right\| + \left\| w \right\| .&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations ==
{{main article|Lorentzian manifold|Super Minkowski space}}
A Lorentzian manifold is a generalization of Minkowski space in two ways. The total number of spacetime dimensions is not restricted to be  {{math|4}} ({{math|2}} or more) and a Lorentzian manifold need not be flat, i.e. it allows for curvature.

=== Generalized Minkowski space ===
Minkowski space refers to a mathematical formulation in four dimensions. However, the mathematics can easily be extended or simplified to create an analogous generalized Minkowski space in any number of dimensions. If {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}}, {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Minkowski space is a vector space of real dimension {{math|''n''}} on which there is a constant Minkowski metric of signature {{math|(''n'' − 1, 1)}} or {{math|(1, ''n'' − 1)}}. These generalizations are used in theories where spacetime is assumed to have more or less than {{math|4}} dimensions. [[String theory]] and [[M-theory]] are two examples where {{math|''n'' &gt; 4}}. In string theory, there appears [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] with {{math|1 + 1}} spacetime dimensions.

[[de Sitter space]] can be formulated as a submanifold of generalized Minkowski space as can the model spaces of [[hyperbolic geometry]] (see below).

=== Curvature ===
As a ''flat spacetime'', the three spatial components of Minkowski spacetime always obey the [[Pythagorean Theorem]]. Minkowski space is a suitable basis for [[special relativity]], a good description of physical systems over finite distances in systems without significant [[gravitation]]. However, in order to take gravity into account, physicists use the theory of [[general relativity]], which is formulated in the mathematics of a [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. When this geometry is used as a model of physical space, it is known as [[curved space]].

Even in curved space, Minkowski space is still a good description in an [[Local reference frame|infinitesimal region]] surrounding any point (barring gravitational singularities).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This similarity between flat and curved space at infinitesimally small distance scales is foundational to the definition of a [[manifold]] in general.&lt;/ref&gt; More abstractly, we say that in the presence of gravity spacetime is described by a curved 4-dimensional [[manifold]] for which the [[tangent space]] to any point is a 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Thus, the structure of Minkowski space is still essential in the description of general relativity.

== Geometry ==
{{main article|Hyperboloid model}}

The meaning of the term ''geometry'' in the context of Minkowski space depends heavily on what is meant by the term. Minkowski space is not endowed with a Euclidean geometry, and not with any of the generalized Riemannian geometries with intrinsic curvature, those exposed by the ''model spaces'' in [[hyperbolic geometry]] (negative curvature) and the geometry modeled by the [[sphere]] (positive curvature). The reason is the indefiniteness of the Minkowski metric. Minkowski space is, in particular, not a [[metric space]] and not a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric. However, Minkowski space contains [[submanifold]]s endowed with a Riemannian metric yielding hyperbolic geometry.

Model spaces of hyperbolic geometry of low dimension, say {{math|2}} or {{math|3}}, ''cannot'' be isometrically embedded in Euclidean space with one more dimension, i.e. {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} respectively, with the Euclidean metric {{math|{{overline|''g''}}}}, disallowing easy visualization.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;There ''is'' an isometric embedding into {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} according to the [[Nash embedding theorem]] ({{harvtxt|Nash|1956}}), but the embedding dimension is much higher, {{math|''n'' {{=}} (''m''/2)(''m'' + 1)(3''m'' + 11)}} for a Riemannian manifold of dimension {{mvar|m}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, model spaces with positive curvature are just spheres in Euclidean space of one higher dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turns out however that these hyperbolic spaces ''can'' be isometrically embedded in spaces of one more dimension when the embedding space is endowed with the Minkowski metric {{math|''η''}}.

Define {{math|'''H'''{{su|p=1(''n'')|b=''R''}} ⊂ '''M'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} to be the upper sheet ({{math|''ct'' &gt; 0}}) of the [[hyperboloid]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf H_R^{1(n)} = \left\{\left(ct, x^1, \ldots, x^n\right) \in \mathbf M^n: c^2 t^2 - \left(x^1\right)^2 \cdots \left(x^n\right)^2 = R^2, ct &gt; 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

in generalized Minkowski space {{math|'''M'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} of spacetime dimension {{math|''n'' + 1}}. This is one of the [[Lorentz group#Restricted Lorentz group|surfaces of transitivity]] of the generalized Lorentz group. The [[induced metric]] on this submanifold,

:&lt;math&gt;h_R^{1(n)} = \iota^* \eta,&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of the Minkowski metric {{math|''η''}} under inclusion, is a [[Riemannian metric]]. With this metric {{math|'''H'''{{su|p=1(''n'')|b=''R''}}}} is a [[Riemannian manifold]]. It is one of the model spaces of Riemannian geometry, the [[hyperboloid model]] of [[hyperbolic space]]. It is a space of constant negative curvature {{math|−1/''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{math|1}} in the upper index refers to an enumeration of the different model spaces of hyperbolic geometry, and the {{math|''n''}} for its dimension. A {{math|2(2)}} corresponds to the [[Poincaré disk model]], while {{math|3(''n'')}} corresponds to the [[Poincaré half-plane model|Poincaré half-space model]] of dimension {{math|''n''}}.

=== Preliminaries ===
In the definition above {{math|''ι'':'''H'''{{su|p=1(''n'')|b=''R''}} → '''M'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[inclusion map]] and the superscript star denotes the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]. The present purpose is to describe this and similar operations as a preparation for the actual demonstration that {{math|'''H'''{{su|p=1(''n'')|b=''R''}}}} actually is a hyperbolic space.

! Behavior of tensors under inclusion, pullback of covariant tensors under general maps and pushforward of vectors under general maps
|-
|
&lt;u&gt;'''Behavior of tensors under inclusion:'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
For inclusion maps from a submanifold {{mvar|S}} into {{mvar|M}} and a covariant tensor {{mvar|α}} of order {{mvar|k}} on {{mvar|M}} it holds that

:&lt;math&gt;\iota^*\alpha\left(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k\right) = \alpha\left(\iota_*X_1, \iota_*X_2, \ldots, \iota_*X_k\right) = \alpha\left(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} are vector fields on {{mvar|S}}. The subscript star denotes the pushforward (to be introduced later), and it is in this special case simply the identity map (as is the inclusion map). The latter equality holds because a tangent space to a submanifold at a point is in a canonical way a subspace of the tangent space of the manifold itself at the point in question. One may simply write

:&lt;math&gt;\iota^*\alpha = \alpha|_S,&lt;/math&gt;

meaning (with slight [[abuse of notation]]) the restriction of {{mvar|α}} to accept as input vectors tangent to some {{math|''s'' ∈ ''S''}} only.

&lt;u&gt;'''Pullback of tensors under general maps:'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The pullback of a covariant {{mvar|k}}-tensor {{mvar|α}} (one taking only contravariant vectors as arguments) under a map {{math|''F'':''M'' → ''N''}} is a linear map

:&lt;math&gt;F^*:T_{F(p)}^k N \rightarrow T_p^k M,&lt;/math&gt;

where for any vector space {{mvar|V}},

:&lt;math&gt;T^k V = \underbrace{V^* \otimes V^* \cdots \otimes V^*}_{k\text{ times}}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;F^*(\alpha)\left(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k\right) = \alpha\left(F_* X_1, F_*X_2, \ldots, F_* X_k\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript star denotes the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of the map {{mvar|F}}, and {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., X&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are vectors in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}. (This is in accord with what was detailed about the pullback of the inclusion map. In the general case here, one cannot proceed as simply because {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} in general.)

&lt;u&gt;'''The pushforward of vectors under general maps:'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Heuristically, pulling back a tensor to {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} from {{math|''F''(''p'') ∈ ''N''}} feeding it vectors residing at {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} is by definition the same as pushing forward the vectors from {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} to {{math|''F''(''p'') ∈ ''N''}} feeding them to the tensor residing at {{math|''F(''p'') ∈ ''N''}}.

Further unwinding the definitions, the pushforward {{math|F&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''TN''&lt;sub&gt;''F''(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} of a vector field under a map {{math|''F'':''M'' → ''N''}} between manifolds is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;F_*(X)f = X(f \circ F),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|f}} is a function on {{mvar|N}}. When {{math|''M'' {{=}} ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''N''{{=}} ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} the pushforward of {{mvar|F}} reduces to {{math|''DF'':ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; →  ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the ordinary [[Total derivative#The total derivative as a linear map|differential]], which is given by the [[Jacobian matrix]] of partial derivatives of the component functions. The differential is the best linear approximation of a function {{mvar|F}} from {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The pushforward is the smooth manifold version of this. It acts between tangent spaces, and is in coordinates represented by the Jacobian matrix of the ''coordinate representation'' of the function.

The corresponding pullback is the [[Transpose of a linear map|dual map]] from the dual of the range tangent space to the dual of the domain tangent space, i.e. it is a linear map,

:&lt;math&gt;F^*:T^*_{F(p)}N \rightarrow T^*_p M.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Hyperbolic stereographic projection ===
[[File:HyperboloidProjection.png|thumb|right|Red circular arc is geodesic in [[Poincaré disk model]]; it projects to the brown geodesic on the green hyperboloid.]]
In order to exhibit the metric it is necessary to pull it back via a suitable ''parametrization''. A parametrization of a submanifold {{mvar|''S''}} of {{math|''M''}} is a map {{math|''U'' ⊂ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''M''}} whose range is an open subset of {{math|''S''}}. If {{mvar|S}} has the same dimension as {{math|''M''}}, a parametrization is just the inverse of a coordinate map {{math|''φ'':''M'' → ''U'' ⊂ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The parametrization to be used is the inverse of ''hyperbolic stereographic projection''. This is illustrated in the figure to the left for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}. It is instructive to compare to [[stereographic projection]] for spheres.

Stereographic projection {{math|''σ'':'''H'''{{su|p=''n''|b=''R''}} → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and its inverse {{math|''σ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;:ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''H'''{{su|p=''n''|b=''R''}}}} are given by

{{Equation box 1

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf H_R^n = \left\{\left(\tau, x^1, \ldots, x^n\right) \subset \mathbf M: -\tau^2 + \left(x^1\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(x^n\right)^2 = -R^2, \tau &gt; 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

and let

:&lt;math&gt;S = (-1, 0, \ldots, 0)&lt;/math&gt;

If

:&lt;math&gt;P = \left(\tau, x^1, \ldots, x^n\right) \in \mathbf H_R^n,&lt;/math&gt;

then it is geometrically clear that the vector

:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{PS}&lt;/math&gt;

intersects the hyperplane

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\left(\tau, x^1, \ldots x^n\right) \in M: \tau = 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

once in point denoted

:&lt;math&gt;U = \left(0, u^1(P), \ldots, u^n(P)\right) \equiv (0, \mathbf u).&lt;/math&gt;

One has

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S + \overrightarrow{SU} &amp;= U \Rightarrow \overrightarrow{SU} = U - S,\\
  S + \overrightarrow{SP} &amp;= P \Rightarrow \overrightarrow{SP} = U - P
\end{align}.&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \overrightarrow{SU} &amp;= (0, \mathbf u) - (-R, 0) = (R, \mathbf u),\\
  \overrightarrow{SP} &amp;= (\tau, \mathbf x) - (-R, 0) = (\tau + R, \mathbf x).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By construction of stereographic projection one has

:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{SU} = \lambda(\tau)\overrightarrow{SP}.&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the system of equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
          R &amp;= \lambda(\tau + R),\\
  \mathbf u &amp;= \lambda \mathbf x.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The first of these is solved for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and one obtains for stereographic projection

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\tau, \mathbf x) = \mathbf u = \frac{R\mathbf x}{R + \tau}.&lt;/math&gt;

Next, the inverse &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{-1}(u) = (\tau, \mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; must be calculated. Use the same considerations as before, but now with
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  U &amp;= (0, \mathbf u)\\
  P &amp;= (\tau(\mathbf u), \xi(\mathbf u)).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

One gets

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       \tau &amp;= \frac{R(1 - \lambda)}{\lambda},\\
  \mathbf x &amp;= \frac{\mathbf u}{\lambda},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

but now with &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; depending on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u.&lt;/math&gt; The condition for {{mvar|P}} lying in the hyperboloid is

:&lt;math&gt;-\tau^2 + \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u = -\tau^2 + |u|^2 = -R^2,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{R^2(1 - \lambda)^2}{\lambda^2} = \frac{|u|^2}{\lambda^2},&lt;/math&gt;

leading to

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{R^2 - |u|^2}{2R^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

With this &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^{-1}(\mathbf u) = (\tau, \mathbf x) = \left(R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 - |u|^2}, \frac{2R^2\mathbf u}{R^2 - |u|^2}.\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Pulling back the metric ===
One has

:&lt;math&gt;h_R^{1(n)} = \eta|_{\mathbf H_R^{1(n)}} = \left(dx^1\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(dx^n\right)^2 - d\tau^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the map

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^{-1}:\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbf H_R^{1 (n)}; \sigma^{-1}(\mathbf u) = (\tau (\mathbf u), \mathbf x (\mathbf u)) = \left(R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 - |u|^2}, \frac{2R^2\mathbf u}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The pulled back metric can be obtained by straightforward methods of calculus;

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)^* \eta\right|_{\mathbf H_R^{1 (n)}} = \left(dx^1(\mathbf u)\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(dx^n(\mathbf u)\right)^2 - \left(d\tau(\mathbf u)\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

One computes according to the standard rules for computing differentials (though one is really computing the rigorously defined exterior derivatives),

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  dx^1(\mathbf u) &amp;= d\left(\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right)
                   = \frac{\partial}{\partial u^1}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}du^1 + \cdots +
                       \frac{\partial}{\partial u^n}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}du^n +
                       \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}d\tau,\\
                   &amp;{}\vdots\\
   dx^n(\mathbf u) &amp;= d\left(\frac{2R^2 u^n}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right) = \cdots,\\
  d\tau(\mathbf u) &amp;= d\left(R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right) = \cdots,\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and substitutes the results into the right hand side. This yields

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)^* h_R^{1(n)} = \frac{4R^2 \left[\left(du^1\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(du^n\right)^2\right]}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2} \equiv h_R^{2(n)}. &lt;/math&gt;

One has

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial u^1}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}du^1 &amp;= \frac{2\left(R^2 -|u|^2\right) + 4R^2 \left(u^1\right)^2}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2}du^1, \\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial u^2}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}du^2 &amp;= \frac{4R^2 u^1 u^2 du^2}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2}du^2,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}d\tau^2 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

With this one may write

:&lt;math&gt;dx^1(\mathbf u) = \frac{2R^2 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)du^1 + 4R^2 u^1(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

from which

:&lt;math&gt;\left(dx^1(\mathbf u)\right)^2 = \frac{4R^2 \left(r^2 - |u|^2\right)^2 \left(du^1\right)^2 + 16R^4 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)\left(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u\right)u^1 du^1 + 14R^r \left(u^1\right)^2 \left(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u\right)^2}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4}.&lt;/math&gt;

Summing this formula one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;\left(dx^1(\mathbf u)\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(dx^n(\mathbf u)\right)^2 \\
  ={} &amp;\frac{4R^2 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2 \left[\left(du^1\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(du^n\right)^2\right] +
             16R^4 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u) +
             16R^4 |u|^2 (\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)^2}
            {\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4} \\
  ={} &amp;\frac{4R^2 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2 \left[\left(du^1\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(du^n\right)^2\right]}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4} +
      R^2 \frac{16R^4 (\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for {{mvar|τ}} one gets

:&lt;math&gt;
  d\tau = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial}{\partial u^i} R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 + |u|^2}du^i + \frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 + |u|^2}d\tau
        = \sum_{i=1}^n R^4\frac{4R^2u^idu^i}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)},
&lt;/math&gt;

yielding

:&lt;math&gt;-dt^2 = -\left(R\frac{4R^4\left(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u\right)}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2}\right)^2 = -R^2\frac{14R^4(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)^2}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now add this contribution to finally get

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)^* h_R^{1(n)} = \frac{4R^2\left[\left(du^1\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(du^n\right)^2\right]}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2} \equiv h_R^{2(n)}. &lt;/math&gt;
|}
This last equation shows that the metric on the ball is identical to the Riemannian metric {{math|''h''{{su|p=2(''n'')|b=''R''}}}} in the [[Poincaré ball model]], another standard model of hyperbolic geometry.

! Alternative calculation using the pushforward
|-
|

The pullback can be computed in a different fashion. By definition,

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)^* h_R^{1(n)}(V, V) = h_R^{1(n)}\left(\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V, \left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V\right) = \eta|_{\mathbf H_R^{1(n)}} \left(\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V, \left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In coordinates,
:&lt;math&gt;(\sigma^{-1})_*V = (\sigma^{-1})_*V^i\frac{\partial}{\partial u^i} = V^i\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial u^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} + V^i\frac{\partial \tau}{\partial u^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} = V^i\frac{\partial }x^j{\partial u^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} + V^i\frac{\partial }\tau{\partial u^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} = Vx^j\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} + V\tau \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}.&lt;/math&gt;

One has from the formula for {{math|''σ''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;}}

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}Vx^j &amp;= V^i\frac{\partial}{\partial u^i}\left(\frac{2R^2u^j}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right) = \frac{2R^2V^j}{R^2 - |u|^2} - \frac{4R^2u^j\langle \mathbf V, \mathbf u\rangle}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2}, \qquad \left(\text{here } V|u|^2 = 2\Sigma_{k=1}^nV^ku^k \equiv 2\langle \mathbf V, \mathbf u\rangle\right)\\
V\tau &amp;= V\left (R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right) = \frac{4R^3\langle \mathbf V, \mathbf u\rangle}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Lastly,

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(\sigma_*^{-1}V, \sigma_*^{-1})V) = \Sigma_{j=1}^n\left(Vx^j\right)^2 - (V\tau)^2 = \frac{4R^4 |V|^2}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2} = h_R^{2(n)}(V, V),&lt;/math&gt;

and the same conclusion is reached.

The '''mirror test''' – sometimes called the '''mark test''', '''mirror self-recognition test''' ('''MSR'''), '''red spot''' technique, or '''rouge test''' – is a [[animal behaviour|behavioural]] technique developed in 1970 by psychologist [[Gordon Gallup Jr.]] as an attempt to determine whether an animal possesses the ability of visual self-recognition.&lt;ref name="Gallup"&gt;{{cite journal

The MSR test is the traditional method for attempting to measure [[self-awareness]]. However, there has been agreement that animals can be self-aware in ways not measured by the mirror test, such as distinguishing between their own and others' songs and scents.&lt;ref name="bekoff"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bekoff |first=Marc |date=2002-09-19 |title=Animal reflections |url=https://www.philanthropysouthwest.org/sites/default/files/resources/animal%2520reflections.pdf |journal=Nature |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, animals can pass the MSR and not necessarily have self-awareness.&lt;ref name="cammaerts" /&gt;

In the classic MSR test, an animal is anaesthetised and then marked (e.g. painted, or a sticker attached) on an area of the body the animal cannot normally see.  When the animal recovers from the [[anesthetic]], it is given access to a [[mirror]].  If the animal then touches or investigates the mark, it is taken as an indication that the animal perceives the reflected image as itself, rather than of another animal.

Very few species have passed the MSR test. As of 2016, only [[great ape]]s (including humans), a single [[Asiatic elephant]], [[dolphins]], [[orcas]], and the [[Eurasian magpie]] have passed the MSR test. A wide range of species have been reported to fail the test, including several species of monkey, [[giant panda]]s, [[sea lion]]s, and [[dog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Animals That Have Passed the Mirror Test|url=http://www.animalcognition.org/2015/04/15/list-of-animals-that-have-passed-the-mirror-test/|accessdate=23 November 2015|date=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Rebecca|title=10 Animals with Self Awareness|url=http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/10-animals-with-self-awareness.html|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method and history==
The inspiration for the mirror test comes from an [[anecdote]] about [[Charles Darwin]] and a captive [[orangutan]]. While visiting the [[London Zoo]] in [[1838]], Darwin observed an orangutan, named Jenny, throwing a tantrum after being teased with an apple by her keeper. This started him thinking about the subjective experience of an orangutan.&lt;ref name="darwin1"&gt;Jonathan Weiner. ''Darwin at the Zoo.'' available at [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=darwin-at-the-zoo http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=darwin-at-the-zoo].&lt;/ref&gt;  He also watched Jenny gaze into a mirror and noted the possibility that she recognised herself in the reflection.&lt;ref name="darwin2"&gt;Carl Zimmer. ''The Descent of Man: The Concise Edition.'' excerpt available at [http://carlzimmer.com/books/descentofman/excerpt.html http://carlzimmer.com/books/descentofman/excerpt.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Gordon Gallup, Jr., experimentally investigated the possibility of self-recognition with two male and two female wild pre-adolescent [[chimpanzee]]s (''Pan troglodytes''), none of which had presumably seen a mirror previously. Each chimpanzee was put into a room by itself for two days. Next, a full-length mirror was placed in the room for a total of 80 hours at periodically decreasing distances. A multitude of behaviours was recorded upon introducing the mirrors to the chimpanzees.  Initially, the chimpanzees made threatening gestures at their own images, ostensibly seeing their own reflections as threatening. Eventually, the chimps used their own reflections for self-directed responding behaviours, such as grooming parts of their body previously not observed without a mirror, picking their noses, making faces, and blowing bubbles at their own reflections.

Gallup expanded the study by manipulating the chimpanzees' appearance and observing their reaction to their reflection in the mirror.  Gallup anaesthetised the chimpanzees and then painted a red alcohol-soluble dye on the eyebrow ridge and on the top half of the opposite ear.  When the dye dried, it had virtually no olfactory or tactile cues.  Gallup then returned the chimpanzees to the cage (with the mirror removed) and allowed them to regain full consciousness.  He then recorded the frequency with which the chimpanzees spontaneously touched the marked areas of skin. After 30 minutes, the mirror was re-introduced into the room and the frequency of touching the marked areas again determined.  The frequency of touching increased to 4–10 with the mirror present, compared to only 1 when the mirror had been removed.  The chimpanzees sometimes inspected their fingers visually or olfactorily after touching the marks.  Other mark-directed behaviour includes turning and adjusting of the body to better view the mark in the mirror, or tactile examination of the mark with an appendage while viewing the mirror.&lt;ref name="Gallup" /&gt;

An important aspect of the classical mark-test is that the mark/dye is non-tactile, preventing attention being drawn to the marking through additional perceptual cues ([[somesthesis]]).  For this reason, animals in the majority of classical tests are anesthetised. Some tests use a tactile marker.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mitchell, R.W.|year=1995|title=Evidence of dolphin self-recognition and the difficulties of interpretation|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=4|issue=2|pages=229–234|doi=10.1006/ccog.1995.1029|pmid=8521261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that are considered to be able to recognise themselves in a mirror typically progress through four stages of behaviour when facing a mirror:&lt;ref name="Plotnik2006" /&gt;
{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-alpha
| social responses
| physical inspection (e.g. looking behind the mirror)
| repetitive mirror-testing behaviour
| realisation of seeing themselves}}

Gallup conducted a follow-up study in which two chimpanzees with no prior experience of a mirror were put under anesthesia, marked and observed.  After recovery, they made no mark-directed behaviours either before or after being provided with a mirror.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The rouge test was also done by Michael Lewis and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn in 1979 for the purpose of self-recognition with human mothers and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social and Personality Development|last=Shaffer|first=David|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|year=2009|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|location=Belmont|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals that have passed==
[[File:Pica pica -Manchester -England -side-8.jpg|thumb|[[European magpie]]s have demonstrated mirror self recognition]]

A large number of studies using a wide range of species have investigated the occurrence of spontaneous, mark-directed behaviour when given a mirror, as originally proposed by Gallup.  Most marked animals given a mirror initially respond with social behaviour, such as aggressive displays, and continue to do so during repeated testing. Only a small number of species have touched or directed behaviour toward the mark, thereby passing the classic MSR test.

Findings in MSR studies are not always conclusive. Even in chimpanzees, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested.&lt;ref name="Prior" /&gt; Prevalence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and aging individuals.&lt;ref name="Povinelli"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Povinelli, D.J., Rulf, A.B., Landau, K.R. and Bierschwale, D.T.|year=1993|title=Self-recognition in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): distribution, ontogeny, and patterns of emergence|journal=J.

Until the 2008 study on magpies, self-recognition was thought to reside in the [[neocortex]] area of the brain. However, this brain region is absent in non-mammals. Self-recognition may be a case of [[convergent evolution]], where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviours or traits, although species arrive at them via different routes, and the underlying mechanism may be different.&lt;ref name="Suddendorf" /&gt;

Evidence of elephant self-awareness was shown when one (and only one) elephant, Happy, repeatedly touched a painted ''X'' on her head with her trunk, a mark which could only be seen in the mirror. Happy ignored another mark made with colorless paint that was also on her forehead to ensure she was not merely reacting to a smell or feeling.

* [[Eurasian magpie]] (''Pica pica''): The Eurasian magpie is the first non-mammal to have passed the mirror test. Researchers applied a small red, yellow or black sticker to the throat of five Eurasian magpies, where they could be seen by the bird only by using a mirror. The birds were then given a mirror. The feel of the sticker on their throats did not seem to alarm the magpies. However, when the birds with coloured stickers caught a glimpse of themselves in the mirror, they scratched at their throats—a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own. Those that received a black sticker, invisible against the black neck feathers, did not react.&lt;ref name="Prior"&gt;{{cite journal

===Insects===
* In a Belgian study from 2015, published in a [[Predatory open-access publishing|predatory journal]], by an author known for other controversial reports, 23 out of 24 adult [[ants]] scratched at small blue dots painted on their [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|clypeus]] (part of their "face") when they were able to see the dot in a mirror. According to the purported results, the ants were individually tested and were from three species, ''[[Myrmica sabuleti]]'', ''[[Myrmica rubra]]'' and ''[[Myrmica ruginodis]]''. None of the ants scratched the clypeus when they had no mirror to see the dot. None tried to scratch the blue dot on the mirror. When they had a mirror and a brown dot similar to their own color, only one of thirty ants scratched the brown dot; researchers said she was darker than average so the dot was visible. They also reacted to the mirror itself.

Ants a few days old did not react to the dots.

==Animals that have failed==
A range of species have been exposed to mirrors.  Although these might have failed the classic MSR test, they have sometimes shown mirror-related behaviour:

* [[Giant panda]] (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca''): In one study, 34 captive giant pandas of a wide range of ages were tested.  None of the pandas responded to the mark and many reacted aggressively towards the mirror, causing the researchers to consider the pandas viewed their reflection as a [[conspecific]].&lt;ref name="Panda"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ma, X., Jin, Y., Luo, B., Zhang, G., Wei, R. and Liu, D.|year=2015|title=Giant pandas failed to show mirror self-recognition|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=18|issue=3|pages=713–721|doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0838-4|pmid=25609263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could also explain why only gorillas with extensive human interaction and a certain degree of separation from other gorillas and usual gorilla behaviour are more predisposed to passing the test.&lt;ref name="The Great Ape Project" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kind" /&gt;

===Fish===
Two captive giant manta rays showed frequent, unusual and repetitive movements in front of a mirror suggested contingency checking.  They also showed unusual self-directed behaviours when exposed to the mirror.&lt;ref name="Ari"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ari, C. and D’Agostino, D.P.|year=2016|title=Contingency checking and self-directed behaviors in giant manta rays: Do elasmobranchs have self-awareness?|journal=Journal of Ethology|volume=34|issue=2|pages=167–174|doi=10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses for mirrors==
Primates, other than the great apes, have so far universally failed the mirror test. However, mirror tests with three species of [[gibbon]] (''Hylobates syndactylus'', ''H.gabriellae'', ''H. leucogenys'') have shown convincing evidence of self-recognition despite the fact that the animals failed the standard version of the mirror test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ujhelyi, M., Merker, B., Buk, P. and Geissmann, T.|year=2000|title=Observations on the behavior of gibbons (Hylobates leucogenys, H. gabriellae, and H. lar) in the presence of mirrors|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=114|issue=3|pages=253–262|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.114.3.253|pmid=10994841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rhesus macaque]]s have failed the MSR test, but use mirrors to study otherwise-hidden parts of their bodies, such as their genitals and the implants in their heads.  It has been suggested this demonstrates at least a partial self-awareness, although this is disputed.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news

[[Pig]]s can use visual information seen in a mirror to find food, and show evidence of self-recognition when presented with their reflection. In an experiment, 7 of the 8 pigs tested were able to find a bowl of food hidden behind a wall and revealed using a mirror. The eighth pig looked behind the mirror for the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Broom | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Sena | first2 = H. | last3 = Moynihan | first3 = K.

[[B. F. Skinner]] found that [[Pigeon]]s are capable of passing a highly modified mirror test after extensive training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1126/science.212.4495.695|last1 = Epstein, L., Skinner, R.P. and Skinner, B.F.|year = 1981|title = "Self-awareness" in the pigeon |url = |journal = Science |volume = 212 |issue = 4495|pages = 695–696 |pmid = 17739404 |bibcode = 1981Sci...212..695E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719225835/http://psychology.lafayette.edu/files/2010/06/selfaware.mov This is video of one such test]&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, a pigeon was [[Operant conditioning|trained]] to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it, which the pigeon then turned to peck to obtain food.  Thus, the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment. Next, the pigeon was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. The latter training was accomplished in the absence of the mirror. The final test was placing a small bib on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror present yielded no pecking at the dot. When the mirror was revealed, the pigeon became active, looked in the mirror and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib. However, [[Animal training|untrained]] pigeons have never passed the mirror test.&lt;ref name="de Waal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | author = De Waal, F.B. | year = 2008 | title = The thief in the mirror | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e201 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060201| pmid = 18715116 | pmc = 2517621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manta rays]] repeatedly swim in front of the mirror, turning over to show their undersides and moving their fins. When in front of the mirror, they  blow bubbles, an unusual behaviour. They do not try to socially interact with the mirror image, suggesting that they recognise that the mirror image is not another ray. However, a classic mirror test using marks on the rays’ bodies has yet to be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Amanda Pachniewska|year=2016|title=List of Animals That Have Passed the Mirror Test |  url = http://www.animalcognition.org/2015/04/15/list-of-animals-that-have-passed-the-mirror-test/|journal=Animalcognition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robots==
In 2012, early steps were taken to make a [[robot]] pass the mirror test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19354994 | title=Robot learns to recognise itself| work=BBC News| date=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The MSR test has been criticised for several reasons, in particular, because it may result in findings that are false negatives.&lt;ref name="Suddendorf" /&gt;

The MSR test may be of limited value when applied to species that primarily use senses other than vision.&lt;ref name="coren"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=January 2009}}  For example, dogs mainly use [[olfactory sense|olfaction]] and [[hearing|audition]]; vision is used only third. It is suggested this is why dogs fail the MSR test. With this in mind, the biologist [[Marc Bekoff]] developed a scent-based paradigm using [[dog urine]] to test self-recognition in canines.&lt;ref name="archer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coren"/&gt; He tested his own dog, but his results were inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201107/does-my-dog-recognize-himself-in-mirror | title=Does My Dog Recognize Himself in a Mirror?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dog cognition researcher Alexandra Horowitz formalized Bekoff's idea in a controlled experiment, reported on in 2016&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/being-a-dog-following-the-dog-into-a-world-of-smell/oclc/955777362|title=Being a dog : following the dog into a world of smell|last=Horowitz |first=Alexandra |date=2016 |publisher=Scribner|isbn=9781476795997|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Alexandra|date=2017|title=Smelling themselves: Dogs investigate their own odours longer when modified in an "olfactory mirror" test|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635717300104|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=143C|pages=17–24|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2017.08.001|pmid=28797909}}&lt;/ref&gt; She compared the dogs' behavior when examining their own and others' odors, and also when examining their own odor with an added smell "mark" analogous to the visual mark in MSR tests. These subjects not only discriminated their own odor from that of other dogs, as Bekoff had found, but also spent more time investigating their own odor "image" when it was modified, as subjects who pass the MSR test do.&lt;ref name="the atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/can-dogs-smell-their-reflections/537219/|title= Can Dogs Smell Their 'Reflections'?|date=17 August 2017 |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cazzolla Gatti|first=Roberto|date=2016|title=Self-consciousness: beyond the looking-glass and what dogs found there|journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=28|issue=2|pages=232–240|doi=10.1080/03949370.2015.1102777|issn=0394-9370}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested an ethological approach, the "Sniff test of self-recognition (STSR)" which may shed light on different ways of checking for self-recognition.

Another concern with the MSR test is that some species quickly respond aggressively to their mirror reflection as if it were a threatening conspecific thereby preventing the animal to calmly consider what the reflection actually represents.  It has been suggested this is the reason why gorillas and monkeys fail the MSR test.&lt;ref name="Couchman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Couchman, J.J.|year=2011|title=Self-agency in rhesus monkeys|journal=Biology Letters|pages=39–41|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/07/08/rsbl.2011.0536.short |doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0536|pmid=21733868|volume=8|issue=1|pmc=3259954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Primatology|year=1984|volume=5|issue=1|pages=81–98|title=Monkeys with mirrors: Some questions for primate psychology|author=Anderson, J.R.|doi=10.1007/bf02735149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a MSR test, animals may not recognise the mark as abnormal, or, may not be sufficiently motivated to react to it.  However, this does not mean they are unable to recognise themselves. For example, in a MSR test conducted on three elephants, only one elephant passed the test but the two elephants that failed still demonstrated behaviours that can be interpreted as self-recognition. The researchers commented that the elephants might not have touched the mark because it was not important enough to them.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kids-and-animals-who-fail-classic-mirror |title=Kids (and animals) who fail classic mirror tests may still have sense of self |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, lesser apes infrequently engage in self-grooming, which may explain their failure to touch a mark on their head in the mirror test.&lt;ref name="Suddendorf" /&gt;

Finally, it should be noted that there has been controversy over whether self-recognition implies self-awareness. The ant researchers state that many ants, from three species, pass the mirror test, but the researchers do not know that they have self-awareness.&lt;ref name="cammaerts" /&gt; Dogs recognize their own scent as different from others' scents,&lt;ref name="bekoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hearne"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animal happiness : a moving exploration of animals and their emotions |last=Hearne |first=Vicki |date=2007 |publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub]] |isbn=9781602391673 |location=New York |oclc=785423631}}&lt;/ref&gt; but fail the mirror test.

==Rouge test==
[[File:Mirror baby.jpg|thumb|225px|A human child exploring his reflection]]
The ''rouge test'' is a version of the mirror test used with human children.&lt;ref name=Amsterdam&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/dev.420050403 |author=Beulah Amsterdam |title=Mirror self-image reactions before age two |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=297–305 |year=1972 |pmid=4679817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] makeup, an experimenter surreptitiously places a dot on the face of the child. The child is then placed in front of a mirror and their reactions are monitored; depending on the child's development, distinct categories of responses are demonstrated. This test is widely cited as the primary measure for mirror self-recognition in human children.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite book |title=Social cognition and the acquisition of self |last=Lewis |first=M. |author2=Brooks-Gunn, J. |year=1979 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-306-40232-6 |page= 296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Priel&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(86)90038-X |author=Priel, Beatrice |author2=de Schonen, Scania |title=Self-Recognition: A Study of a Population without Mirrors |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=237–250 |year=1986 |pmid=3701250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sedikides&gt;Sedikides, C. &amp; Spencer, S.J.

===Developmental reactions===
From the age of 6 to 12 months, the child typically sees a "sociable playmate" in the mirror's reflection. Self-admiring and embarrassment usually begin at 12 months, and at 14 to 20 months most children demonstrate avoidance behaviours.&lt;ref name="Amsterdam" /&gt; Finally, at 18 months half of children recognise the reflection in the mirror as their own&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; and by 20 to 24 months self-recognition climbs to 65%. Children do so by evincing mark-directed behaviour; they touch their own nose or try to wipe the mark off.&lt;ref name="Amsterdam" /&gt;

It appears that self-recognition in mirrors is independent of familiarity with reflecting surfaces.&lt;ref name=Priel/&gt; In some cases the rouge test has been shown to have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a [[Nso people|Cameroonian Nso]] sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of self-recognition outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person touched) and mutual eye contact.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heidi Keller |author2=Relindis Yovsi |author3=Joern Borke |author4=Joscha Kärtner |author5=Henning Jensen |author6=Zaira Papaligoura  |title=Developmental Consequences of Early Parenting Experiences: Self-Recognition and Self-Regulation in Three Cultural Communities |journal=Child Development |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1745–1760 |year=2004|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00814.x |pmid=15566377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong correlation between self-concept and [[object permanence]] have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.&lt;ref name=Bertenthal&gt;{{cite journal |author=BENNETT I. BERTENTHAL |author2=KURT W. FISCHER |title=Development of Self-Recognition in the Infant |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=14 |pages=44–50 |year= 1978 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.14.1.44 |url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/~ddl/articlesCopy/BertenthalFischerDevtSelfRecog.DevPsy1978.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript |citeseerx=10.1.1.550.1903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications===
The rouge test is a measure of [[self-concept]]; the child who touches the rouge on his own nose upon looking into a mirror demonstrates the basic ability to understand self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/dev.420050403 | pmid=4679817 | volume=5 | issue=4 | title=Mirror self-image reactions before age two | year=1972 | journal=Dev Psychobiol | pages=297–305 | author=Amsterdam B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7FK3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=Butterworth,+1992#v=onepage&amp;q=Butterworth%2C%201992&amp;f=false|title=Self-awareness in the first few weeks of life|work=|accessdate=November 4, 2017|isbn=9781136872006|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathon|date=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social Psychology, 6th Edition p68-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals,&lt;ref name="coren"&gt;{{cite book |title=How Dogs Think |author=Stanley Coren |isbn=978-0-7432-2232-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; young children,&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;[http://www.ulm.edu/~palmer/ConsciousnessandtheSymbolicUniverse.htm "Consciousness and the Symbolic Universe"]&lt;/ref&gt; and people who have their sight restored after being blind from birth,&lt;ref name="archer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Archer |first=John |year=1992 |title=Ethology and Human Development|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-389-20996-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes react to their reflection in the mirror as though it were another individual.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Theorists have remarked on the significance of this period in a child's life. For example, [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]] used a similar test in marking the [[mirror stage]] when growing up.&lt;ref name="Lacan"&gt;Lacan, J., ''Some reflections on the Ego'' in ''Écrits'', org. published 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Current views of the [[self (psychology)|self in psychology]] position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and [[social identity]].&lt;ref name="Sedikides" /&gt;

=== Methodological flaws ===
There is some debate as to the interpretation of the results of the mirror test,&lt;ref name="coren"/&gt; and researchers in one study have identified some potential problems with the test as a means of gauging self-awareness in young children and animals.&lt;ref name="Asendorpf"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.32.2.313 |author=Asendorpf, J.B., Warkentin V. and Baudonniere, P.|title=Self-awareness and other-awareness II: Mirror self-recognition, social contingency awareness, and synchronic imitation |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=32 |pages=313–321 |year=1996 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposing that a self-recognising child or animal may not demonstrate mark-directed behaviour because they are not motivated to clean up their faces, thus providing incorrect results, the study compared results of the standard rouge test methodology against a modified version of the test.&lt;ref name=Asendorpf /&gt;

In the classic test, the experimenter first played with the children, making sure that they looked in the mirror at least three times. Then, the rouge test was performed using a dot of rouge below the child's right eye. For their modified testing, the experimenter introduced a doll with a rouge spot under its eye and asked the child to help clean the doll. The experimenter would ask up to three times before cleaning the doll themselves. The doll was then put away, and the mirror test performed using a rouge dot on the child's face. These modifications were shown to increase the number of self-recognisers.&lt;ref name="Asendorpf" /&gt;

The results uncovered by this study at least suggest some issues with the classic mirror test; primarily, that it assumes that children will recognise the dot of rouge as abnormal and attempt to examine or remove it. The classic test may have produced false negatives, because the child's recognition of the dot did not lead to them cleaning it. In their modified test, in which the doll was cleaned first, they found a stronger relationship between cleaning the doll's face and the child cleaning its own face. The demonstration with the doll, postulated to demonstrate to the children what to do, may lead to more reliable confirmation of self-recognition.&lt;ref name="Asendorpf" /&gt;

On a more general level, it remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image implies self-awareness.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Likewise, the converse may also be false—one may hold self-awareness, but not present a positive result in a mirror test.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14007">In [[multilinear algebra]], applying a map that is the [[Tensor product#Tensor product of linear maps|tensor product of linear maps]] to a [[tensor]] is called a '''multilinear multiplication'''.

== Abstract definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;F
   &lt;/math&gt; be a field of characteristic zero, such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}
   &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}
   &lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;V_k&lt;/math&gt; be a finite-dimensional vector space over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d&lt;/math&gt; be an order-d simple [[tensor]], i.e., there exist some vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_k \in V_k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \mathbf{v}_1 \otimes \mathbf{v}_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{v}_d&lt;/math&gt;. If we are given a collection of linear maps &lt;math&gt;A_k : V_k \to W_k&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''multilinear multiplication''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_d)&lt;/math&gt; is defined&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/733546583|title=Tensors : geometry and applications|last=M.|first=Landsberg, J.|date=2012|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=9780821869079|location=Providence, R.I.|oclc=733546583}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the action on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[tensor product]] of these linear maps,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387902845|title=Multilinear Algebra {{!}} Werner Greub {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d : V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d &amp; \to W_1 \otimes W_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes W_d, \\
\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes \mathbf{v}_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{v}_d &amp; \mapsto A_1(\mathbf{v}_1) \otimes A_2(\mathbf{v}_2) \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d(\mathbf{v}_d)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[tensor product]] of linear maps is itself a linear map,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and because every tensor admits a [[tensor rank decomposition]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the above expression extends linearly to all tensors. That is, for a general tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d&lt;/math&gt;, the multilinear multiplication is

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \mathcal{B} := (A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d)(\mathcal{A}) \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; (A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d)\left(\sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d\right) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; \sum_{i=1}^r A_1(\mathbf{a}_i^1) \otimes A_2(\mathbf{a}_i^2) \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d( \mathbf{a}_i^d )
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_i^k \in V_k&lt;/math&gt; is one of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;'s tensor rank decompositions. The validity of the above expression is not limited to a tensor rank decomposition; in fact, it is valid for any expression of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of pure tensors, which follows from the [[Tensor product#Universal property|universal property of the tensor product]].

It is standard to use the following shorthand notations in the literature for multilinear multiplications:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_d) \cdot \mathcal{A} := (A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d)(\mathcal{A}) 
&lt;/math&gt;and&lt;math display="block"&gt;
A_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A} := (\operatorname{Id}_{V_1}, \ldots, \operatorname{Id}_{V_{k-1}}, A_k, \operatorname{Id}_{V_{k+1}}, \ldots, \operatorname{Id}_{V_{d}}) \cdot \mathcal{A},
&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id}_{V_k} : V_k \to V_k &lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity operator]].

== Definition in coordinates ==
In computational multilinear algebra it is conventional to work in coordinates. Assume that an [[Inner product space|inner product]] is fixed on &lt;math&gt;V_k&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;V_k^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[dual vector space]] of &lt;math&gt;V_k &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\{ e_1^k, \ldots, e_{n_k}^k \} &lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;V_k &lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\{ (e_1^k)^*, \ldots, (e_{n_k}^k)^* \} &lt;/math&gt; be the dual basis, and let &lt;math&gt;\{f_1^k, \ldots, f_{m_k}^k \} &lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;W_k &lt;/math&gt;. The linear map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;M_k = \sum_{i=1}^{m_k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_k} m_{i,j}^{(k)} f_i^k \otimes (e_j^k)^* &lt;/math&gt; is then represented by the matrix &lt;math&gt;\widehat{M}_k = [m_{i,j}^{(k)}] \in F^{m_k \times n_k}&lt;/math&gt;.  Likewise, with respect to the standard tensor product basis &lt;math&gt;\{ e_{j_1}^1 \otimes e_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_d}^d \}_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d}  &lt;/math&gt;, the abstract tensor&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} e_{j_1}^1 \otimes e_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_d}^d
   &lt;/math&gt;is represented by the multidimensional array &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{A}} = [a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d}] \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d}
   &lt;/math&gt; . Observe that &lt;math display="block"&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{A}} = \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d,
   &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_j^k \in F^{n_k} &lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''th standard basis vector of &lt;math&gt;F^{n_k} &lt;/math&gt; and the tensor product of vectors is the affine [[Segre map]] &lt;math&gt;\otimes : (\mathbf{v}^{(1)}, \mathbf{v}^{(2)}, \ldots, \mathbf{v}^{(d)}) \mapsto [v_{i_1}^{(1)} v_{i_2}^{(2)} \cdots v_{i_d}^{(d)}]_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_d} &lt;/math&gt;. It follows from the above choices of bases that the multilinear multiplication &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} = (M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; becomes

&lt;math display="block" id="abba"&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\mathcal{B}} &amp;= (\widehat{M}_1, \widehat{M}_2, \ldots, \widehat{M}_d) \cdot \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \\
&amp;= \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} (\widehat{M}_1, \widehat{M}_2, \ldots, \widehat{M}_d) \cdot (\mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d) \\
&amp;= \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} (\widehat{M}_1 \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1) \otimes (\widehat{M}_2 \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2) \otimes \cdots \otimes (\widehat{M}_d \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting tensor &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{B}}&lt;/math&gt; lives in &lt;math&gt;F^{m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_d}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Element-wise definition ===
From the above expression, an element-wise definition of the multilinear multiplication is obtained. Indeed, since &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{B}}&lt;/math&gt; is a multidimensional array, it may be expressed as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{B}} = \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} b_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d,
   &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;b_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \in F
   &lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients. Then it follows from the above formulae that

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T, (\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T, \ldots, (\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \right) \cdot \widehat{\mathcal{B}} \\
= {} &amp; \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} b_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \right) \otimes \left((\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2\right) \otimes \cdots \otimes \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \right) \\
= {} &amp; \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} b_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \delta_{i_1, j_1} \cdot \delta_{i_2,j_2} \cdots \delta_{i_d, j_d} \\
= {} &amp; b_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_d},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{i,j} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} = (M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math display="block" id="abba"&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; b_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_d} = \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T, (\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T, \ldots, (\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \right) \cdot \widehat{\mathcal{B}} \\
= {} &amp; \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T, (\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T, \ldots, (\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \right) \cdot (\widehat{M}_1, \widehat{M}_2, \ldots, \widehat{M}_d) \cdot 
\sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \\
= {} &amp; \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} ((\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T \widehat{M}_1 \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1) \otimes ((\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T \widehat{M}_2 \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2) \otimes \cdots \otimes ((\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \widehat{M}_d \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d) \\
= {} &amp; \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} m_{i_1,j_1}^{(1)} \cdot m_{i_2,j_2}^{(2)} \cdots m_{i_d,j_d}^{(d)},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;m_{i,j}^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; are the elements of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{M}_k &lt;/math&gt; as defined above.

== Properties ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d &lt;/math&gt; be an order-d tensor over the tensor product of &lt;math&gt;F &lt;/math&gt;-vector spaces.  

Since a multilinear multiplication is the tensor product of linear maps, we have the following multilinearity property (in the construction of the map):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;math display="block"&gt;A_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_{k-1} \otimes (\alpha A_k + \beta B) \otimes A_{k+1} \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d = 
\alpha A_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d + \beta A_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_{k-1} \otimes \beta B_k \otimes A_{k+1} \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d 
&lt;/math&gt; 

Multilinear multiplication is a [[linear map]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;math display="block"&gt;(M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot (\alpha \mathcal{A} + \beta \mathcal{B}) 
= \alpha \; (M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{A} +
\beta \; (M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; 

It follows from the definition that the [[Composition of maps|composition]] of two multilinear multiplications is also a multilinear multiplication:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;math display="block"&gt;(M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \left( (K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_d) \cdot \mathcal{A} \right)
= (M_1 \circ K_1, M_2 \circ K_2, \ldots, M_d \circ K_d) \cdot \mathcal{A}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_k : U_k \to W_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_k : V_k \to U_k&lt;/math&gt; are linear maps.

Observe specifically that multilinear multiplications in different factors commute,

&lt;math display="block"&gt;M_k \cdot_k \left( M_\ell \cdot_\ell \mathcal{A} \right) 
= M_\ell \cdot_\ell \left( M_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A} \right) 
= M_k \cdot_k M_\ell \cdot_\ell \mathcal{A}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;k \ne \ell.&lt;/math&gt;

== Computation ==
The factor-k multilinear multiplication &lt;math&gt;M_k \cdot_k\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be computed in coordinates as follows. Observe first that

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
M_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A} &amp;= M_k \cdot_k 
\sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=2}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \\
&amp;= \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \cdots \sum_{j_{k-1}=1}^{n_{k-1}} \sum_{j_{k+1}=1}^{n_{k+1}} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_{k-1}}^{k-1} \otimes M_k \left ( \sum_{j_k=1}^{n_k} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_k}^k \right) \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_{k+1}}^{k+1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Next, since

&lt;math display="block"&gt;F^{n_1} \otimes F^{n_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d} 
\simeq F^{n_k} \otimes (F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_{k-1}} \otimes F^{n_{k+1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}) 
\simeq F^{n_k} \otimes F^{n_1 \cdots n_{k-1} n_{k+1} \cdots n_d},
&lt;/math&gt;

there is a bijective map, called the '''factor-''k'' standard [[Tensor reshaping|flattening]]''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; denoted by &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)_{(k)} &lt;/math&gt;, that identifies &lt;math&gt;M_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; with an element from the latter space, namely

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\left( M_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A} \right)_{(k)} :=
\sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \cdots \sum_{j_{k-1}=1}^{n_{k-1}} \sum_{j_{k+1}=1}^{n_{k+1}} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} M_k \left ( \sum_{j_k=1}^{n_k} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_{k}}^{k} \right) \otimes \mathbf{e}_{\mu_k(j_1,\ldots,j_{k-1},j_{k+1},\ldots,j_d)} := M_k \mathcal{A}_{(k)}, 
   &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_j &lt;/math&gt;is the ''j''th standard basis vector of &lt;math&gt;F^{N_k}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_k = n_1 \cdots n_{k-1} n_{k+1} \cdots n_d &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_{(k)} \in F^{n_k} \otimes F^{N_k} \simeq F^{n_k \times N_k} &lt;/math&gt; is the '''factor-''k'' flattening matrix''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; whose columns are the '''factor-''k'' vectors''' &lt;math&gt;[a_{j_1,\ldots,j_{k-1},i,j_{k+1},\ldots,j_d}]_{i=1}^{n_k} &lt;/math&gt; in some order, determined by the particular choice of the bijective map

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mu_k : [1,n_1] \times \cdots \times [1,n_{k-1}] \times [1,n_{k+1}] \times \cdots \times [1,n_d] \to [1,N_k]. 
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the multilinear multiplication &lt;math&gt;(M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be computed as a sequence of ''d'' factor-''k'' multilinear multiplications, which themselves can be implemented efficiently as classic matrix multiplications.

== Applications ==
The [[higher-order singular value decomposition]] (HOSVD) factorizes a tensor given in coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d} &lt;/math&gt; as the multilinear multiplication &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = (U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_d) \cdot \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_k \in F^{n_k \times n_k} &lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal matrices and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d} &lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], a '''near-field''' is an [[algebraic structure]] similar to a [[division ring]], except that it has only one of the two distributive laws. Alternatively, a near-field is a [[near-ring]] in which there is a [[multiplicative identity]], and every non-zero element has a [[multiplicative inverse]].

== Definition ==

A near-field is a set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, together with two [[binary operations]], &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; (addition) and &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (multiplication), satisfying the following axioms:
:A1: &lt;math&gt;(Q, +)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[abelian group]].
:A2: &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b) \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; for all elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (The [[associative law]] for multiplication).
:A3: &lt;math&gt;(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c  +  b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;  for all elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (The right [[distributive law]]).
:A4: &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; contains an element 1 such that &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a&lt;/math&gt;  for every element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; ([[Multiplicative identity]]).
:A5: For every non-zero element a of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; there exists an element &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; a \cdot a^{-1} = 1 = a^{-1} \cdot a &lt;/math&gt; ([[Multiplicative inverse]]).

=== Notes on the definition ===
# The above is strictly a definition of a ''right'' near-field. By replacing A3 by the left distributive law &lt;math&gt; c \cdot (a + b) = c \cdot  a  +  c\cdot b &lt;/math&gt; we get a left near-field instead. Most commonly, "near-field" is taken as meaning "right near-field", but this is not a universal convention.
# A (right) near-field is called "planar" if it is also a right [[quasifield]]. Every finite near-field is planar, but infinite near-fields need not be.  
# It is not necessary to specify that the additive group is abelian, as this follows from the other axioms, as proved by B.H. Neumann and J.L. Zemmer.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Zemmer, "The additive group of an infinite near-field is abelian" in ''J. London Math. Soc.'' 44 (1969), 65-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zassenhaus"&gt;H Zassenhaus, Abh. Math. Sem. Hans. Univ. 11, pp 187-220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.H. Neumann, "On the commutativity of addition" in ''J. London Math. Soc.'' 15 (1940), 203-208.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proof is quite difficult, and it is more convenient to include this in the axioms so that progress with establishing the properties of near-fields can start more rapidly.
# Sometimes a list of axioms is given in which A4 and A5 are replaced by the following single statement:
#:A4*: The non-zero elements form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication.
#:However, this alternative definition includes one exceptional structure of order 2 which fails to satisfy various basic theorems (such as &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0  = 0&lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;). Thus it is much more convenient, and more usual, to use the axioms in the form given above. The difference is that A4 requires 1 to be an identity for all elements, A4* only for non-zero elements.
#:The exceptional structure can be defined by taking an additive group of order 2, and defining multiplication by &lt;math&gt; x \cdot y  = x &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
# Any [[division ring]] (including any [[Field (mathematics)|field]]) is a near-field.
# The following defines a (right) near-field of order 9. It is the smallest near-field which is not a field.
#:Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Finite field|Galois field]] of order 9. Denote multiplication in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; by ' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; '. Define a new binary operation ' '''·''' ' by:
#::If &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; is any element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; which is a square and &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is any element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; a \cdot b = a*b&lt;/math&gt;.
#::If &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; is any element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; which is not a square and &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is any element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; a \cdot b = a^3*b&lt;/math&gt;.
#:Then &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a near-field with this new multiplication and the same addition as before.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pilz, Near-Rings, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and applications ==
The concept of a near-field was first introduced by [[Leonard Dickson]] in 1905. He took division rings and modified their multiplication, while leaving addition as it was, and thus produced the first known examples of near-fields that were not division rings. The near-fields produced by this method are known as Dickson near-fields; the near-field of order 9 given above is a  Dickson near-field.
[[Hans Zassenhaus]] proved that all but 7 finite near-fields are either fields or  Dickson near-fields.&lt;ref name="Zassenhaus"/&gt;

The earliest application of the concept of near-field was in the study of geometries, such as [[projective geometry|projective geometries]].&lt;ref&gt;O. Veblen and J. H. Wedderburn "Non-desarguesian and non-pascalian geometrie" in ''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.'' 8 (1907), 379-388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Dembrowski "Finite geometries" Springer, Berlin, (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Many projective geometries can be defined in terms of a coordinate system over a division ring, but others can not. It was found that by allowing coordinates from any near-ring the range of geometries which could be coordinatized was extended. For example, [[Marshall Hall (mathematician)|Marshall Hall]] used the near-field of order 9 given above to produce a [[Hall plane]], the first of a sequence of such planes based on Dickson near-fields of order the square of a prime. In 1971 [[T. G. Room]] and P.B. Kirkpatrick provided an alternative development.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. G. Room]] &amp; P.B. Kirkpatrick (1971) ''Miniquaternion geometry'', §1.3 The Miniquaternion system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal(Q),&lt;/math&gt;pp 8&amp;ndash;20, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{isbn|0-521-07926-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous other applications, mostly to geometry.&lt;ref&gt;H. Wähling "Theorie der Fastkörper", Thales Verlag, Essen, (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent application of near-fields is in the construction of ciphers for data-encryption, such as [[Hill cipher]]s.&lt;ref&gt;M. Farag, "Hill Ciphers over Near-Fields" in ''Mathematics and Computer Education'' v41 n1 (2007) 46-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description in terms of Frobenius groups and group automorphisms ==

Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a near field. Let &lt;math&gt;K_m&lt;/math&gt; be its multiplicative group and let &lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt; be its additive group. Let &lt;math&gt;c \in K_m&lt;/math&gt; act on &lt;math&gt;b \in K_a&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;b \mapsto b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;. The axioms of a near field show that this is a right group action by group automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt;, and the nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt; form a single orbit with trivial stabilizer.

Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(A)&lt;/math&gt; which acts freely and transitively on the nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then we can define a near field with additive group &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and multiplicative group &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Choose an element in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to call &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\phi: M \to A \setminus \{ 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; be the bijection &lt;math&gt;m \mapsto 1 \ast m&lt;/math&gt;. Then we define addition on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by the additive group structure on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and define multiplication by &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b = 1 \ast \phi^{-1}(a) \phi^{-1}(b)&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[Frobenius group]] can be defined as a finite group of the form &lt;math&gt;A \rtimes M&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; acts without stabilizer on the nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, near fields are in bijection with Frobenius groups where &lt;math&gt;|M| = |A|-1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Classification ==

As described above, Zassenhaus proved that all finite near fields either arise from a construction of Dickson or are one of seven exceptional examples. We will describe this classification by giving pairs &lt;math&gt;(A,M)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a group of automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which acts freely and transitively on the nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

The construction of Dickson proceeds as follows.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hall, 20.7.2, ''The Theory of Groups'', Macmillan, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; be a prime power and choose a positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that all prime factors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; divide &lt;math&gt;q-1&lt;/math&gt; and, if &lt;math&gt;q \equiv 3 \bmod 4&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is not divisible by &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be the [[finite field]] of order &lt;math&gt;q^n&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the additive group of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplicative group of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, together with the [[Finite field#Frobenius automorphism and Galois theory|Frobenius automorphism]] &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^q&lt;/math&gt; generate a group of automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;C_n \ltimes C_{q^n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; is the cyclic group of order &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The divisibility conditions on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; allow us to find a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;C_n \ltimes C_{q^n-1}&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;q^n-1&lt;/math&gt; which acts freely and transitively on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The case &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; is the case of commutative finite fields; the nine element example above is &lt;math&gt;q=3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;.

In the seven exceptional examples, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;C_p^2&lt;/math&gt;. This table, including the numbering by Roman numerals, is taken from Zassenhaus's paper.&lt;ref name="Zassenhaus"/&gt;

The binary tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral groups are central extensions of the rotational symmetry groups of the [[platonic solid]]s; these rotational symmetry groups are &lt;math&gt;A_4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_5&lt;/math&gt; respectively. &lt;math&gt;2T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 I&lt;/math&gt; can also be described as &lt;math&gt;SL(2,\mathbb{F}_3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;SL(2,\mathbb{F}_5)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
Suppose that {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[compact space]] of [[Hausdorff dimension]] {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is an element of a scale of compact spaces embedded in each other and parametrized by {{math|''t''}} ({{math|0 &lt; ''t'' &lt; ∞}}). Such scales are considered ''equivalent'' with respect to {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} if the compact spaces constituting them coincide for {{math|''t'' ≥ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. It is said that the compact space {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the ''hole'' in this equivalent set of scales, and {{math|−''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the negative dimension of the corresponding equivalence class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://static-content.springer.com/lookinside/art%3A10.1134%2FS0001434607010166/000.png|doi=10.1134/S0001434607010166|title=General notion of a topological space of negative dimension and quantization of its density|journal=Mathematical Notes|volume=81|pages=140|year=2007|last1=Maslov|first1=V. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By the 1940s, the science of topology had developed and studied a thorough basic theory of topological spaces of positive dimension. Motivated by computations, and to some extent aesthetics, topologists searched
for mathematical frameworks that extended our notion of space to allow for negative dimensions. Such dimensions, as well as the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth]] and higher dimensions, are hard to imagine since we are not able to directly observe them. It wasn’t until the 1960s that a special topological framework was constructed—the category of [[Spectrum (topology)|spectra]]. A spectrum is a generalization of space that allows for negative dimensions. The concept of negative-dimensional spaces is applied, for example, to analyze [[Outline of linguistics|linguistic statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=math/0612543 |last1= Maslov |first1= V. P. |title= Negative dimension in general and asymptotic topology |year= 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">'''Organic memory''' is a discredited biological theory, held in the late nineteenth century before the rediscovery of [[Mendelian genetics]]. The theory held the controversial notion that all [[organic matter]] contains [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Draaisma, Douwe. (2000). ''Metaphors of Memory: A History of Ideas about the Mind''. Cambridge University Press. p. 83. {{ISBN|0-521-65024-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anastasio, Thomas J; Ehrenberger, Kristen Ann; Watson, Patrick. (2012). ''Individual and Collective Memory Consolidation: Analogous Processes on Different Levels''. MIT Press. pp. 44-45. {{ISBN|978-0-262-01704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Richard Semon.jpg|thumb|upright|The German biologist [[Richard Semon]] linked organic memory to [[heredity]].]]

German physiologist [[Ewald Hering]] first suggested the idea of organic memory in an 1870 lecture for the Imperial Academy of Science in [[Vienna]]. Hering took influence from the idea of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] and suggested that memories could be passed on through generations by [[germ cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Finger. (1994). ''Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function''. Oxford University Press. p. 338. {{ISBN|978-0-262-01704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of the organic memory theory were proposed by advocates of [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] evolution such as [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[Eugenio Rignano]], [[Théodule-Armand Ribot]] and [[Richard Semon]].&lt;ref&gt;Otis, Laura. (1994). ''Organic Memory: History and the Body in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries''. University of Nebraska Press. pp. 10-34. {{ISBN|0-8032-3561-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akavia, Naamah. (2013). ''Subjectivity in Motion: Life, Art, and Movement in the Work of Hermann Rorschach''. Routledge. p. 44. {{ISBN|978-0-415-53623-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nikulin, Dmitri. (2015). ''Memory: A History''. Oxford University Press. p. 241. {{ISBN|978-0-19-979384-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents such as Semon connected the theory of organic memory to [[Heredity|hereditary]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L. (2001). ''Forgotten Ideas, Neglected Pioneers: Richard Semon and the Story of Memory''. Routledge. p. 108. {{ISBN|978-1-84169-052-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Petteri Pietikainen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Semon argued not only that information is encoded into memory and that there are 'memory traces' (engrams) or after-effects of stimulation that conserve the changes in the nervous system, he also contended that these changes in the brain (that is, engrams) are inherited. Semon's mneme-theory fell into disrepute largely because in a Lamarckian fashion it proposed that memory units are passed from one generation to another.&lt;ref&gt;Pietikainen, Petteri. (2007). ''Alchemists of Human Nature: Psychological Utopianism in Gross, Jung, Reich and Fromm''. Routledge. p. 100. {{ISBN|978-1-85196-923-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ideas of organic memory were popular amongst [[biologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s from 1870 to 1918. The theory later lost scientific legitimacy as it yielded no reliable data and advances in [[genetics]] made the theory untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, Alison. (2004). ''Prosthetic Memory: The Transformation of American Remembrance in the Age of Mass Culture''. Columbia University Press. p. 7. {{ISBN|978-0-231-12927-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Graham.

''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925, Theosophical Publishing House. "The Venetian Chohan" is profiled on page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded as one of the [[ascended master]]s in the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] (also collectively called the ''Great White Brotherhood'').  He is regarded as the Master of the Third Ray&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Seven Rays]]).  According to the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], his final life was his incarnation as the artist [[Paolo Veronese]] (1528-1588), after which he is said to have become an ''Ascended Master''.

==Paul the Venetian's etheric retreat==
{{Theosophy}}
According to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], Paul the Venetian's "''Ascended Master Retreat''" is believed to be in an enormous mansion called the "Chateau de Liberte" on the [[etheric plane]] above an area of southern [[France]] called [[Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare,  Staff of Summit University (2002).''Walking with the Master: Answering the Call of Jesus''.

==Previous incarnations==
The Theosophical author [[C.W. Leadbeater]] mentioned a Venetian Chohan, but did not name him Paul or identify him with Veronese.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925, Theosophical Publishing House, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the lesser known Ancient Wisdom groups maintain that Paul the Venetian was incarnated as [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J. Gordon ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'' 5th Edition New York:1996 Gale Research Page 154&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Paul the Venetian is believed to have been incarnated as a "Minister of Culture" in the government of [[Atlantis]], as one of the [[architect]]s of the [[pyramids]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], and as an [[artist]] (mural painter) in the [[Inca Empire]]. During the Building of the Pyramidos(Adytum), he like the 71 other Builders took no Call or Name.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Press - "Paul the Venetian - Master of the Third Ray" pages 119 - 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascension==
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Paul the Venetian ascended on April 19, 1588. [http://www.preterhuman.net/texts/other/crystalinks/paul.html]

==Twin flame==

According to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (the founder and former head of the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] organization the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]), Paul the Venetian’s ''[[twin flame]]'' ([[Celestial marriage|celestial wife]])  was incarnated as [[Ruth Hawkins]] and is now known as the '''Lady Master Adoremus'''.  Ruth Hawkins was born in [[Topeka, Kansas]] in 1907 and died (“ascended”) in 1995 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. She was an [[artist]] who painted many portraits of the [[ascended masters]] and was very devoted to Paul the Venetian, addressing many "violet flame decrees" toward him. She was a member of the [["I AM" Activity]] and later of [[The Bridge to Freedom]].  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, "Lady Master Adoremus" is now known as the ''Goddess of Beauty''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V2W1vspm8QQC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=%22Lord+Maitreya%22+%22twin+flame%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8CQoqkkpp-&amp;sig=XMCUUEdIZaQ2kCwnaMrBi3UtSUs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mQF6SsOmLYbgsQPS2pDCDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lord%20Maitreya%22%20%22twin%20flame%22&amp;f=false Quotation from “The Masters and Their Retreats” by Elizabeth Clare Prophet:]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] organization the [[Inner Light-Workers]], Paul the Venetian’s ''[[twin flame]]''  (celestial wife) is '''Lady Master Chi Seong Li''', who was incarnated as a widely educated [[Chinese people|Chinese]] lady of noble birth who, following changes in her family's circumstances, taught basic lessons including mathematics to the young children of a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] noble's household.  ''Lady Master Chi Seong Li'' is said to govern the realm of [[logic]], [[mathematics]] and [[Visual appearance|form]].

==Skeptical view==

The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

'''The philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]''' has been a major influence in the development of [[20th-century philosophy]], especially [[existentialism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Kierkegaard was a 19th-century Danish philosopher who has been called the "Father of Existentialism".&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister E.  ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought''. Blackwell Publishing, 1993. p 202&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy also influenced the development of [[existential psychology]].&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;Matustik, M. J. and M. Westphal (eds). ''Kierkegaard in Post/Modernity'', Indiana University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-253-20967-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard criticized aspects of the philosophical systems that were brought on by philosophers such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] before him and the Danish [[Hegelianism|Hegelians]]. He was also indirectly influenced by the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="Kant"&gt;Green, Ronald M. ''Kierkegaard and Kant: The Hidden Debt''. SUNY Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-7914-1107-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He measured himself against the model of philosophy which he found in [[Socrates]], which aims to draw one's attention not to explanatory systems, but rather to the issue of how one exists.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'': "''Socrates' infinite merit is to have been an ''existing'' thinker, not a speculative philosopher who forgets what it means to exist… The infinite merit of the Socratic position was precisely to accentuate the fact that the knower is an existing individual, and that the task of existing is his essential task.''" Swenson/Lowrie translation (1941), pp. 184-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kierkegaard's recurrent themes is the importance of subjectivity, which has to do with the way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', he argues that "subjectivity is truth" and "truth is subjectivity." What he means by this is that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.&lt;ref name="Hong"&gt;Hong, Howard V. and Edna H. "Subjectivity/Objectivity." ''Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers''. Vol. 4. Indiana University Press, 1975, pp. 712-13. {{ISBN|0-253-18243-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note on pseudonyms==
{{see also|Søren Kierkegaard#Indirect_communication_and_pseudonymous_authorship|l1=Indirect Communication and Pseudonymous Authorship}}
Many of Kierkegaard's earlier writings from 1843 to 1846 were written pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'', he explained that the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is ''Anti-Climacus'', a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of ''The Point of View'': Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.&lt;ref name="Journals"&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Papers and Journals'', trans. A. Hannay, London, Penguin Books, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the pseudonymous authors write from perspectives which are not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy mentioned in this article may or may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, ''Johannes Climacus'' is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. ''Anti-Climacus'', as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.&lt;ref name="Journals"/&gt;

Most of Kierkegaard's later philosophical and religious writings from 1846 to 1855 were written and authored by himself, and he assigned no pseudonyms to these works. Subsequently, these works are considered by most scholars to reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard''. Oneworld, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85168-317-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where appropriate, this article will mention the respective author, pseudonymous or not.

==Themes in his philosophy==

===Alienation===
[[Social alienation|Alienation]] is a term philosophers apply to a wide variety of phenomena, including any feeling of separation from, and discontent with, society; feeling that there is a moral breakdown in society; feelings of powerlessness in the face of the solidity of social institutions; the impersonal, dehumanised nature of large-scale and bureaucratic social organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06 Dictionary of the History of Ideas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard recognizes and accepts the notion of alienation, although he phrases it and understands it in his own distinctly original terms. For Kierkegaard, the present age is a reflective age—one that values objectivity and thought over action, lip-service to ideals rather than action, discussion over action, publicity and advertising over reality, and fantasy over the real world. For Kierkegaard, the meaning of values has been removed from life, by lack of finding any true and legitimate authority. Instead of falling into any claimed authority, any "literal" sacred book or any other great and lasting voice, self-aware humans must confront an existential uncertainty.

Humanity has lost meaning because the accepted criterion of reality and truth is ambiguous and subjective thought—that which cannot be proven with [[logic]], historical research, or [[scientific analysis]]. Humans cannot think out choices in life, we must live them; and even those choices that we often think about become different once life itself enters into the picture. For Kierkegaard, the type of objectivity that a scientist or historian might use misses the point—humans are not motivated and do not find meaning in life through pure objectivity. Instead, they find it through passion, desire, and moral and religious commitment. These phenomena are not objectively provable—nor do they come about through any form of analysis of the external world; they come about through a direct relationship between one and the external world. Here Kierkegaard's emphasis is on relationship rather than analysis. This relationship is a way of looking at one’s life that evades objective scrutiny. 

Kierkegaard's analysis of the present age uses terms that resemble but are not exactly coincident with Hegel and [[Marx's theory of alienation]]. However Kierkegaard expressly means that human beings are alienated from God because they are living too much in the world. Individuals need to [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843#To Gain One’s Soul In Patience|gain their souls]] from the world because it actually belongs to God. Kierkegaard has no interest in external battles as [[Karl Marx]] does. His concern is about the inner fight for faith.{{Quotation|Let us speak further about the wish and thereby about sufferings. Discussion of sufferings can always be beneficial if it addresses not only the self-willfulness of the sorrow but, if possible, addresses the sorrowing person for his upbuilding. It is a legitimate and sympathetic act to dwell properly on the suffering, lest the suffering person become impatient over our superficial discussion in which he does not recognize his suffering, lest he for that reason impatiently thrust aside consolation and be strengthened in double-mindedness. It certainly is one thing to go out into life with the wish when what is wished becomes the deed and the task; it is something else to go out into life away from the wish.

Abraham had to leave his ancestral home an emigrate to an alien nation, where nothing reminded him of what he loved – indeed, sometimes it is no doubt a consolation that nothing calls to mind what one wishes to forget, but it is a bitter consolation for the person who is full of longing. Thus a person can also have a wish that for him contains everything, so that in the hour of the separation, when the pilgrimage begins, it is as if he were emigrating to a foreign country where nothing but the contrast reminds him, by the loss, of what he wished; it can seem to him as if he were emigrating to a foreign country even if he remains at home perhaps in the same locality – by losing the wish just as among strangers, so that to take leave of the wish seems to him harder and more crucial than to take leave of his senses.

Apart from this wish, even if he still does not move from the spot, his life’s troublesome way is perhaps spent in useless sufferings, for we are speaking of those who suffer essentially, not of those who have the consolation that their sufferings are for the benefit of a good cause, for the benefit of others. It was bound to be thus – the journey to the foreign country was not long; in one moment he was there, there in that strange country where the suffering ones meet, but not those who have ceased to grieve, not those whose tears eternity cannot wipe away, for as an old devotional book so simply and movingly says, “How can God dry your tears in the next world if you have not wept?” Perhaps someone else comes in a different way, but to the same place. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993 pp. 102-103}}

[[Albert Camus]] wrote about the idea of being a stranger in the world but reversed Kierkegaard's meaning. A [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|stranger]] for Camus was someone living in the world who is forced to exist in a Christian way even though the individual does not want to be a Christian. But Kierkegaard was discussing the Christian who wants to be a Christian living in a world that has abandoned Christianity. Both Camus and Kierkegaard had in common an equal distaste for a Christian Democracy where all are forced to take a positive part in Christianity because freedom of choice would be lacking and in a non-Christian Democracy where none are allowed to take an active part in Christianity. Kierkegaard was against voting about Christianity, for him, Christ was the only authority. Camus called "the existential attitude philosophical suicide." This is how he put it in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus|The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Writings]]'' {{Quotation|Now, it is admitted that the absurd is the contrary of hope, it is seen that existential thought for [[Lev Shestov|Chestov]] (Lev Shestov 1866-1938) presupposes the absurd but proves it only to dispel it. Such subtlety of thought is a conjuror's emotional trick. When Chestov elsewhere sets his absurd in opposition to current morality and reason, he calls it truth and redemption. Hence, there is basically in that definition of the absurd an approbation that Chestov grants it. What is perceptible in Leo Chestov will be perhaps even more so in Kierkegaard. To be sure, it is hard to outline clear propositions in so elusive a writer. But, despite apparently opposed writings, beyond the pseudonyms, the tricks, and the smiles, can be felt throughout that work, as it were, the presentiment (at the same time as the apprehension) of a truth which eventually bursts forth in the last works: Kierkegaard likewise takes the leap. Kierkegaard’s view that despair is not a fact but a state: the very state of sin. For sin is what alienates from God. The absurd, which is the metaphysical state of the consciousness of man, does not lead to God. Perhaps this notion will become clearer if I risk this shocking statement: the absurd is sin without God. It is a matter of living in that state of the absurd. I am taking the liberty at this point of calling the existential attitude philosophical suicide. But this does not imply a judgment. It is a convenient way of indicating the movement by which a thought negates itself and tends to transcend itself in its very negation. For the existential negation is their God. To be precise, that god is maintained only through the negation of human reason. (Let me assert again: it is not the affirmation of God that is questioned here, but rather the logic leading to that affirmation.) Albert Camus, ''The Myth of Sisyphus and other essays'' p. 26-32 Vintage books 1955 Alfred A Knopf}}

Kierkegaard put it this way in ''Three Edifying Discourses'' 1843 and ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' (1846). {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Getting the majority vote on one’s side and one’s God-relationship transformed into a speculative enterprise on the basis of probability and partnership and fellow shareholders is the first step toward becoming objective.
*''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 66.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The love which covers a multitude of sins in never deceived. When the heart is niggardly, when one gives with one eye and with seven eyes looks to see what one will get in return, then one easily discovers a multitude of sins. But when the heart is filled with love, then the eye is never deceived; for love when it gives, does not scrutinize the gift, but its eye is fixed on the Lord. When the heart is filled with envy, then the eye has power to call forth uncleanness even in the pure; but when love dwells in the heart, then the eye has the power to foster the good in the unclean; but this eye does not see the evil but the pure, which it loves and encourages it by loving it. Certainly there is a power in this world which by its words turns good into evil, put there is a power above which turns the evil into good; that power is the love which covers a multitude of sins.

When hate dwells in the heart, then sin lies at a man’s door, and its manifold desires exist in him; but when love dwells in the heart, then sin flees far away, and he sees it no more. When disputes, malice, wrath, quarrels, dissensions, factions fill the heart, does one then need to go far in order to discover the multitudinousness of sin, or does a man need to love very long to produce these outside of himself! But when joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance dwell in the heart, what wonder, then, that a man, even if he were surrounded by a multitude of sins, remains an alien, a stranger, who understands only a very little about the customs of the country, even if these were explained to him? Would not this, then, be a covering of the multitude of sins?
* Soren Kierkegaard ''Three Edifying Discourses'' 1843, Swenson translation 1943 p. 69.

Love does not seek its own. Love does not seek its own, for there are no mine and yours in love. But "mine" and "yours" are only relational specifications of "one's own"; thus, if there are no mine and yours, there is no "one's own" either. But if there is no "one's own" at all, then it is of course impossible to seek one's own. Justice is identified by its giving each his own, just as it also in turn claims its own. This means that justice pleads the cause of its own, divides and assigns, determines what each can lawfully call his own, judges and punishes if anyone refuses to make any distinction between mine and yours. The individual has the right to so as he pleases with this contentious and yet legally entitled mine; and if he seeks his own in no other way than that which justice allows, justice has nothing with which to reproach him and has no right to upbraid him for anything. As soon as someone is defrauded of his own, or as soon as someone defrauds another of his own, justice intervenes, because it safeguards the common security in which everyone has his own, which he rightfully has.-But sometimes a change intrudes, a revolution, a war, an earthquake, or some such terrible misfortune, and everything is confused. Justice tries in vain to secure for each person his own; it cannot maintain the distinction between mine and yours; in the confusion it cannot keep the balance and therefore throws away the scales-it despairs! Terrible spectacle! Yet does not love in a certain sense, even if in the most blissful way, produce the same confusion? But love, it too is an event, the greatest of all, yet also the happiest. Love is a change, the most remarkable of all, but the most desirable-in fact we say in a very good sense that someone who is gripped by love is changed or becomes changed. Love is a revolution, the most profound of all, but the most blessed! 
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', 1847, Hong 1995 pp. 264-265}}

===Abstraction===
An element of Kierkegaard's critique of modernity in his socio-political work, ''[[Two Ages]]'', is the mention of [[money]] — which he calls an [[abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Two Ages'', trans. Howard and Edna Hong. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-07226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Robert L. ''Two Ages: International Kierkegaard Commentary''. Mercer University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-86554-081-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abstraction is something that only has a reality in an [[ersatz]] reality. It is not tangible, and only has meaning within an artificial context, which ultimately serves devious and deceptive purposes. It is a figment of thought that has no [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] reality, neither now nor in the future.

How is money an abstraction? Money gives the illusion that it has a direct relationship to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so much money. In reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making the world a better place for oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world —to give it shape, form and meaning— with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that "a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give me money, the young man will say, and I will be all right."&lt;ref&gt;''Two Ages'', p.75, Hong translation.&lt;/ref&gt; But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery. {{Quotation|Do not forget to do good and to share – Hebrews 13.16 - But do not forget either that this incessant talk by worldliness about beneficence and benevolence and generosity and charitable donations and gift upon gift is almost merciless. Ah, let the newspaper writers and tax collectors and parish beadles talk about generosity and count and count; but let us never ignore that Christianity speaks essentially of mercifulness, that Christianity would least of all be guilty of mercilessness, as if poverty and misery not only needed money etc. but also were excluded from the highest, from being able to be generous, beneficent, benevolent. But people prattle and prate ecclesiastically-worldly and worldly-ecclesiastically about generosity, beneficence-but forget, even in the sermon, mercifulness. Preaching should indeed be solely and only about mercifulness. If you know how to speak effectually about this, then generosity will follow of itself and come by itself accordingly as the individual is capable of it. But bear in mind, that if a person raised money, money, money by speaking about generosity-bear this in mind, that by being silent about mercifulness he would be acting mercilessly toward the poor and miserable person for whom he procured relief by means of the money of wealthy generosity. Bear this I mind, that if poverty and misery disturb us with their pleas, we can of course manage to get help for them through generosity; but bear this in mind, that it would be much more appalling if we constrained poverty and misery “to hinder our prayers,” as Scripture says (1 Peter 3:7), by grumbling against us to God-because we were atrociously unfair to poverty and misery by not telling that they are able to practice mercifulness. We shall now adhere to this point in this discourse about mercifulness and guard ourselves against confusing mercifulness with what is linked to external conditions, that is, what love as such does not have in its power, whereas it truly has mercifulness in its power just as surely as it has a heart in its bosom. It does not follow that because a person has a heart in his bosom he has money in his pocket, but the first is still more important and certainly is decisive with regard to mercifulness. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' Hong 1995 pp. 315-316}}

Below are three quotes concerning Kierkegaard's idea of abstraction which cannot be thought about without thinking about concretion. He moves from the world historical, the general, to the single individual, the specific. The first from the esthete and the second from the ethicist in ''Either/Or'' and the third from the book that explained all his previous works; ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]''.{{Quotation|As has already been noted above, all [[classic]] productions stand equally high, because each one stands infinitely high. If, despite this fact, one were to attempt to introduce an order of rank into the classic procession, one would evidently have to choose as a basis for such a distinction, something that was not essential; for if the basis were essential, the difference itself would become an essential difference; from that it would again follow that the word "classic" was wrongly predicated of the group as a whole. The more abstract the idea is, the smaller the probability of a numerous representation. But how does the idea become concrete? By being permeated with the [[historical]] [[consciousness]]. The more concrete the idea, the greater the probability. The more abstract the medium, the smaller the probability; the more concrete, the greater. But what does it mean to say that the medium is concrete, other than to say it is language, or is seen in approximation to language; for language is the most concrete of all media. The idea, for example, which comes to expression in sculpture is wholly abstract, and bears no relation to the historical; the medium through which it is expressed is likewise abstract, consequently there is a great probability that the section of the classic works which includes sculpture will contain only a few. In this I have the testimony of time and experience on my side. If, on the other hand, I take a concrete idea and a concrete medium, then it seems otherwise. [[Homer]] is indeed a classic [[poet]], but just because the epic idea is a concrete idea, and because the medium is language, it so happens that in the section of the classics which contains the epic, there are many epics conceivable, which are all equally classic, because history constantly furnishes us with new epic material. In this too, I have the testimony of history and the assent of experience. ''Either/Or Part I'', Swenson p. 49, 53}}  {{Quotation|The two positions touched on here could be regarded as attempts to actualize an ethical life-view. The reason that they do not succeed is that the individual has chosen himself in his isolation or has chosen himself abstractly. To say it in other words, the individual has not chosen himself [[ethics|ethically]]. He therefore has no connection with [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|actuality]], and when that is the case no ethical way of life can be put into practice. But the person who chooses himself ethically chooses himself concretely as this specific individual, and he achieves this concretion because this choice is identical with the [[repentance]], which ratifies the [[choice]]. The individual with these capacities, these inclinations, these drives, these passions, influenced by this specific social milieu, as this specific product of a specific [[Social environment|environment]]. But as he becomes aware of all this, he takes upon himself [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for all of it. He does not hesitate over whether he will take this particular thing or not, for he knows that if he does not do it something much more important will be lost. In the moment of choice, he is in complete isolation, for he withdraws from his social milieu, and yet at the same moment he is in absolute continuity, for he chooses himself as a product. And this choice is freedom’s choice in such a way that in choosing himself as product he can just as well be said to produce himself. At the moment of choice, he is at the point of consummation, for his personality is consummating itself, and yet at the same moment he is at the very beginning, because he is choosing himself according to his freedom. Either/Or Part II, Hong p. 251}}{{Quotation|When in pure thinking mention is made of an immediate unity of reflection-in-itself and reflection-in-the-other and of the annulment of this immediate unity, then something must indeed come between the elements of the immediate unity. What is this? Yes, it is time. But time cannot be assigned a place within pure thinking. What, then, do annulment and transition and a new unity signify? What, if anything, does it mean to think in such a way that one always merely makes a show of it because everything that is said is absolutely revoked? And what does it mean not to admit that one thinks this way but then continually to proclaim from the housetops the positive truth of this pure thinking? Just as existence has joined thinking and existing, inasmuch as an existing person is a thinking person, so are there two media: the medium of abstraction and the medium of actuality. But pure thinking is yet a third medium, very recently invented. It begins, it is said, after the most exhaustive abstraction. Pure thinking is-what shall I say-piously or thoughtlessly unaware of the relation that abstraction still continually has to that from which it abstracts. Here in this pure thinking there is rest for every doubt; here is the eternal positive truth and whatever one cares to say. This means that pure thinking is a phantom. And if Hegelian philosophy is free from all postulates, it has attained this with one insane postulate: the beginning of pure thinking. For the existing person, existing is for him his highest interest, and his interestedness in existing in his actuality. What actuality is cannot be rendered in the language of abstraction. Actuality is an ''inter-esse'' [between being] between thinking and being in the hypothetical unity of abstraction. Abstraction deals with possibility and actuality, but its conception of actuality is a false rendition, since the medium is not actuality but possibility. Only by annulling actuality can abstraction grasp it, but to annul it is precisely to change it into possibility. Within abstraction everything that is said about actuality in the language of abstraction is said within possibility. That is, in the language of actuality all abstraction is related to actuality as a possibility, not to an actuality within abstraction and possibility. Actuality, existence, is the dialectical element in a trilogy, the beginning and end of which cannot be for an existing person, who ''qua'' existing is in the [[dialectic]]al element. Abstraction merges the trilogy. Quite right. But how does it do it? Is abstraction a something that does it, or is it not the act of the abstractor? But the abstractor is, after all, an existing person, and as an existing person is consequently in the dialectical element, which he cannot mediate or merge, least of all absolutely, as long as he is existing. If he does do it, then this must be related as a possibility to actuality, to the existence which he himself is. He must explain how he goes about it-that is, how he as an existing person goes about it, or whether he ceases to be an existing person, and whether an existing person has a right to do that. As soon as we begin to ask such questions, we are asking ethically and are maintaining the claim of the ethical upon the existing person, which cannot be that he is supposed to abstract from existence, but that he is supposed to exist, which is also the existing person’s highest interest. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Vol 1, pp. 314-315 Hong translation}}

===Death===
[[Death]] is inevitable and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact in order to live passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend."&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong 1992 p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his [[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death?&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dread or anxiety===
For Kierkegaard's author, ''Vigilius Haufniensis'', [[anxiety]]/[[Existential dread|dread]]/[[angst]] (depending on the translation and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses the example of a man standing on the edge of a tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our "dizziness of freedom."&lt;blockquote&gt;Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]] becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, [[anxiety]] is the dizziness of [[Free will|freedom]], which emerges when the spirit wants to [[wikt:Special:Search/posit#Verb|posit]] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, [[psychology]] cannot and will not go. In that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the [[leap of faith|leap]], which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as [[ambiguous]]ly guilty as it is possible to become. Vigilius Haufniensis, ''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 61.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', Haufniensis focuses on the first anxiety experienced by man: [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts of good and evil did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed [[original sin]], Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety comes from the fact that God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is anxiety that leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin.

However, Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is a way for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. ([[Jean-Paul Sartre]] calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.
{{Quotation|Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate. … Anxiety is freedom’s possibility, and only such anxiety is through faith absolutely educative, because it consumes all finite ends and discovers all their deceptiveness. And no [[Tomás de Torquemada|Grand Inquisitor]] has such dreadful torments in readiness as anxiety has, and no secret agent knows as cunningly as anxiety to attack his suspect in his weakest moment or to make alluring the trap in which he will be caught, and no discerning judge understands how to interrogate and examine the accused as does anxiety, which never lets the accused escape, neither through amusement, nor by noise, nor during work, neither by day nor by night.|Vigilius Haufniensis|The Concept of Anxiety pp. 155-156.}}

===Despair===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
{{Quotation|Is despair a merit or a defect? Purely dialectically it is both. If one were to think of despair only in the abstract, without reference to some particular despairer, one would have to say it is an enormous merit. The possibility of this sickness is man’s advantage over the beast, and it is an advantage which characterizes him quite otherwise than the upright posture, for it bespeaks the infinite erectness or loftiness of his being spirit. The possibility of this sickness is man’s advantage over the beast; to be aware of this sickness is the Christian’s advantage over natural man; to be cured of this sickness is the Christian’s blessedness. |Anti-Climacus|The Sickness Unto Death p. 45}}

Most emphatically in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'', Kierkegaard's author argues that the human self is a composition of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the "relationship of the two to itself," and a consciousness of "the power that posited" the self. The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist in a state of tension. That tension between two aspects of the "self" that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much in terms of its own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person is in a state of [[Existential despair|despair]]. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels perfectly happy. Despair is not just an emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself.
In ''[[Either/Or]]'', ''A'' and ''Judge William'' each has one [[epistolary novel]] in two volumes. The ''A'' is an aesthete well aware that he can use the power of interpretation to define who he is and what he takes to be valuable. He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding of who he is. He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend ''Judge William,'' argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness.
Another perspective, one in which an individual can find some measure of freedom from despair, is available for the person with religious "faith." This attunes the individual so that he or she can recognize what has always been there: a self to be realized within the circumstances it finds itself right now, i.e., this inner attunement brings about a sort of synthesis between the infinite and the finite.
In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', ''Johannes de Silentio'' argues that the choice of [[Abraham]] to obey the private, unethical, commandment of God to sacrifice his son reveals what faith entails: he directs his consciousness absolutely toward "the absolute" rather than the merely ethical, i.e., he practices an inner spirituality that seeks to be "before god" rather than seeking to understand himself as an ethically upright person. His God requires more than being good, he demands that he seek out an inner commitment to him. If Abraham were to blithely obey, his actions would have no meaning. It is only when he acts ''with fear and trembling'' that he demonstrates a full awareness that murdering a son is absolutely wrong, ethically speaking.

Despair has several specific levels that a person can find themselves, each one further in despair than the last as laid out in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''.

The first level is "The despair that is ignorant of being despair or the despairing ignorance of having a self and an eternal self." Essentially this level is one which has the wrong conception of what a self is, i.e., is ignorant of how to realize the self one already potentially is. In this sense, the person does not recognize his own despair because he often measures the success of his life based on whether he himself judges himself to be happy. Regardless of whether you know you are in despair or not, Kierkegaard asserts, you can still be in that state. He notes that this is the most common in the world.

The next level of despair is "The despair that is conscious of being despair and therefore is conscious of having a self in which there is something eternal and then either in despair does not will to be itself or in despair wills to be itself." This becomes further subdivided into three categories: the despair not to will or want to be oneself, the despair not to will to be a self, and lowest, the despair to wish for a new self. These three divisions are mostly the self-worth the person has and the amount to which they understand their own despair. The despair to not be oneself is pretty straightforward. A person sees themself as unworthy and as such does not see themself as worthy before something they do not understand. The despair not to be a self is deeper, because to not wish to be a self is to wish to not have a relation to God or at the very least see one's relation to God as unworthy, and thus shrink from it. The lowest form of this group, however, is the desire to be a new self. This is logically the deepest form as it assumes the deepest understanding of one's despair. Once in despair, without a complete relation to God one will always be in despair, so to be in this level one understands the permanence of the despair. The despair in this group arises from the nature of sensate things and physical desires. These three sub groups are also grouped under the heading "Despair over the earthly."

The second level of conscious despair under the heading "Despair over the eternal." Someone in this level views themself in light of their own weakness. Unlike in the upper level, this weakness is understood and as such, instead of turning to faith and humbling oneself before God, they despair in their own weakness and unworthiness. In this sense, they despair over the eternal and refuse to be comforted by the light of God.

The last and lowest form of despair is the desire "In despair to will to be oneself." This last form of despair is also referred to by Kierkegaard as "demonic despair" (Note that the term demonic is used in the Classical Greek Sense, not the modern sense). In this form of despair, the individual finds him or herself in despair, understands they are in despair, seeks some way to alleviate it, and yet no help is forthcoming. As a result, the self becomes hardened against any form of help and "Even if God in heaven and all the angels offered him aid, he would not want it." At this level of despair the individual revels in their own despair and sees their own pain as lifting them up above the base nature of other humans who do not find themselves in this state. This is the least common form of despair and Kierkegaard claims it is mostly found in true poets. This despair can also be called the despair of defiance, as it is the despair that strikes out against all that is eternal. One last note is that as one travels further down the forms of despair, the number of people in each group becomes fewer.

===Ethics===
[[File:Abraham.jpg|250px|right|thumb|In [[Fear and Trembling]], Johannes de Silentio analyzes [[Abraham]]'s action to sacrifice [[Isaac]].  Silentio argues that Abraham is a knight of faith.]]
Many philosophers who initially read Kierkegaard, especially Kierkegaard's (written under the pseudonym of ''Johannes de Silentio'') ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', often come to the conclusion that Kierkegaard supports a [[divine command theory|divine command]] law of ethics. The divine command theory is a [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] theory which claims moral values are whatever is commanded by a god or gods. However, Kierkegaard is not arguing that morality is created by [[God]]; instead, he would argue that a divine command from God ''transcends'' ethics. This distinction means that God does not necessarily create human morality: it is up to us as individuals to create our own morals and values. But any religious person must be prepared for the event of a divine command from God that would take precedence over all moral and rational obligations. Kierkegaard called this event the ''[[Teleology|teleological]] suspension of the ethical''. Abraham, the [[knight of faith]], chose to obey God unconditionally, and was rewarded with his son, his faith, and the title of ''Father of Faith''. Abraham transcended ethics and leaped into faith.

But there is no valid logical argument one can make to claim that morality ought to be or can be suspended in any given circumstance, or ever. Thus, Silentio believes ethics and faith are separate stages of consciousness. The choice to obey God unconditionally is a true existential 'either/or' decision faced by the individual. Either one chooses to live in faith (the religious stage) or to live ethically (the ethical stage).

In ''[[Either/Or]]'', Kierkegaard insists that the single individual has ethical [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] of his life. However, everyone wants to enjoy themselves and ethics gets in the way of a person's enjoyment of life if taken to extremes. This results in a battle between those who want to live for pleasure and those who demand an ethical existence. But Kierkegaard always points toward the religious goal, an "eternal happiness", or the [[salvation]] of the [[soul]] as the highest good. He says, be whatever you want, but remember that your soul belongs to God, not to the world. {{Quotation| By now you have easily seen that in his life the ethical individual goes through stages we previously set forth as [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Three stages of life|separate stages]]. He is going to develop in his life the [[Personal identity|personal]], the [[Civics|civic]], the [[religious]] virtues, and his life advances through his continually translating himself from one stage to another. As soon as a person thinks that one of these stages is adequate and that he dares to concentrate on it one-sidedly, he has not chosen himself ethically but has failed to see the significance of either isolation or continuity and above all has not grasped that the truth lies in the identity of the two. The person who has ethically chosen and found himself possess himself defined in his entire concretion. He then possesses himself as an [[individual]] who has these [[Aptitude|capacities]], these [[Passion (emotion)|passions]], these [[wikt:tendency|inclinations]], these [[habit (psychology)|habit]]s, who is subject to these external influences, who is influenced in one direction thus and in another thus. Here he then possesses himself as a task in such a way that it is chiefly to order, shape, temper, inflame, control-in short, to produce an evenness in the soul, a harmony, which is the fruit of the personal virtues.'' Either/Or Part 2'', Hong p. 262}}

{{Quotation|[[Resignation]] has made the [[individual]] face or has seen to it that he face toward an eternal happiness as the [[w:Telos (philosophy)|τέλος]] ("end", "purpose", or "goal"). This τέλος is not an element among other elements. Thus the both-and of mediation is not much better, even though less naïve, than the previously described jovial chatter that includes everything. At the moment of resignation, of collecting oneself, of choice the individual is allowed to salute the absolute τέλος-but then, then comes the mediation. So, too, a dog can be taught to walk on two legs for a moment but then, then comes the mediation, and the dog walks on four legs – mediation also does that. Spiritually understood, a human being’s upright walk is his absolute respect for the absolute τέλος, otherwise he walks on all fours. When it is a matter of relative elements mediation has its significance (that they are all equal before mediation), but when it is a matter of the absolute end or goal, mediation means that the absolute τέλος is reduced to a [[relativism|relative]] τέλος. It is not true, either, that the absolute τέλος becomes concrete in the relative ends, because resignation’s absolute distinction will at every moment safeguard the absolute τέλος against all fraternizing. It is true that the individual oriented toward the absolute τέλος, is in the relative ends, but he is not in them in such a way that the absolute τέλος is exhausted in them. It is true that before God and before the absolute τέλος we are all equal, but it is not true that God or the absolute τέλος is equal with everything else for me or for a particular individual. It may be very commendable for a particular individual to be a councilor of justice, a good worker in the office, no.1 lover in the society, almost a virtuoso on the flute, captain of the popinjay shooting club, superintendent of the orphanage, a noble and respected father-in short, a devil of a fellow who can both-and has time for everything. But let the councilor take care that he does not become too much a devil of a fellow and proceed to do both all this and have time to direct his life toward the absolute τέλος. In other words, this [[both-and]] means that the absolute [[w:Telos (philosophy)|τέλος]] is on the same level with everything else. But the absolute τέλος has the remarkable quality of wanting to be the absolute τέλος at every moment. If, then, at the moment of resignation, of collecting oneself, of choice, an individual has understood this, it surely cannot mean that he is supposed to have forgotten it the next moment. Therefore, as I said before, resignation remains in the individual and the task is so far from getting the absolute τέλος [[mediation|mediated]] into all sorts of both-and that, on the contrary, it is to aim at the form of existence that permanently has the pathos of the great moment.

In ''[[Works of Love]]'' and ''Purity of Heart'', Kierkegaard skillfully examines [[Christian ethics]] and the maxim, ''Love Thy Neighbour''.&lt;ref&gt;Here are some verses from the Bible about loving your neighbor [http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Bible-Verses-About-Love-Your-Neighbor/ Love thy neighbor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK.org"&gt;{{cite web | title=D. Anthony Storm | work=Kierkegaard Commentary | url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org | accessdate=September 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard stressed that it was [[Christianity]] that "discovered the neighbor".&lt;ref&gt;Works of Love, Hong p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|Test it, place as the middle term between the lover and the beloved the neighbor, whom one shall love, place as a middle term between two friends the neighbor, whom one shall love, and you will immediately see jealousy. Yet the neighbor is self-denial’s middle term that steps in between self-love’s I and I, but also between erotic love’s and friendship’s I and the other I. .... Love for the neighbor is therefore the eternal equality in loving. Equality is simply not to make distinctions and eternal equality is unconditionally not to make the slightest distinction, unqualifiedly not to make the slightest distinction. The essential Christian is itself too weighty, in its movements too earnest to scurry about, dancing, in the frivolity of such facile talk about the higher, highest, and the supremely highest. Think of the most cultured person, one of whom we all admiringly say, “He is so cultured!” Then think of Christianity, which says to him, “You shall love the neighbor!” of course, a certain social courtesy, a politeness toward all people, a friendly condescension toward inferiors, a boldly confident attitude before the mighty, a beautifully controlled freedom of spirit, yes, this is culture – do you believe that it is also loving the neighbor? With the neighbor you have the equality of a human being before God. God is the middle term. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, 1847, Hong p. 44-61}}

===Individuality===
For Kierkegaard, true [[individual]]ity is called selfhood. Becoming aware of our true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist at a level that is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our [[pleasure]]s—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in ''Either/Or'', &lt;blockquote&gt;Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because if there is to be meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little [[teleology]] as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and [[contemplate]] life. Now you rest in despair. [[Absurdism|Nothing concerns you]]; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world. ''Either/Or Part II'' p. 195-196, 272ff&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Sickness Unto Death]]'' specifically Kierkegaard deals with the self as a product of relations. In this sense, a human results from a relation between the Infinite (Noumena, spirit, eternal) and Finite (Phenomena, body, temporal). This does not create a true self, as a human can live without a "self" as he defines it. Instead, the Self or ability for the self to be created from a relation to the Absolute or God (the Self can only be realized through a relation to God) arises as a relation between the relation of the Finite and Infinite relating back to the human. This would be a positive relation.

An individual person, for Kierkegaard, is a particular that no abstract formula or definition can ever capture. Including the individual in "the public" (or "the crowd" or "the herd") or subsuming a human being as simply a member of a species is a reduction of the true meaning of life for individuals. What philosophy or politics try to do is to categorize and pigeonhole individuals by group characteristics, each with their own individual differences. In [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]] Kierkegaard says the differences aren't important, the likeness with God is what brings equality. &lt;blockquote&gt;In the hallowed places, in every upbuilding view of life, the thought arises in a person’s soul that help him to fight the good fight with flesh and blood, with principalities and powers, and in the fight to free himself for equality before God, whether this battle is more a war of aggression against the differences that want to encumber him with worldly favoritism or a defensive war against the differences that want to make him anxious in worldly perdition. Only in this way is equality the divine law, only in this way is the struggle the truth, only in this way does the victory have validity- only when the single individual fights for himself with himself within himself and does not unseasonably presume to help the whole world to obtain external equality, which is of very little benefit, all the less so because it never existed, if for no other reason than that everyone would come to thank him and become unequal before him, only in this way is equality the divine law. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', by Soren Kiekegaard Hong, p. 143&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard's critique of the modern age, therefore, is about the loss of what it means to be an individual. Modern society contributes to this dissolution of what it means to be an individual. Through its production of the [[false idol]] of "the public", it diverts attention away from individuals to a mass public that loses itself in abstractions, communal dreams, and fantasies. It is helped in this task by the media and the mass production of products to keep it distracted. Even the fight for temporal equality is a distraction. In [[Works of Love]] he writes, {{Quotation| To bring about similarity among people in the world, to apportion to people, if possible equally, the conditions of temporality, is indeed something that preoccupies worldliness to a high degree. But even what we may call the well-intentioned worldly effort in this regard never comes to an understanding with Christianity. Well-intentioned worldliness remains piously, if you will, convinced that there must be one temporal condition, one earthly dissimilarity – found by means of calculations and surveys or in whatever other way – that is [[Liberalism|equality]]. ''Works of Love'', by Søren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong 1995 pp. 71-72 see pp. 61-90}}

Although Kierkegaard attacked "the public", he is supportive of communities:
{{Quotation|In community, the individual is, crucial as the prior condition for forming a community. … Every individual in the community guarantees the community; the public is a chimera, numerality is everything…|Søren Kierkegaard|Journals&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

===Pathos (passion)===
For Kierkegaard, in order to apprehend the absolute, the mind must radically empty itself of objective content. What supports this radical emptying, however, is the desire for the absolute. Kierkegaard names this desire ''Passion''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.uab.cat/pub/enrahonar/0211402Xn29p119.pdf Kangas]&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this philosophy, some scholars have drawn similarities between the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] concept of [[Apatheia]] and Subjective Truth as the highest form of Wisdom. For the Stoics, Pathos (Passion) is a Perturbation which man has to overcome in a similar manner to Kierkegaard's concept of Objective Truth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=-01DAM9kgEMC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=apathy+kierkegaard], Kierkegaard and the Greek World: Aristotle and other Greek authors.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kierkegaard, the human self desires that which is beyond [[reason]]. Desire itself appears to be a desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, according to [[Plato]], is a kind of desire for [[immortality]]—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. [[Erotic love]] itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of [[time]] and [[space]]. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals in the name of a higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion. {{Quotation|If anyone is unwilling to learn from Christianity to love himself in the right way, he cannot love the neighbor either. He can perhaps hold together with another or a few other persons, “through thick and thin,” as it is called, but this is by no means loving the neighbor. To love yourself in the right way and to love the neighbor correspond perfectly to one another, fundamentally they are one and the same thing. When the Law’s ''as yourself'' has wrested from you the self-love that Christianity sadly enough must [[presuppose]] to be in every human being, then you actually have learned to love yourself. The Law is therefore: you shall love yourself in the same way as you love your neighbor when you love him as yourself.

Whoever has any [[knowledge]] of people will certainly admit that just as he has often wished to be able to move them to relinquish self-love, he has also had to wish that it were possible to teach them to love themselves. When the bustler wastes his time and powers in the service of the futile, [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inconsequential inconsequential] pursuits, is that not because he has not [[learn]]ed rightly to love himself? When the light-minded person throws himself almost like a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonentity nonentity] into the folly of the moment and makes nothing of it, is this not because he does not know how to love himself rightly?

When the depressed person desires to be rid of life, indeed of himself, is this not because he is unwilling to learn earnestly and rigorously to love himself? When someone surrenders to [[despair (emotion)|despair]] because the world or another person has faithlessly left him betrayed, what then is his fault (his innocent suffering is not referred to here) except not loving himself in the right way? When someone self-tormentingly thinks to do God a service by torturing himself, what is his sin except not willing to love himself in the right way? And if, alas, a person presumptuously lays violent hands upon himself, is not his sin precisely this, that he does not rightly love himself in the sense in which a person ''ought'' to love himself?

Oh, there is a lot of talk in the world about treachery, and faithlessness, and, God help us, it is unfortunately all too true, but still let us never because of this forget that the most dangerous traitor of all is the one every person has within himself. This treachery whether it consists in selfishly loving oneself or consists in selfishly not willing to love oneself in the right way – this treachery is admittedly a secret. No cry is raised as it usually is in the case of treachery and faithlessness. But is it not therefore all the more important that Christianity’s doctrine should be brought to mind again and again, that a person shall love his neighbor as himself, that is as he ought to love himself?  …  You shall love – this, then is the word of the [[Great Commandment|royal Law]]. ''Works of Love'', Hong p. 22-24}}

One can also look at this from the perspective of what the meaning of our existence is. Why suffer what humans have suffered, the pain and despair—what meaning can all of this have? For Kierkegaard, there is no meaning unless passion, the emotions and will of humans, has a divine source.

Passion is closely aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. [[Faith]] as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world, even though everything we can know intellectually speaks against it. To live and die for a belief, to stake everything one has and is in the belief in something that has a higher meaning than anything in the world—this is belief and passion at their highest.

Kierkegaard wrote of the subjective thinker's task in his ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Intellectual reason had been deified by Hegel in his theology and Kierkegaard felt this would lead to the [[objectification]] of religion.{{Quotation|There is an old proverb: ''oratio, tentatio, meditatio, faciunt theologum'' [prayer, trial, meditation, make a theologian]. Similarly, for a subjective thinker, [[imagination]], [[feeling]] and dialectics in impassioned existence-inwardness are required. But first and last, passion, because for an existing person it is impossible to think about existence without becoming passionate, inasmuch as existing is a prodigious contradiction from which the subjective thinker is not to abstract, for then it is easy, but in which he is to remain. In a world-historical dialectic, individuals fade away into humankind; in a dialectic such as that it is impossible to discover you and me, an individual existing human being, even if new magnifying glasses for the concrete are invented. The subjective thinker is a [[dialectic]]ian oriented to the [[existential]]; he has the intellectual passion to hold firm the qualitative disjunction. But, on the other hand, if the qualitative disjunction is used flatly and simply, if it is applied altogether abstractly to the [[individual]] [[human]] [[being]], then one can run the ludicrous risk of saying something infinitely decisive, and of being right in what one says, and still not say the least thing. Therefore, in the psychological sense it is really remarkable to see the absolute disjunction deceitfully used simply for evasion. When the death penalty is placed on every crime, the result is that no crimes at all are punished. It is the same with the absolute disjunction when applied flatly and simply; it is just like a silent letter-it cannot be pronounced or, if it can be pronounced, it says nothing. The [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[Intellectual|thinker]], therefore, has with intellectual [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] the absolute disjunction as belonging to existence, but he has it as the final decision that prevents everything from ending in a quantifying. Thus he has it readily available, but not in such a way that by abstractly recurring to it, he just frustrates [[existence]]. The subjective thinker, therefore, has also [[esthetic]] passion and [[ethics|ethical]] passion, whereby concretion is gained. All existence-issues are passionate, because existence, if one becomes [[conscious]] of it, involves passion. To think about them so as to leave out passion is not to think about them at all, is to forget the point that one indeed is oneself and existing person. Yet the subjective thinker is not a poet even if he is also a poet, not an ethicist even if he is also an ethicist, but is also a dialectician and is himself essentially existing, whereas the poet’s existence is inessential in relation to the poem, and likewise the ethicist’s in relation to the teaching, and the dialectician’s in relation to the thought. The subjective thinker is not a scientist-scholar; he is an artist. To exist is an art. The subjective thinker is esthetic enough for his life to have esthetic content, ethical enough to [[Regulation|regulate]] it, dialectical enough in thinking to master it. The subjective thinker’s task is to understand himself in existence. pp. 350-351}}

===Subjectivity&lt;!--linked from 'Perspectivism'--&gt;===

''Johannes Climacus'', in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'', writes the following cryptic line: "[[Subjectivity]] is Truth". To understand Climacus's concept of the individual, it is important to look at what he says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual—what makes the individual ''who he is in distinction from others''. It is what is inside—what the individual can see, feel, think, imagine, dream, etc. It is often opposed to objectivity—that which is outside the individual, which the individual and others around can feel, see, measure, and think about. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the ''unique'' relationship between the subject and object.

Johann Fichte wrote similarly about subjectivity in his 1799 book ''[[The Vocation of Man]]''. &lt;blockquote&gt;I must, however, remind my reader that the "I" who speaks in the book is not the author himself, but it is his earnest wish that the reader should himself assume this character, and that he should not rest contented with a mere historical apprehension of what is here said, but really and truly, during reading, hold converse with himself, deliberate, draw conclusions, and form resolutions, like his representative in the book, and, by his own labour and reflection, developed out of his own soul, and build up within himself, that mode of thought the mere picture of which is laid before him in the work. Preface&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scientists and historians, for example, study the objective world, hoping to elicit the truth of nature—or perhaps the truth of [[history]]. In this way, they hope to predict how the future will unfold in accordance with these laws. In terms of history, by studying the past, the individual can perhaps elicit the laws that determine how events will unfold—in this way the individual can predict the future with more exactness and perhaps take control of events that in the past appeared to fall outside the control of humans.

In most respects, Climacus did not have problems with [[science]] or the scientific endeavor. He would not disregard the importance of objective knowledge. Where the scientist or historian finds certainty, however, Climacus noted very accurately that results in science change as the tools of observation change. But Climacus's special interest was in history. His most vehement attacks came against those who believed that they had understood history and its laws—and by doing so could ascertain what a human’s true self is. That is, the assumption is that by studying history someone can come to know who he really is as a person. Kierkegaard especially accused Hegel's philosophy of falling prey to this assumption. He explained this in, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'': {{Quotation|It is the existing [[spirit]] who asks about [[truth]], presumably because he wants to exist in it, but in any case the questioner is [[conscious]] of being an existing individual human being. In this way I believe I am able to make myself understandable to every Greek and to every [[Rationality|rational]] human being. If a German philosopher follows his inclination to put on an act and first transforms himself into a superrational something, just as alchemists and sorcerers bedizen themselves fantastically, in order to answer the question about truth in an extremely satisfying way, this is of no more concern to me than his satisfying answer, which no doubt is extremely satisfying-if one is fantastically dressed up. But whether a German philosopher is or is not doing this can easily be ascertained by anyone who with enthusiasm concentrates his soul on willing to allow himself to be guided by a sage of that kind, and uncritically just uses his guidance compliantly by willing to form his [[existence]] according to it. When a person as a [[learner]] enthusiastically relates in this way to such a German professor, he accomplishes the most superb epigram upon him, because a speculator of that sort is anything but served by a learner’s honest and enthusiastic zeal for expressing and accomplishing, for existentially appropriating his [[wisdom]], since this wisdom is something that the Herr Professor himself has [[imagination|imagined]] and has written books about but has never attempted himself. It has not even occurred to him that it should be done. Like the customers clerk who, in the belief that his business was merely to write, wrote what he himself could not read, so there are speculative thinkers who merely write, and write that which, if it is to be read with the aid of action, if I may put it that way, proves to be nonsense, unless it is perhaps intended only for fantastical beings. P. 191}}

Hegel wanted to philosophize about Christianity but had no intention to ever become a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to know who he is by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that no one else will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.

Subjectivity is that which the individual—and no one else—has. But what does it mean to have something like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a [[car]] or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society's, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: {{Quotation|We are truly reluctant to make a young person arrogant prematurely and teach him to get busy judging the world. God forbid that anything we say should be able to contribute to developing this malady in a person. Indeed, we think we ought to make his life so strenuously inwardly that from the very beginning he has something else to think about, because it no doubt is a morbid hatred of the world that, perhaps without having considered the enormous responsibility, wants to be persecuted. But on the other hand we are also truly reluctant to deceive a young person by suppressing the difficulty and by suppressing it at the very moment we endeavor to recommend Christianity, inasmuch as that is the very moment we speak. We put our confidence in boldly daring to praise Christianity, also with the addition that in the world its reward, to put it mildly, is ingratitude. We regard it as our duty continually to speak about it in advance, so that we do not sometimes praise Christianity with an omission of what is essentially difficult, and at other times, perhaps on the occasion of a particular text, hit upon a few grounds of comfort for the person tried and tested in life. No, just when Christianity is being praised most strongly, the difficulty must simultaneously be emphasized. (….) Christianly the world’s opposition stands in an essential relationship to the inwardness of Christianity. Moreover, the person who chooses Christianity should at that very moment have an impression of its difficulty so that he can know what it is that he is choosing. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, Hong 1995, pp. 193-194}}

The goal of life, according to [[Socrates]], is to know thyself. Knowing oneself means being aware of who one is, what one can be and what one cannot be. Kierkegaard uses the same idea that Socrates used in his own writings. He asks the one who wants to be a single individual the following questions in his 1847 book, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' {{Quotation|Everyone must make an accounting to God as an individual; the king must make an accounting to God as an individual, and the most wretched beggar must make an accounting to God as an individual – lest anyone be arrogant by being more than an individual, lest anyone despondently think that he is not an individual, perhaps because in the busyness of the world he does not even have a name but is designated only by a number. What else, indeed, is the accounting of eternity than that the voice of conscience is installed eternally in its eternal right to be the only voice!...Are you now living in such a way that you are aware of being a single individual and thereby aware of your eternal responsibility before God; are you living in such a way that this awareness can acquire the time and stillness and liberty to withdraw from life, from an honorable occupation, from a happy domestic life – on the contrary, that awareness will support and transfigure and illuminate your conduct in the relationships of life. You are not to withdraw and sit brooding over your eternal accounting, whereby you only take on a new responsibility. You will find more and more time for your duties and tasks, while concern for your eternal responsibility will keep you from being busy and from busily taking part in everything possible – an activity that can best be called a waste of time...Have you made up your mind about how you want to perform your work, or are you continually of two minds because you want to be in agreement with the crowd? Do you stick to your bid, not defiantly, not despondently, but eternally concerned; do you, unchanged, continue to bid on the same thing and want to buy only the same thing while the terms are variously being changed?...Are you hiding nothing suspicious in your soul, so that you would still wish things were different, so that you would dare robber-like to seize the reward for yourself, would dare to parade it, would dare to point to it; so that you would wish the adversity did not exist because it constrains in you the selfishness that, although suppressed, yet foolishly deludes you into thinking that if you were lucky you would do something for the good that would be worth talking about, deludes you into forgetting that the devout wise person wishes no adversity away when it befalls him because he obviously cannot know whether it might not indeed be a good for him, into forgetting that the devout wise person wins his most beautiful victory when the powerful one who persecuted him wants, as they say, to spare him, and the wise one replies: I cannot unconditionally wish it, because I cannot definitely know whether the persecution might not indeed be a good for me. Are you doing good only out of the fear of punishment, so that you scowl even when you will the good, so that in your dreams at night you wish the punishment away and to that extent also the good, and in your daydreams delude yourself into thinking that one can serve the good with a slavish mind? 
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong pp. 127-140}}

Subjectivity comes with consciousness of myself as a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.

Kierkegaard decided to step up to the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] for himself, replacing [[Adam]], and make his [[choice]] in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in ''Fear and Trembling''. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about [[culpability|guilt]] and [[innocence]]. His book, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.

In [[Kierkegaard]]'s meaning, purely theological assertions are [[subjective truth]]s and they cannot be either verified or invalidated by science, i.e. through objective knowledge.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;Robert C. Solomon, No Excuses: Existentialism and the Meaning of Life, The Great Courses, The Teaching Company, http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=437&lt;/ref&gt; For him, choosing if one is for or against a certain subjective truth is a purely arbitrary choice.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; He calls the jump from objective knowledge to religious faith a [[leap of faith]], since it means subjectively accepting statements which cannot be rationally justified.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; For him the Christian faith is the result of the trajectory initiated by such choices, which don't have and cannot have a rational ground (meaning that reason is neither for or against making such choices).&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; Objectively regarded, purely theological assertions are neither true nor false.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;

===Three stages of life&lt;!--linked from 'Søren Kierkegaard'--&gt;===
Early American Kierkegaard scholars tried to reduce the complexity of Kierkegaard's authorship by focusing on three levels of individual existence, which are named in passing by one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, who wrote ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Though the stages represent only one way of interpreting Kierkegaard's thought, it has become a popular way of introducing his authorship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In continental European circles, stage theory never took hold in the same way. This typifies what Kierkegaard was talking about throughout his writing career. "Early American scholars" and "European circles" denote partitions of thought concerning the writings of his works. He was against "reflecting oneself out of reality" and partitioning the "world of the spirit" because the world of the spirit cannot be objectively divided. He wrote about Hegel's stages in his book, ''Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion'': {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;These stages may be compared to those of the ages of man. The child is still in the primal immediate unity of the will with nature, as representing both his own nature and the nature which surrounds him. The second stage, adolescence, when individuality is in process of becoming independent, is the living spirituality, the vitality of Spirit, which while setting no end before it as yet, moves forward, has aspirations, and takes an interest in everything which comes its way. The third is the age of manhood; this is the period of work for a particular end, to which the man makes himself subserviently, to which he devotes his energies. Finally, old age might be considered as a last stage, which having the Universal before it as an end, and recognizing this end, has turned back from the particular interests of life and work to the universal aim, the absolute final end, and has, as it were, gathered itself together out of the wide and manifold interests of actual outward existence and concentrated itself in the infinite depths of its inner life. Such are the determinations which follow in a logical manner from the nature of the Notion. At the close it will become apparent that even the original immediacy does not exist as immediacy, but is something posited. The child itself is something begotten.

A traveler like that changes places, not himself; and thus it is alright for him to mention and to recount the change in a direct, unchanged form. But in the world of the spirit to change place is to be changed oneself, and there all direct assurance of having arrived here and there is an attempt a la [[Baron Munchausen|Munchausen]]. The presentation itself demonstrates that one has reached that far place in the world of spirit. ... The [[pseudonym]]ous author and I along with them were all [[Qualia|subjective]]. I ask for nothing better than to be known in our ''objective'' times as the only person who was not capable of being objective. That subjectivity, inwardness, is truth, that existing is the decisive factor, that this was the way to take to Christianity, which is precisely inwardness, but please note, not every inwardness, which was why the preliminary stages definitely had to be insisted upon-that was my idea, I thought that I had found a similar endeavor in the pseudonymous writings, and I have tried to make clear my interpretation of them and their relation to my ''[[Philosophical Fragments|Fragments]]''.

In one popular interpretation of stage theory, each of the so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This makes it easier to degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see. Either love the person you see as that person is the person he is or stop talking about loving everyone.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works of Love'' and ''Practice in Christianity''&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|1=Back to the ''[[Stages on Life's Way|Stages]]''. It is markedly different from ''[[Either/Or]]'' by a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|tripartition]]. There are three stages, an esthetic, an ethical, a religious, yet not [[Abstract object|abstract]] as the immediate mediate, the unity, but concrete in the qualification of existence categories as pleasure-perdition, action-victory, suffering. But despite this tripartition, the book is nevertheless an either/or. That is, the ethical and the religious stages have an essential relation to each other. The inadequacy of ''Either/Or'' is simply that the work ended ethically, as has been shown. In ''Stages'' that has been made clear, and the religious is maintained in its place. ....

He did not say, "Peter must first change and become another person before I can love him again." No, he said exactly the opposite, "Peter is Peter, and I love him. My love, if anything will help him to become another person." Therefore he did not break off the friendship in order perhaps to renew it if Peter would have become another person; no, he preserved the friendship unchanged and in that way helped Peter to become another person. Do you think that Peter would have been won again without Christ's faithful friendship? But it is so easy to be a friend when this means nothing else than to request something in particular from the friend and, if the friend does not respond to the request, then to let the friendship cease, until it perhaps begins again if he responds to the request. Is this a relationship of friendship? Who is closer to helping an erring one than the person who calls himself his friend, even if the offense is committed against the friend! But the friend withdraws and says (indeed, it is as if a third person were speaking): When he has become another person, then perhaps he can become my friend again. We are not far from regarding such behavior as magnanimous. But truly we are far from being able to say of such a friend that in loving he loves the person he sees. Christ’s love was boundless, as it must be if this is to be fulfilled: in loving to love the person one sees. This is very easy to perceive. However much and in whatever way a person is changed, he still is not changed in such a way that he becomes invisible. If this-the impossible-is not the case, then of course we do see him, and the duty is to love the person one sees. Ordinarily we think that if a person has essentially changed for the worse, he is then so changed that we are exempt from loving him. But Christianity asks: Can you because of this change no longer see him? The answer to that must be: Certainly I can see him; I see that he is no longer worth loving. But if you see this, then you do not really see him (which you certainly cannot deny you are doing in another sense), you see only the unworthiness and the imperfection and thereby admit that when you loved him you did not see ''him'' in another sense but merely saw his excellence and perfections, which you loved. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' (1847) Hong 1995 p. 172-173

When a person to whom the possible pertains relates himself equally to the duality of the possible, we say: He expects. To expect contains within itself the same duality that the possible has, and to expect is to relate oneself to the possible purely and simply as such. Then the relationship divides according to the way the expecting person chooses. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope, which for that very reason cannot be any temporal expectancy but is an eternal hope. To relate oneself expectancy to the possibility of evil is to fear. But both the one who hopes and the one who fears are expecting. As soon, however, as the choice is made, the possible is changed, because the possibility of the good is the eternal. It is only in the moment of contact that the duality of the possible is equal; therefore, by the decision to choose hope, one decided infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision.

People think that they are speaking with ample experience in dividing a person’s life into certain periods and ages and then call the first period the age of hope or of possibility. What nonsense! Thus, in talk about hope they completely leave out the eternal and yet speak about hope. But how is this possible, since hope pertains to the possibility of the good, and thereby to the eternal! On the other hand, how is it possible to speak about hope in such a way that it is assigned to a certain age! Surely the eternal extends over the whole of life and there is and should be hope to the end; then there is no period that is the age of hope, but a person’s whole life should be the time of hope! And then they think they are speaking with ample experience about hope-by abolishing the eternal. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' (1847) Hong 1995 p. 249-251}}

====Stage one: aesthetic====
Kierkegaard was interested in [[aesthetics]], and is sometimes referred to as the "poet-philosopher" because of the passionate way in which he approached [[philosophy]]. But he is often said to be interested in showing the inadequacy of a life lived entirely in the aesthetic level. Aesthetic life is defined in numerous different ways in Kierkegaard's authorship, including a life defined by intellectual enjoyment, sensuous desire, and an inclination to interpret oneself as if one were "on stage." There are many degrees of this aesthetic existence and a single definition is thus difficult to offer. At bottom, one might see the purely unreflective lifestyle. At the top, we might find those lives which are lived in a reflective, independent, critical and socially apathetic way. But many interpreters of Kierkegaard believe that most people live in the least reflective sort of aesthetic stage, their lives and activities guided by everyday tasks and concerns. Fewer aesthetically guided people are the reflective sort. Whether such people know it or not, their lives will inevitably lead to complete despair. Kierkegaard's author ''A'' is an example of an individual living the aesthetic life. {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;You love the accidental. A smile from a pretty girl in an interesting situation, a stolen glance, that is what you are hunting for, that is a motif for your aimless fantasy. You who always pride yourself on being an observateur must, in return, put up with becoming an object of observation. Ah, you are a strange fellow, one moment a child, the next an old man; one moment you are thinking most earnestly about the most important scholarly problems, how you will devote your life to them, and the next you are a lovesick fool. But you are a long way from marriage. ''Either/Or Part II'' p. 7-8&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Just consider, your life is passing; for you, too, the time will eventually come even to you when your life is at an end, when you are no longer shown any further possibilities in life, when recollection alone is left, recollection, but not in the sense in which you love it so much, this mixture of fiction and truth, but the earnest and faithful recollection of your conscience. Beware that it does not unroll a list for you-presumably not of actual crimes but of wasted possibilities, showdown pictures it will be impossible for you to drive away. The [[intellectual]] agility you possess is very becoming to youth and diverts the eye for a time. We are astonished to see a clown whose joints are so loose that all the restraints of man’s gait and posture are annulled. You are like that in an intellectual sense; you can just as well stand on your head as on your feet. Everything is [[Logical possibility|possible]] for you, and you can surprise yourself and others with this possibility, but it is unhealthy, and for your own peace of mind I beg you to watch out lest that which is an advantage to you end by becoming a curse. Any man who has a conviction cannot at his pleasure turn himself and everything topsy-turvy in this way. Therefore I do not warn you against the world but against yourself and the world against you. ''Either/Or II'', Hong p. 16&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

====Stage two: ethical====
The second level of existence is the ethical. This is where an individual begins to take on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for [[goodness and value theory|good]] and [[evil]] and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls [[repentance]]. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with [[Dharma]] - following this or that religion,set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as "dharma", though dharma is also a [[law]]). &lt;blockquote&gt;"He repents himself back into himself, back into the family, back into the race, until he finds himself in God. Only on this condition can he choose himself. And this is the only condition he wants, for only in this way can he choose himself absolutely." ....  “I repent myself out of the whole existence. Repentance specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me and at the same time expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in me did not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were something in me that I could not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute but only a product." .... "It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam."  ... "The [[Either/Or]] I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose ''eo ipso'' the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice." Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216-217, 224, 237-238, 219&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Judge Wilhelm," a pseudonymous author of ''Either/Or'' and the voice who defines the ethical consciousness, argues that the commitment to take responsibility for one's own choices must be made individually. To take responsibility for the various relationships in which an individual finds him- or herself is a possibility open to every human being, but it does not follow that every human being chooses to do so as a matter of course. The meaning of a person's life for Wilhelm depends on how he takes responsibility for his current and future choices, and how he takes ownership of those choices already made. For Wilhelm, the ethically governed person takes responsibility for past actions, some good and some bad, seeks consistency, and takes seriously the obligation to live in a passionate and devoted way. 
{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;The Christian God is spirit and Christianity is spirit, and there is discord between the flesh and the spirit but the flesh is not the sensuous-it is the selfish. In this sense, even the spiritual can become sensuous-for example, if a person took his spiritual gifts in vain, he would then be carnal. And of course I know that it is not necessary for the Christian that Christ must have been physically beautiful; and it would be grievous-for a reason different from the one you give-because if beauty were some essential, how the believer would long to see him; but from all this it by no means follows that the sensuous is annihilated in Christianity. The first love has the element of beauty in itself, and the joy and fullness that are in the sensuous in its innocence can very well be caught up in Christianity. But let us guard against one thing, a wrong turn that is more dangerous than the one you wish to avoid; let us not become too spiritual. Either/Or Part II p. 50&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The question, namely, is this: Can this love be actualized? After having conceded everything up to this point, you perhaps will say: Well, it is just as difficult to actualize marriage as to actualize first love. To that I must respond: No, for in marriage there is a law of motion. First love remains an unreal [[Noumenon#Positive and negative noumena|in itself]] that never acquires inner substance because it moves only in the external medium. In the ethical and religious intention, marital love has the possibility of an inner history and is as different from first love as the historical is from the unhistorical. This love is strong, stronger than the whole world, but the moment it doubts it is annihilated; it is like a sleepwalker who is able to walk the most dangerous places with the complete security but plunges down when someone calls his name. Marital love is armed, for in the intention not only is attentiveness directed to the surrounding world but the will is directed toward itself, toward the inner world. Either/Or II p. 94&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The choice itself is crucial for the content of the personality: through the choice the personality submerges itself in that which is being chosen, and when it does not choose, it withers away in atrophy. ... Imagine a captain of a ship the moment a shift of direction must be made; then he may be able to say: I can do either this or that. But if he is not a mediocre captain he will also be aware that during all this the ship is ploughing ahead with its ordinary velocity, and thus there is but a single moment when it is inconsequential whether he does this or does that. So also with a person-if he forgets to take into account the velocity-there eventually comes a moment where it is no longer a matter of an Either/Or, not because he has chosen, but because he has refrained from it, which also can be expressed by saying: Because others have chosen for him-or because he has lost himself. Either/Or II p. 163-164&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

====Stage three: religious====
The ethical and the [[religious]] are intimately connected:  a person can be ethically serious without being religious, but the religious stage includes the ethical. Whereas living in the ethical sphere involves a commitment to some [[Moral absolutism|moral absolute]], living in the religious sphere involves a commitment and relation to the Christian God. Kierkegaard explained this in ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' like this: {{Quotation|Johannes the [[Seducer]] ends with the [[thesis]] that woman is only the moment. This in its general sense is the essential esthetic thesis, that the moment is all and to that extent, in turn, essentially nothing, just as the [[Sophist]]ic thesis that everything is true is that nothing is true. On the whole the conception of [[time]] is the decisive element in every standpoint up to the paradox, which paradoxically accentuates time. To the degree that time is accentuated, to the same degree there is movement from the esthetic, the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], to the [[ethical]], the religious, and the [[Christian]]-religious. Where Johannes the Seducer ends, the Judge begins: Woman’s beauty increases with the years. Here time is accentuated ethically, but still not in such a way that precludes the possibility of recollection’s withdrawal out of [[existence]] into the [[Immortality|eternal]]. p. 298-299

If a man like Kant, standing on the pinnacle of scientific scholarship, were to say in reference to demonstrations of the existence of God: Well, I do not know anything more about that than that my father told me it was so-this is humorous and actually says more than a whole book about demonstrations, if the book forgets this. p. 552-553}}

The Kierkegaardian pseudonyms who speak of stage theory consider religion to be the highest stage in human existence. In one discussion of religious life, one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, distinguishes two types within this stage, which have been called ''Religiousness A'' and ''Religiousness B''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' p. 555ff&lt;/ref&gt; One type is symbolized by the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Socrates]], whose passionate pursuit of the truth and individual conscience came into conflict with his society. Another type of religiousness is one characterized by the realization that the individual is [[sin]]ful and is the source of untruth.  In time, through revelation and in direct relationship with the [[paradox]] that is [[Jesus]], the individual begins to see that his or her eternal salvation rests on a paradox—[[Attributes of God in Christianity#Transcendence|God, the transcendent]], coming into time in human form to redeem human beings. For Kierkegaard, the very notion of this occurring was scandalous to human reason—indeed, it must be, and if it is not then one does not truly understand the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] nor the meaning of human sinfulness. For Kierkegaard, the impulse towards an awareness of a transcendent power in the universe is what religion is. Religion has a social and an individual (not just personal) dimension. But it begins with the individual and his or her awareness of sinfulness. Here are several quotes from Kierkegaard's where he discusses his concept of sin. &lt;blockquote&gt;The sin/faith opposition is the Christian one which transforms all ethical concepts in a Christian way and distils one more decoction from them. At the root of the opposition lies the crucial Christian specification: before God; and that in turn has the crucial Christian characteristic: the absurd, the paradox, the possibility of offense. And it is of the utmost importance that this is demonstrated in every specification of the Christian, since offense is the Christian protection against all speculative philosophy. In what, then, do we find the possibility of offense here? In the fact that a person should have the reality of his being, as a particular human being, directly before God, and accordingly, again, and by the same token, that man’s sin should be of concern of God. This notion of the single human being before God never occurs to speculative thought; it only universalizes particular human phantastically into the human race. It is exactly for this reason that a disbelieving Christianity came up with the idea that sin is sin, that it is neither here nor there whether it is before God. In other words, it wanted to get rid of the specification ‘before God’, and to that end invented a new wisdom, which nevertheless, curiously enough, was neither more nor less than what the higher wisdom generally is-old paganism. ''The Sickness Unto Death'', Hannay, 1989 p. 115&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Admittance is only through the consciousness of sin; to want to enter by any other road is high treason against Christianity. … The simple soul who humbly acknowledges himself to be a sinner, himself personally (the single individual), has no need at all to learn about all the difficulties that come when one is neither simple or humble. … To the extent Christianity, terrifying, will rise up against him and transform itself into madness or horror until he either learns to give up Christianity or-by means of what is anything but scholarly propaedeutics, apologetics, etc., by means of the anguish of a contrite conscience, all in proportion to his need-learns to enter into Christianity by the narrow way, through the consciousness of sin. ''Practice in Christianity'', Hong, 1991, p. 67-68&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Kierkegaard's thoughts on other philosophers==

===Kierkegaard and Fichte===
[[File:Johann Gottlieb Fichte.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Fichte]] Kierkegaard wrote much about [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] in his thesis ''[[The Concept of Irony]]''&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Concept of Irony'', p. 272ff&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in his first book ''[[De omnibus dubitandum est]]'', written under the pseudonym Johannes Climacus, and his Journals. Fichte wrote the book ''[[The Vocation of Man]]'' (1800) which called for a progression in the life of the human being from doubt to knowledge and then to faith. ''De omnibus dubitandum est'' is from Descartes and means everything must be doubted. Both Kierkegaard and Fichte were interested in this idea of beginning with doubt as well as subjectivity. Kierkegaard wrote: "In Fichte, subjectivity became free, infinite, negative. But in order for subjectivity to get out of this movement of emptiness in which it moved in infinite abstraction, it had to be negated; in order for thought to become actual, it had to become concrete."&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Irony, Hong p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation|Our whole age is imbued with a formal striving. This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations. It is this whole striving which is denoted by — to use the words of another author — Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and [[Robespierre]]'s attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world. I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea. We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual. We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form. Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form. Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment — whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived. But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong — both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily.     Soren Kierkegaard, ''Journals'', Our Journalistic Literature November 28, 1835}}

===Kierkegaard and Hegel===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|150px|thumb|Hegel]]
Many philosophers think that one of Kierkegaard's greatest contributions to philosophy is his critique of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Indeed, many of Kierkegaard's works are written in response to or as a critique of Hegel. Although Kierkegaard strongly criticized some aspects of Hegelian philosophy, his work also shows that he was also positively influenced by Hegel, and had respect for Hegel himself.
{{Quotation | Now everything is set in motion, and usually this also involves making the system popular — per systema influxus physici it lays hold of all men. How [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] was treated in his time is well known, and therefore I need only mention the infinite mass of lexicons, summaries, popular presentations, and explanations for everyman, etc. And how did Hegel fare later, Hegel, the most modern [[philosopher]], who because of his rigorous form would most likely command silence? Has not the logical trinity been advanced in the most ludicrous way? And therefore it did not astound me that my shoemaker had found that it could also be applied to the development of boots, since, as he observes, the dialectic, which is always the first stage in life, finds expression even here, however insignificant this may seem, in the squeaking, which surely has not escaped the attention of some more profound research psychologist. Unity, however, appears only later, in which respect his shoes far surpass all others, which usually disintegrate in the dialectic, a unity which reached the highest level in that pair of boots Carl XII wore on his famous ride, and since he as an orthodox shoemaker proceeded from the thesis that the immediate (feet without shoes — shoes without feet) is a pure [[abstraction]] and took it [the dialectical] as the first stage in the development. And now our modern [[politicians]]! By veritably taking up Hegel, they have given a striking example of the way one can serve two masters, in that their revolutionary striving is paired with a life-outlook which is a remedy for it, an excellent remedy for lifting part of the illusion which is necessary for encouraging their fantastic striving. And the actuality of the [[phenomenon]] will surely not be denied if one recalls that the words "immediate or spontaneous unity" occur just as necessarily in every scientific-scholarly treatise as a brunette or a blonde in every well-ordered romantic household. At the happy moment everyone received a copy of Holy Scriptures, in which there was one book which was almost always too brief and sometimes almost invisible, and this was, I regret — the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. And how curious it is to note that the present age, whose social striving is trumpeted quite enough, is ashamed of the monks and nuns of the [[Middle Ages]], when at the same time, to confine ourselves to our own native land, a society has been formed here which seems to embrace almost the entire kingdom and in which a speaker began thus: Dear Brothers and Sisters. How remarkable to see them censure the Jesuitry of the Middle Ages, since precisely the liberal development, as does every one-sided enthusiasm, has led and must lead to that. And now Christianity — how has it been treated? I share entirely your disapproval of the way every Christian concept has become so volatilized, so completely dissolved in a mass of fog, that it is beyond all recognition. To the concepts of faith, incarnation, tradition, inspiration, which in the Christian sphere are to lead to a particular historical fact, the philosophers choose to give an entirely different, ordinary meaning, whereby faith has become the immediate consciousness, which essentially is nothing other than the vitale Fluidum of mental life, its atmosphere, and tradition has become the content of a certain experience of the world, while inspiration has become nothing more than God's breathing of the life-spirit into man, and incarnation no more than the presence of one or another idea in one or more individuals. — Journals IA 328 1836 or 1837}}

In a journal entry made in 1844, Kierkegaard wrote:
{{Quotation|If Hegel had written the whole of his logic and then said, in the preface or some other place, that it was merely an experiment in thought in which he had even begged the question in many places, then he would certainly have been the greatest thinker who had ever lived.  As it is, he is merely comic. |Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1844&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;)}}

While Kierkegaard was a student of theology at the University of Copenhagen, [[Hegelianism]] had become increasingly popular. [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] and [[Hans Lassen Martensen]] were key figures in Danish Hegelianism. Kierkegaard remarked in his journal on 17 May 1843 that Heiberg's writings were "borrowed" from Hegel, implying Heiberg would have been a nobody without Hegel.

Kierkegaard objected to Hegel's claim that he had devised a system of thought that could explain the whole of reality, with a [[Dialectical#Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]] analysis of history leading the way to this whole. Hegel claimed that the doctrines and history of Christianity could be explained as a part of the rational unfolding and development of our understanding of the natural world and our place within it. Kierkegaard considered Hegel's explanation of Christianity as a necessary part of world history to be a distortion of the Christian message and a misunderstanding of the limits of human reason. He attempted to refute this aspect of Hegel's thought by suggesting that many doctrines of Christianity - including the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|doctrine of Incarnation]], a God who is also human - cannot be explained rationally but remain a logical paradox. However, he was in favor of youthful striving after truth. {{Quotation|Let a doubting youth, but an existing doubter with youth’s lovable, boundless confidence in a hero of scientific scholarship, venture to find in Hegelian positivity the truth, the truth of existence-he will write a dreadful epigram on Hegel. Do not misunderstand me. I do not mean that every youth is capable of overcoming Hegel, far from it. If a young person is conceited and foolish enough to try that, his attack is inane. No, the youth must never think of wanting to attack him; he must rather be willing to submit unconditionally to Hegel with feminine devotedness, but nevertheless with sufficient strength also to stick to his question-then he is a satirist without suspecting it. The youth is an existing doubter; continually suspended in [[doubt]], he grasps for the truth-so that he can exist in it. Consequently, he is negative, and Hegel’s philosophy is, of course, positive-no wonder he puts his trust in it. But for an existing person pure thinking is a [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] when the truth is supposed to be the truth in which to exist. Having to exist with the help of the guidance of pure thinking is like having to travel in Denmark with a small map of Europe on which Denmark is no larger than a steel pen-point, indeed, even more impossible. The youth’s admiration, his enthusiasm, and his limitless confidence in Hegel are precisely the satire on Hegel. This would have been discerned long ago if pure thinking had not maintained itself with the aid of a reputation that impresses people, so that they dare not say anything except that it is superb, that they have understood it-although in a certain sense that it is indeed impossible, since no one can be led by this philosophy to understand himself, which is certainly an absolute condition for all other understanding. Socrates has rather ironically said that he did not know for sure whether he was a human being or something else, but in the confessional a Hegelian can say with all solemnity: I do not know whether I am a human being-but I have understood the system. I prefer to say: I know that I am a human being, and I know that I have not understood the system. And when I have said that very directly, I shall add that if any of our Hegelians want to take me into hand and assist me to an understanding of the system, nothing will stand in the way from my side. In order that I can learn all the more, I shall try hard to be as obtuse as possible, so as not to have, if possible, a single presupposition except my ignorance. And in order to be sure of learning something, I shall try hard to be as indifferent as possible to all charges of being unscientific and unscholarly. Existing, if this is to be understood as just any sort of existing, cannot be done without passion.
* Soren Kierkegaard 1846, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments,'' Hong p. 310-311}}

To refute Hegel's claim that Christianity should be understood as a part of the necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of [[Abraham]] to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said of a human being) and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.
{{Quotation|Kierkegaard's strategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything more difficult. Instead of seeing scientific knowledge as the means of human redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to redemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought to take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God and Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the absolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of setting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast array of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and to place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived from his texts squarely on the reader. … Kierkegaard's tactic in undermining Hegelianism was to produce an elaborate parody of Hegel's entire system. The pseudonymous authorship, from ''[[Either/Or]]'' to ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', presents an inverted Hegelian dialectic which is designed to lead readers away from knowledge rather than towards it.|Søren Kierkegaard|[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/#Rhet William McDonald]}}

By doing this, Hegelian critics accuse Kierkegaard of using the dialectic to disprove the dialectic, which seems somewhat contradictory and hypocritical. However, Kierkegaard would not claim the dialectic itself is bad, only the Hegelian premise that the dialectic ''would lead to a harmonious reconciliation of everything'', which Hegel called the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]. Kierkegaard stated this most clearly in his book ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', &lt;blockquote&gt;[[Theology|Dogmatics]] must not explain [[Original Sin|hereditary sin]] but rather explain it by presupposing it, like that vortex about which Greek speculation concerning nature had so much to say, a moving something that no science can grasp. That such is the case with dogmatics will readily be granted if once again time is taken to understand [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]’s immortal service to this science. He was left behind long ago when men chose Hegel. Yet Schleiermacher was a thinker in the beautiful Greek sense, a thinker who spoke only of what he knew. Hegel, on the contrary, despite all his outstanding ability and stupendous learning, reminds us again and again by his performance that he was in the German sense a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] on a large scale, because he ''a tout prix'' [at any price] must explain all things. ''The Concept of Anxiety'', by Reidar Thomte Princeton University Press 1980 P. 20&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaardian scholars have made several interpretations of how Kierkegaard proceeds with parodying Hegel's dialectic. One of the more popular interpretations argues the aesthetic-ethical-religious stages are the triadic process Kierkegaard was talking about. See section ''Spheres of existence'' for more information. Another interpretation argues for the world-individual-will triadic process. The dialectic here is either to assert an individual's own desire to be independent and the desire to be part of a community. Instead of reconciliation of the world and the individual where problems between the individual and society are neatly resolved in the Hegelian system, Kierkegaard argues that there's a delicate bond holding the interaction between them together, which needs to be constantly reaffirmed. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] takes this latter view and says the individual is in a constant state of reaffirming his or her own identity, else one falls into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]].

This process of reconciliation leads to a "both/and" view of life, where both thesis and antithesis are resolved into a synthesis, which negates the importance of personal responsibility and the human choice of either/or. The work ''[[Either/Or]]'' is a response to this aspect of Hegel's philosophy. A passage from that work exemplifies Kierkegaard's contempt for Hegel's philosophy. Note the comparison between "A" and "B" (Judge Vilhelm) in ''Either/Or'' and ''Stages on Life's Way''.

Here are two more from 1846
{{Quotation|As is well known, Hegelian philosophy has canceled the principle of contradiction, and Hegel himself has more than once emphatically held judgment day on the kind of thinkers who remained in the sphere of understanding and reflection and who have therefore insisted that there is an either/or. Since that time, it has become a popular game, so that as soon as someone hints at an aut/aut [either/or] a Hegelian comes riding trip-trap-trap on horse and wins a victory and rides home again. Among us, too, the Hegelians have several times been on the move, especially against Bishop Mynster, in order to win [[Continental philosophy|speculative]] thought’s brilliant victory; and [[Jacob Peter Mynster|Bishop Mynster]], has more than once become a defeated standpoint, even though for being a defeated standpoint he is holding up very well, and it is rather to be feared that the enormous exertion of the victory has been too exhausting to the undefeated victors. And yet there may be a misunderstanding at the root at the conflict and the victory, Hegel is perfectly and absolutely right in maintaining that, looked at eternally, ''sub specie aeterni'', there is no aut/aut [[either/or]] in the language of abstraction, in [[pure thought]] and pure being. Where the devil would it be, since abstraction, after all, simply removes the contradiction; therefore Hegel and the Hegelians should instead take the trouble to explain what is meant by the masquerade of getting contradiction, movement, transition, etc. into logic. The defenders of aut/aut are in the wrong if they push their way into the territory of pure thinking and want to defend their cause there. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, Volume I'' p. 305}}
{{Quotation | According to Hegel the truth is the continuous world-historical process. Each generation, each stage of this process, is legitimated and yet is only an element of the truth. Short of resorting to a bit of charlatanry, which helps by assuming that the generation in which Hegel lived or the one after him is ''[[imprimatur]]'', and this generation is the last and [[History of the world|world history]] is past, we are all implicated in [[skepticism]]. The passionate question of truth does not even come up, because philosophy has first tricked the [[individual]]s into becoming [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]. The positive Hegelian truth is just as deceptive as happiness was in paganism. Not until afterward does one come to know whether or not one has been happy, and thus the next generation comes to know what truth was in the preceding generation. The great secret of the system is close to [[Protagoras]]’s [[sophism]] “[[Relativism|Everything is relative]]”, except that here everything is relative in the continuous process. But no living soul is served by that … ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]] Volume I'', by Johannes Climacus, edited by Søren Kierkegaard, Copyright 1846 – Edited and Translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong 1992, Princeton University Press. Note p. 33}}

The whole idea of one generation spending all its time studying past generations and then the next generation spending their time studying past generations and making moral and social comments about preceding generations was called, "The Hegelian cud-chewing process with three-stomachs - first immediacy - then regurgitation - then down again." He said, "Maybe a succeeding master-mind could continue this with four stomachs, etc., down once more and up again. I don't know if the master-mind grasps what I mean."&lt;ref&gt;Journals and Papers 25 August 1936 1A229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kierkegaard and Schelling===
[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling.png|150px|thumb|Schelling]]
In 1841–1842, Kierkegaard attended the [[Berlin]] lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]. Schelling was a critic of [[Georg Hegel]] and a professor at the [[University of Berlin]]. The university started a lecture series given by Schelling in order to espouse a type of [[positive philosophy]] which would be diametrically opposed to [[Hegelianism]]. Kierkegaard was initially delighted with Schelling. Before he left Copenhagen to attend Schelling's lectures in Berlin, he wrote to his friend Peter Johannes Sprang:
{{Quotation|Schelling lectures to a select, numerous, and yet also ''undique conflatum auditorium''. During the first lectures it was almost a matter of risking one's life to hear him. I have never in my life experienced such uncomfortable crowding — still, what would one not do to be able to hear Schelling? His main point is always that there are two philosophies, one positive and one negative. The negative is given, but not by Hegel, for Hegel's is neither negative nor positive but a refined Spinozaism. The positive is yet to come. In other words, in the future it will not be only the lawyers who become the ''doctores juris utriusque'', for I venture to flatter myself that without submitting another dissertation I shall become a ''magister philosophiae utriusque''.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1841)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

At Berlin, Kierkegaard gave high praises to Schelling. In a journal entry made sometime around October or November 1841, Kierkegaard wrote this piece about Schelling's second lecture:
{{Quotation|I am so pleased to have heard Schelling's second lecture -- indescribably! I have sighed for long enough and my thoughts have sighed within me; when he mentioned the word, "reality" in connection with the relation of philosophy to reality the fruit of my thought leapt for joy within me. I remember almost every word he said from that moment on.  … Now I have put all my hopes in Schelling!|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1841)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

As time went on, however, Kierkegaard, as well as many in Schelling's audience, began to become disillusioned with Schelling. In a particularly insulting letter about Schelling, Kierkegaard wrote to his brother, Peter Kierkegaard:
{{Quotation|Schelling drivels on quite intolerably! If you want to form some idea what this is like then I ask you to submit yourself to the following experiment as a sort of self-inflicted sadistic punishment. Imagine person R's meandering philosophy, his entirely aimless, haphazard knowledge, and person Hornsyld's untiring efforts to display his learning: imagine the two combined and in addition to an impudence hitherto unequalled by any philosopher; and with that picture vividly before your poor mind go to the workroom of a prison and you will have some idea of Schelling's philosophy. He even lectures longer to prolong the torture. … Consequently, I have nothing to do in Berlin. I am too old to attend lectures and Schelling is too old to give them. So I shall leave Berlin as soon as possible. But if it wasn't for Schelling, I would never have travelled to Berlin. I must thank him for that. … I think I should have become utterly insane if I had gone on hearing Schelling.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 27 February 1842)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

{{Quotation|It is common knowledge that [[Aristotle]] used the term first philosophy primarily to designate [[metaphysics]], though he included within it a part that accorded to our conception belongs to [[theology]]. In paganism it is quite in order for theology to be treated there. It is related to the same lack of an infinite penetration reflection that endowed the theater in paganism with reality as a kind of divine worship. If we now abstract from this ambiguity, we could retain the designation and by first philosophy understand that totality of science which we might call “ethnical,” whose essence is immanence and is expressed in Greek thought by “recollection,” and by second philosophy understand that totality of science whose essence is transcendence or repetition. Schelling called attention to this Aristotelian term in support of his own distinction between negative and positive philosophy. By negative philosophy he meant “logic”; that was clear enough. On the other hand, it was less clear to me what he really meant by positive philosophy, except insofar as it became evident that it was the philosophy that he himself wished to provide. However, since I have nothing to go by except my own opinion, it is not feasible to pursue this subject further. [[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Constantin Constantius]] has called attention to this by pointing out that immanence runs aground upon “interest.” With this concept, actuality for the first time comes into view. Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Anxiety'' 1844, p. 21 and Note p. 21 Nichol}}

Kierkegaard became disillusioned with Schelling partly because Schelling shifted his focus on actuality, including a discussion on ''quid sit'' [what is] and ''quod sit'' [that is], to a more mythological, psychic-type pseudo-philosophy. Kierkegaard's last writing about Schelling's lectures was on 4 February 1842. He wrote the following in 1844, {{Quotation|Some men of [[Naturphilosophie|Schelling’s school]] have been especially aware of the alteration that has taken place in nature because of sin. Mention has been made also of the anxiety that is supposed to be in inanimate nature.  Schelling’s main thought is that anxiety, etc., characterize the suffering of the deity in his endeavor to create. In Berlin he expressed the same thought more definitely by comparing God with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and Jon Von Muller,&lt;ref&gt;See his Universal History published in 1818 https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL4431565A/John_von_Muller&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom felt well only when producing, and also by calling attention to the fact that such a bliss, when it cannot communicate itself, is unhappiness. ''The Concept of Anxiety'' P. 59-60 Note p. 59}}

Although Schelling had little influence on Kierkegaard's subsequent writings, Kierkegaard's trip to Berlin provided him ample time to work on his masterpiece, ''[[Either/Or]]''. In a reflection about Schelling in 1849, Kierkegaard remarked that Schelling was ''like the [[Rhine]] at its mouth where it became stagnant water - he was degenerating into a Prussian "Excellency". (Journals, January 1849)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;''

===Kierkegaard and Schopenhauer===
[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|150px|thumb|Arthur Schopenhauer]]
Kierkegaard became acquainted with [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s writings quite late in his life. Kierkegaard felt Schopenhauer was an important writer, but disagreed on almost every point Schopenhauer made. In several journal entries made in 1854, a year before he died, Kierkegaard spoke highly of Schopenhauer:
{{Quotation|In the same way that one disinfects the mouth during an epidemic so as not to be infected by breathing in the poisonous air, one might recommend students who will have to live in Denmark in an atmosphere of nonsensical Christian optimism, to take a little dose of Schopenhauer's Ethic in order to protect themselves against infection from that malodourous twaddle.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

However, Kierkegaard also considered him, ''a most dangerous sign'' of things to come:
{{Quotation|Schopenhauer is so far from being a real pessimist that at the most he represents 'the interesting': in a certain sense he makes [[asceticism]] interesting--the most dangerous thing possible for a pleasure-seeking age which will be harmed more than ever by distilling pleasure even out of asceticism… is by studying asceticism in a completely impersonal way, by assigning it a place in the system.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

Kierkegaard believes Schopenhauer's ethical point of view is that the individual succeeds in seeing through the wretchedness of existence and then decides to deaden or mortify the joy of life. As a result of this complete asceticism, one reaches contemplation: the individual does this out of sympathy. He sympathizes with all the misery and the misery of others, which is to exist. Kierkegaard here is probably referring to the pessimistic nature of Schopenhauer's philosophy. One of Kierkegaard's main concerns is a suspicion of his whole philosophy:
{{Quotation|After reading through Schopenhauer's Ethic one learns - naturally he is to that extent honest - that he himself is not an ascetic. And consequently he himself has not reached contemplation through asceticism, but only a contemplation which contemplates asceticism. This is extremely suspicious, and may even conceal the most terrible and corrupting voluptuous [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]: a profound [[misanthropy]]. In this too it is suspicious, for it is always suspicious to propound an ethic which does not exert so much power over the teacher that he himself expresses. Schopenhauer makes ethics into genius, but that is of course an unethical conception of ethics. He makes ethics into genius and although he prides himself quite enough on being a genius, it has not pleased him, or nature has not allowed him, to become a genius where asceticism and mortification are concerned.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

Little else is known about Kierkegaard's attitude to Schopenhauer. On Schopenhauer himself, Kierkegaard felt that Schopenhauer would have been patronizing. "Schopenhauer interests me very much, as does his fate in Germany. If I could talk to him I am sure he would shudder or laugh if I were to show him [my philosophy]."  ''(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;''

==Kierkegaard and Eastern philosophy==
Because Kierkegaard read Schopenhauer, and because Schopenhauer was heavily influenced by Eastern philosophy, it would seem that Kierkegaard would have shown an awareness of Eastern philosophy. There is, however, little direct reference to Asian thought in Kierkegaard's writings. Anyone who is familiar with such Asian traditions as Buddhist, Taoist, or Shinto philosophy, will quickly see the philosophical similarities that Kierkegaard shares with these traditions. These similarities perhaps explain the Japanese reception of Kierkegaard and the fact that Japanese awareness and translations of Kierkegaard were appearing at least 30 years before any English translations.&lt;ref&gt;Masugata, Kinya, “A Short History of Kierkegaard's Reception in Japan”, in J. Giles (ed.) ''Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 31-52&lt;/ref&gt; There is also extensive Japanese scholarship on Kierkegaard, a scholarship that interprets Kierkegaard's philosophy in terms of Asian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Mortensen, Finn Hauberg, ''Kierkegaard Made in Japan'', University Press of Southern Denmark, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is understandable when one sees that Kierkegaard's central concerns of subjectivity, anxiety, freedom, despair, and self-deception, are also of central concern to Buddhism and, consequently, that there is nothing exclusively Christian about such concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, James “Introduction: Kierkegaard's among the Temples of Kamakura”, in J. Giles (ed.) ''Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 1-30&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kierkegaard and Zen Buddhism, for example, have seen the predicaments of existence in very similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Nolan Pliny, “The Predicament of Man in Zen Buddhism and Kierkegaard”, ''Philosophy East and West'' 2, 1952, 238-253&lt;/ref&gt; A specific example of the similarities here can be seen in ''Purity of Heart'' where Kierkegaard describes the state of awareness that one must enter in order to partake of confession. Kierkegaard's description of this state is similar to the state of meditation described by Buddhist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, James, “To Practice One Thing: Kierkegaard through the Eyes of Dogen”, in J. Giles (ed.) ''Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 87-105&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct, however, in that the aim of confession, for Kierkegaard, is "to center itself upon this relation to itself as an individual who is responsible to God" (cf. Kierkegaard, "Purity of Heart").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2523&amp;C=2401&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard aims to claim back the subject from the "crowd" mentality of Christendom (cf. Kierkegaard, "On the Dedication to 'That Single Individual' ")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/k/kierkegaard/untruth/untruth.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and reaffirm the absolute responsibility to God, which is our [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] (cf. Kierkegaard, "Fear and Trembling").&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling, ed. and trans. Howard and Edna Hong, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harald Hoffding]] (1843-1931) helped introduce Kierkegaard to Western Europe in the early years of the 20th century. He compared Kierkegaard to Eastern philosophy in his 1914 book ''The Philosophy Of Religion'' in this way: {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;A characteristic and very frequent type of religious faith is determined by the need of rest. The main cause of fatigue and exhaustion in life is chiefly unrest and distraction of mind. We are influenced on so many sides that it is difficult for us to collect our thoughts; we are drawn in so many directions that we find it difficult to focus our will on any one aim; so many different and changing feelings are aroused that the inner harmony of the mind is exposed to the danger of dissolution. Owing to this feeling of misfit with our ideal we experience an inner need, while our outer needs are borne in upon us in the guise of pain, frailty, and dependence on the elementary wants of life. In the [[Upanishads]] we find: "The Self (Atma), the sinless one, who redeems from old age, death, suffering, hunger, and thirst, whose wishes are the right ones and whose decree is the right one I am that self which men must inquire after and seek to know. He who has found and known this Self has attained all worlds and all wishes." And in another place: “Save me, for I feel in this world’s life like a frog in a sealed fountain." Jesus of Nazareth says: " Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Learn of me, and ye shall find rest for your souls." “Unquiet is our heart," says Augustine to his God, “until it find rest in Thee." This need for rest rises to a passion in natures such as [[St. Theresa]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], and Soren Kierkegaard. There is no doubt an element of deep pathos in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] also, but in his case we have the Platonist and the prince of the church combined with the earnest seeker, and it is the combination of all these elements which renders him such a unique figure in the history of the religious life. St. Theresa felt the need of union with God so powerfully that death alone could satisfy it: "I knew not where else to seek this life but in death. The fish, drawn out of the water, sees at any rate the end of its torment; but what death can compare with the life in which I languish?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;With Kierkegaard, too, his great desire was to be released from the struggle of life. The lines which he desired should be inscribed on his gravestone express this longing: “A little while the search is o’er. The din of battle sounds no more." In this life the believer finds himself in an alien element; between the inner and the outer, between life and its conditions there is a want of harmony. In Kierkegaard s case, too, we get the metaphor of the fish out of water; it is characteristic of this type that the same figure should be employed by the ancient Indians in the Upanishads, by the Spanish nun of the sixteenth century, and by the northern thinker of the nineteenth century. This trait sheds a light on the psychology of religion. The aim of man is infinite, but he is condemned to spend his life in the world of finitude, and hence it follows that his existence acquires a sort of spasmodic character. In Kierkegaard, and even in Pascal, this opposition is more sharply brought out than in St. Theresa. In the latter it evokes longing and inner aspiration, but her will is occupied entirely by the highest object, and only her memory and her imagination are free to analyse her experiences. But both Pascal and Kierkegaard have constantly to summon the will to their aid; in their case they have a desperate struggle to keep themselves upright in face of the harsh discord between the true life and the conditions of actual life; to hold fast to the thought of the object of faith and to resist the onslaughts of doubt. ''The Philosophy Of Religion'', Dr. Harald Hoffding p. 116-118, Translated from the German Edition, By B. E. Meyer 1914&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
'''Prajñāpāramitā''' means "the Perfection of (Transcendent) Wisdom" in [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna Buddhism]]. Prajñāpāramitā refers to this perfected way of seeing the nature of reality, as well as to a particular body of [[sutra]]s and to the personification of the concept in the [[Bodhisattva]] known as the "Great Mother" (Tibetan: Yum Chenmo). The word ''Prajñāpāramitā'' combines the [[Sanskrit]] words ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]]'' "wisdom" with ''[[pāramitā]]'' "perfection". Prajñāpāramitā is a central concept in [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]] and is generally associated with the doctrine of emptiness ([[Shunyata]]) or 'lack of [[Svabhava]]' (essence) and the works of [[Nagarjuna]]. Its practice and understanding are taken to be indispensable elements of the [[Bodhisattva]] path.

According to [[Edward Conze]], the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras are "a collection of about forty texts ... composed somewhere around Indian subcontinent between approximately 100 BC and AD 600."&lt;ref&gt;Conze, E. Perfect Wisdom: The Short Prajnaparamita Texts, Buddhist Publishing Group, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Some Prajnāpāramitā sūtras are thought to be among the earliest [[Mahāyāna sūtras]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the important features of the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras is [[anutpada]] (unborn, no origin).&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert; Lopez, Donald S. Jr., eds. (2014), ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'', Princeton University Press pg. 945   "In the PRAJÑĀPĀRAMITĀ literature and the MADHYAMAKA school,  the notion of production comes under specific criticism  (see VAJRAKAṆĀ),  with NĀGĀRJUNA famously asking,  e.g.,  how an effect can be produced from a cause that is either the same as or different from itself.  The prajñāpāramitā sūtras thus famously declare that all dharmas are actually ANUTPĀDA,  or “unproduced.”"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1995), ''Early Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism: The Mahāyāna Context of the Gauḍapādīya-kārikā'', SUNY Press pg.113 "It is equally apparent that one of the important features of the Prajnaparamita positition is that of the nonarising (anutpada) of dharmas."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Earliest texts===

====''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā}}''====
Western scholars have traditionally considered the earliest sūtra in the Prajñāpāramitā class to be the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' or "Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines", which was probably put in writing in the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Mäll, Linnart. ''Studies in the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā and other essays.'' 2005. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This chronology is based on the views of [[Edward Conze]], who largely considered dates of translation into other languages. This text also has a corresponding version in verse format, called the ''{{IAST|Ratnaguṇasaṃcaya Gāthā}}'', which some believe to be slightly older because it is not written in standard literary Sanskrit. However, these findings rely on late-dating Indian texts, in which verses and mantras are often kept in more archaic forms.

Additionally, a number of scholars have proposed that the Mahāyāna Prajñāpāramitā teachings were first developed by the [[Caitika]] subsect of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]s. They believe that the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' originated amongst the southern Mahāsāṃghika schools of the [[Coastal Andhra|Āndhra]] region, along the [[Krishna River|Kṛṣṇa River]].&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. pp. 65-66 "Several scholars have suggested that the Prajnaparamita probably developed among the Mahasamghikas in Southern India, in the Andhra country, on the Krsna River."&lt;/ref&gt; These Mahāsāṃghikas had two famous monasteries near [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amarāvati]] and the [[Dharanikota|Dhānyakataka]], which gave their names to the Pūrvaśaila and Aparaśaila schools.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"/&gt; Each of these schools had a copy of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' in [[Prakrit]].&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' as being that of the Mahāsāṃghikas.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"/&gt; [[Edward Conze]] estimates that this sūtra originated around 100 BCE.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"/&gt;

In 2012, Harry Falk and Seishi Karashima published a damaged and partial [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] manuscript of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā''.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Falk and Seishi Karashima, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225647/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/ARIRIAB/pdf/ARIRIAB-15.pdf A first‐century Prajñāpāramitā manuscript from Gandhāra&amp;nbsp;— parivarta 1 (Texts from the Split Collection 1)]. Annual Report of the International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University XV (2012), 19-61.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to ca. 75 CE, making it one of the oldest Buddhist texts in existence. It is very similar to the first Chinese translation of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] (ca. 179 CE) whose source text is assumed to be in the [[Gāndhārī language]];Lokakṣema's translation is also the first extant translation of the Prajñāpāramitā genre into a non-Indic language. Comparison with the standard Sanskrit text shows that it is also likely to be a translation from Gāndhāri as it expands on many phrases and provides glosses for words that are not present in the Gāndhārī. This points to the text being composed in Gāndhārī, the language of [[Gandhara]] (the region now called the Northwest Frontier of Pakistan, including [[Peshawar]], [[Taxila]] and [[Swat Valley]]). The "Split" manuscript is evidently a copy of an earlier text, confirming that the text may date before the first century of the common era.


====''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā''====
In contrast to western scholarship, Japanese scholars have traditionally considered the ''[[Diamond Sutra|Diamond Sūtra]]'' (''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'') to be from a very early date in the development of Prajñāpāramitā literature.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 1989 p.42"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: the Doctrinal Foundations''. London, UK: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02537-0}}. p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The usual reason for this relative chronology which places the ''Vajracchedikā'' earlier is not its date of translation, but rather a comparison of the contents and themes.&lt;ref&gt;Schopen, Gregory. ''Figments and Fragments of Mahāyāna Buddhism in India.'' 2005. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Some western scholars also believe that the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' was adapted from the earlier ''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra''.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 1989 p.42" /&gt;

Examining the language and phrases used in both the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' and the ''Vajracchedikā'', [[Gregory Schopen]] also sees the ''Vajracchedikā'' as being earlier than the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā''.&lt;ref name="Schopen, Gregory 2005. pp. 31-32"&gt;Schopen, Gregory. ''Figments and Fragments of Mahāyāna Buddhism in India.'' 2005. pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; This view is taken in part by examining parallels between the two works, in which the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' seems to represent the later or more developed position.&lt;ref name="Schopen, Gregory 2005. pp. 31-32"/&gt; According to Schopen, these works also show a shift in emphasis from an oral tradition (''Vajracchedikā'') to a written tradition (''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'').&lt;ref name="Schopen, Gregory 2005. pp. 31-32"/&gt;

===Overview of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras===
[[File:Arapacana manjusri - AP State archaeological museum (1).jpg|thumb|Arapacana manjusri with prajnaparamita in his right hand. Statue belongs to 18 CAD, Tibet. Currently at YSR state archaeological museum|349x349px]]
An Indian commentary on the ''[[Mahāyāna-samgraha|Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]'', entitled ''Vivṛtaguhyārthapiṇḍavyākhyā'', gives a classification of teachings according to the capabilities of the audience:
{{quote|[A]ccording to disciples' grades, the Dharma is [classified as] inferior and superior. For example, the inferior was taught to the merchants [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Trapuṣa and Ballika]] because they were ordinary men; the middle was taught to the group of five because they were at the stage of saints; the eightfold ''Prajñāpāramitās'' were taught to bodhisattvas, and [the ''Prajñāpāramitās''] are superior in eliminating conceptually imagined forms. The eightfold [''Prajñāpāramitās''] are the teachings of the Prajñāpāramitā as follows: the ''Triśatikā'', ''Pañcaśatikā'', ''Saptaśatikā'', ''Sārdhadvisāhasrikā'', ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'', ''Aṣṭadaśasāhasrikā'', ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā'', and ''Śatasāhasrikā''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre. ''Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism.'' 2007. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The titles of these eight Prajñāpāramitā texts are given according to their length. The texts may have other Sanskrit titles as well, or different variations which may be more descriptive. The lengths specified by the titles are given below.

# ''Triśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 300 lines, alternatively known as the ''[[Diamond Sutra|Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]'' (''Diamond Sūtra'')
# ''Pañcaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 500 lines
# ''Saptaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 700 lines, the bodhisattva [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]]'s exposition of Prajñāpāramitā
# ''Sārdhadvisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 2500 lines, from the questions of Suvikrāntavikrāmin Bodhisattva
# ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 8000 lines
# ''Aṣṭadaśasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 18,000 lines
# ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 25,000 lines, alternatively known as the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]''{{citation needed|reason=It is unclear whether the 25,000-line sutra or the 100,000-line sutra is alternatively referred to as the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|date=May 2015}}
# ''Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 100,000 lines, alternatively known as the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]''{{citation needed|reason=It is unclear whether the 25,000-line sutra or the 100,000-line sutra is alternatively referred to as the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|date=May 2015}}

According to Joseph Walser, there is evidence that the ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (25,000 lines) and the ''Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (100,000 lines) have a connection with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect, while the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (8000 lines) does not.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2008. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these, there are also other Prajñāpāramitā sūtras such as the ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' (''Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya''), which exists in a shorter and longer versions. Regarding the shorter texts, Edward Conze writes, "Two of these, the ''Diamond Sūtra'' and the ''Heart Sūtra'' are in a class by themselves and deservedly renowned throughout the world of Northern Buddhism. Both have been translated into many languages and have often been commented upon.".&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. ''The Short Prajñāpāramitā Texts.'' 1973. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the Diamond Sutra to be much earlier than Conze does.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahāyāna Buddhism: the Doctrinal Foundations. London, UK: Routledge. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Jan Nattier argues the Heart Sutra to be an apocryphal text composed in China from extracts of the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā and other texts ca 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Nattier. 1992. The Heart Sūtra : a Chinese apocryphal text? Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies. Vol. 15 (2), p.153-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Red Pine, however, does not support Nattiers argument and believes the Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra to be of Indian origin.&lt;ref&gt;"The Heart Sutra Translation and Commentary", 2004. p.22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tantra|Tāntric]] versions of the Prajñāpāramitā literature were produced from the year 500 CE on and include sutras such as the Adhyardhaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā (150 lines). Additionally, Prajñāpāramitā [[Terma (religion)|terma]] teachings are held by some [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] to have been conferred upon [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] by the [[Nagaraja|Nāgarāja]] "King of the [[Nāga]]s", who had been guarding them at the bottom of the sea.

===Commentaries and translations===
There are various Indian and later Chinese commentaries on the Prajñāpāramitā sutras, some of the most influential commentaries include:

*''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' (大智度論, T no. 1509) a massive and encyclopedic text translated into Chinese by the Buddhist scholar [[Kumarajiva]] (344–413 CE). It is a commentary on the ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā''. This text claims to be from the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] (c. 2nd century) in the [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], but various scholars such as [[Etienne Lamotte]] have questioned this attribution. This work was translated by Lamotte as ''Le Traité de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse'' and into English from the French by Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron.&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte, Etienne; Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron. THE TREATISE ON THE GREAT VIRTUE OF WISDOM OF NĀGĀRJUNA (MAHĀPRAJÑĀPĀRAMITĀŚĀSTRA) VOL. I CHAPTERS I – XV COMPOSED BY THE BODHISATTVE NĀGĀRJUNA AND TRANSLATED BY THE TRIPIṬAKADHARMĀCĀRYA KUMĀRAJIVA OF THE LAND OF KOUTCHA UNDER THE LATER TS’IN&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Abhisamayalamkara|Abhisamayālaṅkāra]]'' (''Ornament of clear realization''), the central ''Prajñāpāramitā'' shastra in the Tibetan tradition. It is traditionally attributed as a revelation from the Bodhisattva [[Maitreya]] to the scholar [[Asanga]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 4th century C.E.), known as a master of the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school. The Indian commentary on this text by [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribadra]], the [[Abhisamayalankaraloka]], has also been influential on later Tibetan texts.
*''Śatasāhasrikā-pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikāṣṭādaśasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā-bṛhaṭṭīkā'', often attributed to [[Vasubandhu]] (4th century).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brunnhölzl "Prajñāpāramitā, Indian “gzhan ston pas“, And the Beginning of Tibetan gzhan stong" (2011) 197p. https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/wstb/wstb.cgi?ID=78&amp;show_description=1&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Satasahasrika-paramita-brhattika'', attributed to [[Damstrásena]].
*[[Dignaga]]'s ''Prajnaparamitarthasamgraha-karika''.
*[[Ratnākaraśānti]]'s ''Prajñāpāramitopadeśa''.

The sutras were first brought to [[Tibet]] in the reign of [[Trisong Detsen]] (742-796) by scholars [[Jinamitra]] and [[Silendrabodhi]] and the translator Yeshe De.&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2011, page 42"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Gone Beyond: The Prajnaparamita Sutras The Ornament Of Clear Realization And Its Commentaries In The Tibetan Kagyu Tradition (Tsadra) 2011, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prajñāpāramitā in Central Asia===
{{see also|Buddhism in Central Asia}}

By the middle of the 3rd century CE, it appears that some Prajñāpāramitā texts were known in [[Central Asia]], as reported by the Chinese monk Zhu Shixing, who brought back a manuscript of the ''Prajñāpāramitā'' of 25,000 lines:&lt;ref&gt;Heirman, Ann. Bumbacher, Stephan Peter. ''The Spread of Buddhism.'' 2007. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When in 260 AD, the Chinese monk Zhu Shixing chose to go to [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] in an attempt to find original Sanskrit ''sūtras'', he succeeded in locating the Sanskrit ''Prajñāpāramitā'' in 25,000 verses, and tried to send it to China. In Khotan, however, there were numerous [[Hinayana|Hīnayānists]] who attempted to prevent it because they regarded the text as [[heterodox]]. Eventually, Zhu Shixing stayed in Khotan, but sent the manuscript to [[Luoyang]] where it was translated by a Khotanese monk named Mokṣala. In 296, the Khotanese monk Gītamitra came to [[Chang'an]] with another copy of the same text.}}

===China===
In China, there was extensive translations of many Prajñāpāramitā texts beginning in the second century CE, main translators include: [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] (支婁迦讖), Zhī Qīan (支謙), [[Dharmarakṣa]] (竺法護), Mokṣala (無叉羅), [[Kumārajīva]] (鳩摩羅什, 408 CE), [[Xuánzàng]] (玄奘), Făxián (法賢) and Dānapāla (施護).&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, M. B.. (2012). Chiasmus in the early Prajñāpāramitā : literary parallelism connecting criticism &amp; hermeneutics in an early Mahāyāna sūtra. (Thesis). Page 41. University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR. Retrieved from https://dx.doi.org/10.5353/th_b4775259&lt;/ref&gt; These translations were very influential in the development of [[East Asian Mādhyamaka]] and on [[Chinese Buddhism]].

[[Xuanzang]] (fl. c. 602–664) was a Chinese scholar who traveled to India and returned to China with three copies of the ''Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' which he had secured from his extensive travels.&lt;ref name="Wriggins, Sally Hovey 2004 p.206"&gt;Wriggins, Sally Hovey (2004). ''The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang''. Boulder, Colorado: WestviewPress. {{ISBN|0-8133-6599-6}}. p.206&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang, with a team of disciple translators, commenced translating the voluminous work in 660 CE using the three versions to ensure the integrity of the source documentation.&lt;ref name="Wriggins, Sally Hovey 2004 p.206"/&gt; Xuanzang was being encouraged by a number of the disciple translators to render an abridged version. After a suite of dreams quickened his decision, Xuanzang determined to render an unabridged, complete volume, faithful to the original of 600 fascicles.&lt;ref&gt;Wriggins, Sally Hovey (2004). ''The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang''. Boulder, Colorado: WestviewPress. {{ISBN|0-8133-6599-6}}. p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also later commentaries from Zen Buddhists on the Heart and Diamond sutra and [[Kūkai]]'s commentary (9th century) is the first known Tantric commentary.

==Themes in Prajñāpāramitā sutras==
===Core themes===
[[Image:Rabjor or Subhuti.jpg|thumb|280x280px|A Tibetan illustration of [[Subhuti]], a major character in the PP sutras who is proclaimed as the foremost “dweller in non-conflict” (''araṇavihārīnaṃ'') and “of those worthy of offering” (''dakkhiṇeyyānaṃ'').]]

====The Bodhisattva and Prajñāpāramitā====
A key theme of the Prajñāpāramitā sutras is the figure of the [[Bodhisattva]] (literally: awakening-being) which is defined in the 8,000 line PP sutra as:

:"One who trains in all dharmas [phenomena] without obstruction [''asakti, asaktatā''], and also knows all dharmas as they really are."&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Bodhisattva is then a being that experiences everything "without attachment" (''asakti'') and sees reality or suchness (''Tathātā'') as it is. The Bodhisattva is the main ideal in [[Mahayana]] (Great Vehicle), which sees the goal of the Buddhist path as becoming a [[Buddha]] for the sake of all sentient beings, not just yourself:

:They make up their minds that ‘one single self we shall tame . . . one single self we shall lead to final Nirvana.’ 
:A Bodhisattva should certainly not in such a way train himself.
:On the contrary, he should train himself thus: ‘My own self I will place in Suchness [the true way of things], and, so that all the world might be helped, 
:I will place all beings into Suchness, and I will lead to Nirvana the whole immeasurable world of beings.’&lt;ref name="huntingtonarchive.org"&gt;Conze, Edward, THE PERFECTION OF WISDOM IN EIGHT THOUSAND LINES &amp; ITS VERSE SUMMARY, http://huntingtonarchive.org/resources/downloads/sutras/02Prajnaparamita/Astasahasrika.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A central quality of the Bodhisattva is their practice of Prajñāpāramitā, a most deep (''gambhīra'') state of knowledge which is an understanding of reality arising from analysis as well as [[meditative]] insight. It is non-conceptual and [[non-dual]] (''advaya'') as well as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, pages 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Literally, the term could be translated as "knowledge gone to the other (shore)",&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 176.&lt;/ref&gt; or transcendental knowledge. The PP sutra in 8000 lines says:

:This is known as the Prajñāpāramitā of the bodhisattvas; not grasping at form, not grasping at sensation, perception, volitions and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further passage in the 8,000 line PP sutra states that Prajñāpāramitā means that a Bodhisattva stands in emptiness ([[shunyata]]) by not standing (''√sthā'') or supporting themselves on any dharma (phenomena), whether conditioned or unconditioned. The dharmas that a Bodhisattva does "not stand" on include standard listings such as: the [[five aggregates]], the sense fields ([[ayatana]]), [[nirvana]], [[Buddhahood]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 149.&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by stating that Bodhisattvas "wander without a home" (''aniketacārī''); "home" or "abode" meaning signs (''nimitta'', meaning a subjective mental impression) of sensory objects and the afflictions that arise dependent on them. This includes the absence, the "not taking up" (''aparigṛhīta'') of even "correct" mental signs and perceptions such as "form is not self", "I practice Prajñāpāramitā", etc. To be freed of all constructions and signs, to be signless (''animitta'') is to be empty of them and this is to stand in Prajñāpāramitā.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 180-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The PP sutras state that all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the past have practiced Prajñāpāramitā. Prajñāpāramitā is also associated with ''Sarvajñata'' (all-knowledge) in the PP sutras, a quality of the mind of a Buddha which knows the nature of all dharmas.

According to Karl Brunnholzl, Prajñāpāramitā means that "all phenomena from form up through omniscience being utterly devoid of any intrinsic characteristics or nature of their own."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Gone Beyond: The Prajnaparamita Sutras The Ornament Of Clear Realization And Its Commentaries In The Tibetan Kagyu Tradition (Tsadra) 2011, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "such omniscient wisdom is always nonconceptual and free from reference points since it is the constant and panoramic awareness of the nature of all phenomena and does not involve any shift between meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Gone Beyond: The Prajnaparamita Sutras The Ornament Of Clear Realization And Its Commentaries In The Tibetan Kagyu Tradition (Tsadra) 2011, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Conze]] outlined several psychological qualities of a Bodhisattva's practice of Prajñāpāramitā:&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward; The Ontology of the Prajnaparamita, Philosophy East and West Vol.3 (1953) PP.117-129, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

*Non-apprehension (''anupalabdhi'')
*No settling down or "non-attachment" (''anabhinivesa'')
*No attainment (''aprapti''). No person can "have," or "possess," or "acquire," or "gain" any dharma.
*Non-reliance on any dharma, being unsupported, not leaning on any dharma.
*"Finally, one may say that the attitude of the perfected sage is one of non-assertion."

====Other Bodhisattva qualities====
The PP sutras also teach of the importance of the other [[paramitas]] (perfections) for the Bodhisattva such as [[Ksanti]] (patience): "Without resort to this patience (kṣānti) they [bodhisattvas] cannot reach their respective goals".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 124.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another quality of the Bodhisattva is their freedom from fear (''na √tras'') in the face of the seemingly shocking doctrine of the emptiness of all dharmas which includes their own existence. A good friend (''kalyanamitra'') is useful in the path to fearlessness. Bodhisattvas also have no pride or self-conception (''na manyeta'') of their own stature as Bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt; These are important features of the mind of a bodhisattva, called [[bodhicitta]]. The PP sutras also mention that bodhicitta is a middle way, it is neither apprehended as existent (''astitā'') or non-existent (''nāstitā'') and it is "immutable" (''avikāra'') and "free from conceptualization" (''avikalpa'').&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bodhisattva is said to generate "great compassion" (''maha-[[karuṇā]]'') for all beings on their path to liberation and yet also maintain a sense of equanimity ([[upekṣā]]) and distance from them through their understanding of emptiness, due to which, the Bodhisattva knows that even after bringing countless beings to nirvana, "no living being whatsoever has been brought to nirvana."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Bodhisattvas]] and [[Mahāsattva]]s are also willing to give up all of their meritorious deeds for sentient beings and develop skillful means ([[upaya]]) in order to help abandon false views and teach them the Dharma. The practice of Prajñāpāramitā allows a Bodhisattva to become: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"a saviour of the helpless, a defender of the defenceless, a refuge to those without refuge, a place to rest to those without resting place, the final relief of those who are without it, an island to those without one, a light to the blind, a guide to the guideless, a resort to those without one and....guide to the path those who have lost it, and you shall become a support to those who are without support."&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tathātā====
[[Image:The Buddha's Descent from Heaven at Samkashya (top; a), The Story of the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita (middle; b), The Buddha Preaching to the Assembled Gods (bottom; c), Three Folios from LACMA M.86.345.11a-c (4 of 4).jpg|thumb|280x280px|Illustration of Bodhisattva ''Sadāprarudita'' (Ever weeping), a character in the 8000 line PP sutra [[Avadana]] section, which is used by the Buddha as an exemplar of those who seek Prajñāpāramitā.]]

''Tathātā'' (Suchness or Thusness) and the related term ''Dharmatā'' (the nature of Dharma), and [[Tathāgata]] are also important terms of the PP texts. To practice Prajñāpāramitā means to practice in accord with 'the nature of Dharma' and to see the Tathāgata (i.e. the Buddha). As the 8000 line PP sutra states, these terms are generally used equivalently: "As the suchness (''tathatā'') of dharmas is immovable (''acalitā''), and the suchness (''tathatā'') of dharmas is the ''Tathāgata''.".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tathāgata is said in the 8000 line PP sutra to "neither come nor go". Furthermore, the 8000 line PP sutra includes a list of synonyms associated with Tathāgata as also being "beyond coming and going", these include: 1. Suchness (''tathatā''); 2. Unarisen (''anutpāda''); 3. Reality limit (''bhūtakoṭi''); 4. Śūnyatā; 5. Division (''yathāvatta''); 6. Detachment (''virāga''); 7. Cessation (''nirodha''); 8. Space element (''ākāśadhātu''). The sutra then states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from these dharmas, there is no Tathāgata. The suchness of these dharmas, and the suchness of the Tathāgatas, is all one single suchness (''ekaivaiṣā tathatā''), not two, not divided (''dvaidhīkāraḥ''). … beyond all classification (''gaṇanāvyativṛttā''), due to non-existence (''asattvāt'').&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Suchness then does not come or go because like the other terms, it is not a real entity (''bhūta'', ''svabhāva''), but merely appears conceptually through [[dependent origination]], like a dream or an illusion. 

[[Edward Conze]] lists six ways in which the ontological status of dharmas is considered by the Prajñāpāramitā:&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward; The Ontology of the Prajnaparamita, Philosophy East and West Vol.3 (1953) PP.117-129, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

#Dharmas are non-existent because they have no own-being ([[svabhava]]).
#Dharmas have a purely nominal existence. They are mere words, a matter of conventional expression.
#Dharmas are "without marks, with one mark only, ie., with no mark." A mark (''laksana'') being a distinctive property which separates it from other dharmas.
#Dharmas are isolated (''vivikta''), absolutely isolated (''atyantavivikta'').
#Dharmas have never been produced, never come into existence; they are not really ever brought forth, they are unborn (''ajata'').
#Non-production is illustrated by a number of similes, i.e., dreams, magical illusions, echoes, reflected images, mirages, and space.

It is through seeing this Tathātā that one is said to have a vision of the Buddha (the Tathāgata), seeing this is called seeing the Buddha's [[Dharmakaya]] (Dharma body) which is a not his physical body, but none other than the true nature of dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Negation and Emptiness====
Most modern Buddhist scholars such as [[Etienne Lamotte|Lamotte]], Conze and [[Yin Shun]] have seen [[Śūnyatā]] (emptiness, voidness, hollowness) as ''the'' central theme of the PP sutras.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now the principal teaching of Prajñāpāramitā with regard to own-being that it is "empty." The Sanskrit term is ''svabhāva-śūnya''. This is a ''[[tatpuruṣa]]'' compound (one in which the last member is qualified by the first without losing its grammatical independence), in which [[svabhava]] may have the sense of any oblique case. The [[Mahayana]] understands it to mean that dharmas are empty of any own-being, i.e.,that they are not ultimate facts in their own right, but merely imagined and falsely discriminated, for each and every one of them is dependent on something other than itself. From a slightly different angle this means that dharmas, when viewed with perfected [[gnosis]], reveal an own-being which is identical with emptiness, i.e in their own-being they are empty.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward; The Ontology of the Prajnaparamita, Philosophy East and West Vol.3 (1953) PP.117-129, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The PP sutras commonly use [[apophasis|apophatic]] statements to express the nature of reality as seen by Prajñāpāramitā. A common trope in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras is the negation of a previous statement in the form 'A is not A, therefore it is A', or more often negating only a part of the statement as in, “XY is a Y-less XY”.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, M. B.. (2012). Chiasmus in the early Prajñāpāramitā : literary parallelism connecting criticism &amp; hermeneutics in an early Mahāyāna sūtra. (Thesis). Page 171. University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR. Retrieved from https://dx.doi.org/10.5353/th_b4775259&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese Buddhologist, Hajime Nakamura, calls this negation the 'logic of not' (''na prthak'').&lt;ref&gt;Nagatomo, Shigenori (2000). The Logic of the Diamond Sutra: A is not A, therefore it is A; Asian Philosophy 10 (3), 217–244&lt;/ref&gt; An example from the [[Diamond sutra]] of this use of negation is:

:As far as ‘all dharmas’ are concerned, Subhuti, all of them are dharma-less. That is why they are called ‘all dharmas.’&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Harrison, Paul. Vajracchedika Prajñaparamita Diamond Cutting Transcendent Wisdom&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale behind this form is the juxtaposition of conventional truth with ultimate truth as taught in the Buddhist [[two truths doctrine]]. The negation of conventional truth is supposed to expound the ultimate truth of the emptiness ([[Śūnyatā]]) of all reality - the idea that nothing has an ontological essence and all things are merely conceptual, without substance. 

The PP sutras state that dharmas should not be conceptualized either as existent, nor as non existent, and use negation to highlight this: "in the way in which dharmas exist (''saṃvidyante''), just so do they not exist (''asaṃvidyante'')".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Māya====
{{Main article|Maya_(religion)#Buddhism}}
The PP sutras commonly state that all dharmas (phenomena), are in some way like an [[illusion]] (''[[Maya_(religion)#Buddhism|māya]]''), like a [[dream]] (''svapna'') and like a [[mirage]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, pages 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' states: 

:"A shooting star, a clouding of the sight, a lamp, An illusion, a drop of dew, a bubble, A dream, a lightning’s flash, a thunder cloud— This is the way one should see the conditioned."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Paul (trans.) Vajracchedika Prajñaparamita Diamond Cutting Transcendent Wisdom, https://hyanniszendo.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/diamondsutra_lettersize1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the highest Buddhist goals like [[Buddhahood]] and [[Nirvana]] are to be seen in this way, thus the highest wisdom or prajña is a type of spiritual knowledge which sees all things as illusory. As Subhuti in the 8000 line PP sutra states:

:"Even if perchance there could be anything more distinguished, of that also I would say that it is like an illusion, like a dream. For not two different things are illusions and Nirvāṇa, are dreams and Nirvāṇa."&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

This is connected to the impermanence and insubstantial nature of dharmas. The PP sutras give the simile of a magician (''māyākāra'': 'illusion-maker') who, when seemingly killing his illusory persons by cutting off their heads, really kills nobody and compare it to the bringing of beings to awakening (by 'cutting off' the conceptualization of self view; Skt: ''ātmadṛṣṭi chindati'') and the fact that this is also ultimately like an illusion, because their aggregates "are neither bound nor released".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The illusion then, is the conceptualization and mental fabrication of dharmas as existing or not existing, as arising or not arising. Prajñāpāramitā sees through this illusion, being empty of concepts and fabrications. 

Perceiving dharmas and beings like an illusion (''māyādharmatām'') is termed the "great armor" (''mahāsaṃnaha'') of the Bodhisattva, who is also termed the 'illusory man' (''māyāpuruṣa'').&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 165-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later additions===
According to Paul Williams, another major theme of the PP sutras is "the phenomenon of laudatory self reference – the lengthy praise of the sutra itself, the immense merits to be obtained from treating even a verse of it with reverence, and the nasty penalties which will accrue in accordance with [[karma]] to those who denigrate the scripture."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edward Conze]], the PP sutras added much new doctrinal material in the later layers and the larger texts. Conze lists the later accretions as:&lt;ref name="huntingtonarchive.org"/&gt;

#Increasing sectarianism, with all the rancor, invective and polemics that that implies
#Increasing scholasticism and the insertion of longer and longer Abhidharma lists
#Growing stress on skill in means, and on its subsidiaries such as the Bodhisattva’s Vow and the four means of conversion, and its logical sequences, such as the distinction between provisional and ultimate truth
#A growing concern with the Buddhist of faith, with its celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattva and their Buddha-fields;
#A tendency towards verbosity, repetitiveness and overelaboration
#Lamentations over the decline of the Dharma
#Expositions of the hidden meaning which become the more frequent the more the original meaning becomes obscured
#Any reference to the Dharma body of the Buddha as anything different from a term for the collection of his teachings
#A more and more detailed doctrine of the graded stages (bhumi) of a Bodhisattva’s career.

==Prajñāpāramitā in visual art==
The Prajnaparamita is often personified as a ''bodhisattvadevi'' (female bodhisattva). Artifacts from [[Nalanda]] depict the Prajnaparamita personified as a deity. The depiction of Prajnaparamita as a Yidam deity can also be found in ancient Java and Cambodian art.

===Prajñāpāramitā in Ancient Indonesia===
[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Front.JPG|thumb|Prajñāpāramitā statue from East Java, Indonesia.|551x551px]]
{{main article|Prajnaparamita of Java}}
[[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] took root in ancient [[Java]] [[Sailendra]] court in the 8th century CE. The Mahayana reverence of female buddhist deity started with the cult of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] enshrined in the 8th century [[Kalasan]] temple in Central Java. Some of Prajnaparamita's important functions and attributes can be traced to those of the goddess Tara. Tara and Prajnaparamita are both referred to as mothers of all Buddhas, since Buddhas are born from wisdom. The Sailendra dynasty was also the ruling family of [[Srivijaya]] in Sumatra. During the reign of the third Pala king Devapala (815-854) in India, Srivijaya Maharaja [[Balaputra]] of Sailendras also constructed one of Nalanda’s main monasteries in India itself. Thereafter manuscript editions of the ''Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra'' circulating in Sumatra and Java instigated the cult of the Goddess of Transcendent Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianartnewspaper.com/article/early-buddhist-manuscript-painting%3A-the-palm-leaf-tradition Asian Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312213139/http://www.asianartnewspaper.com/article/early-buddhist-manuscript-painting%3A-the-palm-leaf-tradition |date=March 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, the tantric buddhism gained royal patronage of king [[Kertanegara of Singhasari]], and thereafter some of Prajnaparamita statues were produced in the region, such as the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari in East Java and Prajnaparamita of [[Muaro Jambi Regency]], [[Sumatra]]. Both of East Java and Jambi Prajnaparamitas bear resemblance in style as they were produced in same period, however unfortunately Prajnaparamita of Jambi is headless and was discovered in poor condition.

The statue of Prajnaparamita of East Java is probably the most famous depiction of the goddess of transcendental wisdom, and is considered the masterpiece of classical ancient Java Hindu-Buddhist art in Indonesia. It was discovered in the Cungkup Putri ruins near Singhasari temple, [[Malang]], [[East Java]]. Today the beautiful and serene statue is displayed on 2nd floor Gedung Arca, [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].

'''Racial tension in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]''', occurred mostly because of the city's volatile mixture of high numbers of new [[immigrants]] from southern and eastern Europe and African-American migrants from the [[Deep South]]. While racial discrimination existed at several levels, the violent outbreaks were within working classes. [[Irish in Omaha, Nebraska|Irish Americans]], the largest and earliest immigrant group in the 19th century, established the first neighborhoods in South Omaha.  All were attracted by new industrial jobs and most were from rural areas. There was competition among ethnic Irish, newer [[Ethnic groups in Omaha, Nebraska|European immigrants]], and African-American migrants from the South, for industrial jobs and housing. They all had difficulty adjusting to industrial demands, which were unmitigated by organized labor in the early years.  Some of the early labor organizing resulted in increasing tensions between groups, as later arrivals to the city were used as strikebreakers.

In Omaha as in other major cities, racial tension has erupted at times of social and economic strife, often taking the form of mob violence as different groups tried to assert power.  Much of the early violence came out of labor struggles in early 20th century industries: between working class ethnic whites and immigrants, and blacks of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].  Meatpacking companies had used the latter for strikebreakers in 1917 as workers were trying to organize.  As veterans returned from World War I, both groups competed for jobs. By the late 1930s, however, interracial teams worked together to organize the meatpacking industry under the [[United Packinghouse Workers of America]] (UPWA).  Unlike the AFL and some other industrial unions in the CIO, UPWA was progressive.  It used its power to help end [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in restaurants and stores in Omaha, and supported the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s. Women labor organizers such as [[Tillie Olsen]] and [[Rowena Moore]] were active in the meatpacking industry in the 1930s and 1940s, respectively.

Most violence and civil unrest in the 1960s, by contrast, arose out of poverty and problems caused by massive loss of working-class jobs through industrial restructuring.  The city's African-American community suffered particularly and erupted in protest.

==19th century==
The [[Nebraska Territory]] was created in 1854 with the condition that the area stay slave-free. But, from 1855 on, there was debate in the [[Nebraska State Legislature|Territorial Legislature]] about whether slavery should specifically be prohibited. As there were few slaves in the state, some legislators did not think the bill was needed.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D. (2002) ''A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha.'' Caxton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, the ''Daily Nebraskian'' newspaper reported its favoring of [[slavery]], writing,

:The bill introduced in [Omaha City] Council, for the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in this Territory, was called up yesterday, and its further consideration postponed for two weeks. A strong effort will be made among the Republicans to secure its passage; we think, however, it will fail. The farce certainly cannot be enacted if the Democrats do their duty.&lt;ref&gt;A ''Daily Nebraskian'' newspaper editorial from 1859, as quoted in Bristow, D. (2002) ''A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha.'' Caxton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

During that period, some local newspapers openly editorialized against the presence of blacks in Omaha, for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and against the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;Several sources in Bristow, D. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1860 census showed that of the 81 Negroes in Nebraska, only 10 were slaves.&lt;ref&gt;(1938) [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/wpa:@field(DOCID+@lit(wpa116041210+)) Authur Goodlett]. ''American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1940''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a clause in the original proposed [[Nebraska Territory#History|Nebraska State Constitution]] limited [[voting rights]] in the state to "free white males", as had been common in many states, Nebraska was delayed about a year from entering the Union. In 1865, the Nebraska Territorial Legislature changed the proposed State Constitution to provide expanded suffrage.  The territory gained statehood soon after.

Following the Civil War, enough blacks lived in Omaha to organize [[St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church (Omaha, Nebraska)|St. John's African Methodist Episcopal Church]] in 1867 as the first church for African Americans in Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;(2003) [http://www.memoriallibrary.com/NE/Ethnic/Negro/church.htm The Negroes of Nebraska: The Negro goes to church.] Memorial Library.&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded birth of an African American was that of William Leper, recorded in Omaha in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;(1895) "Negroes in Omaha," ''Omaha Progress'' February 21, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891 a mob [[lynched]] [[Joe Coe|George Smith]], an [[African American]] man, for allegedly [[raping]] a "white" woman. No one was charged in his murder.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Omaha Riot Will Brown.jpg|thumb|200px|1919 [[lynching]] victim [[Omaha Race Riot of 1919|Will Brown]].]] --&gt;
In the early 20th century, social tensions of the rapidly industrializing city absorbing waves of new immigrants and migrants broke out in riots between ethnic minorities.  The riots included extensive property damage and some deaths.

=== South Omaha ===
{{main|South Omaha}}

South Omaha was where many different immigrant groups established their own neighborhoods.  These ranged from Sheelytown for ethnic [[Irish American|Irish]] to Polish and Czech. [[Little Italy, Omaha|Little Italy]] and [[Little Bohemia (Omaha, Nebraska)|Little Bohemia]] closely bordered South Omaha at its north boundary as well.  The immigrants comprised most of the workers at the stockyards and meatpacking plants, also located there.  They started organizing different laborers and stopped work with strikes. The industry responded by hiring workers from other parts of the country who were also seeking work: both European immigrants and black migrants from the South (whose numbers doubled in Omaha from 1910 to 1920).  In 1905, more than 800 students (mostly children of immigrant workers) in South Omaha protested the presence of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] students at their school, calling them "scabs". The Japanese students were children of [[strikebreaker]]s brought in by the [[Omaha Stockyards]] the previous summer during a fierce strike. Children of the regular workers refused to attend classes and locked teachers out of the building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/04/18/101412042.pdf "Revolt over Japanese; South Omaha School Children Want Them Expelled"], ''The New York Times.'' April 18, 1905. Retrieved 4/20/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek Town Riot ===
{{main|Greek Town Riot}}

[[Greeks in Omaha, Nebraska#Greek Town|Greek Town]] was a growing [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrant community in [[South Omaha]]. Other immigrants resented the Greeks, who had come to the city as [[strikebreaker]]s.  Many men of the community had been jobless for an extensive period after they were [[lay off|laid off]] following the strikes.  Some Omaha citizens assumed they were lazy rather than unemployed. In September 1909 a male resident of the Greek community was arrested by an ethnic Irish South Omaha policeman for allegedly having a relationship with a "white" woman. (He was taking English lessons from her.) The man took the officer's gun and shot him.  After the Greek was captured a short while later, a mob of ethnic whites numbering about 1,000 arrived at the door of the jail.  By then the South Omaha policemen had transferred the man to the Omaha city jail. (The jurisdictions were then separate.)  Frustrated, the mob turned to the Greek neighborhood and began to destroy it, threatening all of its residents with death if they stayed in town. Within a day the Greek residents abandoned the six-by-six block area and scattered into cities across the Midwest. Meanwhile, the mob destroyed the entire neighborhood.  The accused Greek immigrant was brought to trial; but, after intervention from the Greek ambassador to the U.S., who protested the government's failure to protect the immigrant community, the city of Omaha released the man and dropped charges against him.

=== Anti-German sentiments ===
{{main|Germans in Omaha, Nebraska}}

In the immediate years after [[World War I]] and defeat of Germany by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], anti-German sentiment ran high across the country. The Nebraska legislature passed a law in 1919 that enforced teaching in English in public schools. (Because of substantial immigration by Germans to Nebraska, in earlier years, studies in German were available in the public schools, along with French and classical languages.)  By law, "No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language than the English language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/Meyer%20v%20Nebraska%20(1923).html "U.S. Supreme Court: MEYER v. STATE OF NEBRASKA, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)"]. University of Kansas City. Retrieved 9/3/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Meyer was found to violate this law because he taught German.  He was taken to court by the State of Nebraska, and when found guilty he appealed. Although his appeal to the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] failed, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' determined that Meyer had the right to teach the German language as a subject, and to teach it in German. During the course of the year, open [[discrimination]] against Germans throughout Omaha was taking hold. Many German-language newspapers were forced to change to English, or to close.&lt;ref&gt;Folsom, B.W. (1999) ''No More Free Markets Or Free Beer: The Progressive Era in Nebraska, 1900-1924''. Lexington Books. p 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Red Summer ===
{{main|Omaha Race Riot of 1919}}
{{further|Red Summer}}

In September 1919, following a summer of racial riots in several other industrial cities, an African-American laborer named [[Willy Brown]] was lynched in Omaha.  He had been accused of raping a young white woman.  A mob of 5,000 ethnic white men marched from South Omaha (some young men were classmates of the woman) and appeared at the [[Douglas County Courthouse (Omaha)|Douglas County Courthouse]] to demand "justice". Within hours the mob grew to 10,000 people. Many were drinking. When the reform mayor [[Edward P. Smith]] attempted to intervene, he was nearly lynched by the mob.  Only a last-minute rescue saved him from being hanged.  The mob threw stones at windows, far outnumbered the police, and set the courthouse on fire to force the release of Brown.  The police turned him over to save other prisoners.  In a frenzy, the mob hung Brown from a lamppost and shot him, later dragged his body and burned it. The mob turned against police vehicles and attacked any blacks they found in the street.  They began to move toward a large [[Near North Side (Omaha, Nebraska)|African-American enclave]] in North Omaha.  The city and governor had called in the U.S. Army from [[Fort Omaha]] to intervene.  It stationed troops in North Omaha to protect the blacks, and after gaining control of the mob, in South Omaha to prevent any more riots forming.  An unseasonal rainstorm cooled the mob down as well. The Army commander established [[martial law]] for several days.  A grand jury's investigation identified the mob as arising from South Omaha and being encouraged by the city's vice world. No one was charged in the events, however.

=== Anti-Black racism ===

On July 4, 1910 African American boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] won a major upset at a national match in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Upon hearing the news, a dozen fights broke out in different areas of the city between whites and blacks, as happened in other cities.  Whites wounded several black men and killed one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/07/05/105082296.pdf "Omaha negro killed"], ''The New York Times.'' July 5, 1910. Retrieved 4/20/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], white veterans trying to return to their civilian jobs found African-American and Eastern European immigrants in their former positions. Their resentment led to several violent strikes in the [[South Omaha]] [[meat packing]] industry as groups tried to control access to jobs. During this period, Earl Little was a Baptist minister in North Omaha. After his son, Malcolm, was born in Omaha in 1925, the family moved away because of threats by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in 1926. (The KKK had undergone a revival and growth in the Midwest in the early 1920s.)  Malcolm Little later changed his last name to X, when he joined the [[Nation of Islam|Black Muslims]], where he became an important leader known as [[Malcolm X]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm X. (1973) ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X.'' Penguin Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, [[racial segregation]] became normalized in Omaha as [[redlining]] and [[restrictive covenants]] kept African Americans concentrated in housing in [[North Omaha]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Street of Dreams'' Nebraska Public Television.&lt;/ref&gt;  The riot had discredited the city's newly elected reformist government.  In the next election, "Cowboy" [[Jim Dahlman]] was returned to office with the support of Tom Dennison, the informal leader of the vice world.  The labor struggles and social struggles led Omaha's African-American leaders, such as Earl Little, [[Harry Haywood]] and [[George Wells Parker]], to push harder for civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P. (2002) ''American Road: The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the Motor Age.'' Henry Holt and Co. P 107.&lt;/ref&gt; After this period, African Americans in Omaha were largely concentrated as residents on the city's north side, with a small community in South Omaha.

== Civil-rights-movement era ==
{{main|Civil rights movement in Omaha, Nebraska}}

In 1947 a student-led civil-rights group called the [[DePorres Club]] was forced off the [[Creighton University]] campus, where they started.  [[Mildred Brown]], a community activist and publisher, invited them to meet at the ''Omaha Star'', the paper she directed for the African-American community for decades.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.)[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/stories/0801_0400.html Mildred Brown] ''Nebraska Studies.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Omaha jazz legend [[Preston Love]] reported that in the 1950s he saw signs in Omaha restaurants and bars that said, "We Don't Serve Any Colored Race", but that he was always welcome as a musician.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D. (n.d.) [http://www.nebraskalife.com/PrestonLove.asp Swingin' with Preston Love] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216015157/http://www.nebraskalife.com/PrestonLove.asp |date=2007-02-16 }}. ''Nebraska Life.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the United Meatpacking Workers of America (UPWA) helped use their power to have businesses in Omaha integrate their facilities.

The late 1950s and early 1960s was the period which [[Lois Mark Stalvey]] wrote about in ''The Education of a WASP''.  She recounted her [[activist]] efforts to desegregate a middle-class [[West Omaha]] neighborhood for an African-American surgeon and his family who wanted to live in the area.  Such efforts took place in a different environment from the struggles of most working-class families in North and South Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisc.edu/wisconsinpress/books/0410.htm Lois Mark Stalvey, ''Three to Get Ready: The Education of a White Family in Inner City Schools''], University of Wisconsin Press. Retrieved 9/21/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the [[State of Nebraska]] took Omaha's main amusement park, [[Peony Park]], to district court. The state believed that the park, founded in 1919, violated Nebraska Civil Rights Law when [[African American]] swimmers at the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] Swimming Meet held at the park on August 27, 1955 were discriminated against. In ''State of Nebraska v. Peony Park'', the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] found that two African-American participants were illegally barred from the meet because Peony Park barred them from the pool. On September 7, 1955, the court fined Peony Park $50 and costs of the trial. Additional civil suits were settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/meiklejohn/meik-1_2/meik-1_2-3.html Civil Liberties Docket]. Vol. I, No. 2. December, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Omaha Star]]'' newspaper reported extensively on the trial, using the opportunity to highlight segregationist policies around the city as well as the city's burgeoning civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;Suggs, H.L. (1996) ''The Black Press in the Middle West, 1865-1985.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1960s, economic progress by many African Americans and ethnic Americans became unraveled in the massive job losses caused by restructuring of railroad and meatpacking industries. By the mid-1960s, [[North Omaha]] had much more poverty than before and increasing social problems. On July 4, 1966, tensions broke out in a riot after a day of blistering 103 degree weather.  Refusing a police order to disperse, African Americans demolished police cars and attacked the North 24th Street business corridor, throwing firebombs and demolishing storefronts.  Businesses in the Near North Side suffered millions of dollars in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Luebtke, F.C. (2005) ''Nebraska: An Illustrated History'', University of Nebraska Press. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; The riot lasted three days.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, B.J. (2004) ''Resolving Racial Conflict: The Community Relations Service and Civil Rights.''

[http://www.blackfacts.com/fact.asp?ID=567 National Guard Mobilized in North Omaha]. ''Black Facts Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a month later, on August 1, 1966, riots erupted after a 19-year-old was shot by a white off-duty policeman during a burglary. rioters firebombed three buildings and 180 [[riot police]] were required to quell the crowds.  Leaders in the community criticized the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' and local television stations for blaming African Americans for the conditions they faced in their deteriorating neighborhoods, when the problems of joblessness and decreased maintenance were beyond city and regional control.&lt;ref name="Olson, J.C 1997 p 371"&gt;Olson, J.C. and Naugle, R.C. (1997) ''History of Nebraska.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 371.&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, 1966, ''[[A Time for Burning]]'', a documentary featuring North Omaha and the social problems, was filmed. Later it was nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for best documentary.

In March 1968 a crowd of high school and university students gathered at the [[Omaha Civic Auditorium]] to protest the presidential campaign of [[George Wallace]], the segregationist governor of [[Alabama]].  After counter-protesters began acting violently toward the [[youth activism|activists]], [[police brutality]] led to dozens of protesters being injured. During the melee, an African-American youth was shot and killed by a police officer.  Students' fleeing the outbreak attacked businesses and cars, causing thousands of dollars of damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.creighton.edu/031904/cu125.html "Peaceful protest turns violent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920023017/http://press.creighton.edu/031904/cu125.html |date=2008-09-20 }}, ''The Creightonian Online.'' Retrieved 4/16/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day a local barber named [[Ernie Chambers]] helped calm a disturbance and prevent a riot by students at Horace Mann Junior High School. Chambers was already recognized as a community leader.  After finishing his law degree, Chambers was elected to the [[Nebraska State Legislature]].  He went on to serve a total of 38 years, longer than any of his predecessors.&lt;ref name="Olson, J.C 1997 p 371"/&gt; [[Robert Kennedy]] visited Omaha later that year in his quest to become president, speaking in support of Omaha's civil rights activists.

An African-American teenager named Vivian Strong was shot and killed by police officers in an incident at the [[Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects]] in June 1969. Young African Americans in the area rioted after the teenager's death, and looted along the North 24th Street business corridor. Eight businesses were destroyed by firebombing or looting.&lt;ref&gt;Luebtke, F.C. (2005) ''Nebraska: An Illustrated History.

In 1970 an African-American man named Duane Peak was arrested, and quickly implicated six others in a bombing at a vacant house in North Omaha that killed a police officer. On August 31, local [[Black Panther Party]] leaders David Rice and Ed Poindexter were arrested in the case, despite not having been originally implicated. In 1971 both men were convicted of murder in the controversial [[Rice/Poindexter Case]], and in 1974 a retrial of Rice and Poindexter was denied by the Nebraska State Supreme Court.

=== Late 20th century ===

The 1970s construction of the [[North Freeway (Omaha, Nebraska)|North Freeway]] bisected North Omaha, effectively cutting the African-American community in half and creating social problems. In 1976, the [[Omaha Public Schools]] began court-ordered busing to achieve integration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''1954-1979''. Omaha World Herald (Nebraska) June 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 arsonists burned an [[East Omaha]] duplex after an African-American family signed a [[rental agreement]] there. The arson is unsolved.&lt;ref name="Burbach, C 2007"&gt;Burbach, C. "Robbery, fire evoke memories of neighborhood's racist past," ''Omaha World Herald.'' February 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the Nebraska Parole Board voted for the first time to unanimously commute the sentences of Rice and Poindexter to [[time served]]. The Nebraska Board of Pardons refused to schedule a hearing in the matter. This same sequence of events has occurred no fewer than three times since then, with the same outcome each time.

In 1995 an African-American gang member murdered an Omaha police officer named Jimmy Wilson, Jr. The city responded by equipping every police car with a camera and giving North Omaha officers body armor. Later that year arsonists tipped over and burned an African-American woman's car in [[East Omaha]] near the site of the 1981 arson. Both cases are unsolved.&lt;ref name="Burbach, C 2007"/&gt;

In 1996 the Omaha public schools ended court-ordered busing.&lt;ref&gt;''Omaha World Herald'', June 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the ''Omaha World-Herald'' reported that, "One resident of Rose Garden Estates near 172nd and Pacific Streets said privately, for instance, that he finds the prospect of being incorporated into the city 'increasingly scary.' 'I left [[Benson, Nebraska|Benson]] because I didn't like the changes,' he said. 'Too much crime, too much racial tension, too much school busing. I went to the suburbs to get away from that, and now I'm being forced back in.' The man, an insurance company employee, denied that his problems were based on race, but he asked that this part of the interview be anonymous."&lt;ref&gt;Freed, K. "The Lure of the Suburbs: Do City Problems Grow With Growth?" ''Omaha World Herald.'' August 7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, an African-American [[Gulf War]] veteran named Marvin Ammons was shot and killed by an Omaha police officer. A [[grand jury]] indicted the officer for [[manslaughter]]; the indictment was quashed due to a finding of [[jury misconduct]]. A second grand jury cleared the officer of wrongdoing and admonished the [[Omaha Police Department|Omaha police department]] for mishandling the case.

In 2000, George Bibbins, an African American, led Omaha police on a high-speed car chase. At the end of the chase, he was shot and killed by officers. A grand jury later cleared the officers involved of any wrongdoing.

That year the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] enacted [[term limit]]s. Some believed this action was directed against the long-time State Senator Ernie Chambers, an African American who had then served 27 years.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (Apr 25, 2005). For the Record. ''Lincoln Journal Star.'' Retrieved on 24 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Chambers became the longest-serving State Senator in Nebraska history, with more than 32 years of service. Because of the 2002 law, he was not allowed to run for office again once his term expired in 2008.

[[Desegregation busing]] and [[racial integration]] in public schools were contentious issues in Omaha.  Problems with public schools were a factor in middle-class people moving to the suburbs, but the shift in population to suburbs also followed the growth of the city and highways.  Omahans' preference for larger, newer housing was just like that of other Americans.  Middle-class African Americans have also moved to the suburbs here and in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;''"One resident of Rose Garden Estates near 172nd and Pacific Streets said privately, for instance, that he finds the prospect of being incorporated into the city "increasingly scary." "I left Benson because I didn't like the changes," he said. "Too much crime, too much racial tension, too much school busing. I went to the suburbs to get away from that, and now I'm being forced back in." The man, an insurance company employee, denied that his problems were based on race, but he asked that this part of the interview be anonymous'' (Freed, Kenneth. "The Lure of the Suburbs Do City Problems Grow With Growth?" ''Omaha World Herald (August 7, 1996)).'' This article noted other similar instances.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schooling ===

From 1976 to 1999, Omaha had a [[integrated busing|busing]] plan as an effort to integrate the schools.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Busing was an early goal of civil rights leaders and groups in Omaha, including 4CL, who lauded integrated busing as a particularly important step in improving race relations.&lt;ref&gt;''A Street of Dreams.''&lt;/ref&gt;  When the city considered ending busing in the 1990s, Concerned and Caring Educators, a 100-member group of black education administrators and supervisors, praised the system as having improved race relations and the education of Omaha's students.&lt;ref&gt;Ngyren, J. "Black Group: Ending Busing A Step Back", ''Omaha World Herald'', March 14, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Omaha Public Schools]] ended busing to achieve integration in 1999.  It responded to parental desires for neighborhood schools and for choice.  It has created magnet schools to attract students from middle-class families.  As in many other cities, concerns about schools are high.  Like some other districts such as [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Omaha has begun to explore socioeconomic integration - assigning students according to family income - to change the makeup of their schools and address low test scores among poor children in the inner city. There have been delays in efforts to unite the Omaha public school district with newly annexed smaller, local districts in the western half of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, J. "[http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_pg=1640&amp;u_sid=2056237 Dream of integrated schools fading,] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070927223938/http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_pg=1640&amp;u_sid=2056237 |date=2007-09-27 }} ''Omaha World-Herald.''

==21st century==
Senator Ernie Chambers proposed a controversial school separation plan for Omaha in the Nebraska State Legislature in response to concerns by suburban districts outside Omaha boundaries. The state legislature was interested in seeking a way to use suburban districts to help integrate the city's schools.  "The law, intended to resolve a boundary dispute between the Omaha schools and largely white suburban districts, created a learning community of area school districts that would operate with a common tax levy and required them to draw up an integration plan for metropolitan Omaha."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dillon |first=Sam |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=Law to Segregate Omaha Schools Divides Nebraska |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/15/us/15omaha.html?ex=1302753600&amp;en=613ee46cacb5fefa&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |date=April 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chambers lobbied to create three districts in the city, with each drawn along geographic boundaries that loosely correlated to the racial segregation of the city: African Americans in [[North Omaha]], Hispanic/Latinos in [[South Omaha]], and Caucasians in West Omaha.  Chambers defended his decision from the standpoint that much of the city had [[residential segregation]] and that his plan would provide African American parents in North Omaha with more control over their district.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Michaela. ''Chambers up close A Q&amp;A with the senator, whose OPS views are rooted in his youth''. Omaha World Herald (April 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The State Legislature signed [[Omaha Public Schools#Split the District|this plan]] into law in April, 2006, with the plan going into effect in 2008.

Within a month of the legislature's passing the law, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] brought a [[lawsuit]], arguing that due to Omaha's racially segregated residential patterns, subdivided school districts will also be racially segregated, contrary to [[United States]] [[Brown v. Board of Education|law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sam Dillon | title=Schools Plan in Nebraska Is Challenged | publisher=New York Times | date=May 17, 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/us/17naacp.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has also drawn national attention.  Critics regard the plan as "state-sponsored segregation".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In February 2007, unknown assailants robbed, [[Small incendiary device|firebomb]]ed, and [[spray paint]]ed a [[List of ethnic slurs|racist epithet]] on the side of an East Omaha grocery store owned by an [[Ethiopia]]n [[immigrant]]. That crime is unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;Burbach, C. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' noted recent census statistics showed that Omaha, the 43rd largest city in the United States, has the fifth highest poverty rate for African Americans among the 100 largest cities. More than one in three live below the poverty line.  The city has plans for public-private development in North Omaha that are intended to revive the area.  Investment in infrastructure, parks and street design has already begun.&lt;ref&gt;Kotock, C.D. (2007) [http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&amp;u_sid=10148991 "Big plans in store for north Omaha"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120912023017/http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&amp;u_sid=10148991 |date=2012-09-12 }}, ''Omaha World-Herald'', October 3, 2007. Retrieved 10/4/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups have tried to manufacture political power out of immigration issues, but more people in the city and community have rallied in support of the Hispanic community, who comprise the most numerous recent immigrants.  In 2007 a [[neo-Nazi]] group tried to organize a protest and had 65 participants outside the city's [[Mexicans in Omaha, Nebraska|Mexican]] consulate.  They were far outnumbered by the thousands in counter-protests, as well as those celebrating at events marking the diversity of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, R. and Cole, K.

A '''recycling bin''' (or '''recycle bin''') is a container used to hold recyclables before they are taken to [[Materials recovery facility|recycling center]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ECYCLER|url=http://ecycler.com/recycle-bin|work=sustainability|accessdate=23 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815113155/http://ecycler.com/recycle-bin|archivedate=15 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling bins exist in various sizes for use inside and outside [[home]]s, [[office]]s, and large public facilities. Separate containers are often provided for [[paper]], [[tin]] or [[aluminum]] [[Tin can|cans]], and [[glass]] or [[plastic bottle]]s, or may be commingled.

Many recycling bins are designed to be easily recognizable, and are marked with slogans promoting recycling on a blue or green background along with the universal [[recycling]] symbol. Others are intentionally unobtrusive. Bins are sometimes in different colors so that user may differentiate between the types of materials to be placed in them. While there is no universal standard, the color blue is commonly used to indicate a bin is for recycling in public settings.

Recycling bins or cans, or carts are a common element of municipal [[kerbside collection]] programs, which frequently distribute the bins to encourage participation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9881">'''Religious views on the self''' vary widely. The self is a complex and core subject in many forms of [[spirituality]]. In Western [[psychology]], the concept of self comes from [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], and [[Carl Rogers]] where the self is the [[inner critic]]. Two types of self are commonly considered - the self that is the ego, also called the learned, superficial self of mind and body, "[[false self]]", an egoic creation, and the Self which is sometimes called the "[[true self]]", the "Observing Self", or the "Witness".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Manly P. ''Self Unfoldment by Disciplines of Realization''. Los Angeles, California: The Philosophical Research Society, Inc. 1942. page 115 "On rare occasions we glimpse for an instant the tremendous implication of the Self, and we become aware that the personality is indeed merely a shadow of the real."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Eastern philosophies]] reject the self as a [[delusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Conceptions_of_the_Self_in_Western_and_Eastern_Psychology|title=Conceptions of the Self in Western and Eastern Psychology|publisher=Chinese Buddhist Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhism and psychology|Buddhist psychology]], the [[Raga (Buddhism)|attachment]] to [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] is an illusion that serves as the main cause of [[Dukkha|suffering]] and unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerr.com/galin/papers/roots.htm|title=The concept "self" and "person" in buddhism and in western psychology|publisher=NY:Columbia University Press|date=2001|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Human beings have a self—that is, they are able to look back on themselves as both subjects and objects in the universe. Ultimately, this brings questions about who we are and the nature of our own importance.&lt;ref&gt;Charon, Joel M. ''Ten Questions: A Sociological Perspective.'' 5th edition. Thomson &amp; Wadsworth. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity]] sees the self negatively, distorted through [[sin]]: 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?' ([[Jeremiah]] 17:9) Alternately, each human self or spirit is a unique creation by God. The "desperately wicked self" is the sinful self that has chosen to be "curved back upon itself", but ever with the potential of changing and (by God's grace) turning toward "'new life', opened out to love of God and neighbor"
See Albert Outler as quoted in "Outler on the Holy Spirit" by George Aikinson, Bristol House, 2004 p.&amp;nbsp;54. and p.&amp;nbsp;87.

According to psychologist [[James Marcia]], identity comes from both political and religious views. Marcia  also identified exploration and commitment as interactive parts of identity formation, which includes religious identity. [[Erik Erikson]] compared faith with doubt and found that healthy adults take heed to their spiritual side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kiesling, Chris; Montgomery, Marylin; Sorell, Gwendolyn; Colwell, Ronald. "Identity and Spirituality: A Psychosocial Exploration of the Sense of 
Spiritual Self"&lt;/ref&gt;

One description of spirituality is the self's search for "ultimate meaning" through an independent comprehension of the sacred. Spiritual identity appears when the symbolic religious and spiritual of a culture is found by individuals in the setting of their own life. There can be different types of spiritual self because it is determined on one's life and experiences. Another definition of spiritual identity is " a persistent sense of self that addresses ultimate questions about the nature, purpose, and meaning of life, resulting in behaviors that are consonant with the individual’s core values." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Another description of Mind, body, soul, and spirit is a holism of one inner self being of one whole.  It all combines together as one whole instead of different parts.  Individuals one thoughts, one feeling, one breathing is all completed and occurs as one whole.  GT &lt;/truth knowledge of one self, and the universe.

==Maslow's theory==
According to [[Abraham Maslow]]'s theory of "self-actualization needs: to find self fulfillment and realize one's potential."&lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. pg.478
&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that once a person realizes what they are capable of it gives them a motivation to do whatever they intend.

==Bandura==
[[Albert Bandura]] believed in "[[self-efficacy]], which refers to a person's learned expectations of success."&lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. pg 478&lt;/ref&gt; This theory states that people are bound to complete a task more effectively if they think they will succeed. If a person is more negative about their abilities the chances of them completing the task accordingly are less.

==Winnicott==

[[D. W. Winnicott]] was of the opinion that psychopathology was in large part generated by an overvaluation of the [[True self and false self|false self]], at the expense of the true self which was linked to the individual's own [[creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Greenberg et al, ''Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychotherapy'' (2004) p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rogers on self and self-concept==
[[Carl Rogers]]' theory is that "people use the term [[self concept]] to refer to all the information and beliefs you have as an individual regarding your own nature, unique qualities, and typical behaviors." &lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. pg. 478&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers thought that people develop through relationships with others and also in relation to themselves. An encouraging environment helps people towards this development.

Commenting on his clients' search for a real self, Rogers quoted with approval [[Kierkegaard]]'s statement that "the most common despair is to be in despair at not choosing, or willing, to be oneself; but that the deepest form of despair is to choose 'to be another than himself'. On the other hand, 'to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair'".&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming A Person'' (1961) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==The observing self==

The "Visible" self is mainly dependent on a subjective view, that is, as viewed from the specific self. For example: looking in the mirror, we perceive the reflection to be our true "self"....

==The witnessing self==

[[Ken Wilber]] describes the Witnessing (or Observing) Self in the following terms: 
:"This observing Self is usually called the Self with a capital ''S'', or the Witness, or pure [[Immanence|Presence]], or pure [[Awareness]], or [[Consciousness#Philosophical approaches|Consciousness]] as such, and this Self as transparent Witness is a direct ray of the living [[divinity|Divine]]. The ultimate "I AM" is [[Christ]], is [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], is [[shunyata|Emptiness]] itself: such is the startling testimony of the world's great [[mysticism|mystic]]s and [[wise old man|sage]]s." &lt;ref name="wilber"&gt;Ken Wilber, ''A Brief History of Everything'', ch. 12, p.197-199&lt;/ref&gt;
He adds that the Self is not an [[Emergence|Emergent]], but an aspect present from the start as the basic form of awareness, but which becomes increasingly obvious and self-aware  "as growth and transcendence matures." As Depth increases, consciousness shines forth more noticeably, until:
:"shed[ding] its lesser identification with both the body and the mind ... in each case from matter to body to mind to Spirit... consciousness or the observing Self sheds an exclusive [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] with a lesser and shallower dimension, and opens up to deeper and higher and wider occasions, until it opens up to its own ultimate ground in Spirit itself. And the stages of transpersonal growth and development are basically the stages of following this Observing Self to its ultimate abode, which is pure Spirit or pure Emptiness, the ground, path and fruition of the entire display." &lt;ref name="wilber" /&gt;

In a similar vein, [[Evelyn Underhill]]&lt;ref name="Underhill"&gt;Evelyn Underhill, "Mysticism:  A Study in Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness, Section III, P. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; states: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is clear that under ordinary conditions, and save for sudden gusts of "[[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendental]] Feeling" induced by some saving madness such as Religion, Art, or Love, the superficial self knows nothing of the attitude of this silent watcher—this "Dweller in the Innermost"—towards the incoming messages of the external world: nor of the activities which they awake in it. Concentrated on the sense-world, and the messages she receives from it, she knows nothing of the relations which exist between this subject and the unattainable Object of all thought. But by a deliberate inattention to the messages of the senses, such as that which is induced by contemplation, the mystic can bring the ground of the soul, the seat of "Transcendental Feeling," within the area of consciousness: making it amenable to the activity of the will. Thus becoming unaware of his usual and largely fictitious "external world," another and more substantial set of perceptions, which never have their chance under normal conditions, rise to the surface. Sometimes these unite with the normal reasoning faculties. More often, they supersede them. Some such exchange, such "losing to find," appears to be necessary, if man's transcendental powers are to have their full chance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6668">The following system is Mendelson's (1997, 289–293) '''ST''' [[type theory]]. 
ST is equivalent with Russell's ramified theory plus the [[Axiom of reducibility]]. 
The [[domain of discourse|domain of quantification]] is partitioned into an ascending hierarchy of types, with all [[individual]]s assigned a type. Quantified variables range over only one type; hence the underlying logic is [[first-order logic]]. '''ST''' is "simple" (relative to the type theory of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'') primarily because all members of the [[relation (mathematics)|domain]] and [[relation (mathematics)|codomain]] of any [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] must be of the same type.
There is a lowest type, whose individuals have no members and are members of the second lowest type. Individuals of the lowest type correspond to the [[urelement]]s of certain set theories. Each type has a next higher type, analogous to the notion of [[successor function|successor]] in [[Peano arithmetic]]. While '''ST''' is silent as to whether there is a maximal type, a [[transfinite number]] of types poses no difficulty. These facts, reminiscent of the Peano axioms, make it convenient and conventional to assign a [[natural number]] to each type, starting with 0 for the lowest type. But type theory does not require a prior definition of the naturals.

The symbols peculiar to '''ST''' are primed variables and infix &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;. In any given formula, unprimed variables all have the same type, while primed variables (&lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;) range over the next higher type. The [[atomic formula]]s of '''ST''' are of two forms, &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; ([[identity (mathematics)|identity]]) and &lt;math&gt;y\in x'&lt;/math&gt;. The [[infix]] symbol &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; suggests the intended [[model theory|interpretation]], set membership.

All variables appearing in the definition of identity and in the axioms ''Extensionality'' and ''Comprehension'', range over individuals of one of two consecutive types. Only unprimed variables (ranging over the "lower" type) can appear to the left of '&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;', whereas to its right, only primed variables (ranging over the "higher" type) can appear. The first-order formulation of '''ST''' rules out quantifying over types. Hence each pair of consecutive types requires its own axiom of Extensionality and of Comprehension, which is possible if ''Extensionality'' and ''Comprehension'' below are taken as [[axiom scheme|axiom schemata]] "ranging over" types.

* '''Identity''', defined by &lt;math&gt;x=y\leftrightarrow\forall z' [x\in z'\leftrightarrow y\in z']&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]'''.  An [[axiom schema]]. &lt;math&gt;\forall x[x\in y' \leftrightarrow x\in z'] \rightarrow [y'=z']&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; denote any [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] containing the [[free variable]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

* '''Comprehension'''.  An [[axiom schema]]. &lt;math&gt;\exists z'\forall x[x\in z'\leftrightarrow \Phi(x)]&lt;/math&gt;.

: ''Remark''. Any collection of elements of the same type may form an object of the next higher type. Comprehension is schematic with respect to &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; as well as to types.

* '''[[Axiom of infinity|Infinity]]'''.  There exists a nonempty [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over the individuals of the lowest type, that is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], and strongly connected: &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y [x\neq y\rightarrow[xRy\vee yRx]]&lt;/math&gt; and with codomain contained in domain.

: ''Remark''. Infinity is the only true axiom of '''ST''' and is entirely mathematical in nature. It asserts that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a strict [[total order]], with a [[relation (mathematics)|codomain]] contained in its [[relation (mathematics)|domain]]. If 0 is assigned to the lowest type, the type of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is 3. Infinity can be satisfied only if the (co)domain of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is [[Infinity|infinite]], thus forcing the existence of an infinite set. If relations are defined in terms of [[ordered pair]]s, this axiom requires a prior definition of ordered pair; the Kuratowski definition, adapted to '''ST''', will do. The literature does not explain why the usual [[axiom of infinity]] (there exists an [[inductive set (axiom of infinity)|inductive set]]) of [[ZFC]] of other set theories could not be married to '''ST'''.

'''ST''' reveals how type theory can be made very similar to [[axiomatic set theory]]. Moreover, the more elaborate [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] of '''ST''', grounded in what is now called the "iterative conception of set," makes for axiom (schemata) that are far simpler than those of conventional set theories, such as [[ZFC]], with simpler ontologies. Set theories whose point of departure is type theory, but whose axioms, [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]], and terminology differ from the above, include [[New Foundations]] and [[Scott&amp;ndash;Potter set theory]].

== Formulations based on equality ==

{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}

Church's type theory has been extensively studied by two of Church's students, [[Leon Henkin]] and [[Peter B. Andrews (mathematician)|Peter B. Andrews]]. Since '''ST''' is a [[higher order logic]], and in higher order logics one can define propositional connectives in terms of [[logical equivalence]] and quantifiers, in 1963 Henkin developed a formulation of '''ST''' based on equality, but in which he restricted attention to propositional types. This was simplified later that year by Andrews in his
[[Q zero|theory '''Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''']].&lt;!--does anyone else call it this way? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/ Church's Type Theory]" &amp;ndash; by Peter Andrews (adapted from his book).&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect '''ST''' can be seen as a particular kind of a higher-order logic, classified by [[P.T. Johnstone]] in ''Sketches of an Elephant'', as having a [[lambda-signature]], that is a higher-order [[signature (logic)|signature]] that contains no relations, and uses only products and arrows (function types) as [[type constructors]]. Furthermore, as Johnstone put it, '''ST''' is "logic-free" in the sense that it contains no logical connectives or quantifiers in its formulae.&lt;ref&gt;P.T. Johnstone, ''Sketches of an elephant'', p. 952&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5516">The '''Serfdom Patent''' of 1 November 1781 aimed to abolish aspects of the traditional [[serfdom]] ({{lang-de|Leibeigenschaft}}) system of the [[Habsburg lands]] through the establishment of basic [[civil liberties]] for the serfs.

The [[feudal system]] bound farmers to inherited pieces of land and subjected them to the absolute control of their [[landlord]].  The landlord was obligated to provide protection, in exchange for the serfs' labor and goods. The Serfdom Patent, issued by the [[enlightened absolutist]] Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor| Joseph II]], diminished the long-established mastery of the landlords; thus allowing the serfs to independently choose marriage partners, pursue career choices, and move between estates.&lt;ref name="Jelavich1987"&gt;

==Historical context==
The [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] Joseph II ruled as co-regent of the Habsburg Monarchy with his mother, [[Maria Theresa]], from 1765 to 1780. The queen's [[July Decree (1770)|July Decree]] of 1770 granted the peasants the right to justice through royal officials rather than their lords' courts. The [[Patent of 1772]] even granted them the right to appeal to the sovereign, and limited the ''robot'' (labour that lords could demand of their serfs) to three days a week and twelve hours a day. The [[October Decree (1773)|October Decree]] of 1773 capped the price of letters of release, which serfs could buy from their lords to gain their freedom.

Following her death in 1780, Joseph II pursued further liberal reforms. His policies included the [[Patent of Toleration|1781 Edict of Toleration]], in which the [[Roman Catholic]] Emperor granted Protestant denominations more equality than in the past. This represented a tremendous change from the Catholic-centered policies of his mother. Joseph was an enlightened absolutist ruler, incorporating reason and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals into his administration. Emperor Joseph’s enlightened despot contemporaries, [[Catherine the Great]] of [[Russia]] and [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]], both claimed to detest feudalism yet chose to appease their noble classes by strengthening the serfdom system during their years in power. Author T. K. E. Blemming describes the rulers' compromises, arguing that "in exchange for absolute power at a national level it was necessary to hand over to them [nobles] absolute power on their estates." Joseph refused to give in to the nobles’ demands, which would soon create difficulties in the implementation of his decrees.

==The motivations of Joseph II==
Much of the Habsburg economy was based on [[agriculture]] in the 18th century. The nobles and clerics were traditionally exempt from taxes, and the burden fell mainly on the peasants. After paying dues to the landlord, the serfs were unable to create high tax revenues for Joseph's centralized state. The Emperor recognized that the abolishment of the feudal system would allow peasants to pay higher tax rates to the state.&lt;ref name="Good1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=David F. Good|title=The Economic Rise of the Habsburg Empire, 1750-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cz_zBH4r8YgC&amp;pg=PA33|year=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05094-5|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph’s primary objection to feudalism was economic, but his moral objections also arose from witnessing the “inhumanity of serfdom”. He abolished beatings and hoped to allow serfs to appeal court rulings to the throne following a reorganization of the landlord judicial system.

==Consequences of the Serfdom Patent==
The Patent was enforced differently amongst all of the various Habsburg lands.  The nobility in [[Bohemia]] refused to enact its provisions, while the [[Transylvania]]n nobles simply refused to notify the peasants in their region about this emancipation document. The Hungarian estates claimed that their peasants were not serfs, but “tenants in [[fee simple]], who were fully informed as to their rights and duties by precise contracts” and continued to restrict these “tenants”. In contrast, the peasants of the German-speaking provinces were actually aided by the Patent. The 1781 Serfdom Patent allowed the serfs legal rights in the Habsburg monarchy, but the document did not affect the financial dues and the physical [[corvée]] (unpaid labor) that the serfs legally owed to their landlords.  Joseph II recognized the importance of these further reforms, continually attempting to destroy the economic subjugation through related laws, such as his Tax Decree of 1789. This new law would have finally realized Emperor Joseph II’s ambition to modernize Habsburg society, allowing for the end of corvée and the beginning of lesser tax obligations. Joseph’s latter reforms were withdrawn upon his death, but the personal freedom of serfs remained guaranteed through the first half of the nineteenth century due to the consequences of the 1781 Serfdom Patent.

[[File:Symbol of Signalism, an international neo-avant-garde movement.jpg|thumb|right|Symbol of Signalism]]
'''Signalism''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Сигнализам}} / Signalizam; from: [[Latin language|lat.]] Signum – ''sign, signal'') represents an international neo-[[avant-garde]] literal and art movement. It gathered wider support base both in former [[Yugoslavia]] and the world in the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11166 "Signalism in lexicons"] (entries from Yugoslav editions, in English), Signalism @ Project Rastko, e-library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Živković, Živan. [http://www.rastko.org.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11292 "Quarter of century of Signalism"], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins and methods of Signalism ==

The beginning of Signalism dates back to 1959 when its founder and main theoretician [[Miroljub Todorović]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11297 Miroljub Todorović: Bio-bibliography], Signalism @ Project Rastko, e-library&lt;/ref&gt; started with his linguistic experiments. His main belief was that there can be no significant leap forward in poetry without revolutionizing its main medium – the language.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Daligand. [http://www.rastko.rs/rastko/delo/12312 Signalisme et pansemiotique] (2007), Signalism @ Project Rastko, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Pet., "Signalizam", an entry in: ''Enciklopedija srpskog naroda'', Belgrade, 2008, str. 1002; also: B.S-P-, ''Todorović Miroljub'' in: ''Enciklopedija srpskog naroda'', Belgrade, 2008, str. 1133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of Signalism in [[Serbian literature]] and [[Serbian culture|culture]], with its tendency to revolutionize other arts as well (visual, theater, comics,&lt;ref&gt;Branislav Miltojević. ''Antologija niškog stripa'', Prosveta, Niš, 2004, pp. 72, 265-268&lt;/ref&gt; music and movies),&lt;ref&gt;Pavle Levi. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVYIFprvPVkC&amp;pg=PA98 ''Cinema by Other Means''], Oxford University Press, 2012, pp 98-104&lt;/ref&gt; came from the need to eliminate the spent models carried on by poetic and cultural traditions, as well as from the necessity to take on the challenges and spirit of the modern technological and electronic civilization. In its program ("Manifesto" and other guiding texts)&lt;ref&gt;Miroljub Todorović. [http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11192 ''Manifestos and other Essays''] (1969-1975)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in its art pieces, Signalism made a clean break from the principles of neoromantism and late [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] still governing Serbian literature. Its goal was set to radically change poetry both through content and form, and make it compatible with the contemporary times.

Revolutionizing of the poetic language started with the introduction of the symbols, formulas and linguistic forms of the "hard" sciences (physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, biochemistry and astronomy). Furthermore, the language was made visual by dispersing words and sentences into syllables and letters forming visually recognizable patterns,&lt;ref&gt;Adriano Spatola, Brendan W. Hennessey, Guy Bennett. [https://books.google.com/books?id=h60aAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=signalism&amp;dq=signalism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXqlU9f8C8-M0wWh1ICoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Toward Total Poetry''], Otis Books/Seismicity Editions, 2008, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as by introducing non-verbal symbols into the text (drawings, photographs, graphs…) for the purpose of creating a collage of verbal and visual elements.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. dr Dagmar Burkhart, [http://signalizamusvetu.blogspot.com/2014/03/prof.html „Od Carmina figurata ka vizuelnoj poeziji"], ''Signal'', Belgrade, no. 25-26-27, 2003, 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt; This first phase of Signalism is often referred to as ''Scientism'', with the most prominent examples including the books "Planeta" (Planet, 1965) and "Putovanje u Zvezdaliju" (A trip to Starland, 1971) as well as poetry cycles "Belančevina" (Protein), "Kiseonik" (Oxygen), "Ožilište" (Nursery) and others in which the topics are Space, Time and Matter.

In their for decade long research and creative pursuit that followed, Signalists significantly expanded cognitive boundaries and genre profile of modern Serbian poetry. Signalist poetry can be divided into two main forms: verbal and non-verbal. Verbal poetry consists of scientist, aleatoric (random), stochastic, technological, phenomenological, slang and apeironistic poetry. Non-verbal poetry subtypes include visual, object, sound and gestual poetry.

Signalism made significant advances in prose (experimental novel and short story). There is also a number of significant Signalist children literature accomplishments. In visual art strides are made in [[body art]], [[mail art]],&lt;ref&gt;Džon Held. ''Mejl-Art signalizam'', ''Književni magazin'', broj 91-92, Belgrade, 2009, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; performance and [[conceptual art]].

Three manifestos helped define Signalism as a neo-avant-garde movement that negates literal, artistic and cultural heritage, poetic and aesthetic conventions and canonical ways of creativity by insisting on creative experimentation – "Manifesto of scientific poetry" (1968), "Signalist manifesto (Regulae poesis)" (1969) and "Signalism" (1970).

The movement was significantly boosted by the [[Signal, International Review of Signalist Research|international magazine "Signal"]], inaugurated in 1970. Nine issues of "Signal" appeared between 1970 and 1973, presenting a number of domestic and international artists, as well as printing bibliographical data about the avant-garde publications all around the world. From 1973 until 1995 magazine could not be published, mainly for financial reasons. From 1995 to 2004 another 21 issues of "Signal" appeared. The new release of "Signal" revitalized the Signalist movement and brought an army of young artists into the movement in 21st century.

On the work of Miroljub Todorović and Signalism movement that he had founded, three doctoral dissertations have been defended:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11296 "Three dissertations about Signalism" (Biserka Rajčić: 'Kornhauser's study'; Dragoljub P. Đurić: 'Dissertation on Signalism'; Radovan Vučković: 'Radical disproval of tradition)], Signalism @ Project Rastko&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Julian Kornhauser, Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland, 1980; Dr. Živan Živković, Faculty of Philology in Belgrade, 1991 and Dr. Milivoje Pavlović, University of Kosovska Mitrovica, 2002. Twenty monographs have also been published on the same subject.

== The most important authors and works of Signalism ==

Many poets, writers and painters accepted the basic concepts of Signalism, further developing and spreading the ideas of this Serbian (Yugoslav) neo-avant-garde movement.

Besides the founder of Signalism [[Miroljub Todorović]] (''Kyberno'', 1970; ''The Pig is an Excellent Swimmer'', 1971; ''Bumpkin Shows Off'', slang poetry, 1974; ''Insect on the Temple'', 1978; ''Algol'', 1980, ''Textum'', 1981; ''Chinese Erotism'', 1983; ''Knock-Out'', 1984; ''I Mount Rocinante Again'', 1987; ''Water-Snake Drinks Water'', 1988; ''The Diary of Avant-Garde'', 1990; ''Electric Chair'', slang poetry, 1998; ''I’ve Just Opened my Mail'', 2000; ''It Walked Into my Ear'', slang stories, 2005; ''Blue Wind'', 2006; ''Slang Stories'', 2007;) important contributors to the theory and practice of Signalism include [[Marina Abramović]], [[Vlada Stojiljković]], [[Zvonimir Kostić Palanski]], [[Slobodan Pavićević]] (''Flowers’ Silicates'', 1973; ''Roadworks'', 1984), [[Milivoje Pavlović]] (''White Book'', 1974; ''The World In Signals'', 1996), [[Zoran Popović (writer)|Zoran Popović]], [[Ljubiša Jocić]] (''Moonshine in Tetrapack'', 1975; ''What’s the Time'', 1976: ''Essays on Signalism'', 1994), [[Jaroslav Supek]], [[Zvonko Sarić]] (''Overcoat until the Dawn'', 2001; ''Soul Catcher'', 2003), [[Bogislav Marković]] (''Altai Dust'', 2006), [[Ilija Bakić]] (''Prenatal Life'', 1997; ''New Babylon'', 1998; ''Protoplasm'', 2003; ''The Autumn of Gatherers'', 2007; ''To be Continued'', 2009), [[Slobodan Škerović]] (''Indigo'', 2005; ''All Colors of Arcturus'', 2006; ''Chimera or Borg'', 2008), [[Žarko Đurović (writer)|Žarko Đurović]] (''The World of Signalism'', 2002), [[Dušan Vidaković]], [[Dobrivoje Jevtić]], [[Dejan Bogojević]], [[Andrej Tišma]], [[Dobrica Kamperelić]], [[Milivoj Anđelković]], [[Zoran Stefanović]] and others.

== Critical reception ==

Numerous domestic and international critics and theoreticians hold Signalism in high regard:

Prof. [[Miloš Bandić]]: "Signalism is – after [[Zenitism]], [[Surrealism]] and the movement of social literature – the next and autochthonous literary and artistic movement in Serbian literature of 20th century. At the same time, in contemporary Yugoslav literature and culture, Signalism is confirmed as an exclusive modern dimension and a separate artistic form and production. Without it all would probably be poorer and who knows how deprived."

[[Oskar Davičo]], famous writer: "For the first time from the appearance of Surrealism in the twenties, we can joyfully confirm that with exploration of Miroljub Todorović, Serbian poetry can again catch up with the genuine worldwide avant-garde explorations."

[[Zoran Markuš]], visual arts critic: "Signalism is our parallel phenomena within the brackets of the most extreme avant-garde and that explains its international expansion, approval and importance in certain artistic and intellectual circles."

[[Dave Oz]], Canadian multimedia artist: "True essence of Signalism is that it expects appearance of planetary consciousness."

[[Gillo Dorfles]], Italian arts theoretician: "Signalism means a step forward, in relation to concrete poetry, visual poetry and the art of the sign."

Prof. Milivoje Pavlović: "Thanks to Miroljub Todorović and the group that follows him, Signalism with its mainstream represents the arc which connects in a creative manner avant-garde aims from the period between wars with the contemporary epoch, bringing valuable innovations and connecting Serbian art with the modern world’s processes." (From the book ''The Keys of Signalist Poetics'')

[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Accidia).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Acedia in ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', by [[Hieronymus Bosch]].]]

'''Sloth''' is one of the [[seven capital sins]]. It is the most difficult sin to define, and to credit as sin, since it refers to a peculiar jumble of notions, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Society and Evil|last=Lyman|first=Stanford|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-930390-81-4|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One definition is: a habitual disinclination to exertion or laziness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sloth?s=t|title=the definition of sloth|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Views concerning the virtue of work to support society and further God's plan suggest that on the contrary, through inactivity, one invites sin. "For Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do." ("Against Idleness and Mischief" by [[Isaac Watts]]).

== Definition ==
The word "sloth" is a translation of the Latin term ''[[acedia]]'' (Middle English, ''accidie'') and means "without care". Spiritually, ''acedia'' first referred to an affliction attending religious persons, especially monks, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to [[God]]. Mentally, ''acedia'', has a number of distinctive components of which the most important is affectlessness, a lack of any feeling about self or other, a mind-state that gives rise to boredom, rancor, apathy, and a passive inert or sluggish mentation. Physically, ''acedia'' is fundamentally  with a cessation of motion and an indifference to work; it finds expression in [[laziness]], idleness, and indolence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two commentators consider the most accurate translation of ''acedia'' to be "self-pity," for it "conveys both the melancholy of the condition and self-centeredness upon which it is founded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kurtz |first1=Ernest |last2=Ketcham |first2=Katherine |title=Experiencing Spirituality: Finding Meaning Through Storytelling |accessdate=May 15, 2014|publisher=Tarcher Perigee |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catholicism ===
In his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] defined sloth as "sorrow about spiritual good" and as "sluggishness of the mind which neglects to begin good... [it] is evil in its effect, if it so oppresses man as to draw him away entirely from good deeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3035.htm |title=The Summa Theologica II-II.Q35.A1 (Sloth) |publisher=New Advent |edition=1920, Second and Revised |author=Thomas Aquinas}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', "acedia or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes from God and to be repelled by divine goodness."&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|2094|long=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloth includes ignoring the seven gifts of grace given by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Ghost]] ([[wisdom]], [[understanding]], [[counsel]], [[knowledge]], [[piety]], [[Courage|fortitude]], and [[fear of the Lord]]);  such disregard may lead to the slowing of  spiritual progress towards eternal life, to the neglect of manifold duties of [[charity (practice)|charity]] towards the [[neighbourhood|neighbour]], and to animosity towards those who love God.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sin and Its Consequences|last=Manning|first=Henry Edward|author-link=Henry Edward Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khsTAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Burns and Oates|year=1874|isbn=|location=London|pages=40,103–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other capital sins,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in which the sinner commits immoral acts,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} sloth is a sin of omission of desire and/or performance. It may arise from any of the other [[capital vices]]; for example, a son may omit his duty to his father through anger. While the state and habit of sloth is a [[mortal sin]], the habit of the soul tending towards the last mortal state of sloth is not mortal in and of itself except under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Orthodoxy ===
In the [[Philokalia]], the word ''[[depression (mood)|dejection]]'' is used instead of ''sloth,'' for the person who falls into dejection will lose interest in life.

=== Buddhism ===
It is also one of the [[five hindrances]] in [[Buddhism]].

=== Others ===
Sloth has also been defined as a failure to do things that one should do, though the understanding of the sin in antiquity was that this laziness or lack of work was simply a symptom of the vice of apathy or indifference, particularly an apathy or boredom with God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desiringgod.org/messages/lazy-busy&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2017}}

Emotionally and cognitively, the evil of ''acedia'' finds expression in a lack of any feeling for the world, for the people in it, or for the self. ''Acedia'' takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. Although the most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, a lesser but more noisome element was also noted by theologians. From ''tristitia'', asserted Gregory the Great, "there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, [and] despair..." [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], too, dealt with this attribute of ''acedia'', counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, indolence, and ''wrawnesse'', the last variously translated as "anger" or better as "peevishness". For Chaucer, human's sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, he/she tells him/her self, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. ''Acedia''  in Chaucer's view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Society and Evil|last=Lyman|first=Stanford|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1989|isbn=9780930390815|location=|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloth not only subverts the livelihood of the body, taking no care for its day-to-day provisions, but also slows down the mind, halting its attention to matters of great importance. Sloth hinders man in his righteous undertakings and becomes a path to ruin.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to [[Peter Binsfeld]]'s ''Binsfeld's Classification of Demons'', [[Belphegor]] is the chief demon of the sin Sloth.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Demons and Demonology, By Rosemary Guiley, p. 28-29, Facts on File, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sperm donation''' is the provision (or "donation") by a man (known as a sperm donor) of his [[sperm]] (known as donor sperm), principally for it to be used in the [[artificial insemination]] of a woman or women who are not his sexual partners for the purpose of achieving a pregnancy.

Sperm may be donated privately and directly to the intended recipient, or through a [[sperm bank]] or fertility clinic. Sperm donation enables a man to [[father]] a child for third-party women, and is therefore, categorized as a form of [[third party reproduction]]. Pregnancies are usually achieved by using donor sperm in [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART) techniques which include [[artificial insemination]] (either by [[intracervical insemination]] (ICI) or [[IUI|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) in a clinic, or intravaginal insemination at home). Less commonly, donor sperm may be used in in vitro fertilization ([[IVF]]). The primary recipients of donor sperm are single women, lesbian couples and heterosexual couples suffering from [[male infertility]].&lt;ref name = TheTimes/&gt;

Donor sperm and 'fertility treatments' using donor sperm may be obtained at a [[sperm bank]] or fertility clinic. Sperm banks or clinics may be subject to state or professional regulations, including restrictions on donor anonymity and the number of offspring that may be produced, and there may be other legal protections of the rights and responsibilities of both recipient and donor. Some sperm banks, either by choice or regulation, limit the amount of information available to potential recipients; a desire to obtain more information on donors is one reason why recipients may choose to use a known donor or private donation (i.e. a de-identified donor).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivf.com.au/fertility-treatment/donor-program/require-a-sperm-donor|title=Donor Sperm for Fertility Treatment {{!}} IVF Australia|website=www.ivf.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Reference Added: IVF Australia 
- used throughout this article as it outlines procedures and rights thoroughly --&gt; However conception is achieved, the nature and course of the pregnancy will be the same as one achieved by sexual intercourse, and the male donor will be the biological father of any child born from his donations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Laws==
{{main article|Sperm donation laws by country}}

A sperm donor is generally not intended to be the legal or ''[[de jure]]'' father of a child produced from his sperm. The law may however, make implications in relation to legal fatherhood or the absence of a father. The law may also govern the fertility process through sperm donation in a fertility clinic. It may make provision as to whether a sperm donor may be anonymous or not, and it might give an adult donor conceived offspring the right to trace his or her biological father. Where sperm is donated by [[natural insemination]], i.e. where the donor has sexual intercourse with the recipient woman, the law in every country will always provide that the male is the father of any child produced, even where the sperm is provided by a third party male who is not the woman's usual sexual partner and where the express intention was to secure a pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/arta2007367/index.html#s38|title=ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY ACT 2007|website=www8.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws regulating sperm donation address issues such as permissible reimbursement or payment to sperm donors, rights and responsibilities of the donor towards his biological offspring, the child's right to know his/her father's identity, and procedural issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacqueline Acker |year=2013 |title=The Case for Unregulated Private Sperm Donation |journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2qj3t4t1#page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In general, laws are more likely to disregard the sperm donor's biological link to the child, so that he will neither have child support obligations nor rights to the child. In the absence of specific legal protection, courts may order a sperm donor to pay child support or recognize his parental rights, and will invariably do so where the insemination is carried  out by natural, as opposed to artificial means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Malvern|first=Jack | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sperm donor forced to pay child support after lesbian couple split|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article2994783.ece|date=2007-12-04|access-date=2009-06-29|work=The Times|location=London|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008030202/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article2994783.ece|archive-date=2009-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ABA Journal|last=Neil|first=Martha| name-list-format = vanc |title=Court Says Sperm Donor Owes Child Support|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/court-says-sperm-donor-owes-child-support|date=2007-05-10|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carne|first=Lucy| name-list-format = vanc |title=$PERM WAIL BY DONOR MUST PAY SORT 18 YRS.

Laws in many jurisdictions limit the number of offspring that a sperm donor can give rise to, and who may be a recipient of donor sperm.

==Uses==
The purpose of sperm donation is to provide pregnancies for women whose male partner is infertile or, more commonly, for women who do not have a male partner. Direct sexual contact between the parties is avoided since the donor's sperm is placed in the woman's body by artificial means (but see [[Natural insemination|Natural Insemination]]). 

Sperm donation preserves the sexual integrity of a recipient, but the woman is nevertheless able to benefit from the reproductive capacity of a man to provide her with a pregnancy.

Donor sperm is prepared for use in [[artificial insemination]] in intrauterine insemination ([[IUI]]) or [[Intracervical insemination|intra-cervical insemination]] (ICI). Less commonly, donor sperm is prepared for use in other assisted reproductive techniques such as [[IVF]] and [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI).  Donor sperm may also be used in [[surrogacy]] arrangements either by artificially inseminating the [[surrogate pregnancy|surrogate]] (known as traditional surrogacy) or by implanting in a surrogate embryos which have been created by using donor sperm together with eggs from a donor or from the 'commissioning female' (known as ''gestational surrogacy'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://surrogate.com/about-surrogacy/types-of-surrogacy/what-is-gestational-surrogacy/|title=What is Gestational Surrogacy, How it Works  {{!}} Surrogate.com|website=surrogate.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Spare embryos from this process may be donated to other women or surrogates. Donor sperm may also be used for producing embryos with donor eggs which are then donated to a female who is not genetically related to the child she produces.

In medical terms, a pregnancy achieved using donor sperm is no different from a pregnancy achieved through sexual intercourse, and genetically a child produced by sperm donation will be the child of the sperm donor and the woman whose egg was fertilized by his sperm (although not necessarily the birth mother).

Procedures of any kind, e.g., artificial insemination or IVF, using donor sperm to impregnate a female who is not the partner of, nor related to the male who provided the sperm, may be referred to as ''donor treatments''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A Swedish study concluded that 94% of potential donors would be willing to donate to single women and 85% would be willing to donate to lesbian single women or lesbian couples.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; A review of two studies found that 50 to 68% of actual donors would donate for lesbian couples, and 40 to 64% would donate to single women.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

==Provision==
A sperm donor may donate sperm privately or through a [[sperm bank]], sperm agency, or other brokerage arrangement. Donations from private donors are most commonly carried out using [[artificial insemination]].

Generally, a male who provides sperm as a sperm donor gives up all legal and other rights over the biological children produced from his sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s60h.html|title= Family Law Act 1975 – SECT 60H: Children born as a result of artificial conception procedures|website=www5.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in private arrangements, some degree of [[co-parenting]] may be agreed, although the enforceability of those agreements varies by jurisdiction.

Donors may or may not be paid, according to local laws and agreed arrangements. Even in unpaid arrangements, expenses are often reimbursed. Depending on local law and on private arrangements, men may donate anonymously or agree to provide identifying information to their offspring in the future.&lt;ref name="Cryos2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7168|title=Frequently asked questions - Cryos International Sperm Bank|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7168|archive-date=28 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private donations facilitated by an agency often use a "directed" donor, when a male directs that his sperm is to be used by a specific person. Non-anonymous donors are also called "known donors", "open donors" or "identity disclosure donors".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A review of surveys among donors came to the results that the media and advertising are most efficient in attracting donors, and that the internet is becoming increasingly important in this purpose.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Recruitment via couples with infertility problems in the social environment of the sperm donor does not seem to be important in recruitment overall.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

===Sperm banks===
{{main article|Sperm bank}}
A sperm donor will usually donate sperm to a sperm bank under a contract, which typically specifies the period during which the donor will be required to produce sperm, which generally ranges from six to 24 months depending on the number of pregnancies which the sperm bank intends to produce from the donor. If a sperm bank has access to world markets e.g. by direct sales, or sales to clinics outside their own jurisdiction, a male may donate for a longer period than two years, as the risk of [[consanguinity]] is reduced (although local laws vary widely).

The contract may also specify the place and hours for donation, a requirement to notify the sperm bank in the case of acquiring a sexual infection, and the requirement not to have intercourse or to masturbate for a period of usually 2–3 days before making a donation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.australianeedsyoursperm.com.au/sperm-donor-process-australia-needs-your-sperm-help-someone-in-need/|title=Sperm Donor Process {{!}} Australia Needs Your Sperm {{!}} Help a family in need|work=Australia Needs Your Sperm|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sperm provided by a sperm bank will be produced by a donor attending at the sperm bank's premises in order to ascertain the donor's identity on every occasion. The donor [[masturbation|masturbates]] to provide an ejaculate or by the use of an electrical stimulator, although a special [[condom]], known as a [[collection condom]], may be used to [[semen collection|collect the semen]] during sexual intercourse. The ejaculate is collected in a small container, which is usually [[Semen extender|extended with chemicals]] in order to provide a number of vials, each of which would be used for separate inseminations. The sperm is frozen and quarantined, usually for a period of six months, and the donor is re-tested prior to the sperm being used for artificial insemination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Sperm agencies===
In some jurisdictions, sperm may be donated through an agency. The agency may recruit donors, usually via the Internet. Donors may undergo the same kind of checks and tests required by a sperm bank, although clinics and agencies are not necessarily subject to the same regulatory regimes. In the case of an agency, the sperm will be supplied to the recipient female fresh rather than frozen.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/apr/30/health.uknews|title=Internet sperm agencies plan to sidestep new rules|last=Lewis|first=Paul| name-list-format = vanc |date=2007-04-30|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female chooses a donor and notifies the agency when she requires donations. The agency notifies the donor who must supply his sperm on the appropriate days nominated by the recipient. The agency will usually provide the sperm donor with a male collection kit usually including a [[collection condom]] and a container for shipping the sperm. This is collected and delivered by courier and the female uses the donor's sperm to inseminate herself, typically without medical supervision. This process preserves anonymity and enables a donor to produce sperm in the privacy of his own home. A donor will generally produce samples once or twice during a recipient's fertile period, but a second sample each time may not have the same fecundity of the first sample because it is produced too soon after the first one. Pregnancy rates by this method vary more than those achieved by sperm banks or fertility clinics. Transit times may vary and these have a significant effect on sperm viability so that if a donor is not located near to a recipient female the sperm may deteriorate. However, the use of fresh, as opposed to frozen, semen will mean that a sample has a greater fecundity and can produce higher pregnancy rates.

Sperm agencies may impose limits on the number of pregnancies achieved from each donor, but in practice this is more difficult to achieve than for sperm banks where the whole process may be more regulated. Most sperm donors only donate for a limited period, however, and since sperm supplied by a sperm agency is not processed into a number of different vials, there is a practical limit on the number of pregnancies which are usually produced in this way. A sperm agency will, for the same reason, be less likely than a sperm bank to enable a female to have subsequent children by the same donor.

Sperm agencies are largely unregulated and, because the sperm is not quarantined, may carry [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. This lack of regulation has led to authorities in some jurisdictions bringing legal action against sperm agencies. Agencies typically insist on [[STI testing]] for donors, but such tests cannot detect recent infections. Donors providing sperm in this way may not be protected by laws which apply to donations through a sperm bank or fertility clinic and will, if traced, be regarded as the legal father of each child produced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Private or "directed" donations===
Couples or individuals who need insemination by a third-party may seek assistance privately and directly from a friend or family member, or may obtain a "private" or "directed" donation by advertising or through a broker. A number of web sites seek to link recipients with sperm donors, while advertisements in gay and lesbian publications are common.

Recipients may already know the donor, or if arranged through a broker, the donor may meet the recipients and become known to them. Some brokers facilitate contact that maintains semi-anonymous identities for legal reasons. Where a private or directed donation is used, sperm need not be frozen.

Private donations may be free of charge - avoiding the significant costs of a more medicalised insemination - and fresh rather than frozen semen is generally deemed to increase the chances of pregnancy. However, they also carry higher risks associated with unscreened sexual or body fluid contact. Legal treatment of donors varies across jurisdictions, and in most jurisdictions (e.g., Sweden)&lt;ref name=notisum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notisum.se/rnp/Sls/lag/20060351.htm|title=Lag (2006:351) om genetisk integritet m.m.|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; personal and directed donors lack legal safeguards that may be available to anonymous donors. However, the laws of some countries (e.g. New Zealand) recognize written agreements between donors and recipients in a similar way to donations through a sperm bank.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Kits are available, usually on-line, for [[artificial insemination]] for private donor use, and these kits generally include a collection pot, a syringe, ovulation tests and pregnancy tests. A vaginal speculum and a soft cup may also be used. STI testing kits are also available but these only produce a 'snap-shot' result and, since sperm will not be frozen and quarantined, there will be risks associated with it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Natural insemination===
Insemination through sexual intercourse is known as natural insemination (NI). Where natural insemination is carried out by a person who is not the woman's usual sexual partner, and in circumstances where the express intention is to secure a pregnancy, this may be referred to as 'sperm donation by natural insemination'. 

Natural insemination has not been recognised in any state as other than a natural procreation process whereby the sperm donor and biological father is liable for care and support of the child. A woman who becomes pregnant through natural insemination will therefore always have a legal right to claim child support from the donor and the donor has a legal right to the custody of the child. Conceiving through natural insemination is considered a natural process, so the biological father will always be liable for child support and custody rights of the child.&lt;ref name="vanda"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is natural insemination?|url=http://sg.theasianparent.com/natural-insemination|access-date=4 December 2015 |quote=Natural insemination has not been recognised in any state as other than a natural procreation process whereby the sperm donor and biological father is liable for care and support of the child.  A woman who becomes pregnant through natural insemination will therefore always have a legal right to claim child support from the donor and the donor has a legal right to the custody of the child.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law therefore makes a fine distinction based on the method of conception: the biological relationship between the father and the child and the reason for the pregnancy having been achieved will be the same whether the child was conceived naturally or by artificial means, but the legal position will be different.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some countries and in some situations, sperm donors may be legally liable for any child they produce, but with NI the legal risk of paternity for a donor is always absolute. Natural insemination donors will therefore often donate without revealing their identity.

Despite this, some private sperm donors offer both natural and artificial insemination, or they may offer natural insemination after attempts to achieve conception by artificial insemination have failed. Some women also seek natural insemination for various reasons including the desire by them for a "natural" conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8261034.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Secret world of sperm donations |date=September 18, 2009 |access-date=May 23, 2010 |first=Samantha |last=Washington| name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/27/jennie-withers-co-parents-fertility |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Conceivable ideas: meet the modern sperm donor |date=June 27, 2010 |first=Emma |last=John| name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural insemination by a donor usually avoids the need for costly medical procedures that may require the intervention of third parties. It may lack some of the safety precautions and screenings usually built into the artificial insemination process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-have-babies-sperm-donor-ed-houben|title=How One Man Fathered 106 Babies (and Counting)|last=Paterniti|first=Michael|date=2015-10-01|work=GQ|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but proponents claim that it produces higher pregnancy rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kidspot.com.au/birth/conception/getting-pregnant/would-you-get-freaky-with-a-stranger-to-make-a-baby/news-story/7c692d3a112d91e71c9981756a6b9af6|title=Would you have sex with a stranger to make a baby?|last=Wylie|first=Rebel| name-list-format = vanc |website=www.kidspot.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more 'natural' conception does not involve the intervention and intrusion of third parties. However, it has not been medically proved that natural insemination has an increased chance of pregnancy.

NI is generally only carried out at the female's fertile time, as with other methods of insemination, in order to achieve the best chances of a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/getting-pregnant|title=Getting pregnant| work = Australia Healthdirect |date=2018-08-01|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of NI is PI, or partial intercourse, where penetration by the donor takes place immediately before ejaculation, thus avoiding prolonged physical contact between the parties.

==Sperm bank processes==
A sperm donor is usually advised not to ejaculate for two to three days before providing the sample, to increase sperm count. A sperm donor produces and collects sperm at a sperm bank or clinic by [[masturbation]] or during sexual intercourse with the use of a [[collection condom]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Preparing the sperm===
Sperm banks and clinics may "wash" the sperm sample to extract sperm from the rest of the material in the semen. Unwashed semen may only be used for ICI (intra-cervical) inseminations, to avoid cramping, or for IVF/ICSI procedures. It may be washed after thawing for use in IUI procedures. A [[cryoprotectant]] [[semen extender]] is added if the sperm is to be placed in frozen storage in [[liquid nitrogen]], and the sample is then frozen in a number of vials or straws.&lt;ref name=Cryos3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7179|title=Frequently asked questions - Cryos International Sperm Bank|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7179|archive-date=28 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One sample will be divided into 1–20 vials or straws depending on the quantity of the [[ejaculate]], whether the sample is washed or unwashed, or whether it is being prepared for IVF use. Following analysis of an individual donor's sperm, straws or vials may be prepared which contain differing amounts of motile sperm post-thaw. The number of sperm in a straw prepared for IVF use, for example, will be significantly less than the number of motile sperm in a straw prepared for ICI or IUI and there will therefore be more IVF straws per ejaculate. Following the necessary quarantine period, the samples are thawed and used to inseminate women through artificial insemination or other [[assisted reproductive technology|ART]] treatments.

===Medical issues===

====Screening====
{{Main article|Screening of potential sperm bank donors}}
Sperm banks typically screen potential donors for [[genetic diseases]], [[chromosomal abnormalities]] and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s that may be transmitted through sperm. The screening procedure generally also includes a quarantine period, in which the samples are frozen and stored for at least six months after which the donor will be re-tested for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STIs). This is to ensure no new infections have been acquired or have developed during the period of donation. Providing the result is negative, the sperm samples can be released from quarantine and used in treatments. [[Donor conceived person|Children conceived through sperm donation]] have a birth defect rate of almost a fifth compared to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1983-09-01/The-Sperm-Crisis.aspx|title=The Male Fertility Crisis|work=Mother Earth News|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Samples required per donor offspring====
The number of donor samples (ejaculates) that is required to help give rise to a child varies substantially from donor to donor, as well as from clinic to clinic. However, the following equations generalize the main factors involved:

For [[intracervical insemination]]:
:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{V_s \times c \times r_s}{n_r} &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Success rates by amount of sperm.svg|thumb|right|250px|Approximate [[pregnancy rate]] (''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) varies with amount of sperm used in a cycle (''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;). Values are for intrauterine insemination, with sperm number in [[total sperm count]], which may be approximately twice the [[total motile sperm count]]. (Old data, rates are likely higher today)]]

:''N'' is how many children a single sample can help give rise to.
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of a sample (ejaculate), usually between 1.0&amp;nbsp;[[milliliters|mL]] and 6.5&amp;nbsp;mL &lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Essig |first=Maria G. | name-list-format = vanc |editor1-first=Susan |editor1-last=Van Houten |editor2-first=Tracy |editor2-last=Landauer |title=Semen Analysis |work=Healthwise |publisher=WebMD |date=2007-02-20 |url=http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/semen-analysis?page=1 |access-date=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''c'' is the concentration of motile sperm in a sample ''after freezing and thawing'', approximately 5-20 million per ml but varies substantially
:''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[pregnancy rate]] per cycle, between 10% to 35%&lt;ref name=cryos&gt;[http://dk.cryosinternational.com/clinics/questions-answers.aspx#5351 Cryos International - What is the expected pregnancy rate (PR) using your donor semen?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107151459/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/clinics/questions-answers.aspx |date=2011-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=utrecht&gt;[http://faqs.cs.uu.nl/na-dir/medicine/infertility-faq/part4.html Utrecht CS News] Subject: Infertility FAQ (part 4/4)&lt;/ref&gt;
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[total motile sperm count]] recommended for vaginal insemination (VI) or intra-cervical insemination ([[Intracervical Insemination|ICI]]), approximately 20 million pr. ml.&lt;ref name=Cryos5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7169|title=Frequently asked questions - Cryos International Sperm Bank|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7169|archive-date=28 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pregnancy rate increases with increasing number of motile sperm used, but only up to a certain degree, when other factors become limiting instead.

{{For|derivation of the equation|Artificial insemination#Samples per child}}

With these numbers, one sample would on average help giving rise to 0.1–0.6 children, that is, it actually takes on average 2–5 samples to make a child.

For [[intrauterine insemination]], a ''centrifugation fraction'' (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) may be added to the equation:
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the fraction of the volume that remains after centrifugation of the sample, which may be about half (0.5) to a third (0.33).

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{V_s \times f_c \times c \times r_s}{n_r} &lt;/math&gt;

Only 5 million motile sperm may be needed per cycle with IUI (''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;=5 million)&lt;ref name=cryos/&gt;

Thus, only 1–3 samples may be needed for a child if used for IUI.

Using [[assisted reproductive technology|ART]] treatments such as [[IVF]] can result in one donor sample (or ejaculate) producing on average considerably more than one birth. However, the actual number of births per sample will depend on the actual [[assisted reproductive technology|ART]] method used, the age and medical condition of the female bearing the child, and the quality of the embryos produced by fertilization. Donor sperm is less commonly used for [[IVF]] treatments than for [[artificial insemination]]. This is because [[IVF]] treatments are usually required only when there is a problem with the female conceiving, or where there is a 'male factor problem' involving the female's partner. Donor sperm is also used for [[IVF]] in surrogacy arrangements where an embryo may be created in an [[IVF]] procedure using donor sperm and this is then implanted in a surrogate. In a case where [[IVF]] treatments are employed using donor sperm, surplus embryos may be donated to other women or couples and used in [[embryo transfer]] procedures. When donor sperm is used for [[IVF]] treatments, there is a risk that large numbers of children will be born from a single donor since a single ejaculate may produce up to 20 straws for IVF use. A single straw can fertilise a number of eggs and these can have a 40% to 50% pregnancy rate. 'Spare' embryos from donor treatments are frequently donated to other women or couples. Many sperm banks therefore limit the amount of semen from each donor which is prepared for [[IVF]] use, or they may restrict the period of time for which such a donor donates his sperm to perhaps as little as three months (about nine or ten ejaculates).

===Choosing donors===

====Information about donor====
In the US, sperm banks maintain lists or catalogues of donors which provide basic information such as racial origin, skin color, height, weight, color of eyes, and blood group.&lt;ref name="livescience.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/060523_bad_banks.html|title=The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Sperm|work=LiveScience.com|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these catalogues are available via the Internet, while others are only made available to patients when they apply for treatment. Some sperm banks make additional information about each donor available for an additional fee, and others make additional basic information known to children produced from donors when those children reach the age of eighteen. Some clinics offer "exclusive donors" whose sperm is only used to produce pregnancies for one recipient female. How accurate this is, or can be, is not known, and neither is it known whether the information produced by sperm banks, or by the donors themselves, is true. Many sperm banks will, however, carry out checks to verify the information requested, such as checking the identity of the donor and contacting his own doctor to verify medical details. Simply because such information is not verifiable does not imply that it is in any way inaccurate, and a sperm bank will rely upon its reputation which, in turn, will be based upon its success rate and upon the accuracy of the information about its donors which it makes available.

In the UK, most donors are anonymous at the point of donation and recipients can only see non-identifying information about their donor (height, weight, ethnicity, etc.). Donors need to provide identifying information to the clinic and clinics will usually ask the donor's GP to confirm any medical details they have been given. Donors are asked to provide a pen portrait of themselves which is held by the [[HFEA]] and can be obtained by the adult conceived from the donation at the age of 16, along with identifying information such as the donor's name and last known address at 18. Known donation is permitted and it is not uncommon for family or friends to donate to a recipient couple.

Qualities that potential recipients typically prefer in donors include the donors being tall, college educated, and with a consistently high sperm count.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Almeling |first1=Rene | name-list-format = vanc |title=Selling Genes, Selling Gender: Egg Agencies, Sperm Banks, and the Medical Market in Genetic Material |journal=American Sociological Review |date=24 June 2016 |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=319–340 |doi=10.1177/000312240707200301}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review came to the result that 68% of donors had given information to the clinical staff regarding physical characteristics and education but only 16% had provided additional information such as hereditary aptitudes and temperament or character.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

====Other screening criteria====
Sexually active gay men are prohibited or discouraged from donating in some countries, including the US. Sperm banks also screen out some potential donors based on height, baldness, and family medical history.&lt;ref name="livescience.com"/&gt;

===Number of offspring===
{{Further information|Sperm donation laws by country}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}Where a donor donates sperm through a sperm bank, the sperm bank will generally undertake a number of checks to ensure that the donor produces sperm of sufficient quantity and quality and that the donor is healthy and will not pass diseases through the use of his sperm. The donor's sperm must also withstand the freezing and thawing process necessary to store and quarantine the sperm. The cost to the sperm bank for such tests is considerable,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2016}} which normally means that clinics may use the same donor to produce a number of pregnancies in multiple women.

The number of children permitted from a single donor varies by law and practice. These laws are designed to protect the children produced by sperm donation as well as the donor's natural children from [[consanguinity]] in later life: they are not intended to protect the donor himself and those donating sperm will be aware that their donations may give rise to numerous pregnancies in different jurisdictions. Such laws, where they exist, vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and a sperm bank may also impose its own limits. The latter will be based on the reports of pregnancies which the sperm bank receives, although this relies upon the accuracy of the returns and the actual number of pregnancies may therefore be somewhat higher. Nevertheless, sperm banks frequently impose a lower limit on geographical numbers than some jurisdictions and may also limit the overall number of pregnancies permitted from a single donor. The limitation on the number of children which a donor's sperm may give rise to is usually expressed in terms of 'families', on the expectation that children within the family are prohibited from sexual relations under incest laws. In effect, the term ''family'' means a "woman" and usually includes the donor's partner or ex-partner, so that multiple donations to the same woman are not counted in the limit. The limits usually apply within one jurisdiction, so that donor sperm may be used in other jurisdictions. There is no limit on the number of donations that can be made to the same woman.

There is no limit to the number of offspring which may be produced from private donors.

Despite laws limiting the number of offspring, some donors may produce substantial numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/31/fathered-34-children-sperm-donation|title=I fathered 34 children through sperm donation|last=Whitman|first=Chris| name-list-format = vanc |date=2014-01-31|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; of children, particularly where they donate through different clinics, where sperm is onsold or is exported to different jurisdictions, and where countries or jurisdictions do not have a central register of donors.

Sperm agencies, in contrast to sperm banks, rarely impose or enforce limits on the number of children which may be produced by a single donor partly because they are not empowered to demand a report of a pregnancy from recipients and are rarely, if ever, able to guarantee that a female may have a subsequent sibling by the donor who was the biological father of her first or earlier children.

In the media, there have been reports of some donors producing anywhere from over 40 offspring &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/health/44-donor-siblings-and-counting/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5739670c47a7 44 siblings and counting]&lt;/ref&gt; to several hundred or more. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/health/06donor.html One Sperm Donor, 150 Offspring]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siblings====
Where a female wishes to conceive additional children by sperm donation, she will often wish to use the same donor. The advantage of having subsequent children by the same donor is that these will be full biological siblings, having the same biological father and mother. Many sperm banks offer a service of storing sperm for future pregnancies, but few will otherwise guarantee that sperm from the original donor will be available.

Sperm banks rarely impose limits on the numbers of second or subsequent siblings. Even where there are limits on the use of sperm by a particular donor to a defined number of families (as in the UK) the actual number of children produced from each donor will often be far greater.

Since 2000, donor conceived people have been locating their biological siblings and even their donor through web services such as the [[Donor Sibling Registry]] as well as DNA testing services such as [[Ancestry.com]] and [[23andMe]]. By using these services, donors can find offspring despite the fact that they may have donated anonymously. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/sperm-donor-dna-testing-1.4500517&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://stluciatimes.com/2018/10/01/super-sperm-donor-may-have-1000-children/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donor payment===
The majority of donors who donate through a sperm bank receive some form of payment, although this is rarely a significant amount. A review including 29 studies from 9 countries found that the amount of money donors received varied from $10 to €70 per donation or sample.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; The payments vary from the situation in the United Kingdom where donors are only entitled to their expenses, to the situation with some US sperm banks where a donor receives a set fee for each donation plus an additional amount for each vial stored. At one prominent California sperm bank for example, TSBC, donors receive roughly $50 for each donation which has acceptable motility/survival rates both at donation and at a test-thaw a couple of days later. Because of the requirement for the two-day abstinence period before donation, and geographical factors which usually require the donor to travel, it is not a viable way to earn a significant income. Some private donors may seek remuneration although others donate for altruistic reasons. According to the [[EU Tissue Directive]] donors in EU may only receive compensation, which is strictly limited to making good the expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. A survey among sperm donors in Cryos International Sperm bank &lt;ref name=Cryos4&gt;[http://dk.cryosinternational.com/media/132834/0612_001.pdf Attitudes among sperm donors …] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722064939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/media/132834/0612_001.pdf |date=2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that altruistic as well as financial motives were the main factors for becoming a donor. However, when the compensation was increased 100% in 2004 (to DKK 500) it did not significantly affect the numbers of new donor candidates coming in or the frequency of donations from the existing donors. When the compensation was reduced to the previous level (DKK 250) again one year later in 2005 there was no effect either. This led to the assumption that altruism is the main motive and that financial compensation is secondary.

Equipment to collect, freeze and store sperm is available to the public notably through certain US outlets, and some donors process and store their own sperm which they then sell via the Internet.

The selling price of processed and stored sperm is considerably more than the sums received by donors. Treatments with donor sperm are generally expensive and are seldom available free of charge through national health services. Sperm banks often package treatments into e.g. three cycles, and in cases of IVF or other ART treatments, they may reduce the charge if a patient donates any spare embryos which are produced through the treatment. There is often more demand for fertility treatment with donor sperm than there is donor sperm available, and this has the effect of keeping the cost of such treatments reasonably high.

===Onselling===
{{Main article|Onselling of sperm}}
There is a market for vials of processed sperm and for various reasons a sperm bank may sell-on stocks of vials which it holds (known as 'onselling'). Onselling enables a sperm bank to maximize the sale and disposal of sperm samples which it has processed. The reasons for onselling may be where part of, or even the main business of, a particular sperm bank is to process and store sperm rather than to use it in fertility treatments, or where a sperm bank is able to collect and store more sperm than it can use within nationally set limits. In the latter case, a sperm bank may sell on sperm from a particular donor for use in another jurisdiction after the number of pregnancies achieved from that donor has reached its national maximum.

==Psychological issues==
{{anchor|psychological}}
{{Further information|Donor conceived people#Psychological and social}}

===Informing the child===
Many donees do not inform the child that they were conceived through sperm donation, or, when non-anonymous donor sperm has been used, they do not tell the child until they are old enough for the clinic to provide contact information about the donor. Some believe that it is a human right for a person to know who their biological mother and father are, and thus it should be illegal to conceal this information in any way and at any time. For donor conceived children who find out after a long period of secrecy, their main grief is usually not the fact that they are not the genetic child of the couple who have raised them, but the fact that the parent or parents have kept information from or lied to them, causing loss of trust.&lt;ref name=barratt/&gt;

There are certain circumstances where the child very likely should be told:

===Other family members===
Parents of donors, who are the grandparents of donor offspring and may therefore be the oldest surviving progenitors, may regard the donated genetic contribution as a family asset, and may regard the donor conceived people as their grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/my-scattered-grandchildren/article1286201/ My scattered grandchildren] ''The Globe and Mail''. Alison Motluk. Sunday, September 13, 2009 07:53PM EDT&lt;/ref&gt;

A review came to the result that a minority of actual donors involved their partner in the decision-making process of becoming a donor.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; In one study, 25% of donors felt they needed permission from their partner.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; In another study, however, 37% of donors with a partner did not approve of a consent form for partners and rather felt that donors should make their own decisions.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; In a Swedish study, donors reported either enthusiastic or neutral responses from their partners concerning sperm donation.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

It is considered common for donors to not tell their spouses that they are or have been sperm donors. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sperm-donor-dad-when-strangers-shared-dna-become-family-n937366 From sperm donor to 'Dad': When strangers with shared DNA become a family]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mother-child relation===
Studies have indicated that donor insemination mothers show greater emotional involvement with their child, and they enjoy motherhood more than mothers by natural conception and adoption. Compared to mothers by natural conception, donor insemination mothers tend to show higher levels of disciplinary aggression.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilioi EC, Golombok S | title = Psychological adjustment in adolescents conceived by assisted reproduction techniques: a systematic review | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–96 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25281685 | pmc = 4255607 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have indicated that donor insemination fathers express more warmth and emotional involvement than fathers by natural conception and adoption, enjoy fatherhood more, and are less involved in disciplining their adolescent. Some donor insemination parents become overly involved with their children.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"/&gt;

Adolescents born through sperm donation to lesbian mothers have reported themselves to be academically successful, with active friendship networks, strong family bonds, and overall high ratings of well-being. It is estimated that over 80% of adolescents feel they can confide in their mothers, and almost all regard their mothers to be good role models.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"/&gt;

===Motivation vs reluctance to donate===
A [[systematic review]] came to the result that [[altruism]] and financial compensation are the main motivations to donate, and to a lesser degree procreation or genetic fatherhood and questions about the donor's own fertility.&lt;ref name="Broeck2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van den Broeck U, Vandermeeren M, Vanderschueren D, Enzlin P, Demyttenaere K, D'Hooghe T | title = A systematic review of sperm donors: demographic characteristics, attitudes, motives and experiences of the process of sperm donation | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–51 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23146866 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial compensation is generally more prevalent than altruism as a motivation among donors in countries where the compensation is large, which is largely explained by a larger number of economically driven people becoming donors in such countries.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Among men who do not donate, the main reason thereof has been stated to be a lack of motivation rather than concerns about the donation.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

Reluctance to donate may be caused by a sense of ownership and responsibility for the well-being of the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McMahon CA, Saunders DM | title = Attitudes of couples with stored frozen embryos toward conditional embryo donation | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 91 | issue = 1 | pages = 140–7 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18053994 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for donors===
In the UK, the [[National Gamete Donation Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ngdt.co.uk/ National Gamete Donation Trust&lt;/ref&gt; is a charity which provides information, advice and support for people wishing to become egg, sperm or embryo donors. The Trust runs a national helpline and online discussion list for donors to talk to each other.

In one Danish study, 40% of donors felt happy thinking about possible offspring, but 40% of donors sometimes worried about the future of resulting offspring.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

A review came to the result that one in three actual donors would like counselling to address certain implications of their donation, expecting that counselling could help them to give their decision some thought and to look at all the involved parties in the donation.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

A [[systematic review]] in 2012 came to the conclusion that the psychosocial needs and experiences of the donors, and their follow-up and counselling are largely neglected in studies on sperm donation.&lt;ref name="Broeck2012"/&gt;

==Ethical and legal issues==
===Anonymity===&lt;!--limited donor information redirects here--&gt;
Anonymous sperm donation occurs under the condition that recipients and offspring will never learn the identity of the donor. A non-anonymous donor, however, will disclose his identity to recipients. A donor who makes a non-anonymous sperm donation is termed a ''known donor'', an ''open identity donor'',  or an ''identity release donor''.

Non-anonymous sperm donors are, to a substantially higher degree, driven by altruistic motives for their donations.&lt;ref name=werner/&gt;

Even in the case of anonymous donation, some information about the donor may be released to recipients at the time of treatment. ''Limited donor information'' includes height, weight, eye, skin and hair colour. In Sweden, this is the extent of disclosed information. In the US, however, additional information may be given, such as a comprehensive biography and sound/video samples.

Several jurisdictions (e.g., Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Britain, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand, and others) only allow non-anonymous sperm donation. This is generally based on the principle that a child has a right to know his or her biological origins. In 2013, a German court precedent was set based on a case brought by a 21-year-old woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/court-rules-sperm-donors-children-have-right-to-know/a-16580116|title=Court rules sperm donors' children have right to know | date = 6 February 2013 | work = Deutsche Welle |access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these jurisdictions require sperm banks to keep up-to-date records and to release identifying information about the donor to his offspring after they reach a certain age (15–18). See [[Sperm donation laws by country]].

====Attitudes towards anonymity====
For most sperm recipients, anonymity of the donor is not of major importance at the obtainment or [[Single parent#Choice parent|tryer]]-stage.&lt;ref name=werner&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ekerhovd E, Faurskov A, Werner C | title = Swedish sperm donors are driven by altruism, but shortage of sperm donors leads to reproductive travelling | journal = Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences | volume = 113 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–13 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18991243 | doi = 10.3109/2000-1967-241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous sperm is often less expensive. Another reason that recipients choose anonymous donors is concern about the role that the donor or the child may want the donor to play in the child's life. Sperm recipients may prefer a non-anonymous donor if they anticipate disclosing donor conception to their child and anticipate the child's desire to seek more information about their donor in the future. A Dutch study found that lesbian couples are significantly more likely (98%) to choose non-anonymous donors than heterosexual couples (63%). Of the heterosexual couples that opted for anonymous donation, 83% intended never to inform their child of their conception via sperm donation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/820.full.pdf Breaeys, A., de Bruyn, J.K., Louwe, L.A., Helmerhorst, F.M., "Anonymous or identity registered sperm donors? A study of Dutch recipients choices", ''Human Reproduction'' Vol. 20, No. 3 pp. 820–824, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

For children conceived by an anonymous donor, the impossibility of contacting a biological father or the inability to find information about him can potentially be psychologically burdensome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-11-06/news/donor-babies-search-for-their-anonymous-fathers/1|title=Donor Babies Search for Their Anonymous Fathers |first=Craig |last=Malisow | name-list-format = vanc |date=5 November 2008|work=houstonpress.com|access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study estimated that approximately 67% of [[adolescent]] [[donor conceived children]] with an identity-release donor plan to contact him when they turn 18.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"/&gt;

=====Among donors and potential donors=====
Among donors, a [[systematic review]] of 29 studies from nine countries concluded that 20–50% of donors would still be willing to donate even if anonymity could not be guaranteed.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Between 40 and 97% of donors agree to release non-identifying information such as physical characteristics and level of education.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; The proportion of actual donors wishing for contact with their offspring varies between 10 and 88%.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Most donors are not open to contact with offspring, although more open attitudes are observed among single and homosexual donors.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; About half of donors feel that degree of involvement should be decided by the intended parents.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Some of the donors prefer contact with offspring in a non-visible way, such as where the child can ask questions but the donor will not reveal his identity.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; One study recruited donors through the [[Donor Sibling Registry]] who wanted contact with offspring or who had already made contact with offspring. It resulted that none of the donors said that there was "no relationship", a third of donors felt it was a special relationship, almost like a very good friend, and a quarter felt it was merely a genetic bond and nothing more. Fifteen percent of actual donors considered offspring to be "their own children".&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;  On the whole, donors feel that the first step towards contact should come from offspring rather than parents or the donor himself.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Some even say that it is the moral responsibility of the donor not to seek contact with offspring.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

The same review indicated that up to 37% of donors reported changes in their attitude towards anonymity before and after donation, with one in four being prepared to be more open about themselves after the donation than before (as a "potential donor").&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Among potential donors, 30–46% of potential donors would still be willing to donate even if anonymity could not be guaranteed.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Still, more than 75% of these potential donors felt positive towards releasing non-identifying information to offspring, such as physical characteristics and level of education.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Single or homosexual men are significantly more inclined to release their identity than married, heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Potential donors with children are less inclined to want to meet offspring than potential donors without children (9 versus 30% in the review).&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Potential donors in a relationship are less inclined to consider contact with offspring than single potential donors (7 versus 28% in the review).&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; From US data, 20% would actively want to know and meet offspring and 40% would not object if the child wished to meet but would not solicit a meeting themselves.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; From Swedish data, where only non-anonymous donation is permitted in clinics, 87% of potential donors had a positive attitude towards future contact with offspring, although 80% of these potential donors did not feel that the donor had any moral responsibilities for the child later in life.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Also from UK data, 80% of potential donors did not feel responsible for whatever happened with their sperm after the donation.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; With variation between different studies, between 33% and 94% of potential donors want to know at least whether or not the donation resulted in offspring.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Some of these potential donors merely wanted to know if a pregnancy had been achieved but did not want to know any specific information about the offspring (e.g. sex, date of birth).&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Other potential donors felt that knowing the outcome of the donation made the experience more meaningful.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; In comparison, a German study came to the result that 11% of donors actually asked about the outcome in the clinic where they donated.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

An Australian study concluded that potential donors who would still be willing to donate without a guarantee of anonymity were not automatically more open to extended or intimate contact with offspring.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

====Donor tracking====
Even when donors choose to be anonymous, offspring may still find ways to learn more about their biological origins. Registries and DNA databases have been developed for this purpose. Registries that help donor-conceived offspring identify half-siblings from other mothers also help avoid [[accidental incest]] in adulthood.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.donorchildren.com/|title=DonorChildren|website=www.donorchildren.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-07/dingle-the-reality-of-sperm-donors-is-hitting-home/7006906|title=The reality of sperm donation is hitting home|date=2015-12-07|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tracking by registries=====
{{Further information|Donor sibling registration}}
Offspring of anonymous donors may often have the ability to obtain their biological father's donor number from the fertility clinic or sperm bank used for their birth. They may then share their number on a registry. By finding shared donor numbers, offspring may find their genetic half-siblings. The donor may also find his number on a registry and choose to make contact with his offspring or otherwise reveal his identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=====Tracking by DNA databases=====
Even sperm donors who have chosen anonymity and not to contact their offspring through a registry are now increasingly being traced by their children. Improved DNA technology has brought into question the possibility of assuring a donor's anonymity. For example, at least one child found his biological father using his own DNA test and internet research, and was able to identify and contact his anonymous donor.&lt;ref name="newscien"&gt;

===Fertility tourism and international sperm markets===
{{Further information|Fertility tourism#Donor insemination destinations}}
Different factors motivate individuals to seek sperm from outside their home state. For example, some jurisdictions do not allow unmarried women to receive donor sperm. Jurisdictional regulatory choices as well as cultural factors that discourage sperm donation have also led to international [[fertility tourism]] and sperm markets.

====Sweden====
When [[Sweden]] banned anonymous sperm donation in 1980, the number of active sperm donors dropped from approximately 200 to 30.&lt;ref name=sydsvenskan&gt;Sydsvenskan:[Här börjar livet för 100 svenska barn varje år (Google translate:Here begins the lives of 100 Swedish children each year).] By Karen Söderberg 17 April 2005 00:00&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden now has an 18-month waiting list for donor sperm.&lt;ref name=werner/&gt; At least 250&lt;ref name="werner"/&gt; Swedish sperm recipients travel to Denmark annually for insemination. Some of this is also due to the fact that [[Denmark]] also allows single women to be inseminated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100905072034/http://theimpudentobserver.com/world-news/single-women-head-for-denmark-for-guess-what/ Single Women Head For Denmark For Guess What?] ''The Impudent Observer''. July 24, 2009 by Fred Stopsky&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
After the [[United Kingdom]] ended anonymous sperm donation in 2005, the numbers of sperm donors went up, reversing a three-year decline.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/3411.html |title=New donor registrations |work = Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, Strategy and Information Directorate, Web |last=team, |date= |publisher =hfea.gov.uk |access-date=29 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606000000/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/3411.html |archive-date=6 June 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still a shortage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/3422.html#3426|title=4Sperm, Egg and Embryo Donation |work=hfea.gov.uk|access-date=29 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127025158/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/3422.html#3426|archive-date=27 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and some doctors have suggested raising the limit of children per donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/337/nov11_3/a2318|title=Sperm donation in the UK|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some UK clinics import sperm from [[Scandinavia]].

Despite the shortage, sperm exports from the UK are legal and donors may remain anonymous in this context. However, the HFEA does impose safeguards on the export of sperm, such as that it must be exported to fertility clinics only and that the result of any treatment must be traceable. Sperm banks impose their own limits on the number of pregnancies obtained from exported sperm.

Since 2009, the import of sperm via registered clinics for use in the UK has been authorised by the HFEA. The sperm must have been processed, stored and quarantined in compliance with UK regulations. The donors have agreed to be identified when the children produced with their sperm reach the age of eighteen. The number of children produced from such donors in the UK will, of course, be subject to HFEA rules (i.e. currently a limit of ten families,) but the donors' sperm may be used worldwide in accordance with the clinic's own limit of one child per 200.000 of population, subject to national or local limits which apply.  By 2014 the UK was importing nearly 40% of its sperm requirements, up from 10% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldglobe.com/index.php/sid/223347153/scat/2411cd3571b4f088/ht/UK-facing-major-sperm-shortage-due-to-donor-shortfall|title=UK facing major sperm shortage due to donor shortfall - Herald Globe|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 it was reported that almost half of the imported sperm into Britain came from Denmark (3,000 units).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/25/why-are-british-women-using-danish-sperm-to-get-pregnant-7881940/|title=Why are British women using Danish sperm to get pregnant?|last=Olsen|first=Martine Berg|date=2018-08-25|work=Metro|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social controversy===
The use of sperm donation is most common among single women and lesbians.&lt;ref name = "TheTimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/times2/looking-for-a-sperm-donor-swipe-right-l8zth7lgp|title=Looking for a sperm donor?

This produces many ethical issues around the ideals of conventional parenting and has wider issues for society as a whole, including the issues of the role of men as parents, family support for children, and financial support for women with children.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-30/the-ins-and-outs-of-sperm-donation/6732288|title=The ins and outs of sperm donation|date=2015-08-30|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of sperm banks and fertility clinics, the use of sperm agencies and the availability of anonymous donor sperm have served to make sperm donation a more respectable, and therefore a more socially acceptable, procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-21/women-choosing-diy-ivf-sperm-insemination-to-become-mums/8702818|title=Single women taking DIY path to motherhood|date=2017-07-21|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention of doctors and others may be seen as making the whole process a respectable and merely a medical procedure which raises no moral issues, where donor inseminations may be referred to as 'treatments' and donor children as 'resulting from the use of a donor's sperm', or 'born following donation' and subsequent children may be described as 'born using the same donor' rather than as biological children of the same male.

A 2009 study has indicated that both men and women view the use of donor sperm with more skepticism compared with the use of donor eggs, suggesting a unique underlying perception regarding the use of male donor gametes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisenberg ML, Smith JF, Millstein SG, Walsh TJ, Breyer BN, Katz PP | title = Perceived negative consequences of donor gametes from male and female members of infertile couples | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 921–6 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 19523614 | pmc = 2888643 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As acceptance of sperm donation has generally increased, so has the level of questioning as to whether 'artificial' means of conception are necessary, and some donor children too, have been critical of the procedures which were taken to bring them into the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Against this background has been the increase in the use of [[Insemination|NI]] as a method of sperm donation. However, while some donors may be willing to offer this as a method of impregnation, it has many critics and it also raises further legal and social challenges.

Some donor children grow up wishing to find out who their fathers were, but others may be wary of embarking on such a search since they fear they may find scores of half-siblings who have been produced from the same sperm donor. Even though local laws or rules may restrict the numbers of offspring from a single donor, there are no worldwide limitations or controls and most sperm banks will [[wikt:onsell|onsell]] and export all their remaining stocks of vials of sperm when local maxima have been attained (see 'onselling' above).

One item of research has suggested that donor children have a greater likelihood of [[substance abuse]], [[mental illness]] and [[criminal]] behavior when grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2256212|title=New study shows sperm-donor kids suffer.|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its motivation and credibility have been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_65970.asp|title=BioNews - 'My Daddy's Name is Donor': Read with caution!|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming forward publicly with problems is difficult for donor-conceived people as these issues are very personal and a public statement may attract criticism. Additionally, it may upset their parents if they speak out. A website called Anonymous Us&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anonymousus.org/stories/index.php?cid=2|title=The Anonymous Us Project: Stories from Donor Conceived|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been set up where they can post details of their experiences anonymously, on which there are many accounts of problems.

==Religious responses==
{{further information|Religious response to assisted reproductive technology}}

There are a wide range of religious responses to sperm donation, with some religious thinkers entirely in support of the use of donor sperm for pregnancy, some who support its use under certain conditions, and some entirely against.

===Catholicism===
Catholicism officially opposes both the donation of sperm and the use of donor sperm on the basis that it compromises the sexual unity of the marital relationship and the idea "that the procreation of a human person be brought about as the fruit of the conjugal act specific to the love between spouses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20081208_dignitas-personae_en.html#_ftnref20 Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: Instruction on Dignitas Personae on Certain Bioethical Questions], para. 12, quoting Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Instruction Donum vitae, II, B, 4: AAS 80 (1988), 92., and Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Instruction Donum vitae, Introduction, 3: AAS 80 (1988), 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Jewish thinkers hold a broad range of positions on sperm donation. Some Jewish communities are totally against sperm donation from donors that are not the husbands of the recipient, while others have approved the use of donor insemination in some form, while liberal communities accept it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mazornet.com/infertility/insemination.htm Artificial Insemination: Infertility and Judaism]", Mazornet.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorff, Elliot, "[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Bioethics/Fertility_Technology/Artificial_Insemination.shtml Artificial Insemination in Jewish Law]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard V. Grazi, MD, Joel B. Wolowelsky, PhD, "[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/ethic/donor-1.htm Donor Gametes for Assisted Reproduction in Contemporary Jewish Law and Ethics]", Assisted Reproduction Reviews 2:3 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] holds that sperm donation from a third party violates the marital bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Woodruff | first=Teresa| name-list-format = vanc | author-link = Teresa Woodruff | title=Oncofertility: Ethical, Legal, Social, and Medical Perspectives| publisher=Springer| year=2010| isbn=1441965173| page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1884, Professor William Pancoast of Philadelphia's Jefferson Medical College performed an insemination on the wife of a sterile Quaker merchant, which may be the first insemination procedure that resulted in the birth of a child. Instead of taking the sperm from the husband, the professor [[Chloroform#Anesthetic|chloroformed]] the woman, then let his medical students vote which one of among them was "best looking", with that elected one providing the sperm that was then syringed into her [[cervix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intent.com/blog/2008/12/07/donor-babies-search-anonymous-fathers Donor Babies Search for the Anonymous Fathers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209025735/http://www.intent.com/blog/2008/12/07/donor-babies-search-anonymous-fathers |date=2008-12-09 }} From: Donorconceived Adult. Posted: Sunday, December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At the husband's request, his wife was never told how she became pregnant. As a result of this experiment, the merchant's wife gave birth to a son, who became the first known child by donor insemination. The case was not revealed until 1909, when a letter by Addison Davis Hard appeared in the American journal ''Medical World'', highlighting the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Medical World |date=April 1909 |pages=163–164 |title=Letter to the Editor: Artificial Impregnation |url=http://familyscholars.org/2011/02/17/4579/ |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724221400/http://familyscholars.org/2011/02/17/4579/ |archive-date=2012-07-24 |df= }} (cited in {{cite journal | vauthors = Gregoire AT, Mayer RC | title = The Impregnators.

Since then, a few doctors began to perform private donor insemination. Such procedures were regarded as intensely private, if not secret, by the parties involved. Records were usually not maintained so that donors could not be identified for paternity proceedings. Technology permitted the use of fresh sperm only, and it is thought that sperm largely came from the doctors and their male staff, although occasionally they would engage private donors who were able to donate on short notice on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/whitny-braun/a-doctor-a-quaker-woman-a_b_8891324.html|title=A Doctor, a Quaker Woman and a Galvanized Rubber Syringe: The 19th Century Origins of Artificial Insemination in America|last=Braun|first=Whitny| name-list-format = vanc |date=2015-12-31|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, [[Mary Barton (obstetrician)|Mary Barton]] and others published an article in the British Medical Journal on sperm donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barton M, Walker K, Wiesner BP | title = Artificial Insemination | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 4384 | pages = 40–3 | date = January 1945 | pmid = 20785841 | pmc = 2056529 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.4384.40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barton, a gynecologist, founded a clinic in London which offered [[Artificial Insemination by Donor|artificial insemination]] using donor sperm for women whose husbands were infertile. This clinic helped conceive 1,500 babies of which Mary Barton's husband, [[Bertold Wiesner|Bertold Weisner]], probably fathered about 600.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9193014/British-man-fathered-600-children-at-own-fertility-clinic.html |title=British man 'fathered 600 children' at own fertility clinic - Telegraph |last=Smith |first=Rebecca | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-08-10 |website= |publisher=The Telegraph |access-date=2016-10-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810041629/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9193014/British-man-fathered-600-children-at-own-fertility-clinic.html |archive-date=2016-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful human pregnancy using frozen sperm was in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/wendy-kramer/a-brief-history-of-donor-conception_b_9814184.html|title=A Brief History of Donor Conception|last=Kramer|first=Wendy| name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-05-10|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ombelet W, Van Robays J | title = Artificial insemination history: hurdles and milestones | journal = Facts, Views &amp; Vision in ObGyn | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–43 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26175891 | pmc = 4498171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Donor insemination remained virtually unknown to the public until 1954".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OBFNCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Donor+insemination+remained+virtually+unknown+to+the+public+until+1954.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rFR4N0PTyz&amp;sig=Wbh_uLfugR1pv2jf-CoKjXVk-_U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiKx63DvpbdAhXMdt4KHSXVCqgQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Donor%20insemination%20remained%20virtually%20unknown%20to%20the%20public%20until%201954.&amp;f=false|title=Hitler's Doubles: Fully-Illustrated|last=Kapnistos|first=Peter Fotis| name-list-format = vanc |date=2015-04-08|publisher=Peter Fotis Kapnistos|isbn=9781496071460|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year the first comprehensive account of the process was published in [[The British Medical Journal]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cryobank.com/learning-center/sperm-banking-101/sperm-banking-history/|title=Sperm Banking History {{!}} California Cryobank|website=cryobank.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donor insemination provoked heated public debate. In the United Kingdom, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] established the first in a long procession of commissions that, over the years, inquired into the practice. It was at first condemned by the [[Lambeth Conference]], which recommended that it be made a criminal offence. A Parliamentary Commission agreed. In Italy, the Pope declared donor insemination a sin, and proposed that anyone using the procedure be sent to prison.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Sperm donation gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=sperm%20donation%20&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1;,sperm%20donation;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|author=|date=|work=google.com|access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many western countries, sperm donation is now a largely accepted procedure. In the US and elsewhere, there are a large number of [[sperm bank]]s. A sperm bank in the US pioneered the use of on-line search catalogues for donor sperm, and these facilities are now widely available on the websites of sperm banks and fertility clinics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Recent years have also seen sperm donation become relatively less popular among heterosexual couples, who now have access to more sophisticated fertility treatments, and more popular among single women and lesbian couples&lt;ref name = TheTimes/&gt; - whose access to the procedure is relatively new and still prohibited in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/13/fertility-treatment-bans-in-europe-draw-criticism.html|title=Fertility Treatment Bans In Europe Draw Criticism|date=2012-04-13|newspaper=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1954, the Superior Court of [[Cook County, Illinois]] granted a husband a divorce because, regardless of the husband's consent, the woman's donor insemination constituted adultery, and that donor insemination was "contrary to public policy and good morals, and considered adultery on the mother's part." The ruling went on to say that, "A child so conceived, was born out of wedlock and therefore illegitimate. As such, it is the child of the mother, and the father has no rights or interest in said child."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.kentlaw.edu/files/doornbos-v-doornbos-appeal-139-n.e.-2d-844-_1956-1.pdf Doornbos v. Doornbos, 23 U.S.L.W. 2308] (Superior Court, Cook County, Ill., December 13, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the following year, Georgia became the first state to pass a statute legitimizing children conceived by donor insemination, on the condition that both the husband and wife consented in advance in writing to the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0shCDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38&amp;lpg=PT38&amp;dq=Georgia+became+the+first+state+to+pass+a+statute+legitimizing+children+conceived+by+donor+insemination,+on+the+condition+that+both+the+husband+and+wife+consented+in+advance+in+writing+to+the+procedure.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=deRG3UOpE3&amp;sig=Lvqfej8K1YwrZqv7s25itOZa84o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwii7MS6wJbdAhXFFYgKHeb4AUQQ6AEwCXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Georgia%20became%20the%20first%20state%20to%20pass%20a%20statute%20legitimizing%20children%20conceived%20by%20donor%20insemination,%20on%20the%20condition%20that%20both%20the%20husband%20and%20wife%20consented%20in%20advance%20in%20writing%20to%20the%20procedure.&amp;f=false|title=Donor Conception and the Search for Information: From Secrecy and Anonymity to Openness|last=Allan|first=Sonia| name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317177814|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and a year later, the [[American Bar Association]], approved the [[Uniform Parentage Act]]. This act provides that if a wife is artificially inseminated with donor semen under a physician's supervision, and with her husband's consent, the husband is legally considered the natural father of the donor inseminated child. That law was followed by similar legislation in many states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/parentage/upa73.pdf |title=Uniform Parentage Act 1973 |date=1973 |website=Uniform Law Commission |access-date= 31 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial sperm bank in the United States opened in [[Roseville, Minnesota]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBB listing for Cryogenics Laboratories|url=http://www.bbb.org/minnesota/business-reviews/sperm-banks/cryogenic-laboratories-in-saint-paul-mn-14003489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the Warnock Committee was formed in July 1982 to consider issues of sperm donation and assisted reproduction techniques.&lt;ref name="hfea.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/1319.html|title=How legislation on fertility treatment developed| work = Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, Strategy and Information Directorate |publisher =hfea.gov.uk|access-date=29 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414223630/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/1319.html|archive-date=14 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donor insemination was already available in the UK through unregulated clinics such as [[BPAS]]. Many of these clinics had started to offer sperm donation before the widespread use of freezing techniques. 'Fresh sperm' was donated to order by donors at the fertile times of patients requiring treatments. Commonly, infertility of a male partner or sterilisation was a reason for treatment. Donations were anonymous and unregulated.

The Warnock Committee's report was published on July 18, 1984.&lt;ref name="hfea.gov.uk"/&gt; and led to the passing of the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]]. That act provided for a system of licensing for fertility clinics and procedures. It also provided that, where a male donates sperm at a licensed clinic in the UK and his sperm is used at a UK clinic to impregnate a female, the male is not legally responsible for the resulting child.

The 1990 Act also established a UK central register of donors and donor births to be maintained by the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] (the 'HFEA'), a supervisory body established by the Act. Following the Act, for any act of sperm donation through a licensed UK clinic that results in a living child, information on the child and the donor must be recorded on the register. This measure was intended to reduce the risk of [[consanguinity]] as well as to enforce the limit on the number of births permitted by each donor. The natural child of any donor has access to non-identifying information about their donor, starting at the child's eighteenth birthday.

The emphasis of the 1990 Act was on protecting the unborn child. However, a general shortage of donor sperm at the end of the 20th century, exacerbated by the announcement of the removal of anonymity in the UK, led to concerns about the excessive use of the sperm of some donors. These concerns centered on the export and exchange of donor sperm with overseas clinics, and also the interpretation of the term 'sibling use' to include donated embryos produced from one sperm donor, and successive births by surrogates using eggs from different women but sperm from the same sperm donor. Donors were informed that up to ten births could be produced from their sperm, but the words 'other than in exceptional circumstances' in the consent form could potentially lead to many more pregnancies. These concerns led to the SEED Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/docs/SEEDReport05.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004080621/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/docs/SEEDReport05.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned by the HFEA, which was in turn followed by new legislation and rules meant to protect the interests of donors: When a male donates his sperm through a UK clinic, that sperm is not permitted to give rise to more than ten families total, anywhere in the world.

==International comparison==
{{Further information|Sperm donation laws by country}}
On the global market, Denmark has a well-developed system of sperm export. This success mainly comes from the reputation of Danish sperm donors for being of high [[sperm quality|quality]]&lt;ref name=ncbio/&gt; and, in contrast with the law in the other Nordic countries, gives donors the choice of being either anonymous or non-anonymous to the receiving couple.&lt;ref name=ncbio&gt;[http://www.norden.org/da/publikationer/publikationer/2006-505/at_download/publicationfile Assisted Reproduction in the Nordic Countries] ncbio.org&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Nordic sperm donors tend to be tall, with rarer features like blond hair or different color eyes and a light complexion, and highly educated&lt;ref name=newser&gt;[http://www.newser.com/story/34788/fda-rules-block-import-of-prized-danish-sperm.html FDA Rules Block Import of Prized Danish Sperm] Posted August 13, 08 7:37 AM CDT in World, Science &amp; Health&lt;/ref&gt; and have altruistic motives for their donations,&lt;ref name=newser/&gt; partly due to the relatively low monetary compensation in Nordic countries. More than 50 countries worldwide are importers of Danish sperm, including [[Paraguay]], [[Canada]], [[Kenya]], and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=ncbio/&gt; Several UK clinics also export donor sperm, but they must take steps to ensure that the maximum number of ten families produced from each donor is not exceeded. The use of the sperm outside the UK will also be subject to local rules. Within the EU there are now regulations governing the transfer of human tissue including sperm between member states to ensure that these take place between registered sperm banks. However, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) of the US has banned import of any sperm, motivated by a risk of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease|mad cow disease]], although such a risk is insignificant, since artificial insemination is very different from [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease#Transmission|the route of transmission of mad cow disease]].&lt;ref name=kotler&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/the-god-of-sperm/17290/ The God of Sperm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704215550/http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/the-god-of-sperm/17290/ |date=2008-07-04 }} By Steven Kotler&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease#Incidence and prevalence|prevalence of mad cow disease]] is one in a million, probably less for donors. If prevalence was the case, the infectious proteins would then have to cross the [[blood-testis barrier]] to make transmission possible.&lt;ref name=kotler/&gt; Transmission of the disease by an insemination is approximately equal to the risk of getting killed by lightning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/09162007/news/regionalnews/a_baby_bjorn_sperm_crisis.htm A 'BABY BJORN' SPERM CRISIS] NEW YORK POST.

Movie plots involving artificial insemination by donor are seen in ''[[Made in America (1993 film)|Made in America]]'', ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', ''[[The Back-Up Plan]]'', ''[[The Kids Are All Right (film)|The Kids Are All Right]]'', ''[[The Switch (2010 film)|The Switch]]'', ''[[Starbuck (film)|Starbuck]]'', and ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'', the latter also involving [[surrogacy]].&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/art/chi-0621-fertility-dramasjun21,0,2997759.story chicagotribune.com --&gt; Heartache of infertility shared on stage, screen] Colleen Mastony, ''Chicago Tribune''.

Films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of [[assisted reproductive technology]] have had an upswing first in the latter part of the 2000s (decade), although the techniques have been available for decades.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt; Yet, the number of people that can relate to it by personal experience in one way or another is ever growing, and the variety of trials and struggles is huge.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt;

'''Structured English Immersion (SEI)''' is a technique for rapidly teaching English to [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|English Language Learners]].  The term was coined by Keith Baker and Adriana de Kanter in a 1983 recommendation to schools to make use of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's]] successful [[French immersion]] programs.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian model was developed to encourage bilingualism through immersing Anglophones in the minority language and replaced [[language policies of the Canadian provinces and territories|many English-only laws in various Canadian provinces]] before the 1960s, while in the United States the same approach was advocated to force minority speakers to adopt English.

More recently, SEI has been defined as a methodology in which English language learners (ELLs) learn English through structured and sequential lessons. Specially developed for ELLs, these lessons are  based, to a large degree, on the mainstream curricula. (Haver, Johanna J., ''Structured English Immersion,'' Corwin Press, 2002)

In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Horne v. Flores, the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI is significantly more effective than [[bilingual education]]. Findings of the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004 strongly support this conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author      = SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SEI is mandatory in California, Arizona and Massachusetts where voter initiatives opted to restrict the use of bilingual education in preference for SEI.

== SEI Framework ==
Only Arizona mandates that its public schools implement SEI models as follows:
* Significant amounts of the school day are dedicated to the explicit teaching of the English language, and students are grouped for this instruction according to their level of English proficiency.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "The English language is the main content of SEI instruction. Academic content plays a supporting, but subordinate, role."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "English is the language of instruction; students and teachers are expected to speak, read, and write in English."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Teachers use instructional methods that treat English as a foreign language."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Students learn discrete English grammar skills."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Rigorous time lines are established for students to exit from the program."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* SEI program graduates continue to receive support services until they are reclassified as "fluent English proficient" whereby Federal law then requires students be monitored for two years after reclassification.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;

The frequency with which the US government has chosen to employ the practice of transferring prisoners to countries that practice torture has fluctuated from one administration to the next.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9333">In transport, [[tunnel]]s can be connected together to form a '''tunnel [[transport network|network]]'''. These can be used in [[mining]] to reach [[ore]] below ground, in cities for underground [[rapid transit]] systems, in [[sewer system]]s, in [[warfare]] to avoid enemy detection or attacks, as maintenance access routes beneath sites with high ground-traffic such as [[airport]]s and [[amusement park]]s, or to extend public living areas or commercial access while avoiding outdoor weather.

==In warfare==

===Sieges===
Tunnel networks were sometimes developed during [[siege warfare]], even dating back to [[classical antiquity]]. Starting with a single tunnels being dug to undermine a wall that might be detected by the defenders and met with counter-tunnels, leading to [[tunnel warfare]]. Defenders might first create a series of underground listing posts to preempt such mining attacks.

===Trench systems===
[[File:Gros Ouvrage du Michelsberg - Hohlgang.jpg|thumb|Connecting tunnel under [[Ouvrage Michelsberg]], a fortress of the [[Maginot Line]]]]

Any time the use of [[Trench warfare|trenches]] becomes extensive, this naturally leads to connecting them with tunnel networks for safe passage both along the trench lines and with rear areas. In [[World War I#Trench warfare begins|World War I]], when given enough time and resources, the underground components of the defenses could become more extensive than those above ground.

The French [[Maginot Line]], constructed from 1929 to 1939, was a chain of fortresses, bunkers, retractable turrets, outposts, obstacles, and sunken artillery emplacements, all linked by an extensive shell-proof underground tunnel network. It included underground barracks, shelters, ammo dumps and depots, and even had its own underground [[narrow gauge]] railways.

===In Vietnam===
[[Image:VietnamCuChiTunnels.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Part of the tunnel complex at Củ Chi, this tunnel has been made wider and taller to accommodate tourists.]]
The [[Củ Chi tunnels|tunnels of Củ Chi]] are an immense network of connecting underground tunnels located in the [[Củ Chi District]] of [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon), [[Vietnam]], and are part of a much larger network of tunnels that underlie much of the country. The Củ Chi tunnels were the location of several military campaigns during the [[Vietnam War]], and were the [[Viet Cong]]'s base of operations for the [[Tết Offensive]] in 1968.&lt;br/&gt;
The tunnels were used by Viet Cong soldiers as [[secret passage|hiding spots]] during combat, as well as serving as communication and supply routes, hospitals, food and weapon caches and living quarters for numerous North Vietnamese fighters. The tunnel systems were of great importance to the Viet Cong in their resistance to American forces, and helped to counter the growing American military effort.

[[Image:The Structureplan of Vinh Moc Tunnels.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Structureplan of Vinh Moc Tunnels.]]
The [[Vịnh Mốc tunnels]] are a tunnel complex in [[Quảng Trị]], [[Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]] it was strategically located on the border of [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]. The tunnels were built to shelter people from the intense bombing of Son Trung and Son Ha communes in Vinh Linh county of [[Quảng Trị Province]] in the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]].  The American forces believed the villagers of Vinh Moc were supplying food and armaments to the North Vietnamese garrison on the island of Con Co which was in turn hindering the American bombers on their way to bomb Hanoi. The idea was to force the villagers of Vinh Moc to leave the area but as is typical in Vietnam there was nowhere else to go. The villagers initially dug the tunnels to move their village 10 metres underground but the American forces designed bombs that burrowed down 10 metres. Eventually against these odds, the villagers moved the village to a depth of 30 metres. It was constructed in several stages beginning in 1966 and used until early 1972. The complex grew to include wells, kitchens, rooms for each family and spaces for healthcare. Around 60 families lived in the tunnels; as many as 17 children were born inside the tunnels.&lt;br/&gt;
The tunnels were a success and no villagers lost their lives. The only direct hit was from a bomb that failed to explode; the resulting hole was utilized as a ventilation shaft.&lt;br/&gt;
Three levels of tunnels were eventually built.

==In terrorism==
During the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], the Israeli military uncovered and destroyed 32 cross-border tunnels that went on for miles beneath [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and reached into [[State of Israel|Israeli]] territory. According to intelligence officials, Israeli engineers are developing a system that could detect and destroy cross-border tunnels for which the Israeli government has reportedly spent more than $250 million since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel Is Building a Secret Tunnel-Destroying Weapon|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/10/israel-is-building-a-secret-tunnel-destroying-weapon-hamas-us-gaza/|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21 Hamas members killed in tunnel collapses this year|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/222621|website=israelnationalnews.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaza Tunnel Collapsed; 2 Hamas Militants Killed|url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2016/12/09/074826727/Gaza-Tunnel-Collapsed-2-Hamas-Militants-Killed|website=Tempo.co|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A network of caves beneath the cities of [[Mosul]] and [[Badana]] were built by [[ISIS]].

==Overview==
Protests and verbal abuse are routinely aimed against union members or replacement workers who cross picket lines ("blacklegs" or "scabs") during industrial disputes. The inherent aim of a union is to create a labor [[monopoly]] so as to balance the [[monopsony]] a large employer enjoys as a purchaser of labor. [[Strikebreaker]]s threaten that goal and undermine the union's bargaining position, and occasionally this erupts into violent confrontation, with violence committed either by, or against, strikers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; Some who have sought to explain such violence observe, if labor disputes are accompanied by violence, it may be because labor has no legal redress.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing John Bascom, "Civil Law and Social Progress," The Independent, vol. xliv (September 15, 1892), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, some workers declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
..."the right of employers to manage their own business to suit themselves," is fast coming to mean in effect nothing less than a right to manage the country to suit themselves.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing the advisory committee of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers during the Homestead Strike&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Occasionally, violent disputes occur between unions, when one union breaks another's strike.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12795">'''Value theory''' is a range of approaches to understanding how, why, and to what degree persons value things; whether the object or subject of valuing is a person, idea, object, or anything else.

This investigation began in ancient [[philosophy]], where it is called axiology or [[ethics]]. Early philosophical investigations sought to understand [[good and evil]] and the concept of "the good". Today, much of value theory aspires to the [[science|scientifically]] [[empirical]], recording what people do value and attempting to understand why they value it in the context of [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Detmer|title=Freedom as a Value: A Critique of the Ethical Theory of Jean-Paul Sartre|publisher=Open Court Publishing|year=1988|isbn=978-0812690835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the general level, there is a difference between moral and natural goods. Moral goods are those that have to do with the conduct of persons, usually leading to praise or blame. Natural goods, on the other hand, have to do with objects, not persons. For example, the statement "Mary is a good person" uses 'good' very differently than in the statement "That is good food".

Ethics is mainly focused on moral goods rather than natural goods, while economics has a concern in what is economically good for the society but not an individual person and is also interested in natural goods. However, both moral and natural goods are equally relevant to goodness and value theory, which is more general in scope.

==Sociology==
{{Main|Value (personal and cultural)}}
In sociology, value theory is concerned with personal values which are popularly held by a community, and how those values might change under particular conditions. Different groups of people may hold or prioritize different kinds of values influencing social behavior.

Major Western theorists who stress the importance of values as an analytical independent variable include [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Talcott Parsons]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. Classical examples of sociological traditions which deny or downplay the question of values are [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], [[historical materialism]] (including Marxism), [[behaviorism]], pragmatic-oriented theories, [[postmodern philosophy]] and various objectivist-oriented theories.

Methods of study range from questionnaire surveys to participant observation.

==Economics==
{{Main|Theory of value (economics)}}
Economic analysis emphasizes goods sought in a market and tends to use the consumer's choices as evidence ([[revealed preference]]) that various products are of [[economic value]]. In this view, religious or political struggle over what "goods" are available in the marketplace is inevitable, and [[consensus]] on some core questions about body and society and ecosystems affected by the transaction, are outside the market's goods so long as they are unowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium|publisher=Cowles Foundation - Yale University|author=Debreu, G|year=1972|isbn=978-0300015591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some natural goods seem to also be moral  goods. For example, those things that are owned by a person may be said to be natural goods, but over which a particular individual(s) may have moral claims. So it is necessary to make another distinction: between ''moral'' and ''non-moral goods''. A non-moral  good is something that is desirable for someone or other; despite the name to the contrary, it may include moral goods. A moral good is anything which an actor is considered to be morally obligated to strive toward.

When discussing non-moral goods, one may make a useful distinction between inherently serviced and material ''goods in'' the marketplace (or its [[exchange value]]), versus perceived intrinsic and experiential ''goods to'' the buyer. A strict [[service economy]] model takes pains to distinguish between the goods and service guarantees ''to the market'', and that of the service and experience ''to the consumer''.

Sometimes, moral and natural goods can conflict. The value of natural "goods" is challenged by such issues as [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]. The issue of addiction also brings up the distinction between economic and moral goods, where an economic good is whatever stimulates [[economic growth]]. For instance, some claim that [[cigarette]]s are a "good" in the economic sense, as their production can employ [[tobacco]] growers and doctors who treat [[lung cancer]]. Many people would agree that cigarette smoking is not ''morally'' "good", nor ''naturally'' "good," but still recognize that it is economically good, which means, it has exchange value, even though it may have a negative [[public good]] or even be bad for a person's body (not the same as "bad for the person" necessarily&amp;nbsp;– consider the issue of [[suicide]].) 

In [[ecological economics]] value theory is separated into two types: donor-type value and receiver-type value. Ecological economists tend to believe that 'real wealth' needs a donor-determined value as a measure of what things were needed to make an item or generate a service ([[H. T. Odum]], ''Environmental Accounting: Emergy and environmental decision-making'', 1996). An example of receiver-type value is 'market value', or 'willingness to pay', the principal method of accounting used in neo-classical economics.  In contrast, both [[Marx]]'s [[labour theory of value]] and the [[emergy]] concept are conceived as donor-type value. Emergy theorists believe that this conception of value has relevance to all of philosophy, economics, sociology and psychology as well as Environmental Science.

[[Silvio Gesell]] denied value theory in economics. He thought that value theory is useless and prevents economics from becoming science and that a currency administration guided by value theory is doomed to sterility and inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biblio.wiki/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order/Part_III/Chapter_3|title=The Natural Economic Order/Part III/Chapter 3 - Bibliowiki|website=biblio.wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and axiology==
{{Main|Value (ethics)}}

Intuitively, theories of value must be important to ethics. A number of useful distinctions have been made by philosophers in the treatment of value.

===Intrinsic and instrumental value===
{{Main|Instrumental and intrinsic value}}
Many people find it useful to distinguish ''[[instrumental value]]'' and ''[[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s'', first discussed by [[Plato]] in the "Republic". An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth having for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]].

Intrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories. Some things are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other things that are good. "Understanding science" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods.

A prominent argument in [[environmental ethics]], made by writers like [[Aldo Leopold]] and [[Holmes Rolston III]], is that wild nature and healthy ecosystems have intrinsic value, prior to and apart from their instrumental value as resources for humans, and should therefore be preserved. This line of argument has been articulated further in recent years by Canadian philosopher [[John McMurtry]] within the ''[[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems]]'' (http://www.eolss.net) published by [[UNESCO]].

===Pragmatism and contributory goodness===
{{Further|Pragmatic ethics}}

[[John Dewey]] (1859-1952), in his book ''Theory of Valuation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Valuation |author=Dewey, J|year=1939|publisher=University of Chicago USA|isbn=978-0226575940}}&lt;/ref&gt; sees goodness as the outcome of [[ethic valuation]], a continuous balancing of "ends in view". An end in view is said to be an objective potentially adopted, which may be refined or rejected based on its consistency with other objectives or as a means to objectives already held.

Dewey's empiricist approach evinces [[absolute intrinsic value denial]]; i.e. not accepting intrinsic value as an inherent or enduring property of things. Instead, Dewey sees the appearance of intrinsic value as an illusory product of our continuous valuative activity as purposive beings. In addition to denying categorically that there is anything like intrinsic value, Dewey held the same position with regard to moral values - for Dewey, moral values are also based on a learning process, and are never intrinsic or absolute.

Another contribution of pragmatism to value theory is the idea of contributory goods with a [[contributory conditionality]]. These have the same qualities as the good thing, but need some emergent property of a whole state-of-affairs in order to be good. For example, salt is food on its own, but is far better as part of a prepared meal. In other words, such goods are only "good" when certain conditions are met. This is in contrast to other goods, which may be considered "good" in a wider variety of situations.

===Kant: hypothetical and categorical goods===
The thinking of [[Immanuel Kant]] greatly influenced [[moral philosophy]]. He thought of moral value as a unique and universally identifiable property, as an [[absolute value (philosophy)|absolute value]] rather than a [[Relative value (philosophy)|relative value]]. He showed that many practical goods are good only in states-of-affairs described by a sentence containing an "if" clause, e.g., in the sentence, "Sunshine is only good if you do not live in the desert." Further, the "if" clause often described the category in which the judgment was made (art, science, etc.). Kant described these as "hypothetical goods", and tried to find a "categorical" good that would operate across all categories of judgment without depending on an "if-then" clause.

An influential result of Kant's search was the idea of a ''good will'' being the only [[intrinsic good]]. Moreover, Kant saw a good will as acting in accordance with a moral command, the "[[Categorical Imperative]]": "Act according to those maxims that you could will to be universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Critique of Pure Reason|publisher=Macmillan|author= Immanuel Kant  &amp; Gary Banham (Authors) plus other contributors |date=1787–2007 |isbn=978-0230013384}}&lt;/ref&gt;" but should not be confused with the [[Ethic of Reciprocity]] or [[Golden Rule]], e.g. [http://bible.cc/matthew/7-12.htm Mt. 7:12]. Whereas the golden rule states that "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself," Kant asks us to analyze whether an act can be performed simultaneously by everyone without exception. For example, murder cannot be performed simultaneously by everyone, one set of people would have to live and the other die. That disparity is an exception. The act cannot be performed without exception, therefore it fails the categorical imperative. Contrast this with the golden rule which is subjective to the individual. Following the logic of the golden rule, if I wanted someone to kill me, then it would be acceptable for me to kill others, because I would be doing to others what I would want done to me. This is very important to keep in mind, because Kant's categorical imperative avoids this flaw. From this, and a few other axioms, Kant developed a moral system that would apply to any "praiseworthy person".&lt;ref name="Kant1786"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Groundlaying toward the Metaphysics of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kantian philosophers believe that any general definition of goodness must define goods that are categorical in the sense that Kant intended.

'''Verity''' (''alias'' Veretie, Verety, Verita, Veritie, etc.) is a female first name and a surname. As a first name it derives from the Latin feminine noun ''veritas'', meaning "[[truth]]". It is thus an equivalent of [[Alethea]], a female first name first used in England ''circa'' 1585, derived from the ancient and modern Greek feminine noun ''αλήθεια'' (pronounced "al-'''ee'''-thia"), meaning "truth". It was adopted in England as a [[Puritan]] [[virtue name]], truthfulness being considered as a desirable attribute especially in a female. Verity was one of the most popular first names given to girls in Australia.{{when|date=October 2014}} It is especially associated with parts of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Northern England]]. Verity is also a surname, which may have more ancient unrelated origins, possibly being a corruption of a similar word.&lt;ref&gt;Surnames had been adopted by families in England centuries before the Puritan era&lt;/ref&gt; Notable people with the name include:

'''Victorian morality''' is a distillation of the [[morality|moral]] views of people living during the time of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign (1837–1901), the [[Victorian era]], and of the moral climate of Great Britain in the mid-19th century in general.  The British sought to bring these values to the [[British Empire]].  Historian [[Harold Perkin]] writes:
:Between 1780 and 1850 the English ceased to be one of the most aggressive, brutal, rowdy, outspoken, riotous, cruel and bloodthirsty nations in the world and became one of the most inhibited, polite, orderly, tender-minded, prudish and hypocritical. The transformation diminished cruelty to animals, criminals, lunatics, and children (in that order); suppressed many cruel sports and games, such as bull-baiting and cock-fighting, as well as innocent amusements, including many fairs and wakes; rid the penal code of about two hundred capital offences, abolished transportation [of criminals to Australia], and cleaned up the prisons; turned Sunday into a day of prayer for some and mortification for all.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Perkin, ''The Origins of Modern English Society'' (1969) p 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian values emerged in all classes and reached all facets of Victorian living. The values of the period—which can be classed as religion, morality, Evangelicalism, industrial work ethic, and personal improvement—took root in Victorian morality. Current plays and all literature—including old classics like Shakespeare—were cleansed of naughtiness, or "[[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]]."

Contemporary historians have generally come to regard the [[Victorian era]] as a time of many conflicts, such as the widespread cultivation of an outward appearance of dignity and restraint, together with serious debates about exactly how the new morality should be implemented. The international slave trade was abolished, and this ban was enforced by the Royal Navy. Slavery was ended in all the British colonies, child labour was ended in British factories, and a long debate ensued regarding whether prostitution should be totally abolished or tightly regulated. Homosexuality remained illegal.

As of the turn of the 21st century, the term "Victorian morality" can describe any set of values that espouse [[sexual restraint]], [[law and order (politics)|low tolerance of crime]] and a strict social [[code of conduct]].

==Slavery==
{{Main|Abolitionism in the United Kingdom}}
Opposition to slavery was the main evangelical cause from the late 19th century, led by [[William Wilberforce]] (1759–1833). The cause organized very thoroughly, and developed propaganda campaigns that made readers cringe at the horrors of slavery. The same moral fervor and organizational skills carried over into most of the other reform movements.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Drescher, ''Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery'' (2009) pp 205–44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837, only four years after the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] throughout the British Empire. The [[anti-slavery]] movement had campaigned for years to achieve the ban, succeeding with a partial abolition in 1807 and the full ban on slave trade, but not slave ownership, which only happened in 1833. It took so long because the anti-slavery morality was pitted against powerful economic interests which claimed their businesses would be destroyed if they were not permitted to exploit slave labour. Eventually, [[plantation]] owners in the [[Caribbean]] received £20 million in cash compensation, which reflected the average market price of slaves. [[William E. Gladstone]], later a famous reformer, handled the large payments to his father for their hundreds of slaves.  The [[Royal Navy]] patrolled the Atlantic Ocean, stopping any ships that it suspected of trading African slaves to the Americas and freeing any slaves found. The British had set up a [[Crown Colony]] in [[West Africa]]—[[Sierra Leone]]—and transported freed slaves there. Freed slaves from [[Nova Scotia]] founded and named the capital of Sierra Leone "[[Freetown]]".&lt;ref&gt;Howard Temperley, ''British antislavery, 1833–1870'' (1972). &lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolishing cruelty==
===Cruelty to animals===
{{Main|Animal welfare in the United Kingdom}}
[[William Wilberforce]], [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]] and [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/animal-rights#ref287259|title=Animal rights|last=Wise|first=Steven M.|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the first legislation to prevent cruelty to animals, the [[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822]]; it pertained only to cattle and it passed easily in 1822. &lt;ref&gt; James C. Turner, ''Reckoning with the Beast: Animals, Pain, and Humanity in the Victorian Mind'' (2000) p 39.&lt;/ref&gt;) 

In the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1839]] "fighting or baiting Lions, Bears, Badgers, Cocks, Dogs, or other Animals" was made a criminal offence.  The law laid numerous restrictions on how, when, and where animals could be used. It prohibited owners from letting mad dogs run loose and gave police the right to destroy any dog suspected of being rabid. It prohibited the use of dogs for drawing carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-law/victorian-legislation/1839-uk-act-london-police.htm |title=London Police Act 1839, Great Britain Parliament. Section XXXI, XXXIV, XXXV, XLII |accessdate=23 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424093224/http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-law/victorian-legislation/1839-uk-act-london-police.htm |archivedate=24 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was extended to the rest of England and Wales in 1854. Dog-pulled carts were often used by very poor self-employed men as a cheap means to deliver milk, human foods, animal foods (the cat's-meat man), and for collecting refuse (the [[rag-and-bone man]]). The dogs were susceptible to rabies; cases of this horrible deadly disease among humans had been on the rise. They also bothered the horses, which were economically much more vital to the city. Evangelicals and utilitarians in the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals persuaded Parliament it was cruel and should be illegal; the Utilitarian element added government inspectors to provide enforcement.  The owners had no more use for their dogs, and killed them.&lt;ref&gt;M. B. McMullan, "The Day the Dogs Died in London" ''The London Journal: A Review of Metropolitan Society Past and Present'' (1998) 23#1 pp 32–40  https://doi.org/10.1179/ldn.1998.23.1.32 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rep&gt;{{citation |title=Representing Animals |last=Rothfels |first=Nigel |page=12 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-34154-X}}.

===Child labour===
{{Main|Child labour}}
Evangelical religious forces took the lead in identifying the evils of child labor, and legislating against them. They were angered at the contradiction between the conditions on the ground for children of the poor and the middle-class notion of childhood as a time of innocence led to the first campaigns for the imposition of legal protection for children. Reformers attacked child labor from the 1830s onward. The campaign that led to the [[Factory Acts]] was spearheaded by rich philanthropists of the era, especially [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], who introduced bills in Parliament to mitigate the exploitation of children at the workplace. In 1833 he introduced the [[Factory Acts#Labour of Children, etc., in Factories Act 1833|Ten Hours Act 1833]], which provided that children working in the cotton and woollen mills must be aged nine or above; no person under the age of eighteen was to work more than ten hours a day or eight hours on a Saturday; and no one under twenty-five was to work nights.&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Battiscombe, ''Shaftesbury: A Biography of the Seventh Earl 1801–1885'' (1988) pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Factory Acts|Factory Act of 1844]] said children 9–13 years could work for at most 9 hours a day with a lunch break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kelly et al.|title=Business Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMhwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA548|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional legal interventions throughout the century increased the level of childhood protection, despite the resistance from the [[laissez-faire]] attitudes against government interference by factory owners. Parliament respected laissez-faire in the case of adult men, and there was minimal interference in the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. J. Litzenberger|author2=Eileen Groth Lyon|title=The Human Tradition in Modern Britain|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3735-4|pages=142–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployed street children suffered too, as novelist [[Charles Dickens]] revealed to a large middle class audience the horrors of London street life.&lt;ref&gt;Amberyl Malkovich, ''Charles Dickens and the Victorian Child: Romanticizing and Socializing the Imperfect Child'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality==
{{Main|Victorian era#morality}}
Historians [[Peter Gay]] and Michael Mason both point out that modern society often confuses Victorian etiquette for a lack of knowledge. For example, people going for a bath in the [[sea]] or at the [[beach]] would use a [[bathing machine]]. Despite the use of the bathing machine, it was still possible to see people bathing nude.  Typical middle-class brides likely knew nothing about sex and learned about their husbands' expectations for it on their wedding night; the experience was often traumatic. Contrary to popular conception, however, Victorian society recognised that both men and women enjoyed copulation.&lt;ref name="draznin2001"&gt;{{cite book | title=Victorian London's Middle-Class Housewife: What She Did All Day (#179) | publisher=Greenwood Press | author=Draznin, Yaffa Claire | year=2001 | series=Contributions in Women's Studies | location=Westport, Connecticut | pages=95–96 | isbn=0-313-31399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbal or written communication of [[libido|sexual feeling]]s was also often proscribed so people instead used the [[language of flowers]]. However, they also wrote explicit [[erotica]], perhaps the most famous being the racy tell-all ''[[My Secret Life (erotica)|My Secret Life]]'' by the pseudonym Walter (allegedly [[Henry Spencer Ashbee]]), and the magazine ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', which was published for several years and reprinted as a paperback book in the 1960s. Victorian erotica also survives in private letters archived in museums and even in a study of women's orgasms. Some current historians now believe that the myth of Victorian repression can be traced back to early twentieth-century views, such as those of [[Lytton Strachey]], a member of the [[Bloomsbury Group]], who wrote ''[[Eminent Victorians]]''.
===Homosexuality===
{{see also|Labouchere Amendment|Oscar Wilde}}
The enormous expansion of police forces, especially in London, produced a sharp rise in prosecutions for illegal sodomy at midcentury.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Brady, ''Masculinity and Male Homosexuality in Britain, 1861–1913'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, law officers saw it as an unfortunate duty that detracted them from the real business of fighting crime.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Cocks, ''Nameless Offences: Homosexual Desire in the Nineteenth Century'' (2003) p. 50; [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/193191 online review]&lt;/ref&gt;  Male sexuality became a favorite subject of study especially by medical researchers whose case studies explored the progression and symptoms of institutionalized subjects. [[Henry Maudsley]] shaped late Victorian views about aberrant sexuality. [[George Savage (physician)|George Savage]] and [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] wrote about homosexuals living in society. [[Daniel Hack Tuke]]'s ''Dictionary of Psychological Medicine'' covered sexual perversion. All these works show awareness of continental insights, as well as moral disdain for the sexual practices described.&lt;ref&gt; Ivan Crozier, "Nineteenth-century British psychiatric writing about homosexuality before Havelock Ellis: The missing story." ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' 63#1 (2008): 65–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simeon Solomon]] and poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], as they contemplated their own sexual identities in the 1860s, fastened on the Greek lesbian poet [[Sappho]]. They made Victorian intellectuals aware of Sappho, and their writings helped to shape the modern image of lesbianism.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Prettejohn,  "Solomon, Swinburne, Sappho." ''Victorian Review'' 34#2 (2008): 103–128. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27793672 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Labouchere Amendment]] to the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], for the first time, made all male homosexual acts illegal. It provided for two years' imprisonment for males convicted of committing, or being a party to public or private acts of homosexuality. Lesbian acts—still scarcely known—were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;F. Barry Smith, "Labouchere's amendment to the Criminal Law Amendment bill." ''Australian Historical Studies'' 17.67 (1976): 165–173.&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[Oscar Wilde]] was convicted of violating the statute, and imprisoned for such violations, in 1895, he became the iconic victim of English puritanical repression.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Adut, "A theory of scandal: Victorians, homosexuality, and the fall of Oscar Wilde." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 111.1 (2005): 213–248 [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ari_Adut/publication/7525127_A_Theory_of_Scandal_Victorians_Homosexuality_and_the_Fall_of_Oscar_Wilde/links/5899e4a3aca2721f0db11941/A-Theory-of-Scandal-Victorians-Homosexuality-and-the-Fall-of-Oscar-Wilde.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution===

[[File:Illustrated Police News - Jack the Ripper 2.png|thumb| A victim of [[Jack the Ripper]]]]
Prostitution had been a factor in city life for centuries. The reformers started mobilizing in the late 1840s, major news organisations, clergymen, and single women became increasingly concerned about prostitution, which came to be known as "The Great Social Evil".&lt;ref&gt;Judith R. Walkowitz, ''Prostitution and Victorian society: Women, class, and the state'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;   Estimates of the number of prostitutes in London in the 1850s vary widely (in his landmark study, ''Prostitution'', [[William Acton (doctor)|William Acton]] reported that the police estimated there were 8,600 in London alone in 1857).

While the [[Magdalene Asylum]]s had been reforming prostitutes since the mid-18th century, the years between 1848 and 1870 saw a veritable explosion in the number of institutions working to "reclaim" these "fallen women" from the streets and retrain them for entry into respectable society&amp;nbsp;— usually for work as domestic servants. The theme of prostitution and the "fallen woman" (any woman who has had [[sexual intercourse]] out of marriage) became a staple feature of mid-[[Victorian literature]] and politics. In the writings of [[Henry Mayhew]], [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]], [[Charles Dickens]] and others, prostitution began to be seen as a [[Social issues|social problem]].

When Parliament passed the first of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] in 1864 (which allowed the local constabulary in certain defined areas to force any woman suspected of [[Sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] to submit to its inspection), [[Josephine Butler]]'s crusade to repeal the CD Acts yoked the anti-prostitution cause with the emergent [[feminist movement]].  Butler attacked the long-established [[double standard]] of [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Boyd, ''Three Victorian Women Who Changed Their World: Josephine Butler, Octavia Hill, Florence Nightingale'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes were often presented as victims in [[Sentimental novel|sentimental literature]] such as [[Thomas Hood]]'s poem ''[[The Bridge of Sighs (poem)|The Bridge of Sighs]]'', [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s novel ''[[Mary Barton]]'', and [[Dickens]]' novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. The emphasis on the purity of women found in such works as [[Coventry Patmore]]'s ''[[The Angel in the House]]'' led to the portrayal of the prostitute and fallen woman as soiled, corrupted, and in need of cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;George Watt, ''The fallen woman in the nineteenth-century English novel'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

This emphasis on female purity was allied to the stress on the homemaking role of women, who helped to create a space free from the pollution and corruption of the city. In this respect, the prostitute came to have symbolic significance as the embodiment of the violation of that divide. The double standard remained in force. The [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]] allowed for a man to divorce his wife for adultery, but a woman could only divorce for adultery combined with other offences such as incest, cruelty, bigamy, desertion, etc., or based on cruelty alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Nelson, Horace |ref=nelson |date=1889|publisher=Stevens and Sons Limited|location=London| title= Selected cases, statutes and orders |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uqYPAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;ots=56BiBx77mT&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anonymity of the city led to a large increase in prostitution and unsanctioned sexual relationships. Dickens and other writers associated prostitution with the mechanisation and industrialisation of modern life, portraying prostitutes as human commodities consumed and thrown away like refuse when they were used up. Moral reform movements attempted to close down brothels, something that has sometimes been argued to have been a factor in the concentration of street-prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Judith R. Walkowitz, "Male vice and feminist virtue: feminism and the politics of prostitution in nineteenth-century Britain." ''History Workshop'' (1982) 13:79–93. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4288404 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of prostitution in London in the 1880s gained national and global prominence through the highly publicised murders attributed to Whitechapel based serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], whose victims were exclusively prostitutes living destitute in the [[East End]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-the-Ripper|title=Jack the Ripper {{!}} English Murderer|publisher=Britannica|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that many prostitutes were living in poverty as late as the 1880s and 1890s, offering sex services was a source of desperate necessity to fund their meals and temporary lodging accommodation from the cold, and as a result prostitutes represented easy prey for criminals as they could do little to personally protect themselves from harm.

== Crime and police==
{{Main|History of law enforcement in the United Kingdom|History of the Metropolitan Police Service}}
After 1815, there was widespread fear of growing crimes, burglaries, mob action, and threats of large-scale disorder. Crime had been handled on an ad-hoc basis by poorly organized local parish constables and private watchmen, supported by very stiff penalties, including hundreds of causes for execution or deportation to Australia. London, with 1.5 million people—more than the next 15 cities combined—over the decades had worked out informal arrangements to develop a uniform policing system in its many boroughs. The [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]], championed by Home Secretary [[Robert Peel]], was not so much a startling innovation, as a systemization with expanded funding of established informal practices.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gash, ''Mr. Secretary Peel: the life of Sir Robert Peel to 1830'' (1961) pp. 487–98.&lt;/ref&gt; It created the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], headquartered at [[Scotland Yard]].&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Lyman, "The Metropolitan Police Act of 1829: An Analysis of Certain Events Influencing the Passage and Character of the Metropolitan Police Act in England," ''Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science'' (1964) 55#1 pp. 141–154 [https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol55/iss1/18/ online]&lt;/ref&gt; London now had the world's first modern police force. The 3000 policemen were called "bobbies" (after Peel's first name). They were well-organized, centrally directed, and wore standard blue uniforms. Legally they had the historic status of constable, with authority to make arrests of suspicious persons and book offenders before a magistrate court. They were assigned in teams to specified beats, especially at night. Gas lighting was installed on major streets, making their task of surveillance much easier.  Crime rates went down. An 1835 law required all incorporated boroughs in England and Wales to establish police forces.  Scotland, with its separate  legal system, was soon added. By 1857  every jurisdiction in Great Britain had an organized police force, for which the Treasury paid a subsidy.  The police had steady pay, were selected by merit rather than by political influence, and were rarely used for partisan purposes. The pay scale was not high (one guinea a week in 1833), but the prestige was especially high for Irish Catholics, who were disproportionately represented in every city where they had a large presence.&lt;ref&gt; Clive Emsley, "Police" in James Eli Adams, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era'' (2004) 3:221–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Clive Emsley, ''Crime and Society in England, 1750–1900'' (5th ed. 2018) pp 216-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causation==

Intellectual historians searching for causes of the new morality often point to the ideas by [[Hannah More]], [[William Wilberforce]], and the [[Clapham Sect]]. Perkin argues this exaggerates the influence of a small group of individuals, who were "as much an effect of the revolution as a cause."  It also has a timing problem, for many many predecessors had failed. The intellectual approach tends to minimize the importance of Nonconformists and Evangelicals—the Methodists, for example, played a powerful role among the upper tier of the working class.  Finally, it misses a key ingredient: instead of trying to improve an old society, the reformers were trying to lead Britain into a new society of the future.&lt;ref&gt;Perkin, ''The Origins of Modern English Society,'' pp 280–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Victorian Era movements for justice, freedom, and other strong moral values made greed, and exploitation into public evils.  The writings of [[Charles Dickens]], in particular, observed and recorded these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Bivona,  "Poverty, pity, and community: Urban poverty and the threat to social bonds in the victorian age." ''Nineteenth-Century Studies'' 21 (2007): 67–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Peter Shapely examined 100 charity leaders in Victorian Manchester. They brought significant cultural capital, such as wealth, education and social standing. Besides the actual reforms for the city they achieved for themselves a form of symbolic capital, a legitimate form of social domination and civic leadership. The utility of charity as a means of boosting one's social leadership was socially determined and would take a person only so far. &lt;ref&gt;Peter Shapely, "Charity, Status and Leadership: Charitable Image and the Manchester Man" ''Journal of Social History'' 32#1 (1998), pp. 157–177 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789597 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Visha Kanya''''' ([[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa| विष कन्या}}; {{lang-en|Poison girl}}) were young women reportedly used as [[assassins]], often against powerful enemies, during the times of the [[Ancient India]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpXijlqeRpIC|title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil|last=Roy|first=Kaushik|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788178241098|page=24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their blood and bodily fluids were purportedly poisonous to other humans, as was mentioned in the ancient Indian treatise on [[public policy|statecraft]], ''[[Arthashastra]]'', written by [[Chanakya]], an adviser and a prime minister to the first Maurya Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] (c. 340–293 BCE).&lt;ref name="Chaurasia2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Radhey Shyam Chaurasia|title=History of ancient India: earliest times to 1000 A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWmsQQ2smXIC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=20 June 2011|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0027-5|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
A [[Hindu mythology]] text, the ''[[Kalki Purana]]'', mentions that they can kill a person just by looking at them, and talks about a Visha Kanya named Sulochana, the wife of a [[Gandharva]], Chitragreeva.&lt;ref name="Chaturvedi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=B.K. Chaturvedi|title=Kalki Purana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjPXRCCUvk4C&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=20 June 2011|year=2004|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|isbn=978-81-288-0588-2|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in time, "poison damsel" passed into [[folklore]], became an [[archetype]] explored by many writers, resulting in a popular [[literary character]] that appears in many works, including classical [[Sanskrit]] texts such as ''[[Sukasaptati]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Erotic Indian tales from the Sanskrit classic Suksaptati'', by G.L. Mathur. Hind Pocket Books, 1971. ''Page 26–27''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Poison Damsel (Sanskrit Viṣakanyā) is a literary figure that appears in Sanskrit literature as a type of assassin used by kings to destroy enemies. The story goes that young girls were raised on a carefully crafted diet of [[poison]] and antidote from a very young age, a practice referred to as [[mithridatism]]. Although many would not survive, those that did were immune to other poisons and their [[body fluid]]s would be poisonous to others; sexual contact would thus be lethal to other humans. There also exists a myth that says a Visha Kanya can cause instant death with just a touch.

According to Kaushik Roy, Visha Kanyas would kill their targets by seducing them and giving them poisoned alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some Sanskrit sources narrate that a ''Visha Kanya'' was sent by [[Mahapadma Nanda|Nanda]]'s minister Amatyarakshasa to kill [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and Chanakya diverted them to kill Parvatak.&lt;ref name="PenzerBhatta1980"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman Mosley Penzer|author2=Somadeva Bhatta|title=Poison-damsels: Folklore of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWEhbry3WBUC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=20 June 2011|date=November 1980|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-405-13336-7|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thakur1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Molu Ram Thakur|title=Myths, rituals, and beliefs in Himachal Pradesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JH-gI4ncuZ4C&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=20 June 2011|year=1997|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-7387-071-2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary treatments of the theme ==

''Visha Kanya'' has been a popular theme in [[Indian literature]] and [[folklore]], and apart from appearing in classical [[Sanskrit]] texts, it has appeared repeatedly in various works like ''Vishkanya'' by [[Shivani]] and ''Ek Aur Vish Kanya?'' by Om Prakash Sharma, who use ''Visha Kanya'' as an [[archetype]] in their stories—a beautiful girl who kills when she comes too close. More recently, the archetype has taken a new hue in the HIV/AIDS era, for example in ''Vishkanya'', a 2007 novel, based on the [[AIDS]] epidemic in society. ''Vishakanya''s have also been depicted as important characters in the book ''[[Chanakya's Chant]]''. In 2009, Vibha Rahi, a lower caste woman has written an autobiography 'Vishkanya: Untold Secrets' in Marathi, in which she portrays how upper caste women make intimate relationships with lower caste people of high profile and destroy their families and social relationships.&lt;ref name="Vibha Rahi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rahi|first=Vibha|title=Vishkanya: Untold Secrets|year=2009|publisher=Karuvaki Prakashan|location=Pune}}&lt;/ref&gt;        
 
Over the years, many Hindi films have been made on the subject. The first film, ''Visha Kanya'', was made in 1943, starring [[Leela Mishra]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376308/ Vish Kanya (1943)] [[IMDB]].&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, [[Vishkanya (1991)|''Vishkanya'' (1991)]], starring [[Pooja Bedi]] in the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318812/ Vishkanya (1991)] [[IMDB]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishkanya Ek Anokhi Prem Kahani]] is a [[soap opera]] TV series which aired on [[Zee TV]]; it starred [[Aishwarya Khare]] as Aparajita Ghosh, a Visha Kanya, in the main role.

In ''The Real Life of Sebastian Knight'' the author Nabokov treats his affair with Irina Guadanini through allusions to the myth of the poison damsel. In the 2015 novel, ''The Entropy of Bones'' by [[Ayize Jama-Everett]], the main character fights a group of ''Visha Kanya''.  The trope also appears in a set of Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories.

The '''World March for Peace and Nonviolence''' is an initiative of [[World without Wars]], an international organization which has worked for peace and nonviolence since 1995 and was created by the [[Humanist Movement]].

The project of the World March was launched in 2008 and is supported by hundreds of organizations and personalities in the Arts, Music, Politics, Literature, Sports, etc.

The March started October 2 (Gandhi's birthday), 2009 in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] and finished on January 2, 2010 in [[Punta de Vacas]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]]. The March was intended to rise worldwide awareness for nonviolence. Concrete demands of the March are: abolition of nuclear weapons;  withdrawal of invading troops from occupied territories; the progressive and proportional reduction of conventional weapons; the signing of non-aggression treaties among nations and the renunciation by governments of war as a way to resolve conflicts.

The World March for Peace and Nonviolence is projected to include millions of individuals, on six continents in 90 countries, traveling some 160,000 kilometers.

==Demands put forward by world march==

* Nuclear disarmament at a global level.
