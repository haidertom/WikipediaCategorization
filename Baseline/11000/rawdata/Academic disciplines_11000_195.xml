==Description==
It was first discovered in 1993 from coastal isolates of coral in the [[Republic of Palau]] in the west [[Pacific Ocean]] and announced in 1996.&lt;ref name=n96&gt;{{cite journal|author=H.

==Genome==
Its genome was sequenced in 2008, revealing a large bacterial genome of 8.3 Mb with nine plasmids.&lt;ref name=genome/&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Acaryochloris'' is a combination of the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] prefix ''a'' (ἄν)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|an|ἄν|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "without", ''caryo'' (κάρυον)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|karuon|κάρυον|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "nut" (here intended as "nucleus") and ''chloros'' (χλωρός)&lt;ref name=chloro&gt;{{LSJ|xlwros|χλωρός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning green;&lt;ref&gt;{{lpsn|gender.html|Gender of suffices}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore it is [[new Latin]] ''Acaryochloris'' meaning "without nucleus green".&lt;ref name=desc/&gt;
The specific epithet ''marina'' is [[Latin]] meaning "marine".&lt;ref name=desc/&gt;

==Classification==
{{see also|Bacterial taxonomy}}
{{main|Cyanobacteria}}
Due to historical reason, the classification of the Cyanobacteria is problematic and many are not validly published, meaning they have not yet been placed into the classification framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{lpsn|classifcyano.html|Classification of Cyanobacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these not officially recognised species is ''Acaryochloris marina'', which technically should be written as "Acaryochloris marina" in official writings, but in effect this is rarely done (cf.&lt;ref name=genome/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kühl | first1 = M. | last2 = Chen | first2 = M. | last3 = Ralph | first3 = P. J. | last4 = Schreiber | first4 = U. | last5 = Larkum | first5 = A. W.

==Exoplanet habitability==
Scientists including [[NASA]]'s Nancy Kiang have proposed that the existence of ''Acaryochloris marina'' suggests that organisms that use chlorophyll d, rather than chlorophyll a, may be able to perform oxygenic photosynthesis on [[exoplanets]] orbiting [[red dwarf stars]] (which emit much less light than the Sun).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gronstal |first=Aaron |date=February 2012 |title=Far-Out Photosynthesis |url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/features/201202_mielke/ |newspaper=News &amp; Features |location= |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mielke, S.P.|author2=N.Y.

'''Advertising in biology''' means the use of [[display (zoology)|displays]] by [[organism]]s such as [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to [[signalling theory|signal]] their presence for some [[evolution]]ary reason.

Such signalling may be honest, used to attract other organisms, as when [[flower]]s use bright colours, patterns, and scent to attract [[pollinator]]s such as [[bee]]s; or, again honestly, to warn off other organisms, as when distasteful animals use [[aposematism|warning coloration]] to prevent attacks from potential predators. Such honest advertising benefits both the sender and the receiver.

Other animals may advertise dishonestly; in [[Batesian mimicry]], edible animals more or less accurately mimic distasteful animals to reduce their own risk of being attacked by predators.

==In plants==
[[File:Flowers-of-Israel-ver006.jpg|thumb|[[Insect-pollinated]] [[flower]]s use a combination of cues to advertise themselves to insects.]]
{{further information|flower|entomophily}}

[[Insect-pollinated]] [[flower]]s use bright colours, patterns, rewards of [[nectar]] and [[pollen]], and scent to attract [[pollinator]]s such as [[bee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iolanda, Filella |author2=Primante, Clara |author3=Llusià, Joan |author4=Martín González, Ana M. |author5=Seco, Roger |author6=Farré-Armengol,Gerard |author7=Rodrigo, Anselm |author8=Bosch, Jordi |author9=Peñuelas, Josep |title=Floral advertisement scent in a changing plant-pollinators market |journal=Scientific Reports |year=2013 |volume=3 |page=3434 |doi=10.1038/srep03434|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep03434 |pmid=24305624 |pmc=3852139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also use drugs such as [[caffeine]] to encourage bees to return more often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plants spike nectar with caffeine and give bees a buzz|journal=New Scientist|date=15 October 2015|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28349-plants-spike-nectar-with-caffeine-and-give-bees-a-buzz/|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is influenced by [[sexual selection]]: in [[dioecious]] plants like [[Salix caprea|sallow]], the male flowers are brighter yellow (the colour of their pollen) and have more scent than female flowers. Honey bees are more attracted by the brighter male flowers, but not by their scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dötterl, Stefan |author2=Glück, Ulrike |author3=Jürgens, Andreas |author4=Woodring, Joseph |author5=Aas, Gregor |title=Floral Reward, Advertisement and Attractiveness to Honey Bees in Dioecious ''Salix caprea''|journal=PLOS ONE| year=2014 |volume=9 |issue=3 |page=e93421 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0093421 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093421 |pmid=24676333 |pmc=3968154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many flowers that are adapted for pollination by birds produce copious quantities of nectar and advertise this with their red coloration. Insects see red less well than other colours, and the plant needs to devote its energy to attracting birds that can act as pollinators rather than insects that cannot. In fact, the Canary Island [[Endemism|endemic]] ''[[Echium wildpretii]]'' has two subspecies, a red-flowering one on Teneriffe which is mainly pollinated by birds, and a pink-flowered one on Las Palmas which is pollinated by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rodríguez-Gironés, Miguel A. |author2=Santamaría, Luis |year=2004 |title=Why are so many bird flowers red? |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e306 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020350 |pmid=15486585 |pmc=521733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Wilson's Bird of Paradise.jpg|thumb|[[Wilson's bird-of-paradise]] advertises to females in the breeding season with brilliant colours, patterns and tail plumes, as well as [[display (zoology)|display behaviour]] and song.]]
{{further information|sexual selection|signalling theory|aposematism}}

Advertising takes a variety of forms in animals.&lt;ref name=Cott&gt;[[Cott, H. B.|Cott, Hugh B]] (1940). ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]''. Methuen. page 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slater1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater |first=Peter J. B. |title=Essentials of Animal Behaviour |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEOePcIFW0IC&amp;pg=PA178 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62996-6 |pages=178–181 |chapter=8.5 Advertising displays}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breeding adults often [[display (zoology)|display]] to attract a mate. Breeding males of [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] birds, such as [[peacock]]s, [[Bird-of-paradise|birds of paradise]] and [[bower bird]]s, have elaborate [[plumage]], [[birdsong|song]], and [[ethology|behaviour]]. These evolved through [[sexual selection]] by females.&lt;ref name=Slater1999/&gt; The males use these features alone or in combination to advertise their presence, and, especially but not only in species with [[lek mating]], to [[sexual competition|compete]] with rival males. In a lek, the presence of multiple males advertises and potentially benefits all the males present, so they are both collaborating and competing.&lt;ref name="Brudzynski2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brudzynski, Stefan M. |title=Handbook of Mammalian Vocalization: An Integrative Neuroscience Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TU9wYetjgsC&amp;pg=PA446 |date=8 December 2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-092337-6 |page=446 |quote=An advantage of lek mating is that males pool their advertising and courtship signals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breeding males may also advertise [[honest signal|honestly]] to warn rival males of their strength, a classic example being the [[red deer]], where the roaring of a rutting stag reliably signals its size. The honest advertisement benefits both sender and receiver, as neither need become involved in a costly fight to assess their relative strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clutton-Brock |first1=T. H. |last2=Albon |first2=S. D. |title=The Roaring of Red Deer and the Evolution of Honest Advertisement |journal=Behaviour |date=1979 |volume=69 |issue=3/4 |pages=145–170|jstor=4533969 |doi=10.1163/156853979x00449}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the breeding season, frogs congregate at suitable breeding sites and call to advertise their presence, particularly at night. Females can distinguish between the fitness of males based on the characteristics of their voices.&lt;ref name=Dorcas&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dorcas, Michael E.|author2=Gibbons, Whit|title=Frogs: The Animal Answer Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cST6P7aJToYC&amp;pg=PA35 |year=2011 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-9935-5 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Animal behaviour: Truth in advertising|journal=[[The Economist]]|date=18 June 1998|url=http://www.economist.com/node/137078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desert toads emerge from their underground burrows in response to heavy rain. Males emerge first and when one finds a suitable ephemeral pool, its call attracts others and they all congregate there. Males may call in unison in noisy choruses, and breeding is explosive, a mass of males competing for the smaller number of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03281-8 |page=159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colour can be used in advertising. Some butterflies have [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]s on their wings. These make no effort at concealment, but may startle a potential predator into trying elsewhere. The [[western skink]] has a distinctive blue tail. If the skink cannot escape from a predator by concealment or flight, it can afford to lose its tail in order to escape with its life. Similarly, some species of [[grasshopper]] are well-camouflaged when at rest but flash vivid colouration when flying. The grasshopper thus avoids being eaten while the potential predator hunts in vain for the brightly coloured insect it saw.&lt;ref name=Ipsen&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stebbins, Robert Cyril |author2=Ipsen, D.C.|author3=Gillfillan, Gretchen|title=Animal Coloration: Activities on the Evolution of Concealment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0JpRuexSY0C&amp;pg=PA2 |year=2008 |publisher=NSTA Press |isbn=978-1-933531-29-8 |pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Acrocephalus schoenobaenus 1 (Marek Szczepanek)-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sedge warbler]] males advertise their fitness by the variety of their [[birdsong|song]] repertoire.]]

Male crickets chirp to attract females, and in some species, their calls can be heard from great distances. However, a certain parasitic fly has taken advantage of this, the female is attracted to a calling male cricket on which it then deposits its developing larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cade, W.H. | year = 1975 | title = Acoustically orienting parasitoids: Fly phonotaxis to cricket song | journal = Science | volume = 190| pages = 1312–1313 | doi=10.1126/science.190.4221.1312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate [[birdsong|song]] is especially well-developed among [[bird]]s, and again sexual selection has driven its evolution. Songbirds such as warblers have an extensive repertoire of songs, sometimes with thousands of phrases. The [[sedge warbler]] assembles an effectively infinite number of songs by assembling phrases in combination. Laboratory experiments by Clive Catchpole demonstrate that female sedge warblers select males with more varied songs, while field observation indicates that such males attract mates before other males.&lt;ref name=Slater1999/&gt;

Breeding females may advertise [[oestrus]] (being "on heat" or "in season", i.e. that they are fertile, [[ovulation|ovulating]] and receptive to breeding) with [[pheromone]]s (scent), courtship behaviour, and visual signals.&lt;ref name="IrwinStoner2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Irwin |first1=Mark D. |last2=Stoner |first2=John B. |last3=Cobaugh |first3=Aaron M. |title=Zookeeping: An Introduction to the Science and Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7TbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2013 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-92532-5 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human females have long been thought to conceal their ovulation, but women's behaviour changes around the time of ovulation with increased sexual motivation, and they are more attracted to men at that time; conversely, men are more attracted to the scent of women around the time of ovulation than in the non-ovulating (luteal) phase of the [[menstrual cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarin|first1=Juan J.|last2=Gomez-Piquer|first2=Vanessa|title=Do women have a hidden heat period?|journal=Human Reproduction|date=2002|volume=17|issue=9|pages=2243–2248|doi=10.1093/humrep/17.9.2243|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/9/2243.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distasteful animals use [[aposematism|warning coloration]] (aposematism) to prevent attacks from potential predators.&lt;ref name=Cott/&gt;

Many animals wish to advertise to those of their own species while being camouflaged to avoid [[predation]]. Many deep sea fish do this by way of [[bioluminescence]]. Patterns of [[photophore]]s on their undersides emit light that from below hide their silhouettes and resemble the scintillating lights produced by the ever-moving surface layers of water. At the same time, each species has a distinctive pattern of photophores that enables another member of its species to identify it as a con-specific.&lt;ref name=Bone&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bone, Quentin |author2=Moore, Richard |title=Biology of Fishes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLoqT_xWaqoC&amp;pg=PA328 |year=2008 |publisher=Garland Science|isbn=978-0-203-88522-2 |pages=328, 334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alice Holt Research Station''' is one of two British forestry research institutes, being based in north-east Hampshire.

==History==
It was established as a Forestry Research Station in 1946 by the Forestry Commission near [[Wrecclesham]]. The forest estate had 1,225,000 acres.

By the late 1950s it had an international reputation. A £134,000 extension was opened in the summer of 1959, which enable the Commission to have its central seed store at the site for varieties such as [[Douglas-fir]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]], [[Pinus nigra|Corsican pine]], and [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]]. The store was mostly for [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s, keeping seeds up to four years. and also [[acorn]]s had been stored up to three years.

More laboratories were added in the late 1970s.

===Research===
In 1948 it began experimenting with ''[[Metasequoia glyptostroboides]]'', the [[Metasequoia|dawn redwood]], with a view to produce timber.

In the late 1950s its scientists were among the first people to investigate biological data with computers, when they discovered why the Douglas-fir did not grow well in [[South East England|south-east England]], which they found was due to temperature and rooting depth. It was through computers that many solutions were found. The station found a new way to determine daily tree growth with [[vernier scale]]s. Computers investigated ways to classify trees by leaf character. It notably conducted research into [[eucalyptus]] and [[Populus|poplar]] trees.

In April 1973 it found that [[Dutch elm disease]] had been imported on [[Ulmus thomasii|Rock Elm]] logs from North America. The disease had first appeared in 1965. The disease had originally been shipped to the North America from Britain in the 1930s. The disease in Britain had then become less known. There were outbreaks of the disease in 1965 in north Gloucestershire and in 1967 in south Essex. Two scientists at the station discovered two strains of the disease. The areas affected were southern Hampshire, north-west Kent, the Severn valley, and Ipswich. The scientists realised that these outbreaks could have been prevented by controlling imports of logs. It had been assumed that as Britain had the disease in the 1930s that trees would not be affected. By 1984 Dutch elm disease had reached Scotland. Other diseases of trees to be controlled were [[Oak wilt]] and [[Chestnut blight]].

In 1973 it looked at ways to control the [[Eastern gray squirrel|grey squirrel]].

===Chief Research Officers===
* Professor [[Malcolm Laurie]], 1946 - October 1959
* Tom Peace, October 1959 -
* David Burdekin
* Prof Peter Freer-Smith&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/INFD-63BGBE Peter Freer-Smith]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
It is situated next to [[Birdworld]] in the [[Alice Holt Forest]] in [[East Hampshire]] off the A325, east of [[Bentley (Hampshire) railway station|Bentley railway station]] on the [[Alton Line]], which follows the [[River Wey]]. The nearest inhabitation is [[Rowledge]] in [[Surrey]], on the Hampshire boundary. Although now in Hampshire, similar to Birdworld, the site is in the religious parish of Rowledge in Surrey.

Generally, the [[building contractor]] submits the application for the permit to the regulatory authority,  along with a building project's drawings and specifications (called collectively "construction documents").&lt;ref name=AIA/&gt; But in some jurisdictions, the architect is required to submit the construction documents needed to obtain the building permit.&lt;ref name=AIA/&gt; And with some construction projects, more than one building permit is issued. That occurs when several different architects perform services on discrete parts of a single building project.&lt;ref name=AIA/&gt; More than one architect of record, therefore, would exist in such a case.

When an architecture firm is working on a project that is outside of their geographic location or range of expertise, it will often choose to work with an architect that is either local to the project site or skilled in that particular area of expertise. In this case, the primary architect works with the local architect in order to complete the project, and the local architect becomes the "architect of record." This type of working relationship is common when high-profile architects (or "[[Starchitect|starchitects]]") win design bids but find themselves in need of architects with more practical skills or knowledge of local conditions. Or more pragmatically, the high-profile architect simply needs an architect who is local to the project site, facilitating quicker site visits and project oversight.

The local architecture firms that are responsible for corresponding with city agencies about code compliance, tender documents, client communication and creating up to 90 percent of the construction documents and carry out construction inspections are similar, but should be referred as the "executive architect." {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[File:Symphony Hall Birmingham.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Symphony Hall, Birmingham]], an example of the application of architectural acoustics.]]
'''Architectural acoustics''' (also known as '''[[room acoustics]]''' and '''building acoustics''') is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a building and is a branch of [[acoustical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morfey|first=Christopher|title=Dictionary of Acoustics|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first application of modern scientific methods to architectural acoustics was carried out by [[Wallace Sabine]] in the [[Fogg Museum]] lecture room who then applied his new found knowledge to the design of [[Symphony Hall, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sabine|first=Wallace Clement|title=Collected papers on acoustics|year=1922|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural acoustics can be about achieving good [[Intelligibility (communication)|speech intelligibility]] in a theatre, restaurant or railway station, enhancing the quality of music in a concert hall or recording studio, or suppressing noise to make offices and homes more productive and pleasant places to work and live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Templeton|first=Duncan|title=Acoustics in the Built Environment: Advice for the Design Team|year=1993|publisher=Architectural Press|isbn=978-0750605380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Careers Service|title=Job profiles Acoustics consultant|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/acousticsconsultant.aspx}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building skin envelope ==
This science analyzes noise transmission from building exterior envelope to interior and vice versa. The main noise paths are [[roofs]], [[eaves]], [[wall]]s, [[window]]s, [[door]] and penetrations. Sufficient control ensures space functionality and is often required based on building use and local municipal codes. An example would be providing a suitable design for a home which is to be constructed close to a high volume roadway, or under the flight path of a major airport, or of the airport itself.

== Inter-space noise control ==
The science of limiting and/or controlling noise transmission from one building space to another to ensure space functionality and speech privacy. The typical sound paths are ceilings, room partitions, acoustic [[ceiling]] panels (such as wood [[dropped ceiling]] panels), [[door]]s, [[window]]s, flanking, [[Duct (HVAC)|ducting]] and other penetrations. Technical solutions depend on the source of the noise and the path of [[acoustic transmission]], for example noise by steps or noise by (air, water) flow vibrations. An example would be providing suitable [[party wall]] design in an [[apartment complex]] to  minimize the mutual disturbance due to noise by residents in adjacent apartments.

== Interior space acoustics ==
[[Image:quadratic diffusor.gif|thumb|right|Diffusers which scatter sound are used in some rooms to improve the acoustics]] This is the [[science]] of controlling a room's [[Surface science|surfaces]] based on sound absorbing and reflecting properties.  Excessive [[reverberation time]], which can be calculated, can lead to poor speech intelligibility.

[[File:Heichal Hatarbut1.jpg|thumb|400px|Ceiling of [[Culture Palace (Tel Aviv)]] concert hall is covered with [[perforated metal]] panels]]

Sound reflections create standing waves that produce natural resonances that can be heard as a pleasant sensation or an annoying one.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Ballou &amp; Howards Sams, editors. "Handbook for Sound Engineers",  page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective surfaces can be angled and coordinated to provide good coverage of sound for a listener in a concert hall or music recital space. To illustrate this concept consider the difference between a modern large office meeting room or lecture theater and a traditional [[classroom]] with all hard surfaces.

[[File:anechoic chamber.jpg|thumb|250px|An [[anechoic chamber]], using acoustic absorption to create a "dead" space.]]
Interior building surfaces can be constructed of many different materials and finishes. Ideal acoustical panels are those without a face or finish material that interferes with the acoustical infill or substrate.  [[textile|Fabric]] covered panels are one way to heighten acoustical absorption. [[Perforated metal]] also shows sound absorbing qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=William|title=Perforated metal systems as sound absorbing surfaces|year=2007|volume=February|url=http://www.ssaacoustics.com/newspublications/perforated%20metal%20systems%20as%20sound%20absorbative%20surf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finish material is used to cover over the acoustical substrate. Mineral fiber board, or [[Micore]], is a commonly used acoustical substrate. Finish materials often consist of fabric, wood or acoustical tile. Fabric can be wrapped around substrates to create what is referred to as a "pre-fabricated panel" and often provides good noise absorption if laid onto a wall.

Prefabricated panels are limited to the size of the substrate ranging from {{convert|2|x|4|ft|m}} to {{convert|4|x|10|ft|m}}.  Fabric retained in a wall-mounted perimeter track system, is referred to as "on-site acoustical wall panels". This is constructed by framing the perimeter track into shape, infilling the acoustical substrate and then stretching and tucking the fabric into the perimeter frame system. On-site wall panels can be constructed to accommodate door frames, baseboard, or any other intrusion. Large panels (generally, greater than {{convert|50|sqft|m2}}) can be created on walls and [[ceiling]]s with this method.  Wood finishes can consist of punched or routed slots and provide a natural look to the interior space, although acoustical absorption may not be great.

There are four ways to improve workplace acoustics and solve workplace sound problems – the ABCDs.
*A = Absorb (via drapes, carpets, ceiling tiles, etc.)
*B = Block (via panels, walls, floors, ceilings and layout)
*C = Cover-up (via sound masking)
*D = [[Diffusion_(acoustics)|Diffuse]] (cause the sound energy to spread by radiating in many directions)

== Mechanical equipment noise ==
Building services noise control is the science of controlling noise produced by:
*ACMV (air conditioning and mechanical ventilation) systems in buildings, termed [[HVAC]] in [[North America]]
*[[Elevator]]s
*[[Electrical generator]]s positioned within or attached to a building
*Any other building service infrastructure component that emits sound.

Inadequate control may lead to elevated [[Sound intensity level|sound level]]s within the space which can be annoying and reduce speech intelligibility.  Typical improvements are [[vibration isolation]] of mechanical equipment, and [[sound traps]] in ductwork.  [[Sound masking]] can also be created by adjusting HVAC noise to a predetermined level.

[[File:Asa Wright Center.jpg|thumb|right|View from the lodge [[veranda]] including a bird and feeder in the foreground]]
The '''Asa Wright Nature Centre and Lodge''' is a [[ecotourism|nature resort]] and scientific research station in the [[Arima]] Valley of the [[Northern Range]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The centre is one of the top [[birdwatching]] spots in the [[Caribbean]]; a total of 159 species of [[bird]]s have been recorded there. The centre is owned by a [[non-profit]] trust.

The nature centre is on 270 acres and includes a main estate house with inn and restaurant serving dishes such as [[callaloo]] soup with ingredients from an on-site organic garden.&lt;ref name=afar/&gt; Non-adjacent properties have also been added to the centre's land holdings.

==Description==
[[File:Asa Wright, her porch at Springhill home.1963, Trinidad.jpg|thumb|Asa Wright at home in 1967]]
The major properties are the '''Spring Hill Estate''' and the adjacent '''[[William Beebe]] Tropical Research Station''' (also known as '''Simla'''), which was established by the famous naturalist and explorer [[William Beebe]] as a tropical research station for the [[New York Zoological Society]]. Beebe bought the 'Verdant Vale' estate in 1949 and named it after [[Shimla|Simla]] in India, which he had visited in 1910.  Beebe stayed at Springhill in 1949 with the Wrights, while water and electricity connections were made to Simla, four miles down the road.  His bedroom is now the Springhill manager's office.&lt;ref name=Joy/&gt;{{rp|5-6}} 

The owners of the Spring Hill Estate, Newcombe and Asa Wright, hosted the noted [[ornithologists]] [[David Snow (ornithologist)|David Snow]] and [[Barbara Snow]] in the 1950s.  They made detailed studies of the [[oilbird]]s and the [[Bearded bellbird]].  Starting in 1965, Richard ffrench and Don Eckelberry collaborated in eventually publishing ''A Guide to the Birds of Trinidad and Tobago''.&lt;ref name=Joy/&gt;{{rp|47-49,51-52}}

The Wrights' home became internationally renowned for its easy access to wildlife, especially the [[oilbird]] (''Steatornis caripensis'') colonies in the nearby [[Dunston Cave]]. The Asa Wright Nature Center was established on 22 Dec. 1967, with the Royal Bank Trust Company (Trinidad) Limited appointed as Trustee.  The Trust was meant to protect Springhill "in perpetuity", developing its agriculture in an "ecologically sound" way while facilitating its "scientific and educational" potential.  Asa was allowed to live out the remaining years of her life according to a provision in agreement.  She passed away in 1971.&lt;ref name=Joy/&gt;{{rp|25,65-69}} In 1974, the New York Zoological Society donated Simla to the trust.&lt;ref&gt;Gould (2004), p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature centre in 2001 acquired the '''Rapsey Estate''', known as 'El Naranjo' for [[TT$]]3,3 million. The total nature centre holdings are now over 1,300 acres, but this still makes up less than 5% of the valley.&lt;ref name=Joy/&gt;{{rp|131,153}}

==Springhill== 
The home was built in 1906-8 on the cocoa estate originally known as Clearwater by Charles Meyer, on property bought by his father Fredrich Wilhelm Meyer in the Arima Valley.  The first four of eleven children between Charles and his wife Julia Marie Pouchet were born at Springhill.  The house was characterized by high ceilings, six rooms, with a hallway between the rear four, and a wide veranda overlooking the valley.  However, his father's estates were confiscated in [[World War I]] by the Trinidad colonial government, since he was of German origin. 

Charles' cocoa estate, already mortgaged, could no longer turn a profit when plagued by [[witch's broom]], and was reverted to the Agricultural Bank in 1925.  Andrew and Marianne Bernard bought the property in 1926, but once again the estate reverted to the bank.  The estate remained neglected until purchased in 1936 by Joseph Holmes, son of [[Joseph Austin Holmes]].  Holmes added two bathrooms, a water supply, [[septic tank]], generator, two room guest house, and a bathing pool at the foot of the waterfall.  

In the 1930s, it became a weekend retreat for [[Pan Am]] pilots, US Navy families, and government officials.  After [[World War II]], Newcome and Asa Wright bought all of the property except the ten acres containing the guest house, pool and waterfall.  However, in 1955, Asa acquired that remaining acreage after Newcome's death.&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudder|first1=Joy|title=The Old House and the Dream|date=2009|publisher=Prospect Press|location=Port of Spain|isbn=9789769508217|pages=11,21-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
The centre is one of the most biodiverse areas in the West Indies and is home to more than 400 bird species. Bird species at the nature centre include [[purple honeycreeper]], [[tufted coquette]] (a hummingbird), [[tropical mockingbird]], and [[oilbird]] (a nocturnal fruit eater).&lt;ref name=afar&gt;5 Asa Wright Nature Centre; Trinidad and Tobago November/ December 2011 Afar page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red brocket deer]] as well as the elusive  [[ocelot]] can be seen in the nature centre's trails. [[Agouti]] is also a common animal that occurs in the centre.

Although currently a [[Theravada]] Buddhism flourishing country, the [[Mahayana]] cult of worshipping '''Bodhisattva statues''' has existed in ancient [[Sri Lanka]]. Archaeological evidences show that [[Bodhisattva]] cult had existed as a secondary cult inferior to worship of [[Buddha]] during the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sanath Dharmabandu|title=චිත්‍ර හා මූර්ති කලාව|publisher=M.

==History==
During the middle [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]], [[Bodhisattva]] cult became very popular in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=වෙහෙරගල අව‍ලෝකිතේශ්වර බෝධිසත්ත්ව මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early period, [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Buddhism]] was predominantly flourished with [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravāda]] Buddhist ideas. Later, [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] aspects were developed. In the [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, [[Bodhisattva]]s were worshipped with a major significance. During the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]] it is mentioned that, [[Mahasena of Anuradhapura|King Mahāsēna]] had built Bodhisattva images.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura|King Dhatusena]] (459–477 CE) had built a statue of [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nandadeva Wijesekara|title=පැරණි සිංහල ප්‍රතිමා ශිල්පය|publisher=M. D. Gunasena and Company Ltd. |date=1997|chapter=සොයාගැනීම්වල ඉතිහාසය|isbn=9789553061812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several inscriptions mentioning [[Avalokitesvara]] has found from the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During 7th–10th centuries AD, [[Mahayana]] Buddhism had spread along the [[Sri Lanka]]n territory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is evidenced by many surviving Bodhisattva statues and carvings belonging to the period. It is mentioned that King [[Dappula I of Anuradhapura]] had built a 15 cubits-high [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ruhuna]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This image is believed to be the recently restored [[Dambegoda Bodhisattva statue]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is an evidence for the strong Maitreya cult in ancient Sri Lanka.

[[Bhuvanaikabahu IV of Gampola|King Bhuwanekabāhu IV]] of [[Kingdom of Gampola|Gampola]] has built Maitreya and [[Natha (Buddhist deity)|Nātha]] (Avalokitesvara) statues in [[Lankatilaka Vihara]]. It is mentioned that King [[Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy|Kirti Sri Rajasinghe]] had built a [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ridi Viharaya]]. ''Dambulu Viahara thudapatha'', a text dated to1780 CE mentions about some Maitreya and Nātha images of the temple. These images can be seen flanking the standing Buddha near the central entrance of [[Dambulla cave temple]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types== 
Both male and female [[Bodhisattva]] images has found from [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Avalokitesvara]] images play a significant role among the statuary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also various statues of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]], the wife of Avalokitesvara has found. It is assumed that cult of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]] may have been popular in ancient Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=තාරා දෙවඟන මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of [[Maitreya]] are also common. Statues of Bodhisattvas [[Vajrapani]] and [[Manjushri]] has found in Sri Lanka.

[[Bronze]], stone and [[ivory]] has used as the medium to create Bodhisattva images.

==Examples==
[[File:British Museum Asia 45 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Tara]]; [[British Museum]].]]
The [[Veheragala Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva]], currently displayed at [[Colombo National Museum]], is considered as the finest Bodhisattva image ever found in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This [[bronze]] statue belonging to [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]] is delicately designed. Also the [[Statue of Tara]], which is now housed in [[British Museum]] is considered as a masterpiece of Sri Lankan art. This image was originally found in [[Trincomalee]] district, [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=high&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/g/statue_of_tara.aspx Statue of Tara], Highlights, British Museum, accessed 9 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The 33-feet high [[Dambegoda Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva]] statue is also famous. Statues of [[Avalokitesvara]], [[Maitreya]], [[Manjushri]] and [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] can be seen at [[Buduruwagala]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Kushtharajagala Bodhisattva statue]] of [[Weligama]] is another example for Sri Lankan [[Bodhisattva]] images.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another fine [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] image can be seen at [[Colombo National Museum]]. This statue of [[Seated Tara]] was found from [[Kurunegala]] district. It is dated to 8th–9th century AD.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=හිඳි තාරා මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst there is a trend towards the miniaturization of devices, in particular, networks consisting of several miniaturized body sensor units (BSUs) together with a single body central unit (BCU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biomed Tech|year=2002|volume=47|pages=365–8|title=Body Area Network BAN—a key infrastructure element for patient-centered medical applications|vauthors=Schmidt R, Norgall T, Mörsdorf J, Bernhard J, von der Grün T |pmid=12451866|issue=1|doi=10.1515/bmte.2002.47.s1a.365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger decimeter (tab and pad) sized [[smart devices]], accompanied devices, still play an important role in terms of acting as a data hub, data gateway and providing a user interface to view and manage BAN applications, in-situ. The development of WBAN technology started around 1995 around the idea of using  [[wireless personal area network]] (WPAN) technologies to implement communications on, near, and around the human body. About six years later, the term "BAN" came to refer to systems where communication is entirely within, on, and in the immediate proximity of a human body.&lt;ref name=Yuce&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|year=2010|volume=162|issue=1|title=Implementation of wireless body area networks for healthcare systems|author=M.

Through gateway devices, it is possible to connect the wearable devices on the human body to the internet. This way, medical professionals can access patient data online using the internet independent of the patient location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9789814241571|author1=M.

==Concept==
The rapid growth in physiological sensors, low-power integrated circuits, and wireless communication has enabled a new generation of [[wireless sensor networks]], now used for purposes such as monitoring traffic, crops, infrastructure, and health. The body area network field is an interdisciplinary area which could allow inexpensive and continuous health monitoring with real-time updates of medical records through the Internet. A number of intelligent physiological sensors can be integrated into a wearable wireless body area network, which can be used for computer-assisted rehabilitation or early detection of medical conditions. This area relies on the feasibility of implanting very small biosensors inside the human body that are comfortable and that don't impair normal activities. The implanted sensors in the human body will collect various physiological changes in order to monitor the patient's health status no matter their location. The information will be transmitted wirelessly to an external processing unit. This device will instantly transmit all information in real time to the doctors throughout the world. If an emergency is detected, the physicians will immediately inform the patient through the computer system by sending appropriate messages or alarms. Currently the level of information provided and energy resources capable of powering the sensors are limiting. While the technology is still in its primitive stage it is being widely researched and once adopted, is expected to be a breakthrough invention in [[healthcare]], leading to concepts like [[telemedicine]] and [[mHealth]] becoming real.

==Applications==
Initial applications of BANs are expected to appear primarily in the healthcare domain, especially for continuous monitoring and logging vital parameters of patients suffering from [[chronic disease]]s such as [[diabetes]], [[asthma]] and [[heart attacks]].

* A BAN network in place on a patient can alert the hospital, even before they have a heart attack, through measuring changes in their [[vital signs]].
* A BAN network on a diabetic patient could auto inject insulin through a pump, as soon as their insulin level declines.

Other applications of this technology include sports, military, or security. Extending the technology to new areas could also assist communication by seamless exchanges of information between individuals, or between individual and machines.

==Standards==
The latest international standard for BANs is the [[IEEE 802.15.6]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.15.6-2012.html IEEE P802.15.6-2012 Standard for Wireless Body Area Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
A typical BAN or BSN requires vital sign monitoring [[sensors]], motion detectors (through [[accelerometers]]) to help identify the location of the monitored individual and some form of communication, to transmit vital sign and motion readings to medical practitioners or care givers. A typical body area network kit will consist of sensors, a [[microprocessor|Processor]], a [[transceiver]] and a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Physiological sensors, such as [[ECG]] and [[SpO2]] sensors, have been developed. Other sensors such as a blood pressure sensor, [[EEG]] sensor and a [[PDA]] for BSN interface are under development.&lt;ref&gt;http://vip.doc.ic.ac.uk/bsn/m621.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireless communication in the U.S.===
The FCC has approved the allocation of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum bandwidth for medical BAN low-power, wide-area radio links at the 2360–2400&amp;nbsp;MHz band. This will allow off-loading MBAN communication from the already saturated standard Wi-Fi spectrum to a standard band.&lt;ref name="urlBody Area Networks should free hospital bandwidth, untether patients - Computerworld"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9227683/_Body_Area_Networks_should_free_hospital_bandwidth_untether_patients?source=CTWNLE_nlt_emgtech_2012-06-06

|accessdate=2012-06-06
|date=2012-06-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2360–2390&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency range is available on a secondary basis. The FCC will expand the existing Medical Device Radiocommunication (MedRadio) Service in Part 95 of its rules. MBAN devices using the band will operate under a ‘license-by-rule’ basis which eliminates the need to apply for individual transmitter licenses. Usage of the 2360–2390&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies are restricted to indoor operation at health-care facilities and are subject to registration and site approval by coordinators to protect aeronautical telemetry primary usage. Operation in the 2390–2400&amp;nbsp;MHz band is not subject to registration or coordination and may be used in all areas including residential.&lt;ref name="urlFCC Dedicates Spectrum Enabling Medical Body Area Networks | FCC.gov"&gt;{{cite web

==Challenges==
Problems with the use of this technology could include:

* '''Data Quality''': Data generated and collected through BANs can play a key role in the patient care process. It is essential that the quality of this data is of a high standard to ensure that the decisions made are based on the best information possible
* '''Data Management''': As BANs generate large volumes of data, the need to manage and maintain these datasets is of utmost importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439821817;jsessionid=QYm6NTA3ICOGNBvOn3i9MA** Lai, D. , Begg, R.K. and Palaniswami, M. eds, Healthcare Sensor Networks: Challenges towards practical implementation], {{ISBN|978-1-4398-2181-7}}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sensor Validation''': Pervasive sensing devices are subject to inherent communication and hardware constraints including unreliable wired/wireless network links, interference and limited power reserves. This may result in erroneous datasets being transmitted back to the end user. It is of the utmost importance especially within a healthcare domain that all sensor readings are validated. This helps to reduce false alarm generation and to identify possible weaknesses within the hardware and software design.
* '''Data Consistency''': Data residing on multiple mobile devices and wireless patient notes need to be collected and analysed in a seamless fashion. Within body area networks, vital patient datasets may be fragmented over a number of nodes and across a number of networked PCs or Laptops. If a medical practitioner′s mobile device does not contain all known information then the quality of patient care may degrade.
* '''Security''': Considerable effort would be required to make WBAN transmission secure and accurate. It would have to be made sure that the patient ‘'secure‘’ data is only derived from each patient's dedicated WBAN system and is not mixed up with other patient's data. Further, the data generated from WBAN should have secure and limited access. Although security is a high priority in most networks, little study has been done in this area for WBANs. As WBANs are resource-constrained in terms of power, memory, communication rate and computational capability, security solutions proposed for other networks may not be applicable to WBANs. Confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and freshness of data together with availability and secure management are the security requirements in WBAN. The IEEE 802.15.6 standard, which is latest standard for WBAN, tried to provide security in WBAN. However, it has several security problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book&lt;!-- Deny Citation Bot--&gt; |arxiv = 1501.02601|last1 = Toorani|first1 = Mohsen|chapter= On Vulnerabilities of the Security Association in the IEEE 802.15.6 Standard|title= Financial Cryptography and Data Security |volume = 8976 |pages = 245–260|year = 2015|doi = 10.1007/978-3-662-48051-9_18|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn = 978-3-662-48050-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interoperability''': WBAN systems would have to ensure seamless [[data transfer]] across standards such as [[Bluetooth]], [[ZigBee]] etc. to promote information exchange, [[plug and play]] device interaction. Further, the systems would have to be [[scalable]], ensure efficient migration across networks and offer uninterrupted connectivity.
* '''System devices''': The sensors used in WBAN would have to be low on complexity, small in form factor, light in weight, power efficient, easy to use and reconfigurable. Further, the storage devices need to facilitate remote storage and viewing of patient data as well as access to external processing and analysis tools via the [[Internet]].
* '''Invasion of privacy''': People might consider the WBAN technology as a potential threat to freedom, if the applications go beyond "secure" medical usage. Social acceptance would be key to this technology finding a wider application.
* '''Interference''': The wireless link used for body sensors should reduce the interference and increase the coexistence of sensor node devices with other network devices available in the environment. This is especially important for large scale implementation of WBAN systems.&lt;ref name=Yuce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garcia P., "A Methodology for the Deployment of Sensor Networks", IEEE Transactions On Knowledge And Data Engineering, vol. 11, no. 4, December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Cost''': Today's consumers expect low cost health monitoring solutions which provide high functionality. WBAN implementations will need to be cost optimized to be appealing alternatives to health conscious consumers.
*'''Constant monitoring''': Users may require different levels of monitoring, for example those at risk of cardiac ischemia may want their WBANs to function constantly, while others at risk of falls may only need WBANs to monitor them while they are walking or moving. The level of monitoring influences the amount of energy required and the life cycle of the BAN before the energy source is depleted.
*'''Constrained deployment''': The WBAN needs to be wearable, lightweight and non intrusive. It should not alter or encumber the user's daily activities. The technology should ultimately be transparent to the user i.e., it should perform its monitoring tasks without the user realising it.
*'''Consistent performance''': The performance of the WBAN should be consistent. Sensor measurements should be accurate and calibrated, even when the WBAN is switched off and switched on again.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucc.ie/en/media/research/misl/2009publications/pervasive09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The wireless links should be robust and work under various user environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6968">'''Ceramic foam''' is a tough [[foam]] made from [[ceramic]]s. Manufacturing techniques include impregnating open-cell polymer foams internally with ceramic [[slurry]] and then firing in a [[kiln]], leaving only ceramic material. The foams may consist of several ceramic materials such as [[aluminium oxide]], a common high-temperature ceramic, and gets insulating properties from the many tiny air-filled voids within the material.

The foam can be used not only for thermal insulation,&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/05/010518082028.htm | title=Novel Ceramic Foam Is Safe And Effective Insulation | work=[[Science Daily]] | date=May 18, 2001 | accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for a variety of other applications such as [[acoustic insulation]],&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"/&gt; absorption of [[environmental pollutants]],&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"/&gt; filtration of molten metal alloys, and as substrate for [[catalyst]]s requiring large internal surface area.

It has been used as  stiff lightweight structural material, specifically for support of [[reflecting telescope]] mirrors.

== Properties ==
Ceramic foams are hardened ceramics with pockets of air or another gas trapped in [[Porosity|pores]] throughout the body of the material. These materials can be fabricated as high as 94 to 96% air by volume with temperature resistances as high as 1700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily" /&gt; Because many ceramics are already [[oxide]]s or other inert compounds, there is little danger of oxidation or reduction of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.induceramic.com/industrial-ceramic-product/ceramic-foam-insulation|title = Ceramic Foam Insulation - Industrial Ceramics|website = www.induceramic.com|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, pores had been avoided in ceramic components due to their [[Brittleness|brittle]] properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in practice ceramic foams have somewhat advantageous mechanical properties compared to bulk ceramics. One example is [[Fracture mechanics|crack propagation]], given by:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_t = 2\sigma\left ( \frac{a}{r} \right )^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;  is the stress at the tip of the crack, σ is the applied stress, a is the crack size and r is the radius of curvature. For certain stress applications, this means ceramic foams actually outperform bulk ceramics because the porous pockets of air act to blunt the crack tip radius, leading to a disruption of its propagation and a decrease in the likelihood of failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tallon | first1 = Carolina | last2 = Chuanuwatanakul | first2 = Chayuda | last3 = Dunstan | first3 = David E. | last4 = Franks | first4 = George V. | year = | title = Mechanical strength and damage tolerance of highly porous alumina ceramics produced from sintered particle stabilized foams | url = | journal = Ceramics International | volume = 42| issue = 7| pages = 8478–8487| doi = 10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing ==
Much like [[metal foam]]s, there are a number of accepted methods for creating ceramic foams. One of the earliest and still most common is the polymeric sponge method.&lt;ref&gt;K. Schwartzwalder and A. V. Somers, Method of Making Porous Ceramic Articles, US Pat. No. 3090094, May 21, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; A polymeric sponge is covered with a ceramic in suspension, and after rolling to ensure all pores have been filled, the ceramic-coated sponge is dried and pyrolysed to decompose the polymer, leaving only the porous ceramic structure. The foam must then be [[sintering|sintered]] for final densification. This method is widely used because it is effective with any ceramic able to be suspended; however, large amounts of gaseous byproducts are released and cracking due to differences in thermal expansion coefficients is common.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gonzenbach|first2=Urs T.|last3=Tervoort|first3=Elena|last4=Gauckler|first4=Ludwig J.|year=2006|title=Processing routes to macroporous ceramics: a review|url=|journal=J Am Ceram Soc|volume=89|issue=6|pages=1771–1789|doi=10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01044.x|via=|last1=Studart|first1=André R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above are both based on the use of a sacrificial template, there are also direct foaming methods that can be used. These methods involve pumping air into a suspended ceramic before setting and sintering. This is difficult because wet foams are thermodynamically unstable and can end up with very large pores after setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A recent method of creating aluminum oxide foams has also been developed.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily" /&gt; This technique involves heating crystals with the metal and forming compounds until a solution is created. At this point, polymer chains form and grow, causing the entire mixture to separate into a solvent and polymer. As the mixture begins to boil, air bubbles are trapped in solution and locked in to place as the material is heated and polymer is burned off.

== Use ==

=== Insulation ===
Due to ceramics' extremely low thermal conductivity, the most obvious use of a ceramic is as an insulation material.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily" /&gt; Ceramic foams are notable in this regard because their composition by very common compounds, such as aluminum oxide, makes them completely harmless, unlike [[asbestos]] and other ceramic fibers. Their high strength and hardness also allows them to be used as structural materials for low stress applications.

=== Electronics ===
With easily controlled porosities and microstructures, ceramic foams have seen growing use in evolving electronics applications. These applications include electrodes, and scaffolds for [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s and batteries. Foams can also be used as cooling components for electronics by separating a pumped coolant from the circuits themselves.&lt;ref&gt;W. Behrens, A. Tucker. Ceramic foam electronic component cooling. [http://www.google.ch/patents/US20070247808 US Pat No 20070247808 A1]. October 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For this application, [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], aluminum oxide, and aluminum borosilicate fibers can be used.

=== Pollution Control ===
Ceramic foams have been proposed as a means of pollutant control, particularly for particulate matter from engines.&lt;ref&gt;P. Ciambelli, G. Matarazzo, V. Palma , P. Russo , E. Merlone Borla, and M. F. Pidria. Reduction of soot pollution from automotive diesel engine by ceramic foam catalytic filter. ''Topics in Ceramics,'' 42-43. May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They are effective because the voids can capture particulates as well as support a catalyst that can induce oxidation of the captured particulates. Due to the easy means of deposition of other materials within ceramic foams, these oxidation-inducing catalysts can easily be distributed through the entire foam, increasing effectiveness.

'''Computer Arimaa''' refers to the playing of the [[board game]] [[Arimaa]] by [[computer program]]s.

In 2002, Indian American computer engineer Omar Syed published the rules to Arimaa and announced a $10,000 prize, available annually until 2020, for the first computer program (running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware) able to defeat each of three top-ranked human players in a three-game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Syed|first=Omar|author2=Syed, Aamir|year=2003|title=Arimaa – a New Game Designed to be Difficult for Computers|journal=International Computer Games Association Journal|volume=26|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was claimed in 2015, when a computer program played 7:2 against three human players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingpinchess.net/2015/07/arimaa-game-over/ Arimaa: Game Over?]&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been the subject of several [[#Research papers|research papers]].

==State space of Arimaa==

===Opening===
The number of different ways that each player can set up their pieces at the beginning of the game is:

&lt;math&gt;
\dbinom{16}{8} \cdot
\dbinom{8}{2}  \cdot
\dbinom{6}{2}  \cdot
\dbinom{4}{2}  \cdot
\dbinom{2}{1}  \cdot
\dbinom{1}{1} 
= 64,864,800
&lt;/math&gt;

The player can put 8 rabbits on 16 possible squares, followed by 2 cats on the 8 remaining squares, 2 dogs on the 6 remaining squares, 2 horses on the four remaining squares, one camel on one of the two remaining squares, and the elephant on the final unused square.

Because each player can start the game with one of 64,864,800 opening setups, the total state space for the opening is:

&lt;math&gt;
64,864,800^2 \approx      4.2 \cdot 10^{15}
&lt;/math&gt;

As Christ-Jan Cox said in his Master's thesis, because the number of possible initial states is so large, "[i]t follows that it is very difficult to develop complete databases of opening moves."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arimaa.com/arimaa/papers/CoxThesis/Cox_thesis1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence techniques==

===Material evaluation===
It is important for the computer to be able to evaluate the value of the pieces on the board so it can assess whether or not a capture or exchange would be desirable.  Assessing the relative value of pieces is an area of ongoing Arimaa research.  Some currently-used systems are DAPE and FAME.

===Techniques used in Arimaa bots===
The following techniques are used by some or all of the artificial intelligence programs that play Arimaa:
*[[Bitboard]]s
*[[Transposition table]]s
*[[Zobrist hashing]]
*[[Minimax#Minimax algorithm with alternate moves|Minimax]] and [[Alpha beta pruning]]
*[[Killer heuristic|Killer moves]] and [[Transposition table#Related techniques|refutation tables]]
*[[Static evaluation function]]
*[[Quiescence search]]
*[[Monte-Carlo Tree Search]]
*UCT

===Techniques rarely used In Arimaa bots===
*[[Chess opening book (computers)|Opening book]]
*[[Endgame tablebase]]

==Computer performance==

{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
Several aspects of Arimaa make it difficult for computer programs to beat good human players. Because so much effort has gone into the development of strong [[computer chess|chess-playing software]], it is particularly relevant to understand why techniques applicable to chess are less effective for Arimaa.

=== Brute-force searching ===
Top chess programs use [[brute-force search]]ing coupled with static position evaluation dominated by material considerations. Chess programs examine many, many possible moves, but they are not good (compared to humans) at determining who is winning at the end of a series of moves unless one side has more pieces than the other. The same is true for Arimaa programs, but their results are not as good in practice.

When brute-force searching is applied to Arimaa, the depth of the search is limited by the huge number of options each player has on each turn. Computationally, the number of options a player has available to them governs the number of different paths play can go down. This is known as the [[branching factor]]. The average branching factor in a game of Chess is about 35,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1171.asp | title=Chess Programming Part IV: Basic Search | author=François Dominic Laramée | publisher=[[GameDev.net]] | accessdate=2007-05-01 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514205121/http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1171.asp | archivedate=14 May 2007 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Arimaa it is about 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arimaa.janzert.com/bf_study/ | title=A Look at the Arimaa Branching Factor | author=Brian "Janzert" Haskin | work=janzert.com/ | accessdate=2009-11-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091107141949/http://arimaa.janzert.com/bf_study/| archivedate= 7 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These differing branching factors imply that a computer which can search to a depth of eight turns for each player in chess, can only search about three turns deep for each player in Arimaa:

&lt;math&gt;35^8 \approxeq 17000^3&lt;/math&gt;

=== Alpha-beta pruning ===
Brute force search depth, for chess software, is nearly doubled by [[alpha-beta pruning]], which allows the software to conclude that one move is better than another without examining every possible continuation of the weaker move. If the opponent can crush a certain move with one reply, it isn't necessary to examine other replies, which dramatically increases search speed. In Arimaa, however, the side to move switches only every four steps, which reduces the number of available cutoffs in a step-based search.

Furthermore, the usefulness of alpha-beta pruning is heavily dependent on the order in which moves are considered. Good moves must be considered before bad ones in order for the bad ones to be neglected. In particular, checking and capturing moves are key for pruning, because they are often much better than other moves. In Arimaa software the speedup provided by alpha-beta pruning is less, because captures are rarer. In rated games played on arimaa.com, only 3% of steps result in capture, compared to about 19% of chess moves that result in capture.

In most Arimaa positions, particularly toward the beginning of the game when the board is still crowded, a competent player can avoid losing any pieces within the next two turns. Compared to chess, Arimaa allows either player to delay captures for longer. Indeed, the median move number of the first capture in chess is turn 6, whereas in Arimaa it is turn 12. The struggle is initially more positional in Arimaa, and revolves around making captures unavoidable at some point in the future. This magnifies the importance of correctly judging who is gaining ground in non-material ways. Thus the strength of computer programs (examining millions of positions) is not as significant as their weakness (judging the position apart from who has more pieces).

The weakness of Arimaa programs in the opening phases is further magnified by the setup phase. In chess every game starts from the same position. By compiling before the game a list of stock replies to all standard opening moves, chess programs may often make a dozen or more excellent moves before starting to "think". Humans do the same, but have a smaller and less reliable memory of openings, which puts humans at a relative disadvantage in chess. Arimaa, in contrast, has millions of possible ways to set up the pieces even before the first piece moves. This prevents programs from having any meaningful opening book.

As the game progresses, exchanges and the advancement of rabbits tend to make the position more open and tactical. Arimaa programs typically play better in this sort of position, because they see tactical shots which humans overlook. However, it is usually possible for humans to avoid wide-open positions by conservative play, and to angle for strategic positions in which computers fare worse. Against a conservative opponent it is almost impossible to bust open the position in Arimaa, whereas in chess it is merely difficult. One must beat defensive play by the accumulation of small, long-term advantages, which programs do not do very well.

One additional technique from computer chess which does not apply to Arimaa is [[endgame tablebase]]s. Master-level chess games sometimes trade down into unclear endgames with only a few pieces, for example king and knight vs. king and rook. It is possible to build, by [[retrograde analysis]], an exhaustive table of the correct move in all such positions. Programs have only to consult a pre-generated table in such positions, rather than "thinking" afresh, which gives them a relative advantage over humans. Arimaa, in contrast, seldom comes to an endgame. Equal exchanges of pieces are less common than in chess, so it is rare for a game of Arimaa to "trade down" and still be unclear. An average game of Arimaa has only eight captures (compared to seventeen for chess), and top humans can often defeat top programs in Arimaa without losing a single piece, for example [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/games/jsShowGame.cgi?gid=298810&amp;s=w the second game of the 2014 Challenge match]. Another example of low capture density is [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/games/jsShowGame.cgi?gid=218654&amp;s=w this semifinal game of the 2012 World Championship], featuring only a single capture, a goal-forcing elephant sacrifice.

Omar Syed hopes that, because traditional artificial intelligence techniques are only moderately effective for Arimaa, programmers will be forced to use new artificial intelligence techniques to create a strong Arimaa-playing program. The successful quest to build a world-championship-caliber chess program has produced many techniques to successfully play games, but has contributed essentially nothing to more general reasoning; in fact, the techniques of chess playing programs have been excluded from some definitions of [[artificial intelligence]]; a goal for Arimaa is that the techniques involved in playing it will help the larger goals of artificial intelligence.

The structure of Syed's man-against-machine challenge is focused on rewarding advances in AI software and not advances in hardware. In the annual challenge, programs are run on machines chosen and provided by Syed himself, under the criterion that it be a typical, inexpensive, off-the-shelf home computer. The challenge would not be open to anyone requiring expensive multi-processor machines such as those used to challenge top-level chess players, much less something like the custom-built supercomputer [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]], even though it was the success of this hardware-intensive approach which inspired Arimaa's invention. Syed believes that even the computer used in the 2004 challenge match (a Pentium 4 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz system with 512 MB of RAM) had sufficient hardware to win the challenge prize if only it was running the proper software. Supercomputers might already have the power to conquer Arimaa by brute force using conventional AI software, and eventually personal computers will too, if hardware continues to advance at the current rate. This is why the Arimaa challenge prize is offered only until the year 2020.

==Comparing the Arimaa Challenge to chess challenges==
{{OR-section|date=April 2015}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

It has been argued that a computer has beaten the world chess champion but not beaten the human in the Arimaa Challenge (until 2015) because of six reasons:

# Arimaa is a new game. Therefore, the number of programmers and amount of time devoted to computer Arimaa is much less than for computer chess. Computer chess had thousands more programmers and 40 more years than computer Arimaa. The later and smaller effort resulted in less and slower progress in computer Arimaa.
# The rules for the Arimaa Challenge required the computer to show a higher playing ability than the rules for the chess matches. &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt; [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/2009/ Rules to the Arimaa Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; The rules don't even contain the word chess! Clearly this reference alone cannot be used.--&gt; In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer must beat three human players in three matches. In the chess matches, the computer must win one match against one human player.
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer needs to score 2/3 of the total points to win. In chess matches, the computer needs to score more than 1/2 of the total points to win.
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer needs to win a qualification match. Humans are allowed to study the computer's previous games to find the computer’s weaknesses. In chess, there is no qualification match and no requirement that the computer's previous games be made publicly available.{{dubious|date=November 2013}}
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer cannot be improved between games. In chess, the computer was improved between games.
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the rules reject powerful or custom-made computers priced over $1,000. However, a powerful custom-made computer beat the world chess champion.

However, the Arimaa community disputes this argument point by point. To the first point, Arimaa is a new game, so the playing community is still small and even the best players are not professional players and have only been playing the game for a few years. Thus the human players in the Arimaa Challenge are much weaker than the human players in the chess challenge. The weakness of human players should make the Arimaa Challenge easier to conquer than chess, which compensates developers for having studied the problem for a shorter time.

The remaining five points compare the Arimaa Challenge only to Kasparov vs. Deep Blue, ignoring all other man vs. machine chess matches in which computers have prevailed. The chess match which can most closely be compared to the Arimaa Challenge match is the [[Man vs Machine World Team Championship]]. In 2004 and 2005 a team of humans played against a team of computer opponents. In both years the computers won by wide margin. In 2005 all three humans lost, the computers won 2/3 of the total points, the chess engines were commercially available for the humans to study, and the machine hardware used was not a supercomputer, but rather comparable to hardware used in the Arimaa Challenge.

Man-vs.-machine chess matches since 2005 have shown increasing computer dominance. For example, the 2006 [[Vladimir Kramnik#Deep Fritz match|Deep Fritz vs. Vladimir Kramnik]] and 2007 Rybka vs. Jaan Ehlvest matches gave additional advantages to the human player, but the computers (running on commodity hardware) prevailed anyway.

==Resources for software developers==
The [http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/ Arimaa Engine Interface], developed by Brian Haskin, defines a protocol that allows an Arimaa engine to communicate with a controller.

According to the documentation: "An engine is a program capable of taking the state of an Arimaa game and selecting a legal move to make. A controller is anything that wants to communicate with and control an engine. This could be anything from a simple script to have the engine analyse a single position to a GUI program that allows games to be played with humans or other engines."&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/aei-protocol.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arimaa Engine Interface includes an implementation of an engine and controller, documentation, and various scripts to control the engine and play games on any website which supports the protocol, including the official Arimaa website.&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/readme.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/devBot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Cut-Off grade is the minimum grade required in order for a [[mineral]] or [[metal]] to be economically [[Mining|mined]] (or processed). Material found to be above this grade is considered to be [[ore]], while material below this grade is considered to be waste.

The cut-off grade can be determined through a variety of methods, each of varying complexity. Cut-off grades are selected to achieve a certain objective, such as resource utilization or economic benefit. Dividing these objectives even further gives way to specific goals such as the maximization of total profits, immediate profits, and present value. It is important to recognize that the cut-off grade is not simply calculated to a definitive answer. It is in fact a strategic variable that has major implications on mine design. The cut-off grade is adapted as the economic environment changes with regard to [[metal prices]] and mining costs, and is therefore a constantly changing. Metal value is not the only factor affecting the profitability of a block. The presence of unwanted (often [[Hazardous waste|hazardous]]) material in a block may increase the processing cost. This should also be considered when classifying waste rock and ore.

[[File:Wiki-dthroat.png|thumb|Illustration of a woman deep-throating a man]]

'''Deep-throating''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]] in which a person takes a partner's entire erect [[Human penis|penis]] deep into the [[Human mouth|mouth]] and throat. The practice is a type of [[fellatio]] where the receptive partner (the one whose mouth receives the penis) is in control, while deep throat penetration by an actively thrusting partner is called [[irrumatio]]; both are a form of [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name="Grandma's Sex Handbook 161"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZxVCHdCqOKYC&amp;pg=PA161 | title=Grandma's Sex Handbook | publisher=Intimate Press, USA | accessdate=January 7, 2012 | author=Wright, Anne | year=2009 | pages=161 | isbn=978-0-578-02075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3QJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39 | title=Leonardo da Vinci: A PSYCHOSEXUAL STUDY OF AN INFANTILE REMINISCENCE | publisher=MOFFAT YARD &amp; COMPANY | author=Freud, Sigmund | year=1916 | location=New York | pages=39 | quote=The situation contained in the phantasy, that a vulture opened the mouth of the child and forcefully belabored it with its tail, corresponds to the idea of fellatio, a sexual act in which the member is placed into the mouth of the woman. | accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For deep-throating, the penis has to be long enough so that it can reach the back of the recipient's throat.&lt;ref name="Grandma's Sex Handbook 161"/&gt;

The technique and term were popularized by the 1972 [[pornographic]] film [[Deep Throat (film)|''Deep Throat'']].

Deep-throating can be difficult, due to the natural [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] triggered when the [[soft palate]] is touched.&lt;ref name="urlMedical Neurosciences"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html|title=Medical Neurosciences|last=McDougal|first=David|last2=Van Lieshout|first2=Dave|date=|website=|publisher=UW-Madison Medical school.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024508/http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html|archive-date=March 6, 2012|dead-url=yes|last3=Harting|first3=John|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ | title=About WordNet - WordNet - About WordNet | publisher=Princeton University. | date=2010 | accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, and with practice, some people learn to suppress it. Deep-throating leads to an entirely different kind of oral stimulation in comparison to regular [[fellatio]]: the tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and sucking becomes impossible;&lt;ref name="Gentry"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=q8qtd61hoB8C&amp;pg=PA260 | title=The Bedside Orgasm Book: 365 Days of Sexual Ecstasy | publisher=Fair Winds Press | accessdate=January 7, 2012 | author=Gentry, Cynthia W. | year=2005 | location=Gloucester, Massachusetts USA | pages=260 | isbn=1-59233-101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[glans penis]] can be intensely stimulated by the tightness of the [[pharynx]].

== Sex positions ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
There are several [[Sex positions|positions]] that are well suited for performing deep throat. Relaxation of the throat muscles is the most important aspect of positioning. 

One common position is to align the mouth and throat into a straight line (like a [[sword swallower]]), but many different positions are possible. 

"Over-the-edge" is a common position for deep-throating. In this position, the receptive partner lies back and hangs his or her head off the edge of a bed or similar piece of furniture, and the insertive partner stands or kneels in front of the face, lining up his penis at mouth level. 

Another common position used for deep-throating involves the insertive partner sitting on the receptive partner's chest, with his penis in front of the face.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1099">In [[telecommunication]]s, '''deterministic routing''' is the advance determination of the routes between given pairs of nodes. Examples:
#In a network where routing is controlled by a [[telephone switch]] or [[network switch]], switching in which the routes between given pairs of nodes are pre-programmed, ''i.e.,'' are determined, in advance of [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]]. The routes used to complete a given [[telecommunication circuit|call]] through a network are identified, in advance of transmission, in [[routing]] tables maintained in each [[Network switch|switch]] [[database]]. The tables assign the trunks that are to be used to reach each switch [[code]], area code, and International Access Prefix (IAP), usually with one or two alternate routes. 
#In a non-switched network, the routes used to send a given [[message]] through the network are identified in advance in routing tables maintained in a database.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8533">'''Dietary Reference Values''' (DRV) is the name of the nutritional requirements systems used by the [[United Kingdom]] [[Department of Health]] and the [[European Union]]'s [[European Food Safety Authority]].

In 1991, the [[United Kingdom]] [[Department of Health]] published the '''''Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom'''''. This records Dietary Reference Values which recommended nutritional intakes for the UK population. The DRVs can be divided into three types:&lt;ref&gt;Dietary Reference Values of Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom (Report on Health &amp; Social Subjects)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A comparison of dietary reference values for energy of different countries|last1=Hauber |first1=U |last2=Bruce |first2=A |last3=Neuhäuser-Berthold |first3=M |pmid=9467239|volume=36|journal=Z Ernahrungswiss|pages=394-402 |date=1997 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*RNI - Reference Nutrient Intake (95% of the population's requirement is met)
*EAR - Estimated Average Requirement (50% of the population's requirement is met)
*LRNI - Lower Recommended Nutritional Intake (5% of the population's requirement is met)

RNI is not the same as [[Dietary Reference Intake|RDA]] (Recommended Daily Allowance) or [[Guideline Daily Amount|GDA]], although they are often similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/foodfacts/food-labelling-and-health-claims?start=2 |title=Food labelling and health claims |accessdate=31 January 2011 |publisher=British Nutrition Foundation }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current recommendations==

General advice is given for healthy people using the table. The government recommends that healthy people should eat a diet which contains plenty of starch (rice, bread, pasta and potatoes). It also recommends that a person should eat at least 5 fruit or vegetable portions each day. Meat, fish, eggs and other protein-rich foods should be eaten in moderation. Dairy products should also be moderately consumed. Finally, salt, saturated fat and sugar should be eaten least of all.

This advice is summarized in the '''[[eatwell guide]]'''&lt;ref name=eatwell&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide | title=The Eatwell Guide | accessdate=30 July 2018 | publisher=Public Health England (part of UK government)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Note that exceptions to these rules include pregnant women and young children. Additionally, those who have little exposure to sunlight may need to take vitamin D supplementation.

===Sources of energy===
The Dietary Reference Values below are specified mainly for adults. They define the proportion of a person's total energy intake which should come from different components of food. These include fat and fatty acids, fibre, starch and sugars. Note that these values do not apply to children, and children younger than five with small appetites should not have such restrictions imposed.&lt;ref name="nutguide"&gt;http://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/nutrientinstitution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Nutrient !! Population average % of food energy&lt;ref name="nutguide" /&gt;
|-
| Saturated Fatty Acid || Not more than 11%
|-
| Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid || 6.5%
|-
| Monounsaturated Fatty Acid || 13%
|-
| Trans fats || Not more than 2%
|-
| Total Fat || Not more than 35%
|-
| Non-milk extrinsic sugars || Not more than 11%
|-
| Intrinsic milk sugars and starch || 39%
|-
| Total Carbohydrate || 50%
|-
| Fibre as non-starch polysaccharide || 18% [not applicable to children under 5]
|-
|}

===Salt===

The guideline salt intake for adults is about 6 grams of salt (approximately one teaspoon). The Food Standards Agency estimate the average salt intake is about 8.6 grams/day &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/jul/sodiumrep08|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] Food Standards Agency - UK salt intake levels heading in the right direction|author=Food Standards Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2008). A high salt diet is likely to increase the risk of high blood pressure, which is associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Age !! Target salt intake (grams per day)&lt;ref name="nutguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eatwell" /&gt;
|-
| 0–6 months || Less than 1g
|-
| 7–12 months || 1g
|-
| 1–3 years || 2g
|-
| 4–6 years || 3g
|-
| 7–10 years || 5g
|-
| 11 years+ || 6g
|-
|}

===Protein, vitamins and minerals===

Recommendations for protein, vitamins and minerals vary by age. Where different intakes for males and females are recommended, the higher value is identified in the table below to ensure that the greatest daily needs of the group is met: 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Nutrient !! 1-3yrs !! 4-6yrs !! 7-10yrs !! 11-14yrs !! 15-18yrs !! Adults 19-50 yrs !! Adults 50+ 
|-

|-
| Zinc || 5mg || 6.5mg || 7mg || 9mg || 9.5mg || 9.5mg || 9.5mg
|-
| Vitamin A (retinol equivalents) || 400mcg || 400mcg || 500mcg || 600mcg || 700mcg || 700mcg || 700mcg 
|-
| Folate || 70mcg || 100mcg || 150mcg || 200mcg || 200mcg || 200mcg || 200mcg 
|-
| Vitamin C || 30mg || 30mg || 30mg || 35mg || 40mg || 40mg || 40mg
|-
|}

==Extension to EU level==
{{update|date=July 2013}}
In recent times,{{When|date=June 2012}} '''Dietary Reference Values''' are under the interest of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] too, which intend to extend them at the EU level. EFSA is the equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, and acts as watchdog inside the European market in order to establish a common ground on food safety requirements and nutrition as well.

EFSA met in September 2009 with representative of the Member States in order to gain their views on fats, carbohydrates, fibres and water as well as Food-Based Dietary Guidelines.
Furthermore EFSA is searching for comments (Open Consultation) by 15 October, in order to validate its assumptions on the need to have:

* carbohydrates comprising 45%–60% of the overall daily caloric intake
* fats being comprised among 20%–35% of the overall caloric intake
* fibre needs: complying with 25 grams/day

EFSA considers that there are not sufficient data to set DRVs for sugars, and not systematic scientific substantiation linking diseases such as stroke or diabetes (DMT1 or DMT2) to an increased intake of sugars (glycemic load/glycemic index).
In any case, there is much literature referring to this link, on journals with very high impact factor and statistically robust design and results

Many problems seem nowadays to derive from having integrated EU level DRV:
* the presence of a previous EFSA opinion on Food Based Dietary Guidelines, aimed at stressing the need of having only country-based guidelines, against the WHO hypothesis. This is due to very different food patterns, for EFSA, inside Europe.
* the presence of private scheme such as GDA (Guidelines on Daily Amounts), referring on the same subject (calories from nutrient groups) but casting shadow on the effectiveness of DRVs as public authorities' scheme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38144">Dyslexia is a neurological symptom wherein an individual experiences difficulty reading. The neurological nature and underlying causes of dyslexia are an active area of research, and the distinction of dyslexia as a condition is a topic of some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9752.2008.00653.x|title = Does Dyslexia Exist?|journal = Journal of Philosophy of Education|volume = 42|issue = 3–4|pages = 475–491|year = 2008|last1 = Elliott|first1 = Julian G|last2 = Gibbs|first2 = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
{{main|History of dyslexia research}}
Dyslexia was first identified by Oswald Berkhan in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;BERKHAN O. Neur. Zent 28 1917&lt;/ref&gt; and the term 'dyslexia' later coined in 1887 by [[Rudolf Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rudolf Berlin: Originator of the term dyslexia |journal=Annals of Dyslexia|date=January 1973|first=Rudolph|last=Wagner|volume=23|issue= 1 |pages=57–63|doi= 10.1007/BF02653841}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[ophthalmologist]] practicing in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
|title = Uber Dyslexie | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie | volume = 15| pages = 276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the twentieth century, dyslexia was primarily seen as a [[phonological deficit]] (specifically phonological awareness) that resulted in a reading deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christo, Catherine|author2=John M. Davis|author3=Stephen E. Brock|title=Identifying, Assessing, and Treating Dyslexia at School.|year=2009|publisher=New York: Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ott, Philomena|title=Teaching Children with Dyslexia: A Practical Guide.|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|ISBN= 978-0415324540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reid, Gavin|title=The Routledge Companion to Dyslexia|year=2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|ISBN=978-0415430784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyslexia was seen as an issue with reading achievement specifically, caused by deficits in discrimination of written word sounds as opposed to a broader disorder of brain function. However, much research from the 1990s onward has focused on the potential biological bases of dyslexia and understanding dyslexia as a disorder of brain function. One of the first weaknesses of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis for dyslexia was its inability to account for the genetic link of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Reading Disability Research.|author1=McGill-Franzen|first=Anne|author2=Allington|first2=Richard L.|publisher=New York: Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0805853346|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it's been shown that "Relatively high heritabilities were observed for both reading ability and dyslexia indicating substantial genetic influences."&lt;ref name=PractHandbook/&gt; In a large twin study (sample 1031 twins), Gayan and Olson established that dyslexia was highly heritable, while a family study by Pennington (sample 1698 individuals) showed familial risk rates of 35-45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Olson, RK|title=Reading Disability: Evidence for a Genetic Etiology|journal=European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=52–55|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1991|title=Evidence for Major Gene Transmission of Developmental Dyslexia|url=|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=266|issue=11|pages=1527–1534|doi=10.1001/jama.1991.03470110073036|pmid=1880884|via=|vauthors=Pennington BF, Gilger JW, Pauls D, Smith SA, Smith SD, DeFries JC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without a biological explanation for dyslexia, this heritability went unexplained. Not only must the heritability be explained, but also the environmental factors that protected at-risk children from developing dyslexia. Research began to focus on potential biological causes and to center the study of dyslexia in a developmental framework. A second major weakness of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis was its strict definition of dyslexia as a reading disorder. Consequently, the various secondary symptoms were unable to be explained, including automatization deficits of both skill and knowledge acquisition, balance impairments, motor skill/writing deficits, and muscle tone underdevelopment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; New theories of dyslexia began to be a focus of research, with the most well established being the [[biological theories of dyslexia|magnocellular deficit theory]] the [[biological theories of dyslexia|automatization deficit theory]], and the double-deficit hypothesis.&lt;ref name=PractHandbook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reid, Gavin,|title= Dyslexia: A Practitioner's Handbook.|year=2016|publisher=Chichester : Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-0470760406}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=April 2018}}

==Theories==
Theories of the [[etiology]] of dyslexia have and are evolving with each new generation of dyslexia researchers, and the more recent theories of dyslexia tend to enhance one or more of the older theories as understanding of the nature of dyslexia evolves.

Theories should not be viewed as competing, but as attempting to explain the underlying causes of a similar set of symptoms from a variety of research perspectives and background.&lt;ref name=theories&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ramus F, Rosen S, Dakin SC |title=Theories of developmental dyslexia: insights from a multiple case study of dyslexic adults |journal=Brain |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=841–65 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12615643 |doi=10.1093/brain/awg076 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12615643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nicolson RI, Fawcett AJ |title=Procedural learning difficulties: reuniting the developmental disorders? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=135–41 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17328970 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.02.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cerebellar theory===
The '''cerebellar theory of dyslexia'''  asserts that the cause of dyslexia is an abnormality in the [[cerebellum]] (a region in the back of the brain), which in turn cause disruption in normal development, which causes issues with motor control, balance, working memory, attention, automatization, and ultimately, reading.&lt;ref name=Mody2008&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mody|author2=Sillman|title=Brain, Behavior, and Learning in Language and Reading Disorders|year=2008|publisher=London : The Guilford Press|isbn = 978-1593858315}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=April 2018}}   This theory was initially proposed by [[Harold Levinson]] and Jan Frank in 1973 and further developed by Levinson and other researchers. Angela Fawcett and Rod Nicolson later proposed that the [[cerebellum]] contributes to motor control during the [[Manner of articulation|articulation of speech]], and that articulation problems can contribute to the [[phonological]] processing deficits that can cause dyslexia. They also reasoned that the cerebellum contributes to the automatisation of learned behaviors, which may include learning the [[grapheme]]-[[phoneme]] relationships when reading text.&lt;ref name=Stoodley2009&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Stoodley CJ, Stein JF |title=The cerebellum and dyslexia |journal=Cortex |volume= 47|issue= 1|pages= 101–16|date=October 2009 |pmid=20060110 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2009.10.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FNSage&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Reid, Gavin|title=The SAGE Handbook of Dyslexia|year=2013|isbn=9781412945134|chapter=Chapter 4:Dyslexia and the Cerebellum|first1=Angela J.|last1=Fawcett|first2=Roderick I.|last2=Nicolson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}}


In attempting to explain all the many known reading and non-reading dyslexic symptoms, therapies and theories as well as the presence of only cerebellar and related vestibular neurophysiological signs in dyslexics, the cerebellum was postulated to coordinate in time and space all signals (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, motion) entering and leaving the brain as well as signal interconnections. The quality and severity of the many symptoms characterizing each dyslexic was reasoned to depend on the diverse cerebral cortical and other brain processors receiving scrambled signals due to a cerebellar dysfunction. Helpful therapies were reasoned to enhance cerebellar fine tuning (e.g., the use of cerebellar-vestibular stabilizing antimotion sickness medications) and/or improve descrambling and other compensatory cognitive capabilities (e.g., tutoring, biofeedback). Most other theories equate the dyslexia disorder with impaired reading comprehension and so attempt to only explain the latter. Another cerebellar proposal indicated that articulation problems can contribute to the phonological deficits that can cause dyslexia. The cerebellum also contributes to the automitisation of learned behaviors, which can include learning the grapheme-phoneme relationships when reading texts.&lt;ref name=Stoodley2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

However, some have suggested that cerebellar dysfunction alone may not be a primary cause of dyslexia and that dysarticulation and phonological deficits appear unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Irannejad, S.  |author2=Savage, R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Is a cerebellar deficit the underlying cause of reading difficulties?|journal=Annals of Dyslexia|year=2012|volume=62|pages=22–52|doi=10.1007/s11881-011-0060-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoodley|first=Catherine J.|author2=Stein, John F.|title=Cerebellar Function in Developmental Dyslexia|journal=The Cerebellum|date=1 August 2012|doi=10.1007/s12311-012-0407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ramus |first1=F. |last2=Pidgeon |first2=E. |last3=Frith |first3=U. |title=The relationship between motor control and phonology in dyslexic children |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |year=2003|doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary hypothesis===
This theory considers that reading is an unnatural act carried out for a very brief period in human evolutionary history. It has only been in the last hundred years that reading a visual form of speech has been promoted as a major form of communication, and subsequently a lack of time for reading behaviors to evolve. In many societies around the world the majority of the population do not use the visual notation of speech as a form of communication and do not use reading skills, and therefore have no dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dalby JT |title=An ultimate view of reading ability |journal=The International Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=227–30 |date=September 1986 |pmid=3759349 |doi=10.3109/00207458608985671 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many developmental dyslexics significantly compensate for their cerebellar-vestibular
determined symptoms and signs over time and most normal young children evidence age-appropriate "dyslexic-like" symptoms and cerebellar-vestibular(CV) "immaturities." It was thus hypothesized that genetic dyslexia may represent an [[ontogenetic]] [[recapitulation theory|recapitulation]] of a pre-reading state in [[phylogeny]] and that [[ontogeny]] extended beyond the embryo into childhood and occasionally beyond, thus perhaps explaining late and even late-late blooming.&lt;ref name="Levinson2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Levinson |first=H.N. |title=The discovery of cerebellar-vestibular syndromes and therapies, a solution to the riddle dyslexia |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag; Stonebridge Publishing |pages=99–100 |year=2000 |isbn=0963930311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of reading and related writing and spelling functioning, as well as the corresponding ontogenetic CV-cerebral developmental lag hypothesis of dyslexia, is indirectly supported by studies suggesting that "the cerebellum has enlarged between three and fourfold in [only] the past million years of evolution [together with a corresponding spurt of the cerebrum]."&lt;ref name="Linas"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Linas |first=R. |year=1975 |title=The cortex of the cerebellum |journal=Scientific American |volume=232 |pages=56–71 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0175-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palay"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Palay |first1=S.L. |last2=Chan-Palay |first2=V. |year=1974 |title=Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=9780387062280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnocellular theory===
The Magnocellular theory attempts to unify the Cerebellar Theory, the Phonological Theory, the Rapid Auditory Processing Theory, and the Visual Theory.  The Magnocellular theory proposes that the [[magnocellular part|magnocellular]] dysfunction is not only restricted to the visual pathways but also includes auditory and tactile [[Stimulus modality|modalities]].&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ray NJ, Fowler S, Stein JF |title=Yellow filters can improve magnocellular function: motion sensitivity, convergence, accommodation, and reading |journal=Ann.

As of 2010, studies of [[Evoked_potential#Visual_evoked_potential|visual evoked potentials]] have generally supported this theory.  While some studies of contrast sensitivity have supported it. Subjects' age (10-46), differences in experimental design, small sample sizes (&lt;10 dyslexic subjects in prominent studies), and the presence, absence, or failure to assess for comorbid ADHD might explain these contradictory findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulte-Körne|first=Gerd|author2=Bruder, Jennifer|title=Clinical neurophysiology of visual and auditory processing in dyslexia: A review|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|date=1 November 2010|volume=121|issue=11|pages=1794–1809|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2010.04.028|pmid=20570212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming speed deficit and double deficit theories===
The speed with which an individual can engage in the [[rapid automatized naming]] of familiar objects or letters is a strong predictor of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Denckla MB, Rudel RG |title=Rapid "automatized" naming (R.A.N): dyslexia differentiated from other learning disabilities |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=471–9 |year=1976 |pmid=995240 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(76)90075-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slow naming speed can be identified as early as kindergarten and persists in adults with dyslexia.

A deficit in naming speed is hypothesized to represent a deficit that is separate from phonological processing deficit. Wolf identified four types of readers: readers with no deficits, readers with phonological processing deficit, readers with naming speed deficit, and readers with double deficit (that is, problems both with phonological processing and naming speed). Students with double deficits are most likely to have some sort of severe reading impairment.

Distinguishing among these deficits has important implications for instructional intervention. If students with double deficits receive instruction only in phonological processing, they are only receiving part of what they need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Birsh |first=Judith R. |year=2005 |chapter=Alphabet knowledge: letter recognition, naming and sequencing |editor=Judith R.

===Perceptual visual-noise exclusion hypothesis===
The concept of a [[Perceptual noise exclusion hypothesis|perceptual noise exclusion]] deficit (impaired filtering of behaviorally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia or visual-noise) is an emerging hypothesis, supported by research showing that subjects with dyslexia experience difficulty in performing visual tasks (such as motion detection in the presence of perceptual distractions) but do not show the same impairment when the distracting factors are removed in an experimental setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sperling AJ, Lu ZL, Manis FR, Seidenberg MS |title=Motion-perception deficits and reading impairment: it's the noise, not the motion |journal=Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=1047–53 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17201786 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01825.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Roach NW, Hogben JH |title=Impaired filtering of behaviourally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia |journal=Brain |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=771–85 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17237361 |doi=10.1093/brain/awl353 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17237361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers have analogized their findings concerning visual discrimination tasks to findings in other research related to auditory discrimination tasks. They assert that dyslexic symptoms arise because of an impaired ability to filter out both visual and auditory distractions, and to categorize information so as to distinguish the important sensory data from the irrelevant.&lt;ref name=Sperling2005&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sperling AJ, Lu ZL, Manis FR, Seidenberg MS |title=Deficits in perceptual noise exclusion in developmental dyslexia |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=862–3 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15924138 |doi=10.1038/nn1474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonological deficit theory===
The [[phonological deficit]] theory proposes that people with dyslexia have a specific sound manipulation impairment, which affects their auditory memory, word recall, and sound association skills when processing speech. The phonological theory explains a reading impairment when using an [[alphabetic]] writing system which requires learning the [[grapheme]]/[[phoneme]] correspondence, the relationship between the graphic letter symbols and  speech sounds which they represent.&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

===Rapid auditory processing theory===
The rapid auditory processing theory is an alternative to the phonological deficit theory, which specifies that the primary deficit lies in the perception of short or rapidly varying sounds. Support for this theory arises from evidence that people with dyslexia show poor performance on a number of auditory tasks, including frequency discrimination and temporal order judgment.&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

===Visual theory===
The visual theory represents a traditional perspective of dyslexia, as being the result of a visual impairment creating problems when processing information from letters and words from a written text. This includes visual processing problems such as [[binocular vision|binocular]], poor [[vergence]], and visual crowding. The Visual Theory does not deny the possibility of alternative causes of dyslexia&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

==Research==
Various methods and models have been used to study dyslexia.

===Genetics===
High genetic concordance found in [[twin studies]] suggest a significant genetic influence on reading ability, although the degree depends on the definition of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=RK|title=Dyslexia: nature and nurture|journal=Dyslexia|year=2002|volume=8|issue=3|pages=143–159|doi=10.1002/dys.228|pmid=12222731}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linkage analysis]] and [[genetic association]] studies (typically [[quantitative trait locus]] association studies, which use [[microarrays]] to look at [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] of multiple genes at once) have been used to identify [[candidate gene]]s that may be implicated in dyslexia, which have then been confirmed in various [[Knockout mouse|knockout models]].&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt;

As of 2018 the leading candidate genes included [[DYX1C1]] on [[chromosome 15]], [[DCDC2]] and [[KIAA0319]] on [[chromosome 6]], and [[ROBO1]] on [[chromosome 3]].&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shastry" &gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shastry BS |title=Developmental dyslexia: an update |journal=J.

However, these genes account for a small proportion of variance in reading disability, often less than 0.5%.{{mcn|date=November 2018}} Additionally, the findings are not always replicated nor consistently supported by genome-wide association studies.&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt; Therefore, no single gene is definitively implicated in dyslexia. A 2007 review reported that no specific cognitive processes are known to be influenced by the proposed genes and that scientists had begun to include [[neurophysiological]] (e.g., event-related potential) and imaging (e.g., functional [[MRI]]) procedures in their [[phenotype]] characterisation of people with dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Schumacher2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schumacher2007&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schumacher J, Hoffmann P, Schmäl C, Schulte-Körne G, Nöthen MM |title=Genetics of dyslexia: the evolving landscape |journal=[[Journal of Medical Genetics]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=289–97 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17307837 |pmc=2597981 |doi=10.1136/jmg.2006.046516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that multiple genes, as well as the environment, interact to influence reading ability. The [[Generalist Genes Hypothesis]] proposes that many of the same genes are implicated within different aspects of a learning disability as well as between different learning disabilities. Indeed, there also appear to be a large genetic influence on other learning abilities, such as language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stromswold|first=Karin|title=The Heritability of Language: A Review and Metaanalysis of Twin, Adoption, and Linkage Studies.|journal=Language|date=December 2001|volume=77|issue=4|pages=647–723|doi=10.1353/lan.2001.0247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Generalist Genes Hypothesis supports the findings that many learning disabilities are [[comorbid]], such as [[speech sound disorder]], language impairment, and reading disability, although this is also influenced by diagnostic overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pennington BF, Bishop DVM |title= Relations Among Speech, Language, and Reading Disorders |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |year= 2009|volume=60 |pages=283–306|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163548|pmid= 18652545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroimaging ===
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) are the main [[neuroimaging]] methods used to study brain structure in people with dyslexia, and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) along with [[EEG]] are used to study brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soriano-Ferrer |first1=M |last2=Piedra Martínez |first2=E |title=A review of the neurobiological basis of dyslexia in the adult population. |journal=Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain) |date=undefined NaN |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=50-57 |doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2014.08.003 |pmid=25444408}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual processing ===
Visual processes constitute an important part of higher cortical functioning.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vellutino|first=Frank R.|author2=Fletcher, Jack M. |author3=Snowling, Margaret J. |author4=Scanlon, Donna M. |title=Specific reading disability (dyslexia): what have we learned in the past four decades?|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=1 January 2004|volume=45|issue=1|pages=2–40|doi=10.1046/j.0021-9630.2003.00305.x|pmid=14959801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encoding and interpretation of retinal stimulation occur at the neurological level upon reception of afferent input from the eyes. Reading, for example, requires the possession of both adequate vision and the neurological ability to process what is seen. In the past, many researchers have associated anomalies in the visual system as the main cause of dyslexia. While acknowledging that most such theories are untenable, visual system deficits have been shown to contribute to symptoms of dyslexia, such as word reversal and skipping words.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"/&gt;

A small subset of dyslexic individuals have been demonstrated to have deficits in the magnocellular visual system.&lt;ref name="Stein 12–36"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=John|title=The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia|journal=Dyslexia|date=1 January 2001|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12–36|doi=10.1002/dys.186|pmid=11305228}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compromised magnocellular system, responsible for the processing of images with high temporal frequencies and high degree of movement, might be the main contributing factor to the reported "masking" of words reported amongst dyslexic individuals.&lt;ref name="Stein 12–36"/&gt; Researchers posit that such a "masking" effect is due to the abnormal longevity of the visual trace produced in the magnocellular system, resulting in a lapse in acuity as effected individuals attempt to process connected text.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"/&gt; 

Anomalies in saccadic movement, which are instantaneous, fast, oscillating eye movements essential for unimpaired reading have been observed in people with dyslexia. When corrected for reading ability, dyslexic individuals demonstrate below normal saccadic eye movements, suggesting that the severity reading disorders may be due to oculo-motor deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olitsky|first=SE|author2=Nelson, LB |title=Reading disorders in children.|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|date=February 2003|volume=50|issue=1|pages=213–24|pmid=12713114|doi=10.1016/s0031-3955(02)00104-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further examination of the phenomenon shows that saccadic patterns in dyslexics seem to be a result and not the cause of the disorder, as decoding and comprehension failure were isolated as the antecedent for impairments in both the speed and accuracy with which dyslexics read. Also, there is no evidence that children with oculomotor impariments are at risk of developing dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodgetts|first=DJ |author2=Simon, JW |author3=Sibila, TA |author4=Scanlon, DM |author5=Vellutino, FR|title=Normal reading despite limited eye movements.|journal=Journal of AAPOS|date=June 1998|volume=2|issue=3|pages=182–3|pmid=10532756|doi=10.1016/S1091-8531(98)90011-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also suspected are convergence insufficiency and poor accommodation, both of which are uncommon in children, can interfere with the physical act of reading but not with decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Granet|first=D.

=== Language processing ===
Brain activation studies using PET to study language have found that people with dyslexia have a deficit in parts of the left hemisphere of the brain involved in reading, which includes the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], [[inferior parietal lobule]], and middle and [[Brodmann area 20|ventral temporal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16925477 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn3001_5 |year=2006 |last1=Shaywitz |first1=BA |last2=Lyon |first2=GR |last3=Shaywitz |first3=SE |title=The role of functional magnetic resonance imaging in understanding reading and dyslexia |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=613–32 |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neural basis for the visual [[lexicon]] and for auditory verbal [[short term memory]] components have been proposed. [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke's]] and [[Broca's area]]s are being recast in terms of localized components of [[phonological]] input and output.

===Working memory ===
People with dyslexia have been commonly associated with working memory deficits, along with reduced activity in the pre-frontal and parietal cortex.&lt;ref name=Berninger2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berninger|first=Virginia W. |author2=Raskind, Wendy |author3=Richards, Todd |author4=Abbott, Robert |author5=Stock, Pat|title=A Multidisciplinary Approach to Understanding Developmental Dyslexia Within Working-Memory Architecture: Genotypes, Phenotypes, Brain, and Instruction|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|date=5 November 2008|volume=33|issue=6|pages=707–744|doi=10.1080/87565640802418662|pmid=19005912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LMG and PMG are commonly associated with working memory processes such as memory updating and temporal order memory.&lt;ref name="Wager 255–74"/&gt; Behavioral experiments in dyslexia have largely been supportive of the mediating role assumed by working memory between neurological abnormalities and dyslexic behavior.&lt;ref name="Nicolson 508–11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicolson|first=RI |author2=Fawcett, AJ |author3=Dean, P|title=Developmental dyslexia: the cerebellar deficit hypothesis.|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=9|pages=508–11|pmid=11506881|doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)01896-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
It is difficult to control for [[confounder]]s when attempting to isolate specific causes; for example, the response to instructions by children is itself confounded by a subjects' environments, genetics and socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=Berninger2008/&gt;

==Controversy==

In recent years there has been significant debate on the categorization of dyslexia. In particular, Elliot and Gibbs argue that "attempts to distinguish between categories of 'dyslexia' and 'poor reader' or 'reading disabled' are scientifically unsupportable, arbitrary and thus potentially discriminatory".&lt;ref name='Elliot1'&gt;{{Cite journal

While acknowledging that reading disability is a valid scientific curiosity, and that "seeking greater understanding of the relationship between visual symbols and spoken language is crucial" and that while there was "potential of genetics and neuroscience for guiding assessment and educational practice at some stage in the future", they conclude that "there is a mistaken belief that current knowledge in these fields is sufficient to justify a category of dyslexia as a subset of those who encounter reading difficulties".

''The Dyslexia Myth'' is a documentary that first aired in September 2005 as part of the ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' series produced by British broadcaster [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=The Dyslexia Myth
 |work=Dispatches
 |publisher=Channel 4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing only on the reading difficulties that people with dyslexia encounter the documentary says that myths and misconceptions surround dyslexia. It argues that the common understanding of dyslexia is not only false but makes it more difficult to provide the reading help that hundreds of thousands of children desperately need. Drawing on years of intensive academic research on both sides of the Atlantic, it challenged the existence of dyslexia as a separate condition, and highlighted the many different forms of reading styles.

Julian Elliot, an educational psychologist at [[Durham University]] in the United Kingdom, disputes the characterization of dyslexia as a medical condition, and believes it should be treated simply as a reading difficulty.&lt;ref name='Elliot1' /&gt; According to Elliot, "Parents don’t want their child to be considered lazy, thick or stupid. If they get called this medically diagnosed term, dyslexic, then it is a signal to all that it’s not to do with intelligence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He feels that resources are wasted on diagnosis and testing, and favors early intervention programs for all struggling readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

John Everatt of the [[University of Surrey]] 2007, has suggested that:- 
*dyslexic students can be distinguished from other children with low reading achievement by testing geared to assessing their strengths as well as weaknesses
*dyslexic children tend to score significantly better than other children, including non-impaired children, on tests of creativity, [[spatial memory]], and [[spatial reasoning]]
*dyslexic children also perform better than other reading-impaired children on tests of vocabulary and listening comprehension
*dyslexic children may be better served by educational intervention which includes strategies geared to their unique strengths in addition to skill remediation
and thus recommends more comprehensive evaluation and targeted interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4198">'''Econometric Institute''' (Dutch ''Econometrisch Instituut'') at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] is a leading research institute&lt;ref&gt;The institute is ranked among the top 6% Economic Institutions. See [http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.inst.all.html Top 10% Economic Institutions, as of August 2013]. Accessed Sept 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fields of [[econometrics]] and [[management science]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch (2013) ''Yield Curve Modeling and Forecasting''. p. ii&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute offers advanced education in econometrics. It was founded in 1956 by [[Henri Theil]] in cooperation with [[Jan Tinbergen]].

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The first proposal for a special institute in quantitative economics at the Netherlands School of Economics in Rotterdam was made by [[Henri Theil]] in 1953 with support of [[Jan Tinbergen]], while working at the [[Central Planning Bureau]]. The senate of the school added the requirement that it "would not confine itself to economic applications, but would also give attention to business problems, which implied that operations research had to be included in the program."&lt;ref name="PGD 2007"&gt;Pedro Garcia Duarte (2007) ''Constructing Concepts of Optimal Monetary Policy in the Postwar Period.'' p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1955-56 Theil was Visiting Professor at the [[University of Chicago]], where he made a similar proposal again with support of [[Jan Tinbergen]]. This proposal was eventually accepted both in Chicago and in Rotterdam, and the Econometric Institute started September 1956 in Chicago&lt;ref name="PGD 2007"/&gt; and later in Rotterdam.

The Econometric Institute was the first research institute in the field of econometrics in the world, and started with a research staff of 6.&lt;ref name = "PHF 2005"&gt;[[Philip Hans Franses]] (2005) ''[http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/7860/ar2004.pdf Annual Report 2004: Econometric Institute]'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Henri Theil became its first director, and headed the institute until 1966.

=== Development ===
In the early years the Institute developed a full academic program in Econometrics. The program originally focussed on "national and international macroeconomic policy; the required computing power to estimate econometric models was expensive and scarcely available, so that econometrics was almost exclusively applied in public (statistical) agencies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiaan Heij]] et al. (2004) ''Econometric Methods with Applications in Business and Economics''. Oxford University Press. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolved over the years. In this time many leading econometricians were guest at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Baldev Raj, J. Koerts (1992) ''Henri Theil's Contributions to Economics and Econometrics: Econometric theory and methodology. Vol. I''. Springer, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New millennium ===
In the new Millennium the Econometric Institute had "dismissed a strong emphasis on mathematics and statistics as research areas, and it embraced areas as finance, marketing and economics in general."&lt;ref&gt;Franses (2005; Preface)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the Econometric Institute served some 300 students at the BSc and MSc level, and 28 PhD students with a staff of 35.

'''EuroNanoForum 2011''' was three-day event focusing on [[nanotechnology]] that took place from 30 May to 1 June in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. In 2011, [[EuroNanoForum]] and Nanotech Europe joined forces to create a valuable opportunity to immerse in the multidisciplinary nanotechnology scene, to learn about the latest developments and future research challenges. The three-day event included conference, exhibition and matchmaking. EuroNanoForum 2011 gathered 1200 members of the nanotechnology community from over 50 countries. The event was supported by the [[European Commission]] and Hungarian National Innovation Fund, and was organised by the National Innovation Office in partnership with Spinverse under the auspices of the Hungarian Presidency. The EuroNanoForum 2011 conceived as a supportive action for [[Nanoscience]]s, nanotechnologies, materials &amp; new production technologies (NMP) programme of European Commission’s [[Seventh Framework Programme|Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7)]].

The event drew together nanotechnologies which could contribute to the solution of grand challenges, including [[renewable energy]], ageing populations, and resource efficiency. Presenters described hundreds of solutions such as [[nanoparticle]]-based [[cancer]] therapies, [[Retinal implant|retinal]] and [[cochlear implant]]s, [[nanomaterials]] for improving [[energy density]] of batteries and mass production of flexible [[solar cell]]s, and materials to improve the performance and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of electronics. A plenary presentation on the potential applications of [[graphene]] also underlined the fact that nanotechnology is being constantly expanded by new developments and discoveries.

The event was also able to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the future of nanotechnology both in terms of the ongoing work to support Key Enabling Technologies and the Common Strategic Framework. An industrial panel during the closing [[Plenary session|plenary]] discussed ways in which public funding could contribute to the whole innovation pipeline, from research through demonstration to [[commercialisation]] and deployment.

Athanasios Skouras from [[University of Patras]] received the EuroNanoForum 2011 award for the best poster presented by a young researcher. An exhibition accompanied the event, at which 60 organisations presented themselves. The best exhibitors, as voted for by attendees included NanoNext, the [[Netherlands]] nanotechnology network, the NMPTeAM network of national contact points, and [[Estonia]]n [[electrospinning]] pioneer Esfil Tehno. A matchmaking event on 1 June also saw 425 meetings take place, stimulating networking for [[technology transfer]] and for new project consortia.

The event hosted a [[venture capital]] session, where leading investors from [[Europe]] gave awards for start-up companies. The winner of Best Start-up Award was Nanoference from [[Denmark]] with its ambitious, disruptive business plan based on scientific discovery. Skeleton Technologies from Estonia got a special mention for a very well structured pitch. General observation from the session was that Europe is running short of venture capital money. More public funding and tax policies were expected to speed up growth of European start-ups.  [[Research funding]] needs to be complemented with instruments that support also product development and business development.

The '''GenI process'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1011107944|title=The Source of the Universe|last=Genreith|first=Siegfried|publisher=Books on Demand|others=|year=2017|isbn=9783848223572|location=Norderstedt|pages=44|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|iː|n|aɪ}} for Generic Intelligence) models team decision making by launching a chaotic competition between so-called ideas, where one idea after another dwindles out until exactly one remains. The decision statistics are completely determined by the process start configuration and match those known from [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurements]]. The random process accomplishes this in a natural way without any fine adjustment. Therefore, it is also of interest for the interpretation of physical processes.

In mathematical terms, the GenI process describes a time-discrete [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt;X: [0,1] \times \mathbb{N}_0 \rightarrow 2^E&lt;/math&gt; in the state space of the [[Set (mathematics)|finite subsets]] of a [[countable set]] ''E'', together with a mapping &lt;math&gt;2^E \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;  of the [[power set]] on ''E'' into an [[Vector space|n-dimensional complex vector space]]. In principle, it can be classified as a [[Markov chain]] of first order, with variable [[Markov chain|transition probabilities]] &lt;math&gt;P(X_{n+1} \mid X_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

There are two expressions of the GenI process, for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;.

== GenI process on eigenvector swarms ==

=== Background ===
The GenI [[Stochastic process|random process]] determines changes in the complex vector space from the random behavior of independent individuals within a [[Swarm behaviour|swarm]]-like construct. The swarm has a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] state &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j e_j \in \mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;, that controls the individual activities via a target function. The [[Amplitude|amplitudes]] &lt;math&gt;\beta_j e_j&lt;/math&gt; are also called ideas (cf "Generalized Quantum Modeling" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabora|first=Liane|last2=Kitto|first2=Kirsty|date=2017|title=Toward a Quantum Theory of Humor|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphy.2016.00053/full|journal=Frontiers in Physics|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fphy.2016.00053|issn=2296-424X}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The swarm takes one of the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstates]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma e_j&lt;/math&gt;  after a finite number of steps, with the well-defined [[probability]] &lt;math&gt;\frac {\vert{\beta_j}\vert^2} {\sum_k {\vert \beta_k \vert}^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The individuals follow defined rules and are allowed to make mistakes, based on the processes in simulated shoals of fish&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COUZIN|first=IAIN D.|last2=KRAUSE|first2=JENS|last3=JAMES|first3=RICHARD|last4=RUXTON|first4=GRAEME D.|last5=FRANKS|first5=NIGEL R.|authorlink5=Nigel R.

The GenI [[algorithm]] starts a [[Chaotics|chaotic]] [[decision-making]] process as a [[competition]] of ideas, such as running in a team that has to choose from a limited number of solutions to a given task. In the course of the process, a selection mechanism leads to ideas becoming extinct one after the other until finally just one survives that represents the solution to the problem.

Let ''E'' be a countable set and &lt;math&gt;\tilde E := \{ S \subset E : \vert S \vert &lt; \infty \} \subset 2^E&lt;/math&gt; the set of finite subsets of ''E''. Next &lt;math&gt;B = (e_1, \ldots, e_n)&lt;/math&gt; the [[canonical basis]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde B :=
\{i^k e_j : k = 0 \ldots 3, j = 1 \ldots n \}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

A given &lt;math&gt;\rho : E  \rightarrow \tilde B&lt;/math&gt; maps each element of ''E'' into &lt;math&gt;\tilde B&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\forall e \in \tilde B : \vert \rho^{-1} (\{e\}) \vert = \infty&lt;/math&gt;. For a set &lt;math&gt;S \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt;  the complex vector &lt;math&gt;\rho(S) := \sum_{s \in S} \rho(s)
= \sum_j \beta_j e_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes its state with complex '''amplitudes''' &lt;math&gt;\beta_j&lt;/math&gt;. Each such set ''S'' is called an Eigenvector-swarm or '''E-swarm'''.

A [[Ordered pair|pair]] &lt;math&gt;s, t \in E&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\rho(s) + \rho(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is a '''null pair'''. A [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''null ring''' generated by &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\exists j : \rho(s_k) = i^k e_j&lt;/math&gt;.

A set &lt;math&gt;N \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''null set''', if &lt;math&gt;\rho(N) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. A maximal null set &lt;math&gt;N \subset S&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''entropy''' of ''S'' and &lt;math&gt;S \setminus N&lt;/math&gt; the '''entropy free residual swarm'''.

The term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_j (S) := 2 \frac {\vert \beta_j \vert \sqrt{\sum_{k \neq j} \vert \beta_k \vert^2}}
{\sum_{k=1}^n \vert \beta_k\vert^2} \in [0; 1]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the '''excitation''' of the swarm in index ''j''.

==== Algorithm ====
Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(l)} = S_D^{(l)} + N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; be a series of swarms (as an instantiation of &lt;math&gt;X(\omega, l)&lt;/math&gt;) with the respective separation into a maximal null swarm &lt;math&gt;N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; and the entropy free residual swarm &lt;math&gt;S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho(S^{(l)}) =\sum_{k=1}^{n} \beta_k^{(l)} e_k&lt;/math&gt; the respective state and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_j^{(l)} := \varepsilon_j(S^{(l)})&lt;/math&gt; the excitations.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and start with a given swarm &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': If &lt;math&gt;\forall j : \varepsilon_j^{(l)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then finish the process. 
# '''Step''': Each element &lt;math&gt;s  \in S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; generates an additional null ring within the swarm.
# '''Step''': Each null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; (including the newly generated) with &lt;math&gt;\rho( r)= i^k e_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho( t)= - i^k e_j&lt;/math&gt; gets selected with probability &lt;math&gt;p= \varepsilon_j^{(l) 2}&lt;/math&gt; (and "burned" in the next step). 
# '''Step''': For each selected null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, ''t'' leaves the swarm with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac {\varepsilon_j(S \setminus \{r\})} {\varepsilon_j(S \setminus \{r\}) + \varepsilon_j(S \setminus \{t\})}&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise ''t'' stays and ''r'' leaves the swarm.
# '''Step''': The resulting swarm is &lt;math&gt;S^{(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow l+1&lt;/math&gt; and start over with step 2.

==== Interpretation ====
[[File:Competition_of_ideas_within_an_GenI_swarm.jpg|alt=Competition of ideas within an GenI swarm|thumb|Competition of ideas within an GenI swarm: Graph a shows the evolution of absolute amplitudes during a GenI process operating in a four options environment. Due to its intrinsically chaotic behavior, it is impossible to predict the GenI process evolution at any point. The option with the lowest initial chance finally wins.
Chart b shows the according evolution of entropy rising dramatically at the end for the winning idea. Figure c displays the native paths of each idea in the complex plane.

]]
As soon as the excitation disappears in each index, the process naturally comes to rest in step 4 (except for the hard abort condition in step 2), since no null pair is "burned" and the state of the swarm no longer changes. The role of the excitation here reminds of the dynamics of a grain of sand in the formation of the [[Ernst Chladni|Chladnic sound figures]]. On the other hand, excitation as a target in step 5 leads to a systematic distortion from 50% likelihood for an individual to remain. This leads here to an improved tendency to reduce the excitation. The following interpretation is obvious based on biological swarm behavior&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;: Each individual tends to follow the rule "reduce the excitation". It remains free in its decision to do nothing (step 4), to follow the rule, or to disregard it (step 5).

These results support the '''statement of convergence (hypothesis)''':

Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)} = S&lt;/math&gt; be a given E-swarm with &lt;math&gt;\rho(S) = \sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j a_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_j =
\vert \beta_j \vert&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\vert S \vert = \sqrt{\sum b_j^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;S : \mathbb{N}_0 \times [0; 1] \rightarrow \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; be a GenI process with  &lt;math&gt;\rho ( S^{(m)}(\omega))=\sum \beta_j^{(m)}(\omega) a_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;P \left(\tilde S^{(m)} \underset{m \rightarrow \infty}\longrightarrow \gamma a_j
\right) =P \left(\sum_{k \ne j} b_k^{(m) 2} \underset{m \rightarrow
\infty}\longrightarrow 0 \right) = \frac{b_j^2}{\vert {S} \vert^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== GenI process on Pauli swarms ==
The P(auli) process represents a special version of the GenI process for binary YES-NO decisions. It determines a time discrete [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt;X: [0;1] \times \mathbb{N}_0 \mapsto 2^E&lt;/math&gt; in the state space of finite subsets of a countable set E, together with a map &lt;math&gt;\rho : 2^E \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; from the power set on E into the [[Complex number|complex]] [[Matrix ring|matrix algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt;, a perspective vector &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; and a basis &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Background ===
[[File:Competition within a GenI-swarm.jpg|alt=Competition within a GenI-swarm|thumb|Competition within a GenI-swarm: The diagrams a-c demonstrate the Pauli process (as a special expression of the GenI process) evolution using a fixed perspective p = (1;1) under an external environment defined by the observable p3.
Diagrams d-f show another test case under the internal environment defined by the swarm itself. Graphs a/d show the evolution of absolute amplitudes. Charts b/e show the according evolution of entropy for each type according to the swarm member images in {p0, ... , p3}. Null pairs for P-swarm do not relate to environment options as is true for E-swarms. Figures c/f display the native paths of each idea in the complex plane.]]
The GenI random process determines changes in the complex vector space out of the random behavior of independent individuals within a swarm-like construct. The swarm ''S'' has an image &lt;math&gt; \rho(S) \in  \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; in the complex matrix algebra. Together with a perspective &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the state of the swarm is determined by &lt;math&gt;\tilde S = \rho(S) v&lt;/math&gt;. A basis &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;  is called the environment and represents the options under which the swarm makes a decision. This can also be the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of &lt;math&gt; \rho(S) \in  \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; itself and so create a [[self-reference]]. The environment, perspective and state of the swarm control the individual activities via a target variable (excitation). The amplitudes &lt;math&gt;\beta_j a_j&lt;/math&gt; in the decomposition are also referred to as ideas with respect to the environment (see regarding "Generalized Quantum Modeling" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;). The swarm takes one of the eigenstates &lt;math&gt;\gamma a_j&lt;/math&gt;  after a finite number of steps, with the well-defined probability &lt;math&gt;\frac {\vert{\beta_j}\vert^2}  {{\vert \beta_1 \vert}^2 + {\vert \beta_2 \vert}^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The individuals follow defined rules and are allowed to make mistakes, based on the processes in simulated shoals of fish&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The GenI algorithm starts a chaotic decision-making process as a competition of ideas, such as running in a team that has two possible solutions to a given task. In the course of the process, a selection mechanism leads to the survival of only one of the two ideas that represents the solution to the problem. The model in principal allows a moving environment.

The special properties of the P-process also allow interpretations of physical processes (see in particular [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]'s ur-alternatives (archetypal objects) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Weizsäcker, Carl Friedrich, Freiherr von, 1912–2007.|Title=Aufbau der Physik|Publisher=C. Hanser|PublicationPlace=München|ISBN=3446141421|Date=1985|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which he outlined for the reconstruction of quantum mechanics).

=== Definition ===

==== Terminology ====
Let ''E'' be a countable set and &lt;math&gt;\tilde E := \{ S \subset E : \vert S \vert &lt; \infty \} \subset 2^E&lt;/math&gt; the set of finite subsets of ''E''. Next &lt;math&gt;P = (p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3)
\subset \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Pauli matrices]] and &lt;math&gt;\tilde P :=
\{i^k p_j : k = 0, \ldots, 3, j = 1, \ldots, n \}&lt;/math&gt; the image of the '''[[Pauli matrices|Pauli group]]''' in the complex matrix algebra as its irreducible representation. Such a subset &lt;math&gt;S \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; is called a Pauli-swarm or a '''P-swarm'''.

A given &lt;math&gt;\rho : E  \rightarrow \tilde P&lt;/math&gt; maps each element of ''E'' onto one element of the Pauli group, so that &lt;math&gt;\forall e \in \tilde P : \vert \rho^{-1} (\{e\}) \vert = \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

A basis &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''environment''', a non zero vector &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; a '''perspective'''.

For a swarm &lt;math&gt;S \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; denotes &lt;math&gt;\rho(S)  := \sum_{s \in S} \rho(s)&lt;/math&gt; its matrix image, &lt;math&gt;\tilde S = \rho(S) v := \beta_1 a_1 + \beta_2 a_2&lt;/math&gt; its '''state''' with complex '''amplitudes''' &lt;math&gt;\beta_j&lt;/math&gt; at the given environment and perspective.

A [[Ordered pair|pair]] &lt;math&gt;s, t \in E&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\rho(s) + \rho(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is a '''null pair'''. A [[Tuple (mathematics)|tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''null ring''' generated by &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\exists j : \rho(s_k) = i^k p_j&lt;/math&gt;.

A set &lt;math&gt;N \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; is called '''null set''', if &lt;math&gt;\rho(N) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. A maximal null set &lt;math&gt;N \subset S&lt;/math&gt; ist called the '''entropy''' of ''S'' and &lt;math&gt;S \setminus N&lt;/math&gt; its '''entropy freed residual swarm'''.

The term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon (S) := 2 \frac {\vert \beta_1 \vert   \vert \beta_2 \vert}
{\vert \beta_1\vert^2 +  \vert \beta_2\vert^2} \in [0; 1]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the '''excitation''' of the swarm.

==== Algorithm ====
Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(l)} = S_D^{(l)} + N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; be a series of swarms (as an instance von &lt;math&gt;X(\omega, l)&lt;/math&gt;) with the respective separation in a maximal null swarm &lt;math&gt;N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; and the entropy freed residual swarm &lt;math&gt;S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tilde S^{(l)} =\beta_1^{(l)} a_1 + \beta_2^{(l)} a_2&lt;/math&gt; the respective states and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{(l)} := \varepsilon(S^{(l)})&lt;/math&gt; the excitations.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and start with a given swarm &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': If &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon^{(l)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then finish the process.
# '''Step''': Each element &lt;math&gt;s  \in S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; generates an additional null ring within the swarm.
# '''Step''': Each null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; (including the newly generated) gets selected with probability &lt;math&gt;p= \varepsilon^{(l) 2}&lt;/math&gt; (and gets "burned" in next step).
# '''Step''': For each selected null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, ''t'' leaves the swarm with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac {\varepsilon(S \setminus \{r\})} {\varepsilon(S \setminus \{r\}) + \varepsilon(S \setminus \{t\})}&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise ''t'' stays and ''r'' leaves the swarm.
# '''Step''': The resulting swarm is &lt;math&gt;S^{(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow l+1&lt;/math&gt; and start over with step 2.

The reference implementation under JAVA&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; shows an excellent convergence of the process at any fixed environment and perspective according to the chart right hand.

The results support the '''statement of convergence (hypothesis)''':

Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)} = S&lt;/math&gt; be a given P-swarm with &lt;math&gt;\tilde S = \beta_1 a_1 + \beta_2 a_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_j =

Then &lt;math&gt;P \left(\tilde S^{(m)} \underset{m \rightarrow \infty}\longrightarrow \gamma a_j
\right) =P \left(\sum_{k \ne j} b_k^{(m) 2} \underset{m \rightarrow
\infty}\longrightarrow 0 \right) = \frac{b_j^2}{\vert {S} \vert^2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;j,k \in \{1,2\}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5860">'''Genetic matchmaking''' is the idea of matching couples for romantic relationships based on their biological compatibility.  The initial idea was conceptualized by Claus Wedekind through his famous "sweaty t-shirt" experiment.&lt;ref name="wedekind_1995"&gt;Wedekind, C., et al. "MHC-Dependent Mate Preferences in Humans." Proceedings.Biological sciences / The Royal Society 260.1359 (1995): 245-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Males were asked to wear T-shirts for two consecutive nights, and then females were asked to smell the T-shirts and rate the body odors for attractiveness.  Human body odor has been associated with the [[Human leukocyte antigens| human leukocyte antigens (HLA)]] genomic region.  They discovered that females were attracted to men who had dissimilar HLA alleles from them.  Furthermore, these females reported that the body odors of HLA-dissimilar males reminded them of their current partners or ex-partners providing further evidence of biological compatibility.

==Evidence of biological compatibility==
Following the seminal research done by Dr. Wedekind,&lt;ref name="wedekind_1995" /&gt; several studies found corroborating evidence for biological compatibility.  Garver-Apgar ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Garver-Apgar, C. E., et al. "Major Histocompatibility Complex Alleles, Sexual Responsivity, and Unfaithfulness in Romantic Couples." Psychological science : a journal of the American Psychological Society / APS 17.10 (2006): 830-5.&lt;/ref&gt; presented evidence for HLA-dissimilar alleles playing a factor in the healthiness of romantic relationships.  They discovered that as the proportion of HLA-similar alleles increased between couples, females reported being less sexually responsive to their partners, less satisfaction from being aroused by their partners, and having additional sexual partners (while with their current partner).  Additionally, Ober ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Ober, C., et al. "HLA and Mate Choice in Humans." American Journal of Human Genetics 61.3 (1997): 497-504.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an independent study on a population of American [[Hutterites]] by comparing the HLA alleles of married couples.  They discovered that married couples were less likely to share HLA alleles than expected from random chance; thus their results were consistent with tendencies for same-HLA alleled partners to avoid mating. Further evidence of the importance of genetic compatibility can be found in the finding that couples sharing a higher proportion of HLA alleles tend to have recurring spontaneous abortions,&lt;ref name="reznikoff_1991"&gt;Reznikoff-Etievant, M. F., et al. "HLA Antigen-Sharing in Couples with Repeated Spontaneous Abortions and the Birthweight of Babies in Successful Pregnancies." American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y.: 1989) 25.1 (1991): 25-7.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced body mass in babies,&lt;ref name="reznikoff_1991" /&gt; and longer intervals between successive births.&lt;ref&gt;Ober, C., et al. "HLA Sharing and Fertility in Hutterite Couples: Evidence for Prenatal Selection Against Compatible Fetuses." American Journal of Reproductive Immunology and Microbiology : AJRIM 18.4 (1988): 111-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for biological compatibility==
There are several biological reasons why women would be attracted to and mate with men with dissimilar HLA alleles:&lt;ref&gt;Penn, D.J ., and Potts, W.K. “The evolution of mating preferences and major histocompatibility complex genes.”  The American Naturalists, 153 (1999): 145-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Their offspring would have a greater assortment of HLA alleles theoretically giving them a wider diversity of antigens present on the surface of cells compared to HLA-homozygous offsprings.  The wider variety of antigens allows the immune system to target a greater number of pathogens making the offspring more immunocompetent.
* Any HLA allele which becomes a more resistant allele would not simply become an inherent allele in all individuals.  Through [[evolution]], there will always be some pathogens that can become resistant to this allele, and spread to create a selection against the allele.  HLA-dissortative mating can be considered a method to cause the adaptations that pathogens have to their host to become obsolete in their offspring;  In other words, allow us to keep up in the [[Red Queen's Hypothesis|"Red Queen's race"]].
* HLA genes are highly polymorphic between individuals.  Any two individuals with similar HLA genes could be possibly related.  Mating of two related individuals would result in inbreeding which can be harmful to the offspring since it would result in a greater amount of genetic homozygosity thus increasing the chances of recessive mutations.

==Criticism==
There has been skepticism throughout the science community claiming the idea to be ridiculous.  "They are just trying to make a buck," Dr. Rocio Moran, medical director of the General Genetics Clinic at the Cleveland Clinic.  "If it's genetic, it must be real science."&lt;ref&gt;Genetic love match? Dating sites try DNA tests." Associated Press. Nov 12th, 2009 2009. msnbc.com. &lt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33893470/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many skeptics state that the science of love cannot be simplified to just a few genes.

==Companies==
Several companies have sprung up offering genetic matchmaking services: [https://www.dnaromance.com DNA Romance], GenePartner, [https://www.pheramor.com Pheramor], Instant Chemistry,  [[SingldOut]] ...&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dubious-science-genetics-based-dating-180968151/ The Dubious Science of Genetics-Based Dating]&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the '''impact of globalization on women in China''' examines the role and status of [[Chinese women]] relative to the political and cultural changes that have taken place in the 20th century as a consequence of [[globalization]]. Globalization refers to the interaction and integration of people, products, cultures and governments between various nations around the globe; this is fostered by [[trade]], [[investment]], and [[information technology]].&lt;ref name=Jiang&gt;Jiang, Shiwei. "Global Trade and Its Effects on China's Female Labor Market." In International Studies Association (ISA) Annual Convention, San Francisco, CA. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=car&gt;Carnegie Endowment for the International Peace. (2009). ''What is Globalization?''. Retrieved November 26, 2009. Retrieved from www.globalization101.org/What_is_Globalization.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization affected women's rights and the gender hierarchy in China, in aspects of domestic life such as marriage and [[primogeniture]], as well as in the workplace. These changes altered the quality of life and the availability of opportunities to women at different junctures throughout the modern globalization process.

The dynamics of gender inequity are related with the ideological principles held by the ruling political regime. The [[History of China#Imperial China|imperial era]] was dominated by the social paradigm of [[Confucianism]], which was a pervasive philosophy throughout the [[Orient]]. Confucian ideals emphasized [[morality]], character, social relationship, and the [[status quo]].&lt;ref name=main&gt;Main Concepts of Confucianism. (n.d.). Retrieved November 28, 2009. Retrieved from http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/main.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius preached ''jen'' (humanity) and the equality and educability of all people;&lt;ref name=ng&gt;Ng, R.M. (2009). College and character: What did Confucius Teach Us About the Importance of Integrating Ethics, Character, Learning, and Education? Journal of College &amp; Character, vol 10(4), pp 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Confucianists and Imperial leaders used his beliefs in social hierarchy, particularly in the family setting, for the physical and social oppression of women. As the Chinese government began to re-assimilate themselves into the global community in the late 19th to early 20th century, it shifted away from conventional Confucian ideals and women's role in society changed as well. After [[Mao Zedong]] established the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, a change in traditional gender roles came about. Mao's death marked the beginning of the current [[communism|communist]] administration, and an influx of international communications in the areas of commerce, politics and social ideals.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;Sung, Y. W. (1991). The China- Hong Kong Connection: The Key to China's Open Door Policy. pp. 1-183. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-38245-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, under the new communist party, the women's rights movement has gained momentum and has become a national issue as well as a sign of [[modernization]].

In rural areas, women traditionally work alongside their family to produce crops like tea and rice. In urban areas, women work in factories, living away from home. Most of these factory workers are young girls who send their income to their families. To help maintain the rights of women in factories, labor unions and organizations were built. In their homes, women take care of their children and cook.

== Western bias ==
Western scholarship has historically used ideas of [[Hierarchy|subordinance]] and [[Victimology|victimization]] to characterize traditional Chinese womanhood.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; These beliefs were largely constructed on the basis of [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[political agenda]]s, and were widely accepted despite their [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref name =ten&gt;Teng, J. E. (1996). The construction of the "traditional Chinese woman" in western academy: A critical review. ''Signs'', Vol 22 (1), pp. 115-151.&lt;/ref&gt; Early European writings pertaining to Chinese women were produced by [[Missionary|missionaries]] and [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] at the conclusion of the 19th century.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; The goal of the missionaries was to "civilize China," and highlighting weakness and victimization provided for the continuance of their work.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; This belief prompted scholars to use female subordination as a means to validate Western ideas about Chinese culture and Confucian principles.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt;

In the 1970s, as the [[feminist movement]]s were forming, they began to affect the literature surrounding women in China.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; Studies on Chinese women from this period were concerned with women's liberation, and were sympathetic to the feminist movement.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; This sentiment largely influenced the topics and methodology of the research.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; With this shift in perspective, the focus of discourse remained on subordination, [[Patriarch|patriarchal oppression]], and victimization.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; These studies examined such issues as foot binding and the [[chastity]] of widows.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; Literature formulated by feminist writers did nothing to dispel the myth of the weak, subservient woman.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; These works provided a new bias that had not before been articulated.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; Feminists believed that Chinese women were a part of a "universally subordinated womanhood".&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; This line of thinking illustrates the cultural superiority inherently felt by Western women.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; Writings on Chinese woman rarely account for differences in time, [[ethnicity]], [[Social class|class]], region or age, preferring to describe the status of women as a static, unitary fixture of Chinese culture, despite the political and geographic boundaries that defined different regions and the economic and social changes that occurred throughout history.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt;

=== Traditional roles and Confucianism ===
From the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC-220 CE) until the modern period (1840–1919), scholars and rulers developed a male-dominated [[patriarchal society]] in China.&lt;ref name="Tamney"&gt;Tamney, J.

B., &amp; Chiang, L.H. (2002). ''Modernization, Globalization, and Confucianism in Chinese Societies.'' Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.&lt;ref name="Tamney3"&gt;Tamney, J.

During the reform period, the Communist regime in China regulated [[birth control]].&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; The government shaped policies with the intention to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women In China's Long Twentieth Century|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-520-09856-5|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London|pages=27|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the [[Family planning policy|Planned Birth Policy]] was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth Control in China 1949–2000 : Population Policy and Demographic Development|last=Scharping|first=Thomas|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7007-1154-3|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women In China's Long Twentieth Century|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-520-09856-5|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London|pages=27–28|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the fundamental unit of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women In China's Long Twentieth Century|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-520-09856-5|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London|pages=28|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, city couples who both came from one-child families were allowed to have a second child, while couples in rural areas could have a second if just one of them came from a one-child family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/14956C3C5EFFAF28?p=AWNB|title=Shanghai Municipal Government: Young Couples Sticking with One Child|last=|first=|date=November 16, 2011|work=China Business News (China)|access-date=November 20, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the further revision of the Planned Birth Policy allowed couples in which either parent had no siblings to have two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/14B0B267AD5D1D08?p=AWNB|title=Child policy eased, camp abolished|last=|first=|date=December 29, 2013|work=Shanghai Daily (China)|access-date=November 20, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, China allowed all couples to have two children, abolishing its decades-long one-child policy for urban families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/158CAF6871392A70?p=AWNB|title=One-Child Policy Lifted, All Couples Allowed Two Children|last=Xin, Lin and Gang, Wu|first=|date=October 30, 2015|work=Global Times (Beijing, China)|access-date=November 20, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of population control is the prevalence of [[female infanticide]].&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women In China's Long Twentieth Century|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=9780520098565|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London|pages=28–29|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per year because of the preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as [[ultrasound]], which help to find out the sex of the fetus.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge [[china gender gap|gender gap]] in China.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt;

They are named after the [[Silesia]]n princess [[Hedwig of Andechs|Saint Hedwig]] (1174–1245), to whom three of them are traditionally said to have belonged.&lt;ref name="Ettinghausen and Grabar 196-7"&gt;Ettinghausen and Grabar 196-7&lt;/ref&gt; So far, a total of 14 complete glasses are known.&lt;ref name="Wedepohl and Kronz"&gt;Wedepohl and Kronz&lt;/ref&gt; The exact origin of the glasses is disputed, with [[Egypt]], [[Iran]] and [[Syria]] all suggested as possible sources; if they are not of Islamic manufacture they are certainly influenced by [[Glass in Islamic culture|Islamic glass]].&lt;ref name=BMH&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/r/relief_cut_glass_tumbler.aspx |title=Hedwig glass beaker " The British Museum |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date=1959-04-14 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=217275&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=RRM13372&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 |title=Search object details |publisher=British Museum |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Probably made by [[Muslim]] craftsmen, some of the [[iconography]] is Christian, suggesting they may have been made for export or for Christian clients.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/2GL6QSA8SMmcMCtPgHQJsw |title=A History of the World – Object: Hedwig glass beaker |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory that they instead originate from Norman Sicily in the 11th century was first fully set out in a book in 2005 by Rosemarie Lierke, and has attracted some support from specialists.&lt;ref name="Lierke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosemarie-lierke.de/English/Hedwig_Beakers/hedwig_beakers.html|title=Hedwig Beakers|publisher=Rosemarie-lierke.de|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
All 14 of the complete Hedwig glasses so far known all have roughly the same form: they are squat, thick-walled and straight-sided with a flange around the base.  They are around 14&amp;nbsp;cm high and have a diameter of nearly 14&amp;nbsp;cm. All but one are richly decorated with wheel-cut relief with [[hatching|hatched]] details.

The glasses are mostly of a smoky metal colour with a couple of greenish or yellowish glass. The decorations are in two styles: four have abstract decorations derived from Samarra Style C; another eight have zoomorphic decorations of lions, [[griffin]]s and eagles and palm trees.&lt;ref name="Ettinghausen and Grabar 196-7"/&gt;
 
They were probably made in emulation of the [[quartz|rock crystal]] [[hardstone carving|carved vessels]] made in [[Fatimid Egypt]] rather earlier, which were objects of great luxury in the Middle Ages, and have also mostly survived in church treasuries.;&lt;ref name="Lierke"/&gt; an example can be seen in the Treasury of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, which also possesses a rock-crystal ewer in the same style. A number of the glasses were elaborated into [[reliquaries]], or in one case a [[chalice]], during the Middle Ages, with the addition of goldsmith's work, including those at Namur, Krakow and Halberstadt (see below).  Lierke suggests that notches in the bases of many indicate that they were originally given other metalwork settings, perhaps as chalices, but none of these have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Image of a chalice (? or reliquary) in Lierke.  The notches can be seen in the image of the Corning Museum example.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the known Hedwig glasses have 13th- to 15th-century metal mounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=3016 |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708101559/http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=3016 |archivedate=July 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The Hedwig glasses were clearly high status objects. According to Ettinghausen and Grabar, writing in 1987, so far no examples of this type of glass have been found in the Near East: "all the preserved pieces come from the treasuries of Western churches and noble houses".&lt;ref name="Ettinghausen and Grabar 196-7"/&gt; Small shards of broken Hedwig glasses have been found in excavations.
In common with many Islamic objects imported into medieval Europe, they were credited with more antiquity than was in fact the case. The Amsterdam goblet carries the inscription:
"Alsz diesz glas war alt tausent jahr Es Pfalzgraf Ludwig Philipsen verehret war: 1643"
("When this glass was a thousand years old, it was given to Ludwig Philipsen, Count Palatine: 1643")

As of 2009, 14 complete Hedwig glasses and ten additional fragments are known.&lt;ref name="Wedepohl and Kronz"/&gt;

[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 10.JPG|thumb|275px|Model of '''Herod's Jerusalem Palace-Fortress''' in the northwest corner of the Upper City walls. The three towers, from L to R, are Phasael, Hippicus, and Mariamne. Just beneath the latter two, a portion of the reconstruction of the palace building itself is visible.]]

'''Herod's Palace at Jerusalem''' was built in the last quarter of the 1st century BC by [[Herod the Great|Herod I the Great]], [[List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers|King of Judea]] from 37 BC to 4 BC. It was the second most important building in [[Jerusalem]], after the [[Herod's Temple|Temple]] itself, in Herod’s day and was situated at the northwestern wall of the Upper City of Jerusalem (the Western Hill abandoned after the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|sacking of Jerusalem]]). Herod lived in it as a principal residence, but not permanently, as he owned other palace-fortresses, notably at [[Masada]], [[Herodium]] and [[Caesarea Maritima]]. Nothing remains of the Jerusalem Palace today except for portions of the surrounding wall-and-tower complex, much altered and generally known as "the Citadel" (see [[Tower of David]]). The site of the former palace is now occupied by the [[Tower of David#Tower of David Museum|Tower of David Museum]], a police station, and a former Turkish barracks/prison known as the ''Kishle''.

==Location and associated structures==
[[Image:Jerusalem-TowerOfDavid 001.jpg|thumb|right|The "Tower of David"—seen here from the inner courtyard of the Citadel—was built on the base of the Tower of Hippicus.]]

Herod's palace-fortress in Jerusalem stood along the western city wall, in the area now taken by the [[Armenian Quarter]], starting in the north at the Kishle building and ending at the gate called by [[Bargil Pixner]] the Gate of the Essenes on [[Mount Zion]]. It consisted mainly of two palace wings placed north and south of a large garden. Immediately north of the complex, in the area of today's [[Tower of David|Citadel]] and [[Jaffa Gate]], Herod erected three huge towers, as an additional protection and last refuge in case of danger. These he called after people close to him - Hippicus after a friend, [[Phasael]] after his brother, and [[Mariamne I|Mariamne]] after his favourite wife. These towers strengthened the northwest corner of the [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period#Hasmonean Kingdom|First Wall]], the city wall built by the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]] sometime between 142-BC. Of the three towers, only the massive lower part of the [[Hippicus Tower]] (or the Phasael Tower, after some researchers)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 27925783|title = The 'Tower of David'—Phasael or Hippicus?|journal = Israel Exploration Journal|volume = 31|issue = 1/2|pages = 57–65|last1 = Geva|first1 = Hillel|year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; have survived. Remains of two older, Hasmonean towers (the Southern and Middle Towers) have been found in the present Citadel courtyard, which are unrelated to the missing Herodian towers.

During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the tower, and by extension the Citadel as a whole, acquired its alternative name - the [[Tower of David]] - after the Byzantines, mistakenly identifying the hill as [[Mount Zion]], presumed it to be David's palace. This name is still in use today, although in the 19th century an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] minaret erected between 1635-65 over the southern wall of the Citadel took over the title of "Tower of David", so that the name can now refer to either the whole Citadel or the minaret alone.

==Description==
As with his [[Herod's Temple|Temple]], Herod's Jerusalem Palace was constructed on an elevated platform of about 1,000 feet (north-south) by 180 feet (east-west). Resting on a series of retaining walls rising 13 to 16 feet above ground level. It consisted of two main buildings, each with its own banquet halls, baths, and accommodations for hundreds of guests. The two wings were named after [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Augustus|Caesar]]. In the center of the palace were gardens with porticoes. The grounds included groves, canals, and ponds fitted with bronze fountains. The ''[[praetorium]]'' at the Palace was, after Herod's death, the official residence of the Roman governors when they came to Jerusalem during major Jewish festivals. This was probably the site of the trial of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] by [[Pontius Pilate]] (see [[Pilate's court]]).

To the north of Herod's Palace were the three immense towers,
* The [[Phasael Tower]] was the largest. It was named after [[Phasael|Herod's brother]] and stood 145 feet high.
* The [[Hippicus Tower]] was named after a friend of Herod and stood 132 feet high.
* The [[Mariamne Tower]] was named after Herod’s [[Mariamne (second wife of Herod)|Hasmonean wife]] whom he had executed. Josephus said that "the king considering it appropriate that the tower named after a woman should surpass in decoration those called after men." It stood 74 feet high and was accounted the most beautiful of the three.

==Josephus’ description==
The ancient writer and historian [[Josephus]] vividly described the "wondrous" palace in ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' (''ca.'' 75 AD). Book 5, chapter 4 tells that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The largeness also of the stones was wonderful; for they were not made of common small stones, nor of such large ones only as men could carry, but they were of white marble, cut out of the rock; each stone was twenty cubits in length, and ten in breadth, and five in depth. They were so exactly united to one another, that each tower looked like one entire rock of stone, so growing naturally, and afterward cut by the hand of the artificers into their present shape and corners; so little, or not at all, did their joints or connexion appear low as these towers were themselves on the north side of the wall, the king had a palace inwardly thereto adjoined, which exceeds all my ability to describe it; for it was so very curious as to want no cost nor skill in its construction, but was entirely walled about to the height of thirty cubits, and was adorned with towers at equal distances, and with large bed-chambers, that would contain beds for a hundred guests a-piece, in which the variety of the stones is not to be expressed; for a large quantity of those that were rare of that kind was collected together. Their roofs were also wonderful, both for the length of the beams, and the splendor of their ornaments. The number of the rooms was also very great, and the variety of the figures that were about them was prodigious; their furniture was complete, and the greatest part of the vessels that were put in them was of silver and gold. There were besides many porticoes, one beyond another, round about, and in each of those porticoes curious pillars; yet were all the courts that were exposed to the air everywhere green. There were, moreover, several groves of trees, and long walks through them, with deep canals, and cisterns, that in several parts were filled with brazen statues, through which the water ran out. There were withal many dove-courts of tame pigeons about the canals. But indeed it is not possible to give a complete description of these palaces; and the very remembrance of them is a torment to one, as putting one in mind what vastly rich buildings that fire which was kindled by the robbers hath consumed; for these were not burnt by the Romans, but by these internal plotters, as we have already related, in the beginning of their rebellion. That fire began at the tower of Antonia, and went on to the palaces, and consumed the upper parts of the three towers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Flavius Josephus]], ''The Wars of the Jews, or History of the Destruction of Jerusalem'', trans. [[William Whiston]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/book5.htm#noteref-11 Book V, Chapt. 4, Verse 4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fate of the Palace==
At the creation of the Roman province of [[Roman Judea|Judaea]] in the year 6 CE, its governors—holding the rank of a [[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] until the year 41 and that of a [[Procurator (Roman Empire)|procurator]] after that—took up residence in Herod's palace.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 66 CE, the Roman governor [[Gessius Florus]] set up a mass crucifixion of Jews, sparking the [[First Jewish Rebellion]]. Rebelling Jews entered and burnt the palace. Only the three towers remained partially standing.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When the future Roman emperor [[Titus]] destroyed most of Jerusalem in 70 CE, he spared these and set up the camp of the [[Legio X Fretensis|Tenth Legion Fretensis]] in the area of the palace ruins, a camp which covered the entire Western Hill.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} One of the towers—a rebuilt Hippicus (or Phasael) Tower on its intact base—became known as the "[[Tower of David]]".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This was due to the fact that during the Byzantine Period, the Western Hill had been mistakenly identified as [[Mount Zion]] and the remains of the one surviving Herodian tower were presumed to be King David's palace.

Evidence shows that Crusaders fortified and heightened the 15 foot thick Hasmonean city wall and that Arabs, who [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|conquered Jerusalem]] in 637, did the same.{{dubious|Terrible mess. 1- If it only concerns the city walls outside the royal palace area, it's irrelevant here. 2- What Arabs? Early Isl. Period (Rashidun, Umayyad etc. through Fatimid) or post-Crusader (Ayyubid, Mamluk)? 900-year span! 3- Why mention 638 AFTER 12th c. Crusaders?|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

During the 1160s the kings of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem built in the same general area a royal palace of their own, of which close to nothing remains.&lt;ref name="BoasJlm"&gt;Adrian J. Boas.

''Jerusalem in the Crusader Period.'' Bar-Ilan University, Internet Educational Activities, 1997. "''Adjoining the Citadel to the south was the royal palace of the Crusader kings.''"  [http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_9.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th-century Egyptian barracks and later prison—locally known as the ''Kishle''—was built adjacent to the Citadel's southern moat and was used, successively, by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s troops (1834-40/41), the Turks (1840/41-1917), the British (1917–48), the Jordanians (1948–67) and in parts by the Israeli police after 1967. The very popular Tower of David Museum, located at the Citadel, is also administering the Kishle building, thus covering the northernmost part of the palace.

==20th and 21st century excavations==
In the 1970s, excavations outside the city wall disclosed the exit of a water drain belonging to Herod's Palace. This culvert transported water from the palace into the [[Hinnom Valley]]. Until recently, no portion of Herod's palace proper—excluding, that is, the surrounding walls-and-towers complex—had ever been uncovered. In 2001, however, excavations disclosed two palace walls, constructed of the easily recognizable Herodian hewn giant blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Schaalje, Jacqueline (2001),  [http://www.jewishmag.com/48mag/herod/herod.htm "Israeli Archaeologists Discover Herod's Palace"], ''[[The Jewish Magazine]]'' (October 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Even these probably did not belong to the palace proper, but were part of the retaining walls for its base, a construction similar to that used by Herod at the Temple Mount. Excavations by [[Ruth Amiran]] and [[Avraham Eitan]] have also revealed some parts of the superstructure which included sections of painted plaster.

The ''Kishle'' prison excavations are accessible every Friday morning when guided tours are organised by the Tower of David Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Tower of David Museum: reservations for guided tours of the Kishle and Citadel moat  [http://www.tod.org.il/en/the-kishle-and-the-citadel-moat/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''high-integrity pressure protection system''' (HIPPS) is a type of [[safety instrumented system]] (SIS) designed to prevent over-pressurization of a plant, such as a [[chemical plant]] or [[oil refinery]]. The HIPPS will shut off the source of the high pressure before the design pressure of the system is exceeded, thus preventing loss of containment through rupture ([[explosion]]) of a line or vessel. Therefore, a HIPPS is considered as a barrier between a high-pressure and a low-pressure section of an installation.

==Traditional systems==
In traditional systems over-pressure is dealt with through [[Relief valve|relief systems]]. A relief system will open an alternative outlet for the fluids in the system once a set pressure is exceeded, to avoid further build-up of pressure in the protected system. This alternative outlet generally leads to a [[Gas flare|flare]] or venting system to safely dispose the excess fluids. A relief system aims at removing any excess inflow of fluids for safe disposal, where a HIPPS aims at stopping the inflow of excess fluids and containing them in the system.

Conventional relief systems have disadvantages such as release of (flammable and toxic) process fluids or their combustion products in the environment and often a large footprint of the installation. With increasing environmental awareness, relief systems are not always an acceptable solution. However, because of their simplicity, relatively low cost and wide availability, conventional relief systems are still often applied.

==Advantages of HIPPS==
HIPPS provides a solution to protect equipment in cases where:
*high-pressures and / or flow rates are processed
*the environment is to be protected
*the economic viability of a development needs improvement
*the risk profile of the plant must be reduced

HIPPS is an instrumented safety system that is designed and built in accordance with the [[IEC 61508]] and [[IEC 61511]] standards.

The international standards IEC 61508 and 61511 refer to safety functions and Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) when discussing a device to protect equipment, personnel and environment. Older standards use terms like safety shut-down systems, emergency shut-down systems or last layers of defence.

==Components of HIPPS==
A system that closes the source of over-pressure within a specified time with at least the same reliability as a safety relief valve is usually called a HIPPS.  Such a HIPPS is a complete functional loop consisting of:
*sensors, (or initiators) that detect the high pressure
*a logic solver, which processes the input from the sensors to an output to the final element
*final elements, that actually perform the corrective action in the field by bringing the process to a safe state. In case of a HIPPS this means shutting off the source of overpressure. The final element consists of a valve, actuator and solenoids.

==Diagram==
[[Image:HIPPS.png|frame|none|Example of a HIPPS system]]

The scheme above presents three pressure transmitters (PT) connected to a logic solver. The solver will decide based on 2-out-of-3 ([[2oo3]]) voting whether or not to activate the final element. the 1oo2 solenoid panel decides which valve to be closed. The final elements consist here of two block valves that stop flow to the downstream facilities (right) to prevent them from exceeding a maximum pressure. The operator of the plant is warned through a pressure alarm (PA) that the HIPPS was activated.
This system has a high degree of redundancy:
*failure of one of the three pressure transmitters will not compromise the HIPPS functionality, as two readings of high pressure are needed for activation.
*failure of one of the two block valves will not compromise the HIPPS functionality, as the other valve will close on activation of the HIPPS.

One must not confine self to the above design as the only means of materializing the HIPPS definition. One must always think of the HIPPS generically, as a means of isolating a source of a high pressure when down stream flow have been blocked, isolating the upstream equipment (source of the high pressure) in a highly reliable manner. Be this source of the high pressure a pump (in case of liquid) or a gas compressor (in case of gas), the aim of the HIPPS in these cases is to reliably shut down the pump or the gas compressor creating the high pressure condition in a reliable and safe manner.

==Standards and design practices==
The ever-increasing flow rates in combination with the environmental constraints initiated the widespread and rapid acceptance in the last decades of HIPPS as the ultimate protection system.

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has introduced the [[IEC 61508]] and the [[IEC 61511]] standards in 1998 and 2003. These are performance based, non-prescriptive, standards which provide a detailed framework and a life-cycle approach for the design, implementation and management of safety systems applicable to a variety of sectors with different levels of risk definition. These standards also apply to HIPPS.

The IEC 61508 mainly focuses on electrical/electronic/programmable safety-related systems. However it also provides a framework for safety-related systems based on other technologies including mechanical systems. The IEC 61511 is added by the IEC specifically for designers, integrators and users of safety instrumented systems and covers the other parts of the safety loop (sensors and final elements) in more detail.

The basis for the design of your safety instrumented system is the required [[Safety Integrity Level]] (SIL). The SIL is obtained during the risk analysis of a plant or process and represents the required risk reduction. The SIS shall meet the requirements of the applicable SIL which ranges from 1 to 4. The IEC standards define the requirements for each SIL for the lifecycle of the equipment, including design and maintenance. The SIL also defines a required [[probability of failure on demand]] (PFD) for the complete loop and architectural constraints for the loop and its different elements.

The requirements of the HIPPS should not be simplified to a PFD level only, the qualitative requirements and architectural constraints form an integral part of the requirements to an instrumented protection system such as HIPPS.

The European standard EN12186 (formerly the [[DIN]] G491) and more specific the EN14382 (formerly DIN 3381) has been used for the past decades in (mechanically) instrumented overpressure protection systems. These standards prescribe the requirements for the over-pressure protection systems, and their components, in gas plants. Not only the response time and accuracy of the loop but also safety factors for over-sizing of the actuator of the final element are dictated by these standards. Independent design verification and testing to prove compliance to the EN14382 standard is mandatory. Therefore the users often refer to this standard for HIPPS design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5732">'''Indexing''' in reference to motion is moving (or being moved) into a new position or location quickly and easily but also precisely. When indexing a machine part, its new location is known to within a few hundredths of a millimeter (thousandths of an inch), or often even to within a few thousandths of a millimeter (ten-thousandths of an inch), despite the fact that no elaborate measuring or layout was needed to establish that location. In reference to multi-edge [[Cutting tool (machining)#Cutting tools with inserts (indexable tools)|cutting inserts]], indexing is the process of exposing a new cutting edge for use. Indexing is a necessary kind of motion in many areas of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[machining]]. A object that '''indexes''', or can be '''indexed''', is said to be '''indexable'''.

Usually when the word ''indexing'' is used, it refers specifically to [[rotation]]. That is, indexing is most often the quick and easy but precise rotation of a machine part through a certain known number of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]]. For example, ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]'', 25th edition, in its section on milling machine indexing,{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|pp=1873–1916}} says, "Positioning a workpiece at a precise angle or interval of rotation for a machining operation is called indexing."{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|p=1873}} In addition to that most classic sense of the word, the swapping of one part for another, or other controlled movements, are also sometimes referred to as ''indexing'', even if rotation is not the focus.

== Examples from everyday life ==

There are various examples of indexing that laypersons (non-engineers and non-machinists) can find in everyday life. These motions are not always called by the name ''indexing'', but the idea is essentially similar:
* The motion of pins inside a [[pin tumbler lock]], which the correct key can move quickly and easily but also rather precisely into [[:File:Pin tumbler with key.svg|the correct position]] to allow the lock's cylinder to turn
* Indexable driver bits for [[screwdriver]]s
* The motion of a retractable [[utility knife]] blade, which often will have well-defined discrete positions (fully retracted, ¼-exposed, ½-exposed, ¾-exposed, fully exposed)
* The indexing of a [[revolver]]'s [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]] with each shot

== Manufacturing applications==

Indexing is vital in [[manufacturing]], especially [[mass production]], where a well-defined cycle of motions must be repeated quickly and easily—but precisely—for each [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable part]] that is made. Without indexing capability, all manufacturing would have to be done on a craft basis, and interchangeable parts would have very high [[unit cost]] because of the time and skill needed to produce each unit. In fact, the evolution of modern technologies depended on the shift in methods from crafts (in which toolpath is controlled via operator skill) to indexing-capable toolpath control. A prime example of this theme was the development of the [[turret lathe]], whose turret indexes tool positions, one after another, to allow successive tools to move into place, take precisely placed cuts, then make way for the next tool. 

=== How indexing is achieved in manufacturing ===

Indexing capability is provided in two fundamental ways: with or without [[Information technology]] (IT).

==== Non-IT-assisted physical guidance ====

Non-IT-assisted physical guidance was the first means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the [[Industrial Revolution]] to progress into the [[Machine Age]]. It is achieved by [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and machine tool parts and accessories, which control toolpath by the very nature of their shape, physically limiting the path for motion. Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are [[wikt:drill jig|drill jigs]], the turrets on manual [[turret lathe]]s, [[indexing head]]s for manual [[milling machine]]s, [[rotary table]]s, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than indexing heads, and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Harvnb|Bulgin|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although indexing heads of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of CNC milling machine toolholders or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.

==== IT-assisted physical guidance ====

IT-assisted physical guidance (for example, via [[Numerical control|NC]], [[CNC]], or [[robotics]]) has been developed since the [[World War II]] era and uses electromechanical and electrohydraulic [[servomechanism]]s to translate digital information into position control. These systems also ultimately physically limit the path for motion, as jigs and other purely mechanical means do; but they do it not simply through their own shape, but rather using changeable information.

'''Jehoiachin's rations tablets''' date from the 6th century BC and describe the rations set aside for a royal captive identified with [[Jeconiah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas |first=David Winton |authorlink=David Winton Thomas |title=Documents from Old Testament Times |publisher=Thomas Nelson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cRBAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=tablets&amp;pg=PA84 |location=Edinburgh and London|year=1958|edition=1961|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|24:12|kjv}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|24:15–24:16|kjv}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|25:27–25:30|kjv}}; {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:9–36:10|kjv}}; {{Bibleverse|Jeremiah|22:24–22:26||}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|29:2|kjv}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|52:31–52:34|kjv}}; {{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|17:12|kjv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tablets from the royal archives of [[Nebuchadnezzar]] king of Babylon were unearthed in the ruins of Babylon that contain food rations paid to captives and craftsmen who lived in and around the city. On one of the tablets, "Ya’u-kīnu, king of the land of Yahudu" is mentioned along with his five sons listed as royal princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Babylonian_Ration_List:_King_Jehoiakhin_in_Exile,_592/1_BCE |title=Babylonian Ration List: King Jehoiakhin in Exile, 592/1 BCE |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=COJS.org |publisher=The Center for Online Judaic Studies |accessdate=23 August 2013 |quote=Ya’u-kīnu, king of the land of Yahudu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavation==
The tablets were excavated from [[Babylon]] during 1899–1917 by [[Robert Koldewey]] and were stored in a barrel-vaulted underground building consisting of rows of rooms near the [[Ishtar Gate]].

==Translation==
The tablets' text states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Babylon 28122: "...t[o] Ia-'-u-kin, king..."
Babylon 28178: "10 (sila of oil) to ...Ia-'-kin, king of Ia[...] 2{{sfrac|1|2}} sila to [...so]ns of the king of Ia-a-hu-du"
Babylon 28186: "10 (sila) to Ia-ku-u-ki-nu, the son of the king of Ia-ku-du, 2{{sfrac|1|2}} sila for the 5 sons of the king of Ia-ku-du"&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another tablet reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;1{{sfrac|1|2}} sila (oil) for three carpenters from [[Arvad]], {{sfrac|1|2}} apiece,
11{{sfrac|1|2}} sila for eight woodworkers from [[Byblos]], . . .
3{{sfrac|1|2}} sila for seven Greek craftsman, {{sfrac|1|2}} sila apiece,
{{sfrac|1|2}} sila to the carpenter, Nabuetir
10 sila to Ia-ku-u-ki-nu, the [[king of Judah]]’s son,
2{{sfrac|1|2}} sila for the five sons of the Judean king. &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This evidence matches with the biblical texts found in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|24:10–17|ESV}} and {{bibleverse|Jeremiah|52:31–34|ESV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblehistory.net/newsletter/jehoiachin.htm |title=Jehoiachin's grain ration list |author=John Argubright |date=2013 |website=biblehistory.net |publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''sila'' is a [[Ancient_Mesopotamian_units_of_measurement#Capacity|Babylonian unit of capacity]] equivalent to about 800 mL (1.7 US pints).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assyrianlanguages.org/akkadian/dosearch.php?searchkey=472&amp;language=id&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9030">'''The Lifecycle Modeling Language (LML)''' is an open-standard modeling language designed for [[systems engineering]]. It supports the full [[System lifecycle|lifecycle]]: conceptual, utilization, support and retirement stages. Along with the integration of all lifecycle disciplines including, [[program management]], systems and design [[engineering]], [[verification and validation]], deployment and maintenance into one framework.&lt;ref name="specification"&gt;{{cite web|author=LML Steering Committee|title=LML Specification|url=http://www.lifecyclemodeling.org/spec/LML_Specification_1_0.pdf|accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LML was originally designed by the LML steering committee. The specification was published October 17, 2013.

The purpose behind the language is to replace predecessor languages, such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and [[SysML]] that overcomplicate the systems engineering process. LML uses common language to define its modeling elements such as entity, attribute, schedule, cost, and relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lifecyclemodeling.org/about-lml/|title=About Lifecycle Modeling Language|publisher=LML Steering Committee|accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
LML communicates cost, schedule and performance to all stakeholders in the system lifecycle. 
LML combines the logical constructs with an ontology to capture information. SysML is mainly constructs and has a limited ontology, while DoDAF MetaModel 2.0 (DM2) only has an ontology. Instead LML simplifies both the constructs and ontology to make them more complete, but still easier to use. There are only 12 primary entity classes. Almost all of the classes relate to each other and themselves with consistent words, i.e., Asset performs Action. Action performed by Asset.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;Dr. Steven Dam and Dr. Warren Vaneman, [http://www.slideshare.net/ElizabethSteiner/lifecycle-modeling-language-tutorial-by-dr-dam-and-dr-vaneman "Lifecycle Modeling Language Tutorial"], ''Presentation at SEDC 2014''2014-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; 
SysML uses object oriented design, because it was designed to relate systems thinking to software development. No other discipline in the lifecycle uses object oriented design and analysis extensively. LML captures the entire lifecycle from cradle to grave.&lt;ref name="specification"/&gt;

Systems Engineers have identified complexity as a major issue.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; LML is a new approach to analyzing, planning, specifying, designing, building and maintaining modern systems. 
LML focuses on these 6 goals:
1.	To be easy to understand
2.	To be easy to extend 
3.	To support both functional and object oriented approaches within the same design
4.	To be a language that can be understood by most system stakeholders, not just Systems Engineers
5.	To support systems from cradle to grave
6.	To support both evolutionary and revolutionary changes to system plans and designs over the lifetime of a system &lt;ref name="specification"/&gt;

== History ==
The LML Steering Committee was formed in February 2013 to review a proposed draft ontology and set of diagrams that forms the LML specification. Contributors from many academic and commercial organizations provided direct input into the specification, resulting in its publication in October 2013. Presentations and tutorials were given at the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) Systems Engineering Conference (October 2013) and the Systems Engineering in DC (SEDC) in April 2014.
A predecessor to LML was developed by Dr. Steven H. Dam, SPEC Innovations, as part of a methodology called Knowledge-Based Analysis and Design (KBAD). The ontology portion was prototyping in a systems engineering database tool. Ideas on how to better implement it and the development of key LML diagrams (Action and Asset) were part of their Innoslate product development from 2009 to present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.slideshare.net/ElizabethSteiner/knowledgebased-analysis-and-design-kbad-an-approach-to-rapid-systems-engineering-for-the-lifecycle | title = Knowledge-Based Analysis and Design (KBAD): An Approach to Rapid Systems Engineering for the Lifecycle |  accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ontology ==
Ontologies provide a set of defined terms and relationships between the terms to capture the information that describes the physical, functional, performance, and programmatic aspects of the system. 
Common ways for describing such ontologies are "Entity", "Relationship", and "Attribute" (ERA). ERA is often used to define database schemas. LML extends the ERA schema with "Attributes on Relationship", a feature that can reduce the number of required "Relationships", in the same way that "Attribute" reduce the number of required "Entities" in ERA. 
In alignment with the first goal of LML, "Entity", "Relationship", "Attribute", and "Attribute on Relationship" have equivalent English language elements: [[noun]], [[verb]], [[adjective]] and [[adverb]].&lt;ref name="specification"/&gt;

'''Entity (noun)'''
An [[entity]] is defined as something that is uniquely identifiable and can exist by itself. There are only 12 parent entities in LML: Action, Artifact, Asset, Characteristic, Connection, Cost, Decision, Input/Output, Location, Risk, Statement and Time. 
Several child entities have been defined to capture information that stakeholders need. The child entities have the attributes and relationships of the parents plus additional attributes and relationships that make them unique. Child entities include: Conduit (child of Connection), Logical (child of Connection), Measure (child of Characteristic), Orbital (child of Location), Physical (child of Location), Requirement (child of Statement), Resource (child of Asset), and Virtual (child of Location). 
Every entity has a name or number or description attribute or combination of the three to identify it uniquely. The name is a word or small collection of words providing an overview of information about the entity. 
The number provides a numerical way to identify the entity. The description provides more detail about that entity.&lt;ref name="specification"/&gt;
	
'''Attribute (adjective)'''
The attributes work in the same way an adjective. Entities (the nouns) can have names, numbers, and description attributes. The inherent characteristic or quality of an entity is an attribute. Every attribute has a name that identifies it uniquely within an entity. Attributes names are unique within an entity, but may be used in other entities. The name provides an overview of information about the attribute. The attribute data type specifies the data associated with the attribute.&lt;ref name="specification"/&gt;

'''Relationship (verb)'''
The relationship works the same way a verb connects nouns or in this case the entities. The relationships enable a simple method to see how [entities] connect. For example, when connecting an action to a statement, LML uses “traced from” as the relationship: an Action is traced from a Statement. The inverse relation of traced from is “traced to.” Relationships are defined in both directions and have unique names with the same verb. The standard parent child relationship is decomposed by and its inverse is decomposes. 
Relationship names are unique across the whole schema.&lt;ref name="specification"/&gt;

'''Attributes on Relationships (adverb)'''
Classic ERA modeling does not include "attributes on relationships", but is included in LML. In terms of the English language, an "attribute on a relationship" is like an adverb, helping to describe the relationship. Analogous to the way in which attributes relate to entities the "attribute on a relationship" has a name that is unique to its relationship, but need not be unique across other relationships.&lt;ref name="specification"/&gt;

[[Bacteriophage]]s, viruses that are parasitic on bacteria, were first discovered in the early twentieth century.

==In sediments==
Marine bacteriophage form an important part of [[deep sea]] [[ecosystem]]s. There are between 5x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and 1x10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; phage per square metre in deep sea sediments and their abundance closely correlates with the number of [[prokaryote]]s found in the sediments. They are responsible for the death of 80% of the prokaryotes found in the sediments, and almost all of these deaths are caused by cell [[lysis]] (bursting). They therefore play an important part in shifting nutrients from living forms into dissolved organic matter and detritus. This explains the high rate of nutrient turnover in deep sea sediments. The release of nutrients from infected bacteria stimulates the growth of uninfected bacteria and then these also become infected. Because of the importance of deep sea sediments in biogeochemical cycles, marine bacteriophage must influence the [[carbon cycle|carbon]], [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus cycle]]s, but the exact influences are currently not understood.&lt;ref name="Danovaro" /&gt;

==Carbon cycle==

Marine viruses may play an important role in the carbon cycle by increasing the efficiency of the biological pump. The argument is that lysis releases unstable compounds, such as amino acids and nucleic acids, which tend to be recycled near the surface, whereas more indigestible carbon-rich material, such as that found in cell walls, is probably exported to deeper waters. Thus, the material that is exported to deeper waters by the '[[viral shunt]]' is probably more carbon rich than the material from which it was derived. This would increase the efficiency of the biological pump.&lt;ref name="pmid17853907"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Suttle CA |title=Marine viruses—major players in the global ecosystem |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=801–12 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17853907 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:31012016-img114.jpg|thumb|Statue of mother with children at the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]]]]

A '''mother''' is the [[female]] parent of a [[child]]. Mothers are [[women]] who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their [[children]], who may or may not be their biological [[offspring]]. Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given [[birth]], by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for [[fertilisation]], or some combination thereof. Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother. Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child. Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an [[adoption|adoptive]] mother, and those who meet only the third a [[surrogate pregnancy|surrogacy]] mother.

The above concepts defining the role of mother are neither exhaustive nor universal, as any definition of 'mother' may vary based on how social, cultural, and religious roles are defined. The parallel conditions and terms for males: those who are (typically biologically) [[father]]s do not, by definition, take up the role of fatherhood. Mother and fatherhood are not limited to those who are or have [[parenting|parented]]. Women who are [[pregnant]] may be referred to as expectant mothers or mothers-to-be, though such applications tend to be less readily applied to (biological) fathers or adoptive parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=definition of mother from Oxford Dictionaries Online|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mother?rskey=YplwRN&amp;result=1|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Define Mother at Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mother|publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of becoming a mother has been referred to as "matrescence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sacks |first1=Alexandra |title=The Birth of a Mother |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/well/family/the-birth-of-a-mother.html |accessdate=9 September 2018 |date=8 May 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological mother==
[[File:Countries by Birth Rate in 2014.svg|thumb|Countries by crude birth rate (CBR) in 2014. Birth rates are lowest in Western countries.]]
Biological motherhood for [[human]]s, as in other [[mammal]]s, occurs when a [[pregnant]] female gestates a fertilized ovum (the "egg"). A female can become pregnant through [[sexual intercourse]] after she has begun to [[ovulate]]. In well-nourished girls, [[menarche]] (the first [[menstrual cycle|menstrual period]])  usually takes place around the age of 12 or 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/589004_3|title=Medscape: Medscape Access|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a [[fetus]] develops from the viable [[zygote]], resulting in an [[embryo]]. [[Gestation]] occurs in the woman's [[uterus]] until the fetus (assuming it is carried to [[Pregnancy duration|term]]) is sufficiently developed to be born. In humans, gestation is often around 9 months in duration, after which the woman experiences labor and gives birth. This is not always the case, however, as some babies are born [[preterm birth|prematurely]], late, or in the case of [[stillbirth]], do not survive gestation. Usually, once the baby is born, the mother produces [[milk]] via the [[lactation]] process. The mother's [[breast milk]] is the source of [[antibodies]] for the infant's [[immune system]], and commonly the sole source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods; older infants and toddlers may continue to be breastfed, in combination with other foods, which should be introduced from approximately six months of age.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/solid-foods-weaning/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Childlessness]] is the state of not having children. Childlessness may have personal, social or political significance. Childlessness may be [[voluntary childlessness]], which occurs by choice, or may be involuntary due to health problems or social circumstances. Motherhood is usually voluntary, but may also be the result of [[forced pregnancy]], such as [[pregnancy from rape]]. Unwanted motherhood occurs especially in cultures which practice [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]].

==Non-biological mother==
''Mother'' can often apply to a woman other than the biological parent, especially if she fulfills the main social role in raising the child. This is commonly either an [[adoptive]] mother or a [[stepmother]] (the biologically unrelated [[Significant other|partner]] of a child's [[father]]). The term "[[othermother]]" or "other mother" is also used in some contexts for women who provide care for a child not biologically their own in addition to the child's primary mother.

Adoption, in various forms, has been practiced throughout history, even predating human civilization.&lt;ref name="Conn2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Conn|title=Adoption: A Brief Social and Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoUh9LvIzRcC&amp;pg=PA25|date=28 January 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-33390-2|pages=25–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive [[statutes]] and [[regulations]]. In recent decades, [[international adoption]]s have become more and more common.

[[Adoption in the United States]] is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jardine|first=Cassandra|title=Why adoption is so easy in America|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3354960/Why-adoption-is-so-easy-in-America.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Oct 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the US accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/child-adoption.pdf |format=PDF |title=Child Adoption : Trends and Policies |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrogate mother===
{{Main|Surrogacy}}
A surrogate mother is a woman who bears a child that came from another woman's fertilized ovum on behalf of a couple unable to give birth to children. Thus the surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a child that she is not the biological mother of. Surrogate motherhood became possible with advances in [[reproductive technologies]], such as [[in vitro]] fertilization.

Not all women who become pregnant via in vitro fertilization are surrogate mothers. Surrogacy involves both a genetic mother, who provides the ovum, and a gestational (or surrogate) mother, who carries the child to term.

===Motherhood in same-sex relationships===
The possibility for lesbian and bisexual women in [[same-sex relationship]]s (or women without a partner) to become mothers has increased over the past few decades{{when|date=October 2014}} due to technological developments. Modern [[gay parenting|lesbian parenting]] (a term that somewhat [[bisexual erasure|erases]] the bisexual case) originated with women who were in heterosexual relationships who later identified as lesbian or bisexual, as changing attitudes provided more acceptance for non-heterosexual relationships. Another way for such women to become mothers is through [[LGBT adoption|adopting]] or [[foster parent]]ing. There is also the option of self-[[insemination]] and clinically assisted donor insemination, forms of [[artificial insemination]]. As fertility technology has advanced, more females not in a heterosexual relationship have become mothers through [[in vitro fertilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://find.galegroup.com/gtx/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T002&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;docId=A96237890&amp;source=gale&amp;userGroupName=wash_main&amp;version=1.0 |title=Lesbian parenting: issues, strengths and challenges |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hooks2000"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mezey, Nancy J |title=New Choices, New Families: How Lesbians Decide about Motherhood |year=2008 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=978-0-8018-9000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social roles associated with motherhood are variable across time, culture, and social class.

In many cultures, women received significant help in performing these tasks from older female relatives, such as mothers in law or their own mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.unm.edu/fasmith/Web_Page_PDFs/Smith_Brown_1996.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Changing Role of Women in North American Mammalogy |publisher=Biology.unm.edu |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding [[women in the workforce]], mothers often entail a [[mommy track]] rather than being entirely "[[career women]]". Mothers may be [[Housewife|stay at home mothers]] or [[Working parent|working mothers]]. In recent decades there has been an increase in [[Stay-at-home dad|stay at home fathers]] too. Social views on these arrangements vary significantly by culture: in Europe for instance, in German-speaking countries there is a strong tradition of mothers exiting the workforce and being homemakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ined.fr/fichier/s_rubrique/26128/540.population.societies.2017.january.en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Has childlessness peaked in Europe? |website=Ined.fr|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers have historically fulfilled the primary role in raising children, but since the late 20th century, the role of the father in child care has been given greater prominence and social acceptance in some Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cisep/conferencias/conferencia_20021016/Papers/kjeldstad55.PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815170110/http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cisep/conferencias/conferencia_20021016/Papers/kjeldstad55.PDF|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucgstp.org/lit/gn/gn064/fathersimportant.htm |title=ucgstp.org |publisher=Ucgstp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th century also saw more and more women entering paid work. [[Mothers' rights]] within the workforce include [[maternity leave]] and [[parental leave]].

The social role and experience of motherhood varies greatly depending upon location.

Since the 1970s, [[in vitro fertilization]] has made pregnancy possible at ages well beyond "natural" limits, generating ethical controversy and forcing significant changes in the social meaning of motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/motherhood-is-it-ever-too_b_233916.html |title=Motherhood: Is It Ever Too Late? &amp;#124; Jacob M.

Traditionally, and still in most parts of the world today, a mother was expected to be a [[married]] woman, with birth outside of marriage carrying a strong [[social stigma]]. Historically, this stigma not only applied to the mother, but also to her child. This continues to be the case in many parts of the developing world today, but in many Western countries the situation has changed radically, with single motherhood being much more socially acceptable now. For more details on these subjects, see [[Legitimacy (family law)]] and [[single parent]].

The total fertility rate (TFR), that is, the number of children born per woman, differs greatly from country to country. The TFR in 2013 was estimated to be highest in [[Niger]] (7.03 children born per woman) and lowest in [[Singapore]] (0.79 children/woman).&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the TFR was estimated for 2013 at 2.06 births per woman.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; In 2011, the average age at first birth was 25.6 and 40.7% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm|title=FastStats|work=cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''maternal death'' is defined by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indmaternalmortality/en/|title=WHO - Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births)|work=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 56% of maternal deaths occur in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and another 29% in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/news/over-99-percent-of-maternal-deaths-occur-in-developing-countries|title=Over 99 percent of maternal deaths occur in developing countries|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the organization [[Save the Children]] has [[Save the Children State of the World's Mothers report|ranked]] the countries of the world, and found that [[Scandinavia]]n countries are the safest places to give birth, whereas countries in sub-Saharan Africa are the least safe to give birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/newsdesk/2006-05-08b.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012211639/http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/newsdesk/2006-05-08b.html|date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study argues a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is over 750 times more likely to [[maternal mortality|die in pregnancy or childbirth]], compared to a mother in the top ten ranked countries, and a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is 28 times more likely to [[infant mortality|see her child die]] before reaching their first birthday.

The most recent data suggests that [[Italy]], [[Sweden]] and [[Luxembourg]] are the safest countries in terms of maternal death and [[Afghanistan]], [[Central African Republic]] and [[Malawi]] are the most dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/story/86023/safest-place-to-give-birth-italy.html|title=Safest Place to Give Birth?

[[Childbirth]] is an inherently dangerous and risky procedure, subject to many complications. The "natural" mortality rate of childbirth—where nothing is done to avert maternal death—has been estimated as being 1500 deaths per 100,000 births.&lt;ref name="vanlerberghe"&gt;Van Lerberghe W, De Brouwere V. ''Of blind alleys and things that have worked: history’s lessons on reducing maternal mortality.'' In: De Brouwere V, Van Lerberghe W, eds. ''Safe motherhood strategies: a review of the evidence''. Antwerp, ITG Press, 2001 (Studies in Health Services Organisation and Policy, 17:7–33).  "Where nothing effective is done to avert maternal death, "natural" mortality is probably of the order of magnitude of 1,500/100,000."&lt;/ref&gt; Modern medicine has greatly alleviated the risk of childbirth. In modern Western countries the current maternal mortality rate is around 10 deaths per 100,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', p10&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all world religions define tasks or roles for mothers through either [[religious law]] or through the [[glorification]] of mothers who served in substantial religious events. There are many examples of religious law relating to mothers and women.

Major world religions which have specific religious law or [[Biblical canon|scriptural canon]] regarding mothers include: [[Women in Christianity|Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What The Bible Says About Mother |url=http://www.mothersdayworld.com/mothers-day-quotes/bible-verses-on-mother.html |publisher=Mothers Day World |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women in Judaism|Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Religious Obligations of Jewish women |url=http://judaism.about.com/cs/women/f/women_mitzvot.htm |publisher=About.com |first=Lisa |last=Katz |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gender roles in Islam|Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ideal Muslimah: The True Islâmic Personality of the Muslim Woman as Defined in the Qur'ân and Sunnah |first=Muhammad |last='Ali Al-Hashimi |url=http://www.wefound.org/texts/Ideal_Muslims_files/herchildren.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020302034316/http://www.wefound.org/texts/Ideal_Muslims_files/herchildren.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-03-02 |publisher=Wisdom Enrichment Foundation, Inc. |accessdate=2008-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of honoring motherhood include the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]] or ''Blessed Virgin Mother [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]]'' for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], and the multiple positive references to active womanhood as a mother in the [[Book of Proverbs]].

Throughout history mothers with their children have often been the subject of artistic works, such as paintings, sculptures or writings.

Fourth century grave reliefs on the island of [[Rhodes]] depicted mothers with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=3fnsWhZkq74C |page=234 |title=Women, Crime and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paintings of mothers with their children have a long tradition in [[France]].

Many contemporary movies portray mothers.

===Etymology===
[[File:Մայր Հայաստան հուշարձան.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Mother Armenia]], aerial view in [[Yerevan]]]]
The modern English word is from Middle English moder, from Old English mōdor, from Proto-Germanic *mōdēr (cf. East Frisian muur, Dutch moeder, German Mutter), from Proto-Indo-European *méh₂tēr (cf. Irish máthair, Tocharian A mācar, B mācer, Lithuanian mótė). Other cognates include Latin māter, Greek μήτηρ, Common Slavic *mati (thence Russian мать (mat’)), Persian مادر (madar), and Sanskrit मातृ (mātṛ).

'''Museolog''' is a web-driven [[software]] system for cataloging museum information. It is an advanced tool for museum records management, based on the international standards. It was developed by EUROCLID within the UNESCO HeritageNet project, and localized by the non-governmental organization, Open Systems. Using this software, initial functions of input and editing of museum catalogues are provided what has been described as "a modern intuitive graphical interface using forms and menus." Museolog is [[free software]] released under the [[GNU GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/museolog/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing museum objects==

Museolog allows the user to create a record across several interactive sessions. It is also possible to save non-validated, incomplete records for future completion.

Access to the database is regulated by a system of managing access rights, to various levels of functionaries in the museum.

It is also possible manage object movements (when an object is moved from one place to another within the museum, or on loan to an external place), and restoration work. To track movement, a 'movement sheet' is printed. This software allows the user to print a list of all objects on loan, including details like origin and destination place.

When restoration work is undertaken, the type of work (e.g. cleaning), the physical method used, and digital photos taken before and after can be recorded.

==Searching the museum==

Searching and selecting records is also possible, from the catalogue, through the use of Boolean queries. Retrieved records are shown as a short-list of titles; clicking on any would show the full record. Selected records are printable, with any relevant images inserted in the document.

In keeping with current methods of photographing museum exhibits, digital images are indexed in the database. These images are archived, using recordable CD-roms. CDs are then numbered and indexed in the database, making retrieval easy of all museum objects.

==More functions==

Users can save the current state of the database on a CD-R; there is the possibility of rebuilding this when needed due to any possible hardware or software crash. Data from the database can also be exported in XML format, making it transferable to other databases or website. This software also allows for managing [[thesauri]] and authority lists. Users can load, browse, edit and export [[thesauri]] and terminology resources, thus allowing for cooperative terminology definition and exchanges.

==Versions available==

As of [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556 July 7, 2007] the versions that were available were [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556&amp;package_id=148371 4.5-6 for Linux] and [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556&amp;package_id=148372 4.6 for Windows], both released in mid-2005.

[[File:Mycena leaiana var. australis.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mushrooms]] are considered a kind of fungal reproductive organism.]]

'''Mycology''' is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of [[fungus|fungi]], including their [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biochemistry|biochemical]] properties, their [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[ethnomycology|their use to humans]]  as a source for [[tinder]], [[medicine]], [[Edible mushroom|food]], and [[entheogens]], as well as their dangers, such as [[poison|toxicity]] or [[fungal infection|infection]]. 

A biologist specializing in mycology is called a '''mycologist'''.
 
Mycology branches into the field of [[phytopathology]], the study of plant diseases, and the two disciplines remain closely related because the vast majority of plant pathogens are fungi.

== Overview ==
Historically, mycology was a branch of [[botany]] because, although fungi are [[evolution]]arily more closely related to animals than to plants, this was not recognized until a few decades ago. Pioneer ''mycologists'' included [[Elias Magnus Fries]], [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]], [[Anton de Bary]], and [[Lewis David von Schweinitz]].

Many fungi produce [[toxin]]s, [[antibiotics]], and other [[secondary metabolism|secondary metabolites]]. For example, the [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] (worldwide) genus ''[[Fusarium]]'' and their toxins associated with fatal outbreaks of alimentary toxic aleukia in humans were extensively studied by [[Abraham Joffe]].

Fungi are fundamental for life on earth in their roles as [[symbiosis|symbionts]], e.g. in the form of [[mycorrhiza]]e, [[insect]] symbionts, and [[lichen]]s.  Many fungi are able to break down complex [[organic compound|organic]] [[biomolecules]] such as [[lignin]], the more durable component of [[wood]], and pollutants such as [[xenobiotic]]s, [[petroleum]], and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.  By decomposing these molecules, fungi play a critical role in the global [[carbon cycle]].

Fungi and other organisms traditionally recognized as fungi, such as [[oomycetes]] and myxomycetes ([[slime molds]]), often are economically and socially important, as some cause diseases of animals (such as [[histoplasmosis]]) as well as plants (such as [[Dutch elm disease]] and [[Magnaporthe grisea|Rice blast]]).

Apart from pathogenic fungi, many fungal species are very important in controlling the plant diseases caused by different pathogens. For example, species of the filamentous fungal genus ''[[Trichoderma]]'' considered as one of the most important biological control agents as an alternative to chemical based products for effective crop diseases management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruano-Rosa|first=David|last2=Prieto|first2=Pilar|last3=Rincón|first3=Ana María|last4=Gómez-Rodríguez|first4=María Victoria|last5=Valderrama|first5=Raquel|last6=Barroso|first6=Juan Bautista|last7=Mercado-Blanco|first7=Jesús|date=2015-11-07|title=Fate of ''Trichoderma harzianum'' in the olive rhizosphere: time course of the root colonization process and interaction with the fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae|journal=BioControl|language=en|volume=61|issue=3|pages=269–282|doi=10.1007/s10526-015-9706-z|issn=1386-6141|hdl=10261/157852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field meetings to find interesting species of fungi are known as 'forays', after the first such meeting organized by the [[Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club]] in 1868 and entitled "A foray among the funguses"[''sic''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anon |title=A foray among the funguses |journal=Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club |volume=1868 |year=1868 |pages=184–192 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/44662#page/254/mode/1up|publisher=Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fungi can cause disease in humans and other animals - The study of [[pathogenic fungi]] that infect animals is referred to as [[pathogenic fungi|medical mycology]].&lt;ref name= SanBlasCalderone&gt;{{cite book | author = San-Blas G; Calderone RA (editors). | title = Pathogenic Fungi | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/pat2 | isbn= 978-1-904455-32-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It is presumed that humans started [[Mushroom hunting|collecting mushrooms]] as food in [[prehistoric]] times. Mushrooms were first written about in the works of [[Euripides]] (480-406 B.C.). The Greek philosopher [[Theophrastos]] of [[Eresos]] (371-288 B.C.) was perhaps the first to try to systematically classify plants; mushrooms were considered to be plants missing certain organs. It was later [[Pliny the Elder]] (23&amp;ndash;79 A.D.), who wrote about [[truffles]] in his encyclopedia ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis historia]]''. The word ''mycology'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: μύκης (''mukēs''), meaning "fungus" and the suffix {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}} (''-logia''), meaning "study".

The [[Middle Ages]] saw little advancement in the body of knowledge about fungi. Rather, the invention of the printing press allowed some authors to disseminate superstitions and misconceptions about the fungi that had been perpetuated by the classical authors.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rquote|right|Fungi and truffles are neither herbs, nor roots, nor flowers, nor seeds, but merely the superfluous moisture or earth, of trees, or rotten wood, and of other rotting things. This is plain from the fact that all fungi and truffles, especially those that are used for eating, grow most commonly in thundery and wet weather.|Jerome Bock ([[Hieronymus Tragus]])|1552&lt;ref&gt;''De stirpium maxime earum quae in Germania nostra nascuntur, usitatis nomenclaturis''. Strasbourg. In Ainsworth, p. 13, quoting Buller, AHR. (1915). Micheli and the discovery of reproduction in fungi. ''Transactions of the royal Society of Canada'', series 3 '''9''': 1&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The start of the modern age of mycology begins with [[Pier Antonio Micheli]]'s 1737 publication of ''Nova plantarum genera''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Published in [[Florence]], this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic [[classification (biology)|classification]] of grasses, mosses and fungi. The term ''mycology'' and the complementary ''mycologist'' were first used in 1836 by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley|M.J. Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NanoGagliato''' is an invitational gathering of scientists, physicians, business leaders, artists, and researchers to discuss the most current challenges and opportunities in the fields of [[nanomedicine]] and the [[nanotechnology|nanosciences]], from a multisciplinary perspective. This series of events takes place each year, at the end of July, in the town of [[Gagliato]], [[Calabria]], [[Italy]].

== Format ==

During two days of intense scientific exchanges, the participants to NanoGagliato address the challenges of translating research to the [[clinic]] by deploying technological advances born in the field of [[nanotechnology]]. On the last two days of the event, the group goes on excursions of renowned localities in Calabria and neighboring regions.

=== Public session ===
The culminating event of NanoGagliato is a town-hall style meeting, traditionally attended by hundreds of people of all ages from Gagliato and neighboring towns. The event is organized in concert with local citizens' associations and public institutions, and is held in Gagalito's [[town square]]. Highlights of the attending scientists' research are presented. Time is reserved for an open Q&amp;A session, where members of the public are encouraged to ask about the impact of the presented research, the promise for new treatments for [[disease]], and any [[medical ethics|ethical]] concerns.

== Sessions ==
{{Empty section|date=January 2012}}

== Founding session ==
The first NanoGagliato was convened in 2008 by '''[http://www.methodisthealth.com/tmhri.cfm?id=39431 Mauro Ferrari]''', Ph.D, with the help of his wife, Paola, and hosted at his summer residence in Gagliato. Attendees were asked to provide their own transportation. Several countries were represented, including [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Portugal]], the [[United States]], and [[France]]. Hospitality was kindly provided by local private residents.

=== Establishment of L'Accademia di Gagliato delle Nanoscienze ===
At the end of the first NanoGagliato, the participants agreed to establish a [[Nonprofit organization|non profit association]], named '''L'Accademia di Gagliato delle Nanoscienze''', and its children's chapter, La Piccola Accademia. These associations are now the organizers of the events of NanoGagliato, and are supported by donations of individuals and corporations.

== Successive sessions==

During the 2010 session, four [[scholarships]] were awarded to four young Italian researchers in the field of [[biomedical engineering]], in honor of Prof. [[Salvatore Venuta]], the late [[Rector (academia)|Magnifico Rettore]] of the [[Magna Græcia University]] of [[Catanzaro]]. As part of the award, the finalists were invited to join the NanoGagliato events alongside the scientists.

== Children's activities ==

'''La Piccola Accademia di Gagliato''' is the children's chapter of the L' Accademia di Gagliato. The first series of educational activities for schoolchildren was launched in the summer of 2010. Inspired by the [[NanoDays]] developed by the [http://www.nisenet.org/ NISE] (Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network), La Piccola Accademia organized a lively and very successful program including games, presentations, trading cards, and a Q&amp;A session with the scientists. Approximately fifty children from Gagliato and nearby towns attended the first session.

== Recognition of Gagliato ==

In recognition of the unique role that the town of Gagliato has come to play as an international magnet for global leaders in nanotechnology, and as host of the NanoGagliato events, Gagliato has received the official appellation of “Paese delle NanoScienze”, town of Nanosciences, attributed by the [[City Council]].

'''''No Way to Heaven''''' is a 2008 documentary feature about people allegedly living on light ([[Breatharianism]]), directed and produced by Swiss filmmakers Janos Tedeschi and Christof Schaefer. It is the world’s very first full-length film on this topic.

''No Way to Heaven'' premiered in Switzerland in January 2008. The film had theatrical release in Switzerland in January 2009 and went on to screen in Estonia and the Netherlands.

==Synopsis==
''No Way to Heaven'' begins on a remote island in Southeast Asia. There, Fritz Joss, a young man from the Swiss mountains has decided to stop eating – once and for all. He plans to find sustenance in pure (sun-)light by applying what is known as the "21 day process". Fritz sets off on his endeavour, but the planned conversion to "breatharianism" is much more difficult than anticipated.

==Cast==
The film features encounters with the following characters:
* Fritz Joss, a young Swiss yogi who stops eating and drinking by applying the "21-day process".
* [[Inedia#Prahlad Jani .28.22Mataji.22.29|Prahlad Jani]], an 82-year ascetic Hindu, who for 74 years has survived allegedly without food and liquid.
* A team of doctors, headed by [[Inedia#2003 Tests|Prof. Dr. Sudhir Shah]], a neurologist and respected scientist at Sterling Hospital Ahmedabad, India, who have conducted several case studies on breatharianism, most notably with Prahlad Jani in 2004 and 2010.
* Niranjan Bhagat, who gazes at the sun ([[sungazing]]) every day for 45 minutes and hence claims does not need to eat.
* Sanjay Padhiyar, a 110-year-old Indian saint, who tells the story of how she forgot to eat during several years of meditation, living as a recluse in a cave in northern India.

DVD Extras:

* [[Jasmuheen]], an Australian esoteric teacher and author, who introduced breatharianism (and the 21-day process) in her best-selling book "Living on Light" to Western audiences in the late 90s.
* Dr. Michael Werner, a German chemist, anthroposophist and author of "Leben durch Lichtnahrung", himself a breatharian of multiple years.
* [[Inedia#2003 Tests|Prof. Dr. Sudhir Shah]] (extended interview).
* Swami Vivekananda Saraswati, a prominent yogi and teacher of Fritz Joss.

'''Open Threat Exchange''' (OTX) is the world's largest crowd-sourced computer-security platform&lt;ref name=ITPortal /&gt; with more than 80,000 participants in 140 countries who share more than 19 million potential threats daily.&lt;ref name=AlienVault/&gt; It's free to use.&lt;ref name=CMS /&gt;

Founded in 2012,&lt;ref name=Info /&gt; OTX was created and is run by [[AlienVault]], a developer of commercial and open source solutions to manage cyber attacks.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch2 /&gt;  The collaborative threat exchange was created partly as a counterweight to criminal hackers successfully working together and sharing information about viruses, malware and other cyber attacks.&lt;ref name=Hacker /&gt;

==Components==

OTX is cloud-hosted. Information sharing covers a wide range of issues related to security, including viruses, malware, intrusion detection and firewalls. Its automated tools cleanse, aggregate, validate and publish data shared by participants.&lt;ref name=Info /&gt; The data is validated by the OTX platform then stripped of information identifying the participating contributor.&lt;ref name=Hacker /&gt;

In 2015, OTX 2.0 added a social network which enables members to share, discuss and research security threats, including via a real-time threat feed.&lt;ref name=Security /&gt;  Users can share the IP addresses or websites from where attacks originated or look up specific threats to see if anyone has already left such information.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch /&gt;

Users can subscribe to a “Pulse,” an analysis of a specific threat, including data on IoC, impact, and the targeted software. Pulses can be exported as STIX, JSON, OpenloC, MAEC and CSV, and can be used to automatically update local security products.&lt;ref name=Security /&gt;  Users can up-vote and comment on specific pulses to assist others in identifying the most important threats.&lt;ref name=Enterprise /&gt;

OTX combines social contributions with automated machine-to-machine tools that integrates with major security products such as firewalls and perimeter security hardware.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch /&gt; The platform can read security report in .pdf, .csv, .json and other open formats. Relevant information is extracted automatically, assisting IT professionals to more readily analyze data.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch /&gt;

Specific OTX components include a dashboard with details about the top malicious IPs around the world and to check the status of specific IPs; notifications should an organization's IP or domain be found in a hacker forum, blacklist or be listed by in OTX; and a feature to review log files to determine if there has been communication with known malicious IPs.&lt;ref name=Hacker /&gt;

In 2016, AlienVault released a new version of OTX allowing participants to create private communities and discussions groups to share information on threats only within the group. The feature is intended to facilitate more in-depth discussions on specific threats, particular industries, and different regions of the world. Threat data from groups can also be distributed to subscribers of managed service providers using OTX."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaeger|first1=Jaclyn|title=AlienVault unveils latest edition of Open Threat Exchange|url=https://www.complianceweek.com/blogs/scuttlebutt/alienvault-unveils-latest-edition-of-open-threat-exchange#.V-QKgrW5y3F|accessdate=22 September 2016|work=Compliance Week|date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

OTX is a big data platform that integrates natural language processing and machine learning to facilitate the collection and correlation of data from many sources, including third-party threat feeds, websites, external API and local agents.&lt;ref name=betanews&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barker|first1=Ian|title=Open Threat Exchange brings a community approach to fighting attacks|url=http://betanews.com/2015/07/28/open-threat-exchange-brings-a-community-approach-to-fighting-attacks/|accessdate=8 November 2015|publisher=betanews|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1013">'''Orbicules''' (syn. [[Ubisch]] bodies, con-peito grains) are small acellular structures of [[sporopollenin]] (known size range from &lt; 1&amp;nbsp;µm to 15&amp;nbsp;µm, but usually sub-micrometre) that might occur on the inner tangential and radial walls of [[Tapetum (botany)|tapetal cells]]. Their function is unclear at this moment. Current consensus is that they are just a by-product of pollen wall sporopollenin synthesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3941">A '''parade of horribles''' is both a literal [[parade]] and a [[rhetorical device]].

==As a literal parade==
The phrase ''parade of horribles'' originally referred to a literal parade of people wearing comic and grotesque costumes, rather like the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] [[Mummers Parade]]. It was a traditional feature of [[Fourth of July]] parades in parts of the [[United States]] in the 19th century, and "Horribles Parades" continue to be part of the Independence Day celebration in several [[New England]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-8564729.html "Horribles Parades a weird tradition." ''The Boston Globe'', July 4, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1926 newspaper article about July the Fourth celebrations in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]] notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Old-time celebrations are to be held tomorrow at [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]], [[Lancaster, New Hampshire|Lancaster]], [[Colebrook, New Hampshire|Colebrook]], and [[Conway, New Hampshire|Conway]], with all the usual features of street parades of horribles and grotesques, brass bands, decorated automobiles and vehicles, exhibitions by fire departments, basket picnics in convenient groves...&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1926/07/04/archives/mountain-season-early-camp-and-stream-bring-many-visitors-to-new.html "Mountain Season Early. Camp and Stream Bring Many Visitors to New Hampshire Despite Coolness". ''The New York Times'', July 4, 1926, p. X8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Founded in 1926, the [[Ancient and Horribles Parade]] in [[Chepachet, Rhode Island]] continues this tradition.

Other rural New England towns, such as [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]] and [[Mendon, Massachusetts]] still hold annual Horribles Parades.&lt;ref&gt;http://uptondaily.com/2015/07/02/mendon-to-hold-horribles-parade/&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a rhetorical device==
A parade of horribles is also a [[rhetorical device]] whereby the speaker argues against taking a certain course of action by listing a number of extremely undesirable events which will ostensibly result from the action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DdU9NHiX3OcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Rhode+Island+Curiosities:+Quirky+Characters,+Roadside+Oddities+%26+Other+Offbeat+Stuff%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yeooTKmwO8O88gb3iL3EDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Brown, Seth. ''Rhode Island Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff'' (Globe Pequot, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotalone.com/article/6762.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017085117/http://www.enotalone.com/article/6762.html |archivedate=2010-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its power lies in the emotional impact of the unpleasant predictions; however, a parade of horribles can potentially be a [[fallacy]] if one or more of the following is true:
*The action doesn't actually change the likelihood of the "horribles" occurring. The "horribles" could be unlikely to occur even if the action is taken, or they could be likely to happen anyway even if the action is avoided. This is an [[appeal to probability]], and can be viewed as a [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]] insofar as the action has no causal relation to the "horribles". 
*The argument relies solely on the emotional impact of the "horribles" (an [[appeal to emotion]]).
*The "horribles" are not actually bad.
*The "horribles" have a low probability of occurring when compared to the high probability of good occurring.  

A parade of horribles is a type of [[hyperbole]], because it exaggerates the negative results of the action, arguing that "If we do this, ultimately all these horrible things will happen".

'''Portraits of the Apostles''' are a common theme in [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Portraits of the Apostles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous examples include the statue of [[Saint Peter]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]

[[File:Rome basilica st peter 011c.jpg|thumb|upright|The bronze statue of [[Saint Peter]], attributed to [[Arnolfo di Cambio]]|alt= Peter is shown as a bearded man in draped garment like a toga. He is seated on a chair made of marble, and has his right hand raised in a gesture of blessing while in his left hand he holds two large keys. Behind the statue, the wall is patterned in mosaic to resemble red and gold brocade cloth.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6246">Most real databases contain data whose correctness is uncertain. In order to work with such data, there is a need to quantify the integrity of the data. This is achieved by using probabilistic databases.

A '''probabilistic database''' is an [[uncertain database]] in which the [[possible worlds]] have associated [[probability|probabilities]]. Probabilistic [[database management system]]s are currently an active area of research. "While there are currently no commercial probabilistic database systems, several research prototypes exist..."&lt;ref&gt;Vinod Muthusamy, Haifeng Liu, Hans-Arno Jacobsen: [http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jacobsen/ptopss.pdf Predictive Publish/Subscribe Matching.] University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probabilistic databases distinguish between the [[logical data model]] and the physical representation of the data much like [[relational database]]s do in the [[ANSI-SPARC Architecture]].
In probabilistic databases this is even more crucial since such databases have to represent very large numbers of possible worlds, often exponential in the size of one world (a classical [[database]]), [[succinct data structure|succinctly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nilesh N. Dalvi]], [[Dan Suciu]]: Efficient query evaluation on probabilistic databases. VLDB J. 16(4): 523-544 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyublena Antova]], [[Christoph Koch]], [[Dan Olteanu]]: 10^(10^6) Worlds and Beyond: Efficient Representation and Processing of Incomplete Information. ICDE 2007: 606-615&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

In a probabilistic database, each data item←relation, tuple and value that an attribute can take—is associated with a probability ∈ (0,1], with 0 representing that the data is certainly incorrect, and 1 representing that it is certainly correct.

===Possible Worlds===

A probabilistic database could exist in multiple states. For example, if we are uncertain about the existence of a tuple in the database, then the database could be in two different states with respect to that tuple—the first state contains the tuple, while the second one does not. Similarly, if an attribute can take one of the values ''x'', ''y'' or ''z'', then the database can be in three different states with respect to that attribute.

Each of these ''states'' is called a possible world.

Consider the following database:

{| border=1 align=center
 |+ An Incomplete Database
 |-
 !A!!B
 |-
 |a1||b1
 |-
 |a2||b2
 |-
 |a3||{b3,b3′,b3′′}
 |-
 |}

&lt;small&gt;(Here ''{b3,b3′,b3′′}'' denotes that the attribute can take any of the values ''b3'',''b3′'' or ''b3′′'')&lt;/small&gt;

*Let us assume that we are uncertain about the first tuple, certain about the second tuple and uncertain about the value of attribute '''B''' in the third tuple.

Then the actual state of the database may or may not contain the first tuple (depending on whether it is correct or not). Similarly, the value of the attribute '''B''' may be ''b3'',''b3′'' or ''b3′′''.

Consequently, the possible worlds corresponding to the database are as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100" align=center
|+ World 1
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a1 ||align=center| b1
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 2
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a1 || align=center|b1
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3′
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 3
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a1 || align=center|b1
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3′′
|}
{{Clear}}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 4
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 5
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3′
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 6
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3′′
|}
{{Clear}}

===Types of Uncertainties===

There are essentially two kinds of uncertainties that could exist in a probabilistic database, as described in the table below:

{| border=1 align=center
|+ Types of Uncertainties
|-
! Tuple-level uncertainty !! Attribute-level uncertainty
|-
| Here, we are not sure if a tuple is correct or not, that is, whether it should exist in the database or not. || Here, we are not sure about the values that an attribute of a tuple can take, that is, it could take one of the several possible values. 
|-
| Corresponding to each uncertain tuple, there are two possible worlds: one which includes the tuple while the other which does not. || Corresponding to each uncertain attribute which can take one of the values ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', there are ''n'' possible worlds.
|-
| Tuple-level uncertainty can be seen as a boolean random variable associated with each uncertain tuple. || Attribute-level uncertainty can be seen as a random variable associated with each uncertain attribute which can take values ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.
|}

By assigning values to random variables associated with the data items, we can represent different possible worlds.

[[File:Europe20000ya.png|thumb|European [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia]], 20 [[Year#Abbreviations yr and ya|kya]].]]

In biology, a '''refugium''' (plural: ''refugia'') is a location which supports an isolated or [[relict (biology)|relict]] [[population]] of a once more widespread species. This isolation ([[allopatry]]) can be due to climatic changes, geography, or human activities such as [[deforestation]] and overhunting.

Present examples of refuge species are the [[mountain gorilla]], isolated to specific mountains in central Africa, and the [[Australian sea lion]], isolated to specific breeding beaches along the south-west coast of Australia, due to humans taking so many of their number as game.  This resulting isolation, in many cases, can be seen as only a temporary state; however, some refugia may be longstanding, thereby having many [[endemic species]], not found elsewhere, which survive as relict populations. The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool has been proposed to be a longstanding refugium, based on the discovery of the "living fossil" of a marine [[dinoflagellate]] called ''Dapsilidinium pastielsii'', currently found in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mertens | first1=K.N. | last2=Takano | first2=Y. | last3=Head | first3=M.J. | last4=Matsuoka | first4=K. | year=2014 | title=Living fossils in the Indo-Pacific warm pool: A refuge for thermophilic dinoflagellates during glaciations | doi=10.1130/G35456.1 | journal=Geology | volume= 42| issue=| pages= 531–534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]], ''refugia'' often refers specifically to [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia]], where some ancestral human populations may have been forced back to [[Glacial refugium|glacial refugia]], similar small isolated pockets in the face of the continental [[ice sheet]]s during the [[Last glacial maximum|last glacial period]]. Going from west to east, suggested examples include the [[Franco-Cantabrian region]] (in northern [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]]), the [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Balkan]] peninsulas, the [[Ukrainian LGM refuge]], and the [[Bering Land Bridge]]. Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic humans survived the glacial maxima (incl. the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]) in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense [[forest cover]].&lt;ref name=Gavashelishvili23&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gavashelishvili, A. |author2=Tarkhnishvili, D. |year=2016 |title= Biomes and human distribution during the last ice age |journal= Global Ecology and Biogeography |doi=10.1111/geb.12437 |volume=25 |pages=563–574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speciation ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Refugia.png|thumb|250px|Proposed Amazonian refugia and modern distribution of the ''[[Selenidera]]'' toucanets. From Haffer, 1969]] --&gt;

As an example of a locale refugia study, [[Jürgen Haffer]] first proposed the concept of refugia to explain the [[biological diversity]] of bird populations in the [[Amazonian river basin]]. Haffer suggested that climatic change in the late [[Pleistocene]] led to reduced reservoirs of habitable forests in which populations become allopatric. Over time, that  led to [[speciation]]: populations of the same species that found themselves in different refugia evolved differently, creating [[parapatric]] [[sister species|sister-species]]. As the Pleistocene ended, the arid conditions gave way to the present humid rainforest environment, reconnecting the refugia.

Scholars have since expanded the idea of this mode of speciation and used it to explain population patterns in other areas of the world, such as [[Africa]], [[Eurasia]], and [[North America]]. Theoretically, current biogeographical patterns can be used to infer past refugia: if several unrelated species follow concurrent [[Range (biology)|range]] patterns, the area may have been a refugium. Moreover, the current distribution of [[species]] with narrow ecological requirements tend to be associated with the spatial position of glacial refugia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01788.x | volume=105 | title=Palaeoclimatic models help to understand current distribution of Caucasian forest species | year=2011 | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | pages=231–248 | last1 = Tarkhnishvili | first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simple environment examples of temperature==
One can provide a simple explanation of refugia involving core temperatures and exposure to sunlight. In the [[northern hemisphere]], north-facing sites on hills or mountains, and places at higher elevations count as ''cold sites''. The reverse are sun- or heat-exposed, lower-elevation, south-facing sites: ''hot sites''. (The opposite directions apply in the [[southern hemisphere]].) Each site becomes a refugium, one as a "cold-surviving refugium" and the other as a "hot-surviving refugium". Canyons with deep hidden areas (the opposite of hillsides, mountains, mesas, etc. or other exposed areas) lead to these separate types of refugia.

A concept not often referenced is that of "sweepstakes colonization":&lt;ref name="science-FotP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-Guinea" /&gt; when a dramatic ecological event occurs, for example a meteor strike, and global, multiyear effects occur. The sweepstake-winning species happens to already be living in a fortunate site, and their environment is rendered even more advantageous, as opposed to the "losing" species, which immediately fails to reproduce.&lt;ref name="science-FotP"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/320/5882/1450.abstract | title=Forests of the Past: A Window to Future Changes |author1=Petit, Rémy J |author2=Hu, Feng Sheng |author3=Dick, Christopher W. | journal=Science | year=2008 | volume=320 | issue=5882 | pages=1450–1452 | doi=10.1126/science.1155457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-Guinea"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/guinea_islands/ | title=Gulf of Guinea Islands Biodiversity Project | publisher=California Academy of Sciences | date=10 April 2001 | accessdate=26 April 2016 |author1=Penny, Norman D |author2=Penny, Fabio R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11813">'''Spectral regularization''' is any of a class of [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] techniques used in [[machine learning]] to control the impact of noise and prevent [[overfitting]]. Spectral regularization can be used in a broad range of applications, from deblurring images to classifying emails into a spam folder and a non-spam folder. For instance, in the email classification example, spectral regularization can be used to reduce the impact of noise and prevent overfitting when a machine learning system is being trained on a labeled set of emails to learn how to tell a spam and a non-spam email apart.

Spectral regularization algorithms rely on methods that were originally defined and studied in the theory of [[Ill-posed problem|ill-posed]] [[inverse problem]]s (for instance, see&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz Engl|H. W. Engl]], M. Hanke, and A. Neubauer. ''Regularization of inverse problems''. Kluwer, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;) focusing on the inversion of a linear operator (or a matrix) that possibly has a bad [[condition number]] or an unbounded inverse. In this context, regularization amounts to substituting the original operator by a bounded operator called the "regularization operator" that has a condition number controlled by a regularization parameter,&lt;ref name="rosasco"&gt;L. Lo Gerfo, L. Rosasco, F. Odone, E. De Vito, and A. Verri. Spectral Algorithms for Supervised Learning, ''Neural Computation'', 20(7), 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; a classical example being [[Tikhonov regularization]]. To ensure stability, this regularization parameter is tuned based on the level of noise.&lt;ref name="rosasco" /&gt; The main idea behind spectral regularization is that each regularization operator can be described using spectral calculus as an appropriate filter on the eigenvalues of the operator that defines the problem, and the role of the filter is to "suppress the oscillatory behavior corresponding to small eigenvalues".&lt;ref name="rosasco" /&gt; Therefore, each algorithm in the class of spectral regularization algorithms is defined by a suitable filter function (which needs to be derived for that particular algorithm). Three of the most commonly used regularization algorithms for which spectral filtering is well-studied are Tikhonov regularization, [[Landweber iteration]], and [[Singular value decomposition#Reduced SVDs|truncated singular value decomposition]] (TSVD). As for choosing the regularization parameter, examples of candidate methods to compute this parameter include the discrepancy principle, generalized [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross validation]], and the L-curve criterion.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Hansen, J. G. Nagy, and D. P. O'Leary. ''Deblurring Images: Matrices, Spectra, and Filtering'', Fundamentals of Algorithms 3, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is of note that the notion of spectral filtering studied in the context of machine learning is closely connected to the literature on [[function approximation]] (in signal processing).

== Notation ==
The training set is defined as &lt;math&gt;S = \{(x_1, y_1), \dots , (x_n, y_n)\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n \times d&lt;/math&gt; input matrix and &lt;math&gt;Y = (y_1,\dots,y_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the output vector. Where applicable, the kernel function is denoted by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; kernel matrix is denoted by &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; which has entries &lt;math&gt;K_{ij} = k(x_i,x_j)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[RKHS|Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space]] (RKHS) with kernel &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The regularization parameter is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

''(Note: For &lt;math&gt;g \in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \in F&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; being Hilbert spaces, given a linear, continuous operator &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, assume that &lt;math&gt;g = Lf&lt;/math&gt; holds. In this setting, the direct problem would be to solve for &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the inverse problem would be to solve for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. If the solution exists, is unique and stable, the inverse problem (i.e. the problem of solving for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) is well-posed; otherwise, it is ill-posed.) ''

== Relation to the theory of ill-posed inverse problems ==
The connection between the regularized least squares (RLS) estimation problem (Tikhonov regularization setting) and the theory of ill-posed inverse problems is an example of how spectral regularization algorithms are related to the theory of ill-posed inverse problems.

The RLS estimator solves

: &lt;math&gt; \min_{f\in\mathcal{H}} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-f(x_i))^2+\lambda \|f\|^2_\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;

and the RKHS allows for expressing this RLS estimator as &lt;math&gt;f_S^\lambda (X)=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i k(x,x_i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;(K+n\lambda I)c=Y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c=(c_1,\dots,c_n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;L. Rosasco. Lecture 6 of the Lecture Notes for 9.520: Statistical Learning Theory and Applications. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Fall 2013. Available at http://www.mit.edu/~9.520/fall13/slides/class06/class06_RLSSVM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The penalization term is used for controlling smoothness and preventing overfitting. Since the solution of empirical risk minimization &lt;math&gt; \min_{f\in\mathcal{H}} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-f(x_i))^2&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;f_S^{\lambda}(X)=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i k(x,x_i)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Kc=Y&lt;/math&gt;, adding the penalty function amounts to the following change in the system that needs to be solved:&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;L. Rosasco. Lecture 7 of the Lecture Notes for 9.520: Statistical Learning Theory and Applications. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Fall 2013. Available at http://www.mit.edu/~9.520/fall13/slides/class07/class07_spectral.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\bigg\{ \min_{f\in\mathcal{H}} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-f(x_i))^2\rightarrow \min_{f\in\mathcal{H}} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-f(x_i))^2+\lambda \|f\|^2_\mathcal{H}\bigg\}\equiv \bigg\{Kc=Y\rightarrow (K+n\lambda I)c=Y\bigg\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this learning setting, the kernel matrix can be decomposed as &lt;math&gt;K = Q\Sigma Q^T&lt;/math&gt;, with

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \operatorname{diag}(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n),~\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \cdots \geq \sigma_n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;q_1,\dots,q_n&lt;/math&gt; are the corresponding eigenvectors. Therefore, in the initial learning setting, the following holds:

: &lt;math&gt;c=K^{-1}Y=Q\Sigma^{-1}Q^TY=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sigma_i} \langle q_i,Y \rangle q_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for small eigenvalues, even small perturbations in the data can lead to considerable changes in the solution. Hence, the problem is ill-conditioned, and solving this RLS problem amounts to stabilizing a possibly ill-conditioned matrix inversion problem, which is studied in the theory of ill-posed inverse problems; in both problems, a main concern is to deal with the issue of numerical stability.

== Implementation of algorithms ==
Each algorithm in the class of spectral regularization algorithms is defined by a suitable filter function, denoted here by &lt;math&gt;G_{\lambda}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;. If the Kernel matrix is denoted by &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; should control the magnitude of the smaller eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;G_{\lambda}(K)&lt;/math&gt;. In a filtering setup, the goal is to find estimators &lt;math&gt;f_S^{\lambda}(X):=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i k(x,x_i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c=G_{\lambda}(K)Y&lt;/math&gt;. To do so, a scalar filter function &lt;math&gt;G_\lambda(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is defined using the eigen-decomposition of the kernel matrix:

: &lt;math&gt;G_\lambda(K)=QG_{\lambda}(\Sigma)Q^T,&lt;/math&gt;

which yields

: &lt;math&gt;G_{\lambda}(K)Y~=~\sum_{i=1}^{n}G_{\lambda}(\sigma_i) \langle q_i,Y\rangle q_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Typically, an appropriate filter function should have the following properties:&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt;

1. As &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; goes to zero, &lt;math&gt;G_\lambda (\sigma)~\rightarrow ~1/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

2. The magnitude of the (smaller) eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;G_{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is controlled by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

While the above items give a rough characterization of the general properties of filter functions for all spectral regularization algorithms, the derivation of the filter function (and hence its exact form) varies depending on the specific regularization method that spectral filtering is applied to.

=== Filter function for Tikhonov regularization ===
In the Tikhonov regularization setting, the filter function for RLS is described below. As shown in,&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt; in this setting, &lt;math&gt;c=(K+n\lambda I)^{-1}Y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,

: &lt;math&gt;c=(K+n\lambda I)^{-1}Y=Q(\Sigma+n\lambda I)^{-1}Q^T Y=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sigma_i+n\lambda}&lt;q_i,Y&gt;q_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The undesired components are filtered out using regularization:
* If &lt;math&gt;\sigma \gg \lambda n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sigma_i+n\lambda} \sim  \frac{1}{\sigma_i}&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;\sigma \ll \lambda n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sigma_i+n\lambda} \sim \frac{1}{\lambda n}&lt;/math&gt;.
The filter function for Tikhonov regularization is therefore defined as:&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;G_\lambda (\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma+n\lambda }.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Filter function for Landweber iteration ===
The idea behind the Landweber iteration is [[gradient descent]]:&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;c^0 =0 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{for } i=1,\dots,t-1 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;~~~~~          c^i=c^{i-1}+\eta(Y-Kc^{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{end} &lt;/math&gt;

In this setting, if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is larger than &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;'s largest eigenvalue, the above iteration converges by choosing &lt;math&gt;\eta = 2/n&lt;/math&gt; as the step-size:.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt; The above iteration is equivalent to minimizing &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}||Y-Kc||_2^2&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the empirical risk) via gradient descent; using induction, it can be proved that at the &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-th iteration, the solution is given by  &lt;ref name="AA" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;c=\eta\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}(I-\eta K)^iY.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the appropriate filter function is defined by:

&lt;math&gt;G_\lambda(\sigma)=\eta\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}(I-\eta\sigma)^i. &lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that this filter function corresponds to a truncated power expansion of &lt;math&gt;K^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt; to see this, note that the relation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\geq0} x^i = 1/(1 - x)&lt;/math&gt;, would still hold if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by a matrix; thus, if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (the kernel matrix), or rather &lt;math&gt;I - \eta K&lt;/math&gt;, is considered, the following holds:

: &lt;math&gt;K^{-1}=\eta\sum_{i=0}^\infty (I-\eta K)^i \sim \eta\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}(I-\eta K)^i.&lt;/math&gt;

In this setting, the number of iterations gives the regularization parameter; roughly speaking, &lt;math&gt;t \sim 1/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt; If &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is large, overfitting may be a concern. If &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is small, oversmoothing may be a concern. Thus, choosing an appropriate time for early stopping of the iterations provides a regularization effect.

=== Filter function for TSVD ===
In the TSVD setting, given the eigen-decomposition &lt;math&gt;K = Q\Sigma Q^T&lt;/math&gt; and using a prescribed threshold &lt;math&gt;\lambda n&lt;/math&gt;, a regularized inverse can be formed for the kernel matrix by discarding all the eigenvalues that are smaller than this threshold.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt;
Thus, the filter function for TSVD can be defined as

: &lt;math&gt;G_\lambda(\sigma) =\left\{\begin{array}[c]{lcll}1/\sigma &amp; ,&amp; \text{if }\sigma\geq\lambda n\\[0.05in]0&amp;,&amp; \text{otherwise}\\[0.05in]\end{array}\right..&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that TSVD is equivalent to the (unsupervised) projection of the data using (kernel) [[Principal component analysis|Principal Component Analysis]] (PCA), and that it is also equivalent to minimizing the empirical risk on the projected data (without regularization).&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt; Note that the number of components kept for the projection is the only free parameter here.

'''Religiocentrism''' or '''religio-centrism''' is defined ([[Raymond Corsini|Corsini]] 1999:827) as the "conviction that a person's own religion is more important or superior to other religions." In analogy to [[ethnocentrism]], religiocentrism is a [[value-neutral]] term for psychological [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]].

==Terminology==
The [[neologism]] ''religiocentrism'' combines ''[[wikt:religio-|religio-]]'' (e.g., [[wikt:religiophobia|religiophobia]]) and ''[[wikt:-centrism|-centrism]]'' (e.g., [[Eurocentrism]]). [[Derivation (linguistics)|Derivations]] include ''religiocentric'' or ''religio-centric''.

Although the precise origins of ''religiocentrism'' and ''religiocentric'' remain unclear, the words have been used since the early 20th century. The American economist Adrian Augustus Holtz (1917:15) described how early German school reforms were "carried on in a way that allowed for a religio-centric educational system." [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920:307) said, "Maud Dyer was neurotic, religiocentric, faded; her emotions were moist, and her figure was unsystematic."

The related term ''[[Christocentric]]'' theologically means "forms of Christianity that concentrate on the teaching of [[Jesus Christ]]", but is sometimes used as a near [[synonym]] of ''religiocentric''. For instance (Hamilton 2002), "No matter where it appears, government-sponsored Christocentrism, or even religiocentrism, undermines this nation's ideals."

==Academic studies==
Religiocentrism is commonly discussed in contexts of [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[anthropology]].

The Australian social psychologists John J. Ray and Dianne Doratis defined religiocentrism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ethnocentrism" is the social scientist's value-neutral term for ethnic or racial prejudice. It refers to ethnically-based sentiments of exclusiveness without any implication of their moral worth or justifiability... By analogy, the term religiocentrism is derived here to mean ''religiously'' based sentiments of exclusiveness—beliefs that one should marry within one's own religion, work with members of one's own religion, and in general prefer members of one's own religion above others. This will also entail ''ipso facto'' devaluative judgments of other religions. (1971:170)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ray and Doratis designed a groundbreaking attitude scale to measure religiocentrism and ethnocentrism. Their religiocentrism scale comprises 33 items (for instance, "I think my religion is nearer to the truth than any other" and "Most Moslems, Buddhists and Hindus are very stupid and ignorant"), with five-point [[Likert scale]] psychometric response options from "Strongly agree" (Scored 5) to "Strongly disagree" (1). To verify [[internal consistency]] among respondents, 11 items were reverse scored ("It makes no difference to me what religion my friends are" is the converse of "I think that it's better if you stick to friends of the same religion as your own"), resulting in a [[Kuder–Richardson Formula 20|reliability coefficient]] of .88 among 154 first-year university students. The authors tested attitudes among Australian fifth-form students in two Catholic and two public schools, and discovered that neither ethnocentrism nor religiocentrism showed any correlation with religious background. Ray and Doratis concluded (1971:178), "Ethnocentrism, religiocentrism and religious conservatism were all shown to be separate and distinct factors of attitudes in their own right. They are not just three aspects of the one thing. Religiocentric people do however tend to be both religiously conservative and ethnocentric."

The Hungarian-Jewish historian and anthropologist [[Raphael Patai]] mentions religiocentrism as a variable in relationships between religion and culture, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Each religion also has a definite outlook on its own value in relation to that of other religions. Its relationship to other religions may range from complete toleration to the complete lack of it, with a corresponding range of self-evaluation. This variable, best called religio-centrism (on the analogy of ethnocentrism), can serve as an additional avenue of approach to the study of our subject. (1954:234)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparing Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and Western cultures, Patai finds,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion in the Far East is characterized by the absence of religio-centrism: there is a marked toleration of other religions and a mutual borrowing and influencing; in the Middle East and in the West there is a high degree of religio-centrism, with intolerance and scorn of other religions: each religion is exclusive and regards itself as the "one and only" true faith. (1954:252)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a later survey of the potentials for world peace, Patai differentiated the major modern religions between "theistic" and "nontheistic".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The three great monotheistic religions of the Middle East and the West, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, are the foremost theistic religions and the dominant faiths of about one half of mankind. Common to all theistic religions is a pronounced religiocentrism, expressed most poignantly in the conviction that one's own religion is the one and only true one, and that all the other faiths are erroneous and hence depreciable. In this conviction were rooted the great religious wars which pitted, not only Muslims against Christians, but also various Muslim sects against one another, and likewise made various Christian denominations bitter enemies... The situation is more hopeful in the great nontheistic religions of South, Southeast, and East Asia. These religions, notably Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, lack the element of self-assurance and certainty that each is the exclusive possessor of the only truth. (1987:24-25)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response, [[Andrew Wilson (academic)|Andrew Wilson]], Professor of Scriptural Studies of the [[Unification Theological Seminary]], criticized Patai's opinion as theologically plausible but historically erroneous, citing examples (1987:28) of "rampant communal violence between Hindus and Buddhists in Sri Lanka and between Sikhs and Hindus in India."

Religiocentrism has a specialized meaning for sociologists (Chalfant, Beckley, and Palmer 1994:51). "This term is related to a common word used in sociological literature, ''ethnocentrism''. Similarly, we might refer to feelings of rightness and superiority resulting from religious affiliation as ''religiocentrism''. Religiocentrism inhibits the ability of a society to achieve adaptation, integration and goal-attainment."

[[Mohammed Abu-Nimer]], the Director of the Peacebuilding and Development Institute at [[American University]], distinguishes between religiocentrism and "religiorelativism".
&lt;blockquote&gt;A religiorelative person is firm in his/her belief that other religions have the right to exist and be practiced, even if such norms and beliefs are contradictory to one's own set of religious beliefs. Such a person is prone not to engage in violence or discriminatory actions against the others. In contrast, a religiocentric person is a believer who denies other religions' "truth" and who holds an absolute truth that leaves no room for different religious practices. Such a person becomes more prone to dehumanize, exclude, and discriminate against other religious groups and individuals. Often, as a result of negative and destructive exposure and experience with conflict and war, religiocentric beliefs not only are exacerbated and easily translated into violence against the enemy (that is, the different other), but also actually grow and prohibit human and peaceful contact with the other. However, there are conflict resolution and peace-building activities and forums that can assist peace workers in such settings to transform a religiocentric into a religiorelative believer. (2004:497)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abu-Nimer (2004:479-501) analyzes three typical reactions of a religiocentric person to another religion: [[denial]] (e.g., Israel not allowing Arabs to purchase or use state land), [[defense mechanisms]] ("There is no salvation outside the Church"), and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] ("We are all the children of God").

'''Sex for Fish''' sometimes referred to as "Fish for Sex" is a phenomenon in which female traders engage in sexual relationships with fishermen to secure their supply of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2007.05.010 |title=Women and Fish-for-Sex: Transactional Sex, HIV/AIDS and Gender in African Fisheries |year=2008 |last1=Béné |first1=Christophe |last2=Merten |first2=Sonja |journal=World Development |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=875–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women fish traders are often pressured into having sex with the fishermen who supply them with daily fresh fish. Along the beaches where the sex for fish practices have been observed, the fishermen do maintain several transactional sexual relationships with women at different beaches where they land with their fish.
 
Sex for Fish as a phenomenon is common in many low and middle income developing countries; however, the bulk cases have been observed in Sub-Saharan Africa’s inland fisheries. The most vulnerable victims are economically disadvantaged women, e.g. single or divorced women as well as widows residing in along the shores of inland fisheries centers.

Several social-economic factors including poverty, cultural practices, and competition among women who are involved in fish trade are often listed as variables fueling the sex for fish practice. There is no conclusive research that shows what promotes sex for fish practice, however, fishermen seem to be taking advantage of stiff competition between the women who trade in fish to demand sexual favors in exchange for the fish. The men or the trader who receives sexual favors would grant preferential sale and sale at reduced prices to these women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cg7UT6fBpk |title=Sex for Fish - Kenya |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the shores of [[Lake Victoria]] in [[Kenya]], women have been observed giving out empty polythene bags to the fishermen before they go out fishing at night or early morning, and when the fishermen return, some of the best catch would be set aside for them, stashed in these bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/aeap.2013.25.3.216 |title=Jaboyavs.Jakambi: Status, Negotiation, and HIV Risks Among Female Migrants in the "Sex for Fish" Economy in Nyanza Province, Kenya |year=2013 |last1=Camlin |first1=Carol S. |last2=Kwena |first2=Zachary A. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Shari L. |journal=AIDS Education and Prevention |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=216–31 |pmid=23631716 |pmc=3717412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fishermen take advantage of these economically and social disadvantaged women by offering preferential treatment in fish business in exchange for sex.

==Poverty==
In Kenya where sex for fish has been well documented, poverty among the fishing communities has been constantly listed as factors contributing to the practice of sex for fish. Sex for fish practice in Kenya is popularly referred to as Jaboya system. Jaboya in Luo tribe dialect means customer, however, due to the transactional involvement of fishermen with women fish traders, the locals coined the term Jaboya system to refer to sex for fish phenomenon. Fishmongers in lake side city of [[Kisumu]], have sex with fishermen to get stock to sell in order to make a living. They have alluded to having children to feed and having to pay rent and school fees as drivers for exchange of sex for fish. In Kenya’s third largest city of Kisumu, Dunga Beach along the shores of Lake Victoria young girls have become the new attraction for fishermen who use their fish catch as a bait to lure these vulnerable group into sex for fish practice fees.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/country/ke/kenya |title=IRIN &amp;#124; Africa &amp;#124; East Africa &amp;#124; Kenya |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of poverty and vulnerable ensures that older women introduces their younger daughters or orphaned girls to sex for fish trade. In return the young girl sleeps with the fisherman that offers the best deal. In many cases the young girls do have sex with multiple partners and are exposed to STD’s and potentially HIV infections.&lt;ref name="irinnews1" /&gt;

==Exploitation of gay men==
In September 2012, a Kenyan TV station reported incidents where gay men exchange sex for fish. This occurs due to poor catch or for money. The economically weak gay men have been become the latest group to be involved in sex for fish within the fishing communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://identitykenya.com/index.php/daily-news/709-anal-sex-for-fish-in-kisumu-the-invisible-bridge-final-part |title=Anal Sex For Fish In Kisumu: The Invisible Bridge Final Part |publisher=Identitykenya.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217090019/http://identitykenya.com/index.php/daily-news/709-anal-sex-for-fish-in-kisumu-the-invisible-bridge-final-part |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS prevalence==
Some of the earliest recorded cases of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Africa were in fishing communities around Lake Victoria in 1982. Several studies have shown a link between sex for fish phenomenon and higher HIV prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qui1whVeqX4 |title=Sex for fish: How fishing is fueling the spread of HIV/Aids in Homabay |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-12-26 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kenya]], it is assumed that ‘Sex for Fish’ contributes to the high HIV/AIDS prevalence along the lake region, where it is double the national average.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtzpsda.co.ke/download.php?filename=psda_downloads/_Menn%20%20Anyango_vf.pdf&amp;name=_Menn%20%20Anyango_vf.pdf |title=Omena fishery and 'Sex for Fish' at Lake Victoria |publisher=Gtzpsda.co.ke |accessdate=2013-11-23 |author=Dr. Iris Menn and Elizabeth Anyango}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya Modes of Transmission Study 2008 had put prevalence in the fishing communities at between 25 percent and 30 percent in Nyanza province in Kenya.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt; This prevalence level was double Nyanza province in general infection rate of 15.3 percent, which was nearly the national average. The effect of HIV transmission is made worse by the fact that these women have no control over the use of condoms as a preventive measure against the spread of the HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

In [[Uganda]], studies conducted around [[Lake George (Uganda)|Lake George]] and [[Lake Edward]] by the [[Uganda Fisheries and Fish Conservation Association]] (UFFCA), found that the HIV/AIDS prevalence average rate was at 22.4 percent against the national prevalence of 7.3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancap.org/en/news-global/1723-uganda-sex-for-fish-common-as-hiv-reaches-22-percent.html |title=Uganda: 'Sex for Fish' Common As HIV Reaches 22 Percent |publisher=Pancap.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex for fish is considered by many leaders and researchers as one of the reasons that have led to higher than average HIV/AIDS prevalence amongst these fisher communities.

In [[Mangochi]], [[Malawi]], sex is a vibrant part of fishing and research has shown a strong link between HIV prevalence and sex for fish trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7448/IAS.15.3.17364 |title=Transactional sex and HIV: Understanding the gendered structural drivers of HIV in fishing communities in Southern Malawi |year=2012 |last1=MacPherson |first1=Eleanor E |last2=Sadalaki |first2=John |last3=Njoloma |first3=Macdonald |last4=Nyongopa |first4=Victoria |last5=Nkhwazi |first5=Lawrence |last6=Mwapasa |first6=Victor |last7=Lalloo |first7=David G |last8=Desmond |first8=Nicola |last9=Seeley |first9=Janet |last10=Theobald |first10=Sally |journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society |volume=15 |issue=3 Suppl 1 |pmid=22713352 |pages=1–9 |pmc=3499929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactional sex is common in Malawian fishing communities, with women identified as vulnerable in negotiations because of existing gendered power structures.  Men carrying out the fishing, therefore men controls factors of production, and women processing, drying and selling the fish. The control of factors of production by men, the power dynamics in these exchanges favour men and make it more difficult for women to negotiate safe sex.
The Malawian NGO, [[Youth Net and Counselling]] (YONECO) that works to combat the spread of HIV infection in Malawi, observed that despite increased awareness on HIV and AIDS in Malawi, fishermen on Lake Chilwa are queuing for sex. This was disclosed by fishermen who were trained by YONECO as peer educators during a monitoring visit the organization made to Mposa in Machinga district. The reports indicate that a total of 25 fishermen would line up to have sex with one woman in exchange of 15 dozen fish if no condom is used during sexual intercourse or 3 dozen fish if a condom is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7WF4OJaG0#t=82]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kafue Flats]] region of [[Zambia]] sex for fish exchange increased the spread of HIV/AIDS rapidly between the years 2002-2005.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Interventions==

===U.S. Peace Corps===
In 2010, two [[Peace Corps]] volunteers, Dominik Mucklow and Michael Geilhufe who lived near Lake Victoria decided to do something to help the women who were trapped in sex for fish practice. With support from the U.S. [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) funding, they assisted a group of women fish traders to acquire their own fishing boats. The women then employed men to go fishing using these boats. This simple advancement allowed women to be free from sexual exploitation in order to secure their fish supply.&lt;ref name="worldconnect-us1"&gt;{{cite web|author=World Connect, US |url=http://www.worldconnect-us.org/discoverprojects/sex-fish-nyamware/ |title=No Sex for Fish: Nyamware &amp;#124; World Connect |publisher=Worldconnect-us.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No sex for fish aimed to change the work dynamic between the women and the men who make their living from the fishing industry by giving women ownership of the means of production, boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/94497/Kenya-Helping-Wowen-to-end-sex-for-fish-culture |title=IRIN Africa &amp;#124; KENYA: Helping women to end sex-for-fish culture &amp;#124; Kenya &amp;#124; Economy &amp;#124; Gender Issues &amp;#124; HIV/AIDS (PlusNews) &amp;#124; Prevention - PlusNews |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women own the boats, as the women work they repay the cost of building the boat, then the boat repayment money is pooled to construct more boats; increasing the number of women involved. The pilot project was managed by the [[Victoria Institute for Research on Environment and Development]] (Vired).&lt;ref name="worldconnect-us1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26186194 Kenya's battle to end 'sex for fish' trade], BBC News, Mark Lowen, 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merlin===
An organization that brings together local leaders and community members, Merlin has created several theatre groups in Western Kenya that perform skits and plays that deal with the issues that the sex for fish (Jaboya System) practice brings. The shows take place once per month, and coincide with the return of the fishermen to the beach. The shows typically draw large crowds on the beach, and end with a discussion, as well as condom distribution to the fishermen. Local people believe that the shows are getting the local community to change their thinking about the Jaboya system, and ultimately their behaviour as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Okwiri|first=Caroline|title=Jaboya System|url=http://www.jaluo.com/wangwach/1106/Caroline_Okwiri111506.html|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Deadly Catch'' film==
''Deadly Catch'' is a film that was produced by [[IRIN]] that centers around the fishing community located outside of [[Bondo, Kenya]]. It shows how the HIV virus has affected different people in various ways, focusing on those both directly involved with the jaboya system, and those that have lost family members due to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KENYA: Deadly Catch: Lake Victoria's AIDS crisis|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=61001|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=IRIN|date=10 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of  "[[microscopy|television microscopy]]", the forerunner of telepathology, did not require that a pathologist have physical or virtual "hands-on" involvement in the selection of microscopic fields-of-view for analysis and diagnosis.

An [[academic]] pathologist, [[Ronald S. Weinstein]], M.D., coined the term "telepathology" in 1986.  In a [[medical journal]] [[editorial]], Weinstein outlined the actions that would be needed to create remote pathology diagnostic services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Weinstein  | first = RS | title = Prospects for telepathology (Editorial) | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 1986 | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 433–434|doi=10.1016/s0046-8177(86)80028-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his collaborators published the first scientific paper on robotic telepathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Weinstein | first = RS | last2 = Bloom | first2 = KJ | last3 = Rozek | first3 = LS | title = Telepathology and the networking of pathology diagnostic services | journal = Arch Pathol Lab Med | volume = 111 | issue = 7 | year = 1987 | pages = 646–652| pmid = 3606341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein was also granted the first [[United States|U.S.]] [[patents]] for [[robotics|robotic]] telepathology systems and telepathology diagnostic networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kayser | first = K | last2 = Szymas | first2 = J | last3 = Weinstein | first3 = RS | title = Telepathology: Telecommunications, Electronic Education and Publication in Pathology | year = 1999 | pages = 1–186 | publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein is known to many as the "father of telepathology".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://archive.is/20120805232102/http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8942 | title=ReUnion '10 award winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norway]], Eide and Nordrum implemented the first sustainable clinical telepathology service in 1989;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Nordrum | first = I | last2 = Engum | first2 = B | last3 = Rinde | first3 = E | title = Remote frozen section service: A telepathology project to northern Norway. | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 1991 | pages = 514–518 | volume = 1991|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is still in operation decades later. A number of clinical telepathology services have benefited many thousands of patients in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]].

Telepathology has been successfully used for many applications, including the rendering of [[histopathology]] tissue diagnoses at a distance. Although [[digital pathology]] imaging, including [[virtual microscopy]], is the mode of choice for telepathology services in developed countries, [[Analog signal|analog]] telepathology imaging is still used for patient services in some developing countries.

== Types of systems ==

Telepathology systems are divided into three major types: static image-based systems, [[real-time systems]], and [[virtual slide]] systems.

Static image systems have the benefit of being the most reasonably priced and usable systems.  They have the significant drawback in only being able to capture a selected subset of [[microscopic]] fields for off-site evaluation.

Real-time robotic microscopy systems and virtual slides allow a consultant pathologist the opportunity to evaluate histopathology slides in their entirety, from a distance. With real-time systems, the consultant actively operates a robotically controlled motorized [[microscope]] located at a distant site—changing focus, illumination, magnification, and field of view—at will.  Either an analog video camera or a digital video camera can be used for robotic microscopy. Another form of real-time microscopy involves utilizing a high resolution video camera mounted on a path lab microscope to send live digital video of a slide to a large computer monitor at the pathologist's remote location via encrypted store-and-forward software.  An echo-cancelling microphone at each end of the video conference allows the pathologist to communicate with the person moving the slide under the microscope.

[[Virtual slide]] systems utilize automated digital slide scanners that create a digital image file of an entire glass slide (whole slide image).  This file is stored on a computer server and can be navigated at a distance, over the [[Internet]], using a browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kayser | first = K | last2 = Molnar | first2 = B | last3 = Weinstein | first3 = RS | title = Digital pathology virtual slide technology in tissue-based diagnosis, research and education. | journal = VSV Interdisciplinary Medical Publishing | year = 2006 | pages = 1–193 | issue = Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital imaging]] is required for virtual microscopy.

While real-time and virtual slide systems offer higher diagnostic accuracy when compared with static-image telepathology, there are drawbacks to each. Real-time systems perform best on [[local area network]]s (LANs), but performance may suffer if employed during periods of high network traffic or using the Internet proper as a backbone. Expense is an issue with real-time systems and virtual slide systems as they can be costly.  Virtual slide telepathology is emerging as the technology of choice for telepathology services.  However, high throughput virtual slide scanners (those producing one virtual slide or more per minute) are currently expensive.  Also, virtual slide digital files are relatively large, often exceeding one [[gigabyte]] in size.  Storing and simultaneously retrieving large numbers of telepathology whole-slide image files can be cumbersome, introducing their own workflow challenges in the clinical laboratory.

== Uses and benefits ==

Telepathology is currently being used for a wide spectrum of clinical applications including diagnosing of [[frozen section]] [[Laboratory specimen|specimens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Evans | first = AJ | last2 = Chetty | first2 = R | last3 = Clarke | first3 = BA | last4 = Croul | first4 = S | last5 = Ghazarian | first5 = DM | last6 = Kiehl | first6 = TR | last7 = Ordonez | first7 = BP | last8 = Ilaalagan | first8 = S | last9 = Asa | first9 = SL | title = Primary frozen section diagnosis by robotic microscopy and virtual slide telepathology: the University Health Network experience | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 2009 | pages= 1069–1081 | volume = 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; primary [[histopathology]] diagnoses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dunn | first = BE | last2 = Choi | first2 = H | last3 = Recla | first3 = DL | last4 = Kerr  | first4 = SE | last5 = Wagenman | first5 = BL | title = Robotic surgical telepathology between the Iron Mountain and Milwaukee Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers: a 12-year experience | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 2009 | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages= 1092–1099| pmid = 19552935 | doi = 10.1016/j.humpath.2009.04.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[second opinion]] diagnoses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Graham | first = AR | last2 = Bhattacharyya | first2 = AK | last3 = Scott | first3 = KM | last4 = Lian | first4 = F | last5 = Grasso | first5 = LL | last6 = Richter | first6 = LC | last7 = Henderson | first7 = JT | last8 = Carpenter | first8 = JB | last9 = Lopez | first9 = AM | last10 = Barker | first10 = GP | last11 = Weinstein | first11 = RS | last12 = Weinstein | first12 = R.

Benefits of telepathology include providing immediate access to off-site pathologists for rapid frozen section diagnoses. Another benefit can be gaining direct access to subspecialty pathologists such as a [[renal pathology|renal pathologist]], a [[neuropathologist]], or a [[dermatopathologist]], for immediate consultations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10105">[[File:SirTheodoreDeMayerne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sir Théodore de Mayerne]]
'''Sir Théodore Turquet de Mayerne''' (28 September 1573 &amp;ndash; 22 March 1655) was a  [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]]-born physician who treated kings of France and England and advanced the theories of [[Paracelsus]].
==The Young Doctor==
Mayerne was born in a [[Huguenot]] family in [[Geneve]], Republic of Geneva. His father was a [[Huguenot|Protestant French]] historian who had fled [[Lyon]] following the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] and his godfather was [[Theodore Beza]]. Mayerne's first wife was Marguerite de Boetslaer and they had three children.

Mayerne studied first in [[Geneve]] and later moved to the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Later he moved to [[Montpellier]] to study [[medicine]], graduated 1596 and received his doctorate in 1597. His dissertation defended the use of chemical remedies in medicine, under the guidance of [[Joseph du Chesne]]; this was the first intimation of his interest in Paracelsian theories. In May 1599, Mayerne joined [[Henri de Rohan]], a Huguenot nobleman very powerful in Brittany, on his grand tour of Europe, visiting Germany, Italy, Bohemia, the Netherlands, England, and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; During their visit to London in October 1600, Rohan and Mayerne were received by Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court, and in November 1600, when they reached [[Edinburgh]], they were received by King [[James VI]], before returning to France in early 1601.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his austere Calvinism, Mayerne greatly admired the many works of art and architecture he saw in his travels in Germany and Italy, especially liking the paintings of [[Albrecht Dürer]] and the ''[[Kunstkammer]]'' in Munich of curios kept by the [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Paris Years==
Mayerne moved to Paris, lecturer on [[anatomy]] and [[pharmacy]] and founded a [[medical practice]]. By that time he had begun to support the views of Paracelsus and used many chemical remedies. He kept detailed notes about his patients, among them Armand du Plessis, later [[Cardinal Richelieu]], whom he treated for [[gonorrhea]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1600 French [[royal physician]] [[Jean Ribit de la Rivière]] (1571–1605) sponsored him to become one of the personal physicians, physician in ordinary, of the king [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, « Paris, 1598 - 1601 »&lt;/ref&gt; His other pursuits were thwarted because he was not a Catholic and because most French physicians still followed the principles of [[Galen]]. In 1603 he tried to support his views to Medical Faculty of Paris, stating that his views were not opposed to Galenic and [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] principles.

Despite their opposition, he retained the favour of the King, who appointed him to travel with the [[Henri, Duc de Rohan|Duc de Rohan]] in his diplomatic missions to Germany and Italy. When the King intended to make Mayerne his first physician, the queen opposed the decision because Mayerne refused to convert to Catholicism. Mayerne continued in his lower post until 1606 when he sold it to another physician.

At this time he continued his association with du Chesne and the circle of [[Hermeticists]] that had grown up around him. These devotees of Paracelsus believed they were reviving the wisdom of the mythical pre-[[Platonism|Platonic]] natural philosophers - men known as the ''prisci theologi'' that included [[Zoroaster]] and [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. The [[alchemical]] nature of their experiments was greatly resented by Galenists at the [[University of Paris]].

In the same year he briefly visited England by invitation and met [[James I of England|James I]]. He became a physician of [[Anne of Denmark]] and was incorporated at [[Oxford]] on April 8, 1606. He probably spent the following years back in France.

==Life in England==
When Henri IV was murdered in 1610, Mayerne moved to England, again by invitation. In 1611 he became first physician of James I and his queen and also treated most members of the royal court, including Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] and [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. His inability to successfully treat those two individuals, together with his closeness to the scandal surrounding the murder of [[Thomas Overbury|Sir Thomas Overbury]] coloured his first years in England. Nevertheless, he was sometimes sent on diplomatic missions to France.

In 1616 Mayerne was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. He helped the [[Society of Apothecaries]] to obtain a [[royal charter]] separate from the Grocers and helped to found the [[Company of Distillers]]. King [[knighthood|knighted]] him in 1624. Next year he briefly visited Switzerland, where he had become Baron [[Aubonne, Switzerland|Aubonne]]. Mayerne retained his post as a first physician after the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1625.

He successfully championed the effort to produce the first official [[pharmacopoeia]], which would specify treatments that [[apothecaries]] should provide for specific ailments. In this he included chemical remedies, which were easier to introduce in Protestant England than in Catholic France.

In 1628 his wife died and in 1630 he married Elizabeth Joachimi. They had five children but only one daughter survived. At about this time he treated [[Oliver Cromwell]] for a variety of physical and emotional symptoms, including a severe depression. In response to [[the Plague of 1630]], he suggested the institution of a centralized 'Office of Health', with free royal hospitals, trained officials, and regulatory power.

During the [[English Civil War]] Mayerne kept a low profile in his practice in London and retained the favour of the parliament. After the [[execution of Charles I]] in 1649, he became nominal physician to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] but soon retired to [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].

Mayerne died at Chelsea on 22 March 1654 or 1655. He was buried in [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] with most of his family and his godson Sir Theodore des Vaux sponsored a monument for him. Des Vaux later published Mayerne's medical notes in the book ''Praxis Medica'' in 1690.

==Legacy==

Mayerne compiled the so-called 'de Mayerne manuscript' between 1620 and 1646 based on conversations with painters (and others). The manuscript includes contributions from [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[Daniël Mijtens|Mytens]], [[Paul van Somer I|Paul van Somer]], and [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen|Cornelius Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/cornelis-jonson-van-ceulen-i-portrait-of-5666153-details.aspx?pos=3&amp;intObjectID=5666153&amp;sid=&amp;page=4 Christies Auction Catalogue; lot notes, lot 45]&lt;/ref&gt; His estate included copious amount of medical manuscripts, including detailed notes about his patients, most of it in Latin and French; his patients ranged from [[John Donne]] to [[Oliver Cromwell]]. His papers are kept in the [[Royal College of Physicians]].

His influence on the administration of medicine - including the first suggestion of [[socialized medicine]] in England, and the standardisation of chemical cures, has been widely recognised.

His 'Paracelsian' outlook, which viewed the world as 'abounding in chemical secrets waiting to be exploited', led him to devise projects to enhance Scottish coal mines, to reopen lead mines in Europe and to monopolize oyster beds. He made [[chemistry|chemical]] and physical experiments, created [[pigment]]s and [[cosmetics]], introduced [[calomel]] to medical use and created ''black-wash'' (lotio nigra). It also led him to an interest in cooking, and he grew obese in later years.

In 1634, he wrote the introduction for and edited one of the first treatises ever published on Insects (usually attributed to [[Thomas Muffet]]), under the title ''Insectorum, sive minimorum animalium Theatrum: Olim ab Edoardo Wottono, Conrado Gesnero, Thomaque Pennio inchoatum: Tandem Tho. Moufeti Londinâtis operâ sumptibusque maximis concinnatum, auctum, perfectum: Et ad vivum expressis Iconibus suprà quingentis illustratum. Londini ex Officinâ typographicâ Thom. Cotes. Et venales extant apud Benjam. Allen, in diverticulo, quod Anglicè dicitur Popes-head Alley.''

A '''turn construction unit''' (TCU) is the fundamental segment of speech in a conversation, as analyzed in [[conversation analysis]].

The idea was introduced in (Sacks, Schegloff, &amp; Jefferson 1974) and is meant to describe pieces of conversation which may comprise an entire turn. The end of a TCU, called a ''transition relevance place'' (TRP), marks a point where the turn may go to another speaker, or the present speaker may continue with another TCU.

== Turn Construction Unit (TCU) ==
A '''Turn Construction Unit (TCU)''' is a building component of a turn in a conversation. It is a unit of conversation that completes a communicative act.

=== Types of TCU ===

There are four types of TCU categorized by the roles they play in the utterance:

1. '''Lexical TCU''': e.g. "Yes", "There"&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Phrasal TCU''': e.g. "In the basket", "out of here"&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Clausal TCU''': e.g. "When I am free", "If I got the job"&lt;br /&gt;
4. '''Sentential TCU''': e.g. "I am working on my thesis", "He has got my car"

=== Criteria for Turn Construction Unit ===
A general rule to identify a TCU would be to look for a possible completion in an ongoing utterance. There are three criteria to determine what constitutes a TCU:&lt;br /&gt;
1. '''Intonationally Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with the hint of a falling tone, signaling the possible ending of the utterance.&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Grammatically Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with a hint of its syntactic completeness, i.e. it signals the end of a sentence in terms of its grammatical structure.&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Pragmatically Complete''': This means the utterance is seen to have possibly accomplished its purpose in response to the situation during a conversation. For example, the utterance "She is really" can be seen as pragmatically complete in response to the exclamation, "That girl is really pretty!", in the sense that it functions as an agreement to the previous comment.

Scholars in the field of conversation analysis have debated over the relative significance of the above three criteria as signifiers of the end of an utterance. There are, however, no conclusive answer to the discussion, and one can classify a TCU as such when observing either one (or more) of the above features.

== Transition Relevance Place (TRP)==
'''Transition Relevance Place''' (or TRP) is a point of possible completion (or potential end) of an utterance (hence a TCU) where speaker change is a possible next action.

'''European countries''' have had varying policies that confine '''women and military service''' or the extent of their participation in the national [[armed services]] of their respective countries, especially [[combatant]] roles in [[armed conflicts]] or hostile environments. While most of the countries have always allowed women to participate in military activities involving no direct aggression with the [[enemy]], most began seeing the value of servicewomen in the armed services during the [[First World War]] when they began losing unprecedented numbers of servicemen. In modern times many of the European countries now allow women to voluntarily pursue a [[career]] path or [[profession]] in the national armed services of their country as well as permit [[conscription]] equality, with minimal or no restrictions at all.

==Denmark==

Women were employed in the Danish armed forces as early as 1934 with the Ground Observer Corps, Danish Women's Army Corps and Naval Corps in 1946 and the Women's Air Force since 1953. In 1962 the Danish parliament passed laws allowing women to volunteer in the regular Danish armed forces as long as they did not serve in units experiencing direct combat. 1971 saw the enlistment of women as non-commissioned officers, with military academies allowing women in 1974.

In 1978, based on the reports of studies on the topic, women were allowed to enlist in an all areas of the Danish armed forces, with combat trials in the eighties exploring the capabilities of women in combat. In 1998 laws were passed allowing women to sample military life in the same way as conscripted men, however without being completely open to conscription. Women in the Danish military come under the command of the Chief of Defense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/denmark.htm NATO/IMS: Committee on Women in the NATO Forces: Denmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009|7}} the highest rank reached by a woman in the Danish armed forces is Colonel (Susanne Bach Bager, Telegrafregimentet), with 5.2% (832) women in the services: 153 officers, 176 NCOs, and 503 privates (not counting women serving as "concripts").&lt;ref&gt;http://forsvaret.dk/FPT/Nyt%20og%20Presse/fakta/kvinderiforsvaret/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; From the summer 2007 to July 2009 a total of 84 women have served in the Danish Battalion in Helmand province, Afghanistan. This includes frontline service in infantry units and active participation in combat. However recent recruitment of women has been low in Denmark due to rising job opportunities elsewhere. NATO reports also indicate that the Danish military does not promote women to positions of leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

As with many nations with women in their armed forces, Denmark has different basic physical requirements for men and women in their armed forces, however the requirements for the more physically demanding jobs do not differ for either sex.

==Finland==

[[Image:Suomalaisia naissotilaita vannomassa sotilasvalaa.jpg|thumb|Finnish female soldiers swearing their military oath alongside male conscripts.]]
The [[Finnish Defense Forces]] does not conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 years of age have the possibility of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the [[Finnish Border Guard|Border Guard]]. Females serve under the same conditions as men, with the exception that during the first 45 days of service they have the option to leave the military without consequences. After that, they must complete the service which lasts 6, 9 or 12 months. After the service, the females face the same reserve obligations as the males who have done the obligatory military service. If the female in national service experiences a conscientious crisis which prevents her from fulfilling her military service or reserve obligations, she is ordered to the alternative civilian service, which lasts 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1995/19950194 Law on the voluntary military service for women (194/1995)] {{Fi}} Retrieved 2-20-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

All services and units in the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard accept females. In garrison environment, the females are lodged in separate rooms and are given separate toilet and bath facilities. In exercises and aboard ships, women are lodged with men. The women in national service are given an extra allowance of €0,40 per diem for sanitary articles and smallclothes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naiset.dsp Finnish Defence Forces. Naiset armeijassa.] {{Fi}} Retrieved 2-20-2007&lt;/ref&gt; The females in military service are usually well motivated and some 60% of them receive either NCO or reserve officer training. Yearly, some 500 women complete the voluntary military service, while some 30,000 men complete the obligatory conscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp Finnish Defence Forces.

The women who have completed the voluntary military service are eligible for further military employment. If they have at least NCO training, they can apply for career NCO positions or for officer training. These career paths have been open since 1996, when the first women completed the military service. In 2005, 32 female career officers were in service. The number of female warrant officers was 16 and the number of female specialist officers 7. In comparison, there were a total of 2.584 officers and 894 specialist officers in service. The women made up about 16% of the total career NCO cadre. However, most of these career NCOs were grandfathered former female enlistees who had not undertaken military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/perustietoa/toiminnantuloksellisuus/pdf/htp05.pdf Finnish Defence Forces.

[[Image:Naispunakaartilainen.jpg|thumb|upright|Female Red Guard soldier from [[Finnish Civil War]]]]
The history of women in the Finnish military is, however, far longer than just since 1995. During the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] had several ''Naiskaarti'' (Women's Guard) units made of voluntary 16- to 35-year-old women, who were given rudimentary military training. The reactions on women in military were ambivalent during the Civil War. The fighting women of the Reds were shunned in the [[White Guard (Finland)|White]] propaganda but in the Red side propaganda they were admired and also compared to the "[[amazons]] of old".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vanha.hum.utu.fi/historia/raunistula/yhteiskunta/naiskaarti/kaarti7.html Hakala, A.

While the ''Lottas'' were not front line fighting units per sé, as a paramilitary organization they handled several important second-line duties freeing men to the actual fighting service. A voluntary Lotta unit manned a searchlight battery of Finnish [[anti-aircraft artillery]] in defense of Helsinki in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/ruotuvaki/index.dsp?action=read_page&amp;pid=36&amp;aid=530 Valonheitinlotat - ainutlaatuinen osa historiaa].

In 1961, the Finnish Defence Forces started to enlist females for second-line duties. The duties available to women were radar operator, sea-control person, and C3 person. Most of the female enlisted served in coastal artillery and [[Finnish Air Force]]. The women enlisted all served in the rank of ''värvätty'' (enlisted), using a special female uniform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soal.fi/tietopankki/index.php?group=00000210&amp;mag_nr=5 Sotilasammattiliitto SoAL ry.

In the beginning of the year 2007, the term enlisted (''värvätty'') was changed to NCO (''aliupseeri'') to better recognize the change in the duties of this personnel group. The female enlistees who had not undertaken military service were grandfathered. They remain in the rank of enlistee unless they complete the conscript NCO course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/tyojakoulutus/tehtavat/aliupseerit.dsp Aliupseerit: Sotilasammattihenkilöistä aliupseereiksi.] Finnish Defence Forces.

The non-combat duties in Finnish Defence Forces [[peace-keeping]] operations opened to women in 1991. At first, the women without previous military training experienced rather large problems in the Finnish peace-keeping units, most remarkably in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the mid-1990s. Since the introduction of the voluntary military service, the women have mostly the same training as the men which has lessened the problems. Only a handful of women without military training, mostly nurses or social service personnel, are serving with the Finnish peace-keeping forces. All duties in Finnish foreign operations are open to women, provided they have the necessary military training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat/45min_2003/arkisto.shtml?91386 Naisista tasa-arvoisia rauhanturvaajia.] MTV3 news service.

==France==
[[File:Cantiniere1800s.jpg|thumb|A [[Cantinière]] with a male infantry soldier in Algeria, around 1845. Painting by Edouard Moreau.]]

In the 1800s, women in the French military were responsible for preparing meals for soldiers, and were called [[Cantinières]]. They sold food to soldiers beyond that which was given to them as rations. Cantinières had commissions from the administrators of the regiments, and they were required to be married to a soldier of the regiment. They served near the front lines on active campaigns, and some served for as long as 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Following the drums: Cantinieres|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_cantinieres.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in the French military grew in 1914 with the recruitment of women as medical personnel (Service de Santé des Armées). In 1939, they were authorized to enlist with the armed service branches, and in 1972 their status evolved to share the same ranks as those of men. Nonetheless, women are still not permitted to join the field combat units or to be aboard the submarines of the French navy.

[[Valérie André]], a neurosurgeon, became the first woman in France to attain the rank of three-star general as Médecin Général Inspecteur. A veteran of the [[French Resistance]], she served overseas in [[Indochina]]. During that period, she learned how to pilot a helicopter so that she could reach wounded soldiers who were trapped in the jungle. André is the first woman to have flown a helicopter in combat. She received many decorations for her achievements, including the highest rank of the [[Legion of Honour]]. She retired from active service in 1981. Many other French women were involved in the [[Women in the French Resistance|French Resistance]].

==Germany==
[[Image:Ulrike Flender.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ulrike Flender]]—in 2007 became the first female [[German Air Force]] jet-fighter pilot and first German female [[Panavia Tornado]] pilot.]]

Since the creation of the [[Bundeswehr]] in 1955, Germany had employed one of the most conservative gender-policies of any NATO country. That was generally regarded as a reaction to the deployment of young women at the end of [[World War II]]. Though women were exempt from direct combat functions in accordance with Nazi-ideology, several hundred thousand German women, along with young boys and sometimes girls (as [[Flakhelfer]]), served in [[Luftwaffe]] artillery units; their flak shot down thousands of Allied warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/H491/women-combat.htm D'Ann Campbell, "Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union" ''Journal of Military History'' (April 1993), 57:301-323 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1975 the first female medical officers were appointed in the ''Sanitätsdienst'' ([[Medical corps]]) of the Bundeswehr. Since 1994, two women, [[Verena von Weymarn]] and Erika Franke, attained the rank of ''[[Generalarzt]]'' (Surgeon General). But it was not until January 2001 that women first joined German combat units, following a court ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]]. The change in the law was prompted after a qualified female [[electronics technician]] argued her case to the European Court of Justice after her application to join the Maintenance-Recovery Service (Electronics) technical unit of the German Armed Forces was rejected in 1996, citing "it is barred by German law for women to perform armed services". The court ruled that preventing women from occupying combat roles in the armed forces was against sexual equality principles. 244 of the first 1,900 women who signed up following the law change were admitted on the first day of the new rules, the majority of them joining the army and air force.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1097492.stm Women join German fighting forces]&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are no restrictions regarding the branch of service, and there are women serving in the ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' (paratrooper), aboard [[submarine]]s and jet-fighter aircraft. Before the law change 4,400 women only occupied [[military medicine]] or [[Military band|military-band]] roles within the German armed forces. The new legislations initially did not receive full military support. A report on the subject commented that, regarding the older male soldiers, "The way they see themselves as male fighters is shattered". Like many countries who have accepted women into combat roles, Germany conducts special courses on preventing sexual harassment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

After several years of experience the commotion inside the Bundeswehr has now remarkably decreased. Today women are regularly being sent to foreign deployments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1842630,00.html Germany Marks Five Years of Women in Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 about 16,900 female soldiers serve in the Bundeswehr, representing a share of 9 percent of all troops except conscripted soldiers. The German Bundeswehr now expects the percentage of all female personnel to rise to about 15 percent in the middle-term future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/a/bwde/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd443DgwBSUGYAfqR6GIBIQixoJRUfW99X4_83FT9AP2C3NCIckdHRQAlYgRn/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfQ180QTc!?yw_contentURL=/C1256EF4002AED30/W27DXCZE807INFODE/content.jsp Starke Truppe – Immer mehr Frauen entscheiden sich für die Bundeswehr (Powerful troop - more and more women join the Bundeswehr)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979, allowed women to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] for the first time and was passed by the [[Oireachtas]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1979/en/act/pub/0028/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are no restrictions for women to the "full range of operational and administrative duties."&lt;ref&gt;http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0658/D.0658.200807020061.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 the number of women in the Permanent Defence Forces is 565, 5.7 percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20100224.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=1236#N1236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
[[File:Italian Soldier Olypmic Games Turin 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Italian parachutist]]
During [[World War II]], the [[Italian Social Republic]] established the Female Volunteer Unit ({{lang-it|Corpo volontario femmnile}}) as an auxiliary service and their soldiers were known as Female Auxiliary Unit ({{lang-it|Servizio Ausiliario Femminile}}). The law that introduced this unit provided that its existence be limited to war periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/RSI_ANALISI/34.htm|title=Decreto istitutivo del Corpo femminile|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its equivalent in [[Southern Italy]] during World War II, was the ''CAF'', {{lang-it|Corpo di Assistenza Femminile}}, that was on the side of the [[Allies]]. This unit was also dismissed at the end of the war. Those who belonged to this unit were equivalent to [[sub-lieutenants]] and wore military uniforms made in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museobadoglio.altervista.org/docs/forze.pdf|title=Forze del Regno del Sud|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the Female Police unit ({{lang-it|Corpo di Polizia femminile}}) was established.

In 1981, Diadora Bussani was the first woman who asked to be admitted  into the [[Italian Naval Academy]] of [[Livorno]] ({{lang-it|Accademia navale di Livorno}}). She was born in 1962 in [[Trieste]] and started to try to join the academy in 1981. After being excluded from the application, Italy's regional administrative court upheld the appeal; however, Italy's State Council overturned the judgment. The enlisting of a woman seemed to be legally feasible because of the Italian law Legge 1963 n. 66, which allowed the enrollment of women in public positions, but Italy's State Council excluded the military because of biological differences between male and female human bodies. When Diadora Bussani became famous and the case was well-known, the [[United States Navy]] symbolically granted her enlistment on 2 November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloogger.it/2018/06/italiane-in-armi/&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary female military service was introduced in 1999 with the Italian law Legge 20 ottobre 1999 n. 380, which introduced the possibility of being admitted to the army for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informagiovani.it/frame/_donnemiliti.htm Informagiovani]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was the last country among [[NATO]] members to allow women to deploy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Editoria/Rassegna+Arma/2004/Suppl_3/I+Sessione/01_Sessione_03.htm#3 L'impatto del servizio militare femminile. Un primo bilancio (Periodico Rassegna dell'arma dei carabinieri anno anno 2004, supplemento al n. 3/2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays women are present in all branches of Italian armed forces, including the police, and the [[Guardia di Finanza]], and they are also employed for military missions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difesa.it/APPROFONDIMENTI/ARCHIVIOAPPROFONDIMENTI/SERVIZIO_FEMMINILE/Pagine/default.aspx Ministero della Difesa]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the year 2000, women were employed in war only as voluntary nurses inside the organizations [[Croce Rossa Italiana]] and of [[Corpo delle infermiere volontarie dell'ACISMOM]]. 235º Reggimento fanteria "Piceno" is the training center for women inside the Italian army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esercito.difesa.it/organizzazione/capo-di-sme/comando-per-la-formazione-specializzazione-e-dottrina-dell-esercito/Scuola-di-Fanteria/Centro-Addestramento-Volontari/235-RAV-Piceno Esercito.difesa]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==
Women in Norway have been serving in military roles since 1938. During the Second World War both enlisted women and female officers served in all branches of the military. However, in 1947 political changes commanded that women only serve in civilian posts, with reservists allowing women to join in 1959.

Between 1977 and 1984, the Norwegian Parliament passed laws expanding the role of women in the Norwegian Armed Forces, and in 1985 equal opportunities legislation was applied to the military. 
In 1995, Norway became the first country to allow women to serve on its military [[submarines]]

In a further step in favour of gender equality in the armed services, the Norwegian parliament voted, with a strong majority, the 14th of June 2014, a [[Bill (law)|bill]] to extend [[Conscription|compulsory military service]] to females from mid-2016. Norway is the first NATO member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both sexes.&lt;ref name="NMMSW"&gt;[http://rt.com/news/197152-norway-army-women-military-conscripts/ Girls in the army: Norway passes bill on mandatory military service for women]&lt;/ref&gt; It will apply to all medically fit Norwegian citizens between age 19-44 born from 1997 onwards.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt; Women born in 1997 and onwards will also be subject to conscription during wartime.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt;

As of 2017, 1341 of the 11596 military personnel in the Norwegian military forces were women (12%). Of all the conscriped soldiers the same year, the female percentage was 23%. c&lt;ref&gt;https://forsvaret.no/fakta_/ForsvaretDocuments/Forsvarets_aarsrapport_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2017, major general Tonje Skinnarland became the first-ever appointed woman to be the head of the Royal Norwegian air force.

==Poland==
Women have taken part in the battles for independence against occupiers and invaders since at least the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the occupation by the [[Nazi]]s, 1939–1945, several thousand women took part in the resistance movement as members of the [[Home Army]]. The Germans were forced to establish special [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s after the [[Warsaw Rising]] in 1944 to accommodate over a thousand women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm Women in Home Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938 the law requiring compulsory military service for men included provisions for voluntary service of women in auxiliary roles, in the medical services, in the anti-aircraft artillery and in communications. In 1939 a Women's Military Training Organization was established under the command of [[Maria Wittek]].

In present Poland a law passed April 6, 2004 requires all women with college [[nursing]] or [[veterinary]] degrees to register for compulsory service. In addition it allows women to volunteer and serve as professional personnel in all services of the army. As of June 30, 2007 there are 800 women in the army, of which 471 are officers, 308 non-commissioned officers and 21 other ranks, in addition 225 are in military training schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 Women in army - in Polish]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
{{Main| Women in the Russian and Soviet military}}

The first woman known to have enlisted in the Russian Army was [[Nadezhda Durova]] who, pretending to be a man, fought with distinction in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. At that time, however, she was very much of a unique exception in an all-male army.

During the [[First World War]], heavy defeats led to the loss of millions of [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] soldiers. To psychologically energize morale [[Alexander Kerensky]] (leader of Russia of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]) ordered the creation of the Woman’s Death Battalion in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wdeath.htm Women's Death Battalion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) till December 1991.

The current tally of woman in the Russian Army is standing at around 115,000 to 160,000, representing 10% of Russia’s military strength.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They're not allowed in combat roles, however.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The Russian army runs the [[Miss Russian Army]] beauty contest for attractive female Russian soldiers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Colonel Gennady Dzyuba, of the Defense Ministry, said of the 2005 contest that "Those who have served, especially in hot spots, know the importance of women in the [[armed forces]]."{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Soviet Union: 1917–1991===

{{Main| Soviet women in the Great Patriotic War}}
Women had the legal right to serve in the [[Red Army|Soviet Armed Forces]] throughout the post Second World War period, with many all-female units existing as far back as World War One. By the early 1990s, 100,000 women made up 3% of the Soviet Armed Forces.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LyudmilaPavlichenko1.jpg|thumb|Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] --&gt;

During the Second World War, the Soviet Union had a female military strength of over one million women [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/jan-feb/obrien.html] who served as snipers, machine gunners, and tank crew members. Very few of these women, however, were ever promoted to officers.

In 1942 the [[Soviet Union]] formed three regiments of women combat pilots to fly night bombing missions over Germany, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, later called the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment. These women took part in regular harassment bombing against the Germans in [[Polikarpov Po-2]] biplanes, and participated in the final onslaught against Berlin. The regiments, collectively known to the Germans as the "Nachthexen" ("[[Night Witches]]"), flew more than 24,000 sorties and won in total 23 [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] medals. Some of the most talented women pilots were assigned day fighter duties. [[Lydia Litvyak|"Lily" Litvak]] and [[Katya Budanova]] became fighter aces flying the Soviet Union's best fighter designs alongside men in day attacks. Both were killed in their aircraft. Meanwhile, in the ground combat role [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], made 309 confirmed kills including 36 enemy snipers. Pavlichenko was one of the many female snipers of the Soviet Army.

In 1967, the Soviet Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available combat soldiers during periods of large-scale mobilisation. Thus, several programs during the height of the cold war were set up to encourage women to enlist. Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for ex-servicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples. Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves.

In the Soviet Union civil universities, in addition to professional education, gave basic military training to the youth of both sexes. Many secondary schools in [[post-Soviet countries]] still have defense lessons, both for boys and girls.

==Serbia==
 {{commonscat|Military women of Serbia}}
Although the Serbian combat forces were traditionally exclusively male (with exception of nurses and some other non-combat roles) there were some exceptions. Several women are known to have fought in the ranks in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the [[First World War]], often by initially hiding their gender to work around the draft regulations. The most notable of them was [[Milunka Savić]]. In the [[Second World War]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav partisan units]] accepted female volunteers as combatants as well as medical personnel. After the war the practice was abandoned, but was reintroduced recently with professionalisation of the army.

In Yugoslavia (including Serbia and other states), two million women were directly involved in non-combat support roles with Yugoslavia's partisans, and 100,000 served in the partisan army during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jancar, "Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview," ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' (1981) 14#2 pp 143-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In the Military Articles of 1621, which organized the Swedish army, military men on all levels were explicitly allowed to bring their wives with them to war, as the wives were regarded to fill an important role as [[sutler]]s in the house hold organisation of the army: prostitutes, however, were banned.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"&gt;Sjöberg, Maria: ''Kvinnor i fält 1550-1850.'' [Women in Combat] Gidlund (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This regulation was kept until the Military Article of 1798, though the presence of women diminished after the end of the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; In the Military Article of 1798, the only women allowed to accompany the army was the professional unmarried female sutlers, in Sweden named ''marketenterska''.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; Unofficially, however, there were females who served in the army posing as male the entire period, the most famous being [[Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt;

In 1924, the [[Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service]] (Swedish: Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer, commonly known as Lottorna) was founded: it is an auxiliary defense organization of the [[Swedish Home Guard]], a part of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Since 1989 there are no gender restrictions in the Swedish military on access to military training or positions. They are allowed to serve in all parts of the military and in all positions, including combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id%3D11756 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045646/http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} in Swedish, Retrieved 04-23-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
[[File:Breguet 19 Sabiha.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female pilot to fly during a conflict, 1937]]
When Turkish history is examined, it is apparent that Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country, showing the same power and courage as men. [[Nene Hatun]], whose monument has been erected in the city of Erzurum (Eastern Turkey) because of her gallant bravery during the Ottoman-Russian War, constitutes a very good example of this fact. Furthermore, the Independence War has taken its place in history with the unsurpassed heroism of Turkish women.&lt;ref name="nato.int"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/turkey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female combat pilot in the world, as well as the first Turkish female aviator. She was one of the eight adoptive children of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Throughout her career in the Turkish Air Force, Gökçen flew 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions. She was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "20 Greatest Aviators in History" published by the United States Air Force in 1996.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/gokcen.html Sabiha Gokcen (1913-2001), Pioneer Aviatrix&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women personnel are being employed as officers in the Turkish Armed Forces today. The women officers serve together with the men under the same respective chains of command. The personnel policy regarding women in the Turkish Armed Forces is based on the principle of "needing qualified women officers in suitable branches and ranks" to keep pace with technological advancements in the 21st century. Women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff, technical fields, and social services without sexual discrimination. Women officers serve in all branches except armour, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias.&lt;ref name="nato.int"/&gt;

As of the year 2005, the number of the female officers and NCOs in the Turkish Armed Forces is 1245.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2005/win/national_reports/turkey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

Women may now join the British Armed forces in all roles except those whose "primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy": [[British Army Infantry|Infantry]], [[Household Cavalry]], [[Royal Armoured Corps]], [[Royal Marines|Royal Marines Commandos]], [[RAF Regiment]], [[Special Air Service]] and [[Special Boat Service]]. In addition medical reasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} used to preclude service in the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service]] or as Mine Clearance Divers, but in May 2014 it was announced that three women had become the RN's first female submariners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal Navy gets first female submariners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27278588|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are however, permitted access to special force's support units, such as commando engineers and are cleared to join the [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]], a largely unknown branch of the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] that does not bar women from joining.

Female personnel currently make up around 9% of the British armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm Defence Factsheet, Women in the Armed Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929073139/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm |date=2012-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, female combatants can be found throughout Britain’s military history.&lt;ref&gt;BBC news [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6502847.stm article] on Women in Combat, retrieved on March 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example is Queen [[Boudica]], who led warriors of the Iceni tribe against Roman forces occupying Britain around AD 62, her legacy being often quoted in support of arguments calling for the full opening up of the British Armed forces to women.

In the medieval period, Queens and noblewomen such as [[Ethelfleda]] of Mercia, [[Matilda of England]], [[Isabella of France]] and [[Margaret of Anjou]] commanded armies in battle, although they did not fight themselves. Many women including Queen [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] accompanied their husbands on Crusade. In the 16th century [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], accompanied troops in several campaigns. Women continued to lead armies or organise the defense of castles in the absence of their male relatives until the close of the [[English Civil War]]. Charles I's consort, [[Henrietta Maria of France]] was the last English queen to command troops in battle in northern England in 1643.

During the 1776 American War of Independence, it is estimated that over 5,000 women accompanied British forces. Many of these would have been the wives of high-ranking officers, with a large proportion being the wives of serving soldiers. While as much as possible women were left in the camp, they sometimes accompanied forces in their baggage trains serving as cooks or nurses, and were occasionally caught in combat and killed or taken prisoner. Similarly women accompanied men in ships of the [[Royal Navy]], in combat being employed as powder monkeys or assisting [[surgeon]]s.

During [[World War I]] the British Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps was formed; Lieutenant-General H Lawson recommended using it in France in 1917. Sir Neville Macready, the Adjutant-General, supported the idea that women and men should be treated the same at the front. Women served in the British Army during World War One as cooks, medical staff and clerical staff, however women were not permitted to be officers, and there were many disputes over pay. In 1917 the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS) was formed, although then disbanded in 1919 It provided catering and administrative support, communications and electrician personnel.

Prior to [[World War II]], in 1938 the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) was created, with 20,000 women serving in non-combat roles during the conflict as well as serving as military police. Some women took part in direct combat roles as part of mixed gender teams manning heavy anti-aircraft batteries and gun crews within Britain. Women members of the teams might sight and aim anti-aircraft guns and even give the command to fire, but the actual release of the trigger was always (officially at least) reserved for a male soldier. A number of women operated on active service in wartime Europe with special services, engaged in intelligence, sabotage and laison with local resistance groups. During the war, the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry was incorporated into the ATS. The WRNS was reformed at the outbreak of war in 1939, with an increased range of shore-based opportunities available.

In 1949 women were officially recognized as a permanent part of British Armed forces, although full combat roles were still available only to men. In this year, the Women's Royal Army Corps was created to replace the WAAC, and in 1950 the ranks were normalised with the ranks of men serving in the British Army.

The 1991 Gulf War marked the first deployment of British women in combat operations since 1945. Women were engaged in a broad range of support operations up to 8&amp;nbsp;km from the front line. In 1992 British Army units devoted only to women were disbanded, and women were distributed amongst the same units in which men served. During the 1990s an increasing number of roles were opened up to women including direct combat support roles in intelligence, artillery, engineering and signals.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Woodward, Trish Winter, ''Sexing the soldier: the politics of gender and the contemporary British Army,'' Routledge, (2007) pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 seagoing opportunities were opened to WRNS personnel leading to the full integration of the WRNS with the Royal Navy in 1993. To date several female personnel have commanded small ships of the RN and a recently retired Commanding Officer of [[HMNB Clyde|HM Naval Base, Clyde]], Commodore Carolyn Stait, is a former WRNS Officer.

The [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel|seizure]] of [[Royal Navy]] sailor [[Faye Turney]] in 2007 by the [[Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|naval forces of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] led to some media comment on the role of women and mothers in the armed forces.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article2411286.ece |title= Only the capture of Prince Harry could have done more damage |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[commander-in-chief]] of the British Armed Forces is a woman ([[Queen Elizabeth II]]) though her position is only nominal.
