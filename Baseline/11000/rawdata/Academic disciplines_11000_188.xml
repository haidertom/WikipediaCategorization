{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |expanded=religion}}
'''Afterlife''' (also referred to as '''life after death''') is the concept that an [[essence|essential part]] of an individual's [[Personal identity|identity]] or the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] continues to manifest after the [[death]] of the physical body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire [[soul]] or [[spirit]], of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian [[nirvana]]. Belief in an afterlife, which may be [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] or [[supernatural]], is in contrast to the belief in [[eternal oblivion|oblivion after death]].

In some views, this continued existence often takes place in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be [[#Reincarnation|reborn]] into [[World (theology)|this world]] and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or [[Otherworld]]. Major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]].

Some belief systems, such as those in the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic tradition]], hold that the dead go to a specific [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] after death, as determined by [[God]], or other [[divine judgment]], based on their [[orthopraxy|actions]] or [[orthodoxy|beliefs]] during life. In contrast, in systems of [[#Reincarnation|reincarnation]], such as those in the [[Indian religions]], the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life, rather than through the decision of a different being.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Different metaphysical models==
[[Theists]] generally believe some type of afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions tend to believe in an afterlife, but without reference to a deity. The [[Sadducees]] were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no afterlife.

Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.

===Reincarnation===
{{main|Reincarnation}}
Reincarnation is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each biological [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland|2010|pp=24-29, 171}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}} It is a central tenet of all major [[Indian religions]], namely [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rita M. Gross |title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK37AxCfxVEC  |year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0513-1 |pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of reincarnation is found in many ancient cultures,{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland|2010|pp=102–103}} and a belief in rebirth/[[metempsychosis]] was held by Greek historic figures, such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Socrates]], and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;see Charles Taliaferro, Paul Draper, Philip L. Quinn, ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''. John Wiley and Sons, 2010, page 640, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA640 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]], and [[Eckankar]] and is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as [[Australia]], [[East Asia]], [[Siberia]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere, ''Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth''. University of California Press, 2002, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of denominations within the [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of [[Kabbalah]], the [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Alawites]], the [[Druze]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, Philip K (2007) [1924].

London: Saqi. pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-86356-690-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rosicrucians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]] (1985) [1939, 1908] ''The Rosicrucian Christianity Lectures (Collected Works)'': [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcl/rcleng01.htm#lecture1 The Riddle of Life and Death]. Oceanside, California. 4th edition. {{ISBN|0-911274-84-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of [[Neoplatonism]], [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Manicheanism]], and [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Roman era]] as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;An important recent work discussing the mutual influence of ancient Greek and Indian philosophy regarding these matters is ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'' by [[Thomas McEvilley]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity Church]] and its founder [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles Fillmore]] teach reincarnation.

===Heaven and hell===
{{Main|Heaven|Hell}}
[[Heaven]], the heavens, [[seven heavens]], [[pure land]]s, [[Tian]], [[Jannah]], [[Valhalla]], or [[the Summerland]], is a common [[Religious cosmology|religious, cosmological]], or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] place where beings such as [[Deity|gods]], [[angel]]s, [[jinn]], [[saint]]s, or [[Veneration of the dead|venerated ancestors]] are said to originate, be [[throne|enthroned]], or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or [[Incarnation|incarnate]], and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases [[Entering Heaven alive|enter heaven alive]].

Heaven is often described as a "higher place", the [[Sacred|holiest]] place, a [[paradise]], in contrast to [[hell]] or the [[underworld]] or the "low places", and [[Universal reconciliation|universally]] or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of [[divinity]], [[good and evil|goodness]], [[piety]], [[faith]] or other [[virtue]]s or [[orthodoxy|right beliefs]] or simply the [[will of God]]. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a [[world to come]].

In [[Indian religions]], heaven is considered as ''[[Svarga|Svarga loka]]''. There are seven positive regions the soul can go to after death and seven negative regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/afterlife/life-after-death/|title=Life after death - Where do we go after we die?|work=SSRF English|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing its stay in the respective region, the soul is subjected to [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in different living forms according to its ''[[karma]]''. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves ''[[Moksha]]'' or ''[[Nirvana]]''. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (heaven, hell, or other) is referred to as [[otherworld]].

[[Hell]], in many religious and [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions, is a place of [[torture|torment]] and [[punishment]] in the afterlife. [[Religion]]s with a [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear]] [[Divinity|divine]] history often depict hell as an [[eternal damnation|eternal destination]],&lt;!--(for example, see [[Christian views on hell]])--&gt; while religions with a [[reincarnation|cyclic history]] often depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s.&lt;!--(for example, see Chinese [[Diyu]])--&gt; Typically, these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the [[earth]]'s surface and often include entrances to hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include [[purgatory]] and [[limbo]].

Traditions that do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward merely describe hell as an [[Bosom of Abraham|abode of the dead]], the [[grave]], a neutral place (for example, [[sheol]] or [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]) located under the surface of earth.

==Ancient religions==

===Ancient Egyptian religion===
{{main|Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife}}
The afterlife played an important role in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], and its belief system is one of the earliest known in recorded history. When the body died, parts of its soul known as ''ka'' (body double) and the ''ba'' (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the [[Aaru|Fields of Aaru]], [[Osiris]] demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Taylor, ''Death and the afterlife: A Cultural Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87436-939-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at one's reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords and formulae of the [[Book of the Dead]]. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased's heart was weighed against the ''Shu'' feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess [[Ma'at]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard| first = Katheryn | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon [[Ammit]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Demeritt, ''Ptah's Travels: Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt'', 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptians also believed that being mummified and put in a sarcophagus (an ancient Egyptian "coffin" carved with complex symbols and designs, as well as pictures and hieroglyphs) was the only way to have an afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in a [[mastaba]], could the [[Resurrection of the Dead|dead live again]] in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewellery, and 'curses'. They also used the "opening of the mouth".&lt;ref&gt;Glennys Howarth, Oliver Leaman, ''Encyclopedia of death and dying'', 2001, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Lunis, ''Tut's Deadly Tomb'', 2010, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became the driving force behind their funeral practices. Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through [[mummification]], and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the ''ka'', the ''ba'', and the ''akh''. The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Fleming, Alan Lothian, ''Ancient Egypt's Myths and Beliefs'', 2011, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by [[User (ancient Egyptian official)|User]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb|title=Door to Afterlife found in Egyptian tomb |publisher=www.meeja.com.au |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2008-09-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110016/http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb |archivedate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a powerful adviser to the [[18th dynasty]] Queen [[Hatshepsut]] who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a 'door to the Afterlife'. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in [[Roman Egypt]].

===Ancient Greek and Roman religions===
{{main|Greek underworld}}
The Greek god [[Hades]] is known in [[Greek mythology]] as the king of the [[underworld]], a place where souls live after death.&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Retief and L. Cilliers, "Burial customs, the afterlife and the pollution of death in ancient Greece", ''Acta Theologica'' '''26'''(2), 2006, p. 45 ([http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/viewFile/52560/41166 PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek god [[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River [[Styx]], the river between life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Social Studies School Service, ''Ancient Greece'', 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: Upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased's tongue. Once crossed, the soul would be judged by [[Aeacus]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and King [[Minos]]. The soul would be sent to [[Elysium]], [[Tartarus]], [[Asphodel Fields]], or the Fields of Punishment. The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods, or were simply rebellious and consciously evil.&lt;ref&gt;Perry L. Westmoreland, ''Ancient Greek Beliefs'', 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls: Those whose sins equalled their goodness, were indecisive in their lives, or were not judged. The Fields of Punishment were for people that had sinned often, but not so much as to be deserving of Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava, or stretched on racks. Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. In the ancient Greek myth about the [[Labours of Heracles]], the hero [[Heracles]] had to travel to the underworld to capture [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks.

In ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'', [[Cicero]] describes what seems to be an [[out of body experience]], of the [[soul]] traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.&lt;ref&gt;N. Sabir, ''Heaven Hell Or'', 2010, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book VI of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the hero, [[Aeneas]], travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them. While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas' former lover, the warriors and shades, Tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside. He sees the river of forgetfulness, [[Lethe]], which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew. Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.

===Norse religion===
{{main|Norse religion#Afterlife|Death in Norse paganism}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
The [[Poetic Edda|Poetic]] and [[Prose Edda]]s, the oldest sources for information on the Norse concept of the afterlife, vary in their description of the several realms that are described as falling under this topic. The most well-known are:
* [[Valhalla]]: (lit. "Hall of the Slain" i.e. "the Chosen Ones") Half the warriors who die in battle join the god [[Odin]] who rules over a majestic hall called Valhalla in [[Asgard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.viking-mythology.com/theNineWorlds.php|title=Norse Mythology {{!}} The Nine Worlds|website=www.viking-mythology.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fólkvangr]]: (lit. "Field of the Host") The other half join the goddess [[Freyja]] in a great meadow known as Fólkvangr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spangenhelm.com/folkvangr-freyjas-field-warriors/|title=Fólkvangr, Freyja welcomes you to the Field of the Host|date=2016-05-20|work=Spangenhelm|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hel (realm)|Hel]]: (lit. "The Covered Hall") This abode is somewhat like [[Hades]] from Ancient Greek religion: there, something not unlike the [[Asphodel Meadows]] can be found, and people who have neither excelled in that which is good nor excelled in that which is bad can expect to go there after they die and be reunited with their loved ones.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* [[Niflhel]]: (lit. "The Dark" or "Misty Hel") This realm is roughly analogous to Greek [[Tartarus]]. It is the deeper level beneath Hel, and those who break oaths and commit other vile things will be sent there to be among their kind to suffer harsh punishments.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===
{{main|Jewish eschatology}}

====She'ol====
[[She'ol]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]], is a place of darkness to which all the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous, regardless of the moral choices made in life, a place of stillness and darkness cut off from life and from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rainwater|1996|p=819}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=June 2017}}

The inhabitants of Sheol are the "shades" (''[[rephaim]]''), entities without personality or strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under some circumstances they are thought to be able to be contacted by the living, as the [[Witch of Endor]] contacts the shade of [[Samuel]] for [[Saul]], but such practices are forbidden (Deuteronomy 18:10).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knobel|2011|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the [[Second Temple period]] (roughly 500 BC–70 AD) a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered to be the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone.&lt;ref name="Longenecker 2003 189"&gt;{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into [[Septuagint|Greek]] in ancient [[Alexandria]] around 200 BC, the word "[[Hades]]" (the [[Greek underworld]]) was substituted for Sheol. This is reflected in the [[New Testament]] where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the [[evil]] it represents.&lt;ref name="Longenecker 2003 189"/&gt;

====World to Come====
The [[Talmud]] offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the ''Olam Haba'' or [[world to come]]. Most do not enter the world to come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a "re-schooling", with the soul gaining wisdom as one's errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the world to come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of "eternal [[damnation]]", so prevalent in other religions, is not a tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tsa/tsa37.htm |title=Tractate Sanhedrin: Interpolated Section: Those Who have no Share in the World to Come |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10049.html |title=Jehoiakim |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]] describes the ''Olam Haba'' in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the [[Messianic era]]. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was "housed" during its earthly existence.

The [[Zohar]] describes [[Gehenna]] not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-9.html |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Jewish Thought (6/12)Section - Question 12.8: What do Jews say happens when a person dies? Do Jews believe in reincarnation? In hell or heaven? Purgato |publisher=Faqs.org |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reincarnation in Jewish tradition====
Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings,&lt;ref&gt;Saadia Gaon in Emunoth ve-Deoth Section vi&lt;/ref&gt; according to rabbis such as Avraham Arieh Trugman, reincarnation is recognized as being part and parcel of Jewish tradition. Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism,&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{YouTube|mM8dn68vgD8|Reincarnation in the Jewish Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

[[Shraga Simmons]] commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5-10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_reincarnation.htm |title=Ask the Rabbi - Reincarnation |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an "ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism". The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. [[Onkelos]], a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, "Let Reuben live and not die&amp;nbsp;..." (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, [[Nachmanides]] (Ramban 1195–1270), attributed Job's suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job's saying "God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to&amp;nbsp;... the light of the living' (Job 33:29,30)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yirmiyahu |first=Rabbi |url=http://ohr.edu/yhiy/article.php/1077 |title=Reincarnation « Ask! « Ohr Somayach |publisher=Ohr.edu |date=2003-07-12 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reincarnation, called ''[[gilgul]]'', became popular in [[folk belief]], and is found in much [[Yiddish]] literature among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. [[Martin Buber]]'s early collection of stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]'s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Buber, "Legende des Baalschem" in ''Die Chassidischen Bücher'', Hellerau 1928, especially ''Die niedergestiegene Seele''&lt;/ref&gt;

Among well known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], the [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] and [[Leon de Modena]]. Saadia Gaon, in [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] (Hebrew: "beliefs and opinions") concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of [[metempsychosis]] (reincarnation). While rebutting reincarnation, Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.

Other well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Yonassan Gershom, [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716181413/http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |title=Reincarnation and the Holocaust FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.

Among the many volumes of Yitzchak Luria, most of which come down from the pen of his primary disciple, Chaim Vital, are insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'', "The Gates of Reincarnation", is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.

Rabbi Naftali Silberberg of The [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] notes that "Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where does the soul go?

===Christianity===

{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}
[[Mainstream Christianity]] professes belief in the [[Nicene Creed]], and [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use]] include the phrase: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come." Although punishments are made part of certain Christian conceptions of the afterlife, the prevalent concept of "eternal damnation" is a tenet of the Christian afterlife.

When questioned by the [[Sadducees]] about the [[resurrection of the dead]] (in a context relating to who one's spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), [[Jesus]] said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be like the [[angels]] in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2022:23-33;&amp;version=47; |title=Matthew 22:23-33 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the [[Son of God]], and all who were in the tombs would come out, who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXD.HTM |title=The New American Bible - IntraText |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Enoch]] describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in [[Paradise]], the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Fosdick, Harry Emerson]]. A guide to understanding the Bible. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1956. page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.

The book of [[2 Maccabees]] gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.

[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 056.jpg|right|thumb|[[Domenico Beccafumi]]'s ''Inferno'': a Christian vision of hell]]
The author of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] recounts the story of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], which shows people in Hades awaiting the resurrection either in comfort or torment. The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] writes about God and the angels versus [[Satan]] and [[demons]] in an epic battle at the end of times when all souls are judged. There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]].

The non-canonical [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]] speak of the efficacy of [[prayer for the dead]], so that they might be "translated to a state of happiness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/thecla.html Acts of Paul and Thecla] 8:5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] pictures the [[underworld]] ([[Hades]]) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the [[bosom of Abraham]] their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the "[[Lake of fire|lake of unquenchable fire]]" into which they are destined to be cast.

Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote that a person "may afterward in a quite different manner be very much interested in what is better, when, ''after his departure out of the body'', he gains knowledge of the difference between virtue and vice and finds that he is not able to partake of divinity until he has been ''purged of the filthy contagion in his soul by the purifying fire''" (emphasis added)—Sermon on the Dead, AD 382, quoted in [http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp The Roots of Purgatory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527235028/http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp |date=May 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of "purgatorial flames".

The noun [[Purgatory|"purgatorium"]] (Latin: place of cleansing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/purgatory "purgatory"]. The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003. Answers.com 06 Jun. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved after life. The same word in adjectival form (''purgatorius -a -um'', cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2339625 |title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, '&amp;#39;A Latin Dictionary'&amp;#39; |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was already used by Christians such as Augustine of Hippo and [[Pope Gregory I]] to refer to an after-death cleansing.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs. A notable example is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]''.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/heaven-and-hell-dole/contents/10|title=Swedenborg, E. '&amp;#39;Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg Foundation, 2000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as [[marriage]] in heaven (where all [[angels]] are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), [[time]] and [[space]] in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the [[eternity]] of [[Hell]] (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"/&gt;

====The Catholic Church====
The "Spiritual Combat", a written work by [[Lorenzo Scupoli]], states that four assaults are attempted by the “evil one” at the hour of death.&lt;ref&gt;http://stjudetheapostleparish.org/pdf/books/spiritual_combat.pdf#page35&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that [[Particular judgment|after the body dies, the soul is judged]], the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented [[mortal sin]] go to hell. In the 1990s, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry [[venial sin]] go to a place called [[Purgatory]] where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.

=====Limbo=====
{{main|Limbo}}
Despite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a [[dogma]] of the [[Catholic Church]], yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church. Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants, [[Virtue#Christianity|virtuous]] individuals who lived before [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus Christ was born on earth]], or those that die before [[baptism]] exist in neither Heaven or Hell proper. Therefore, these souls neither merit the [[beatific vision]], nor are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal [[sin]] although they have not received baptism, so still bear [[original sin]]. So they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness, until the end of time.

In other [[Christian denominations]] it has been described as an [[intermediate state|intermediate place]] or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/limbo |title=limbo - definition of limbo by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Purgatory=====
{{main|Purgatory}}
The notion of [[purgatory]] is associated particularly with the [[Catholic Church]]. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a "cleansing fire" although it is not always called purgatory.

[[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], believed in an [[intermediate state]] between death and the [[resurrection of the dead]] and in the possibility of "continuing to grow in holiness there", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of [[Prayer for the dead|helping by prayer]] any who may be in that state.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Campbell, Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials (Abingdon 1999), quoted in [http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 Feature article by ''United Methodist Reporter'' Managing Editor Robin Russell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154244/http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 |date=2011-07-22 }} and in [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=4746355&amp;content_id=%7B94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2%7D&amp;notoc=1 FAQ Belief: What happens immediately after a person dies?]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity====
The Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred.  Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner.  Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that "the 'location' of one’s final destiny—heaven or hell—as being figurative."&lt;ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011"&gt;[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=19 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud &amp; Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2011), 245.]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one's uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. "The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience."&lt;ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011"/&gt; For instance, [[St. Isaac the Syrian]] observes that "those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners . . . [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability."&lt;ref&gt;St. Isaac the Syrian, "Homily 28," In ''The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac the Syrian,'' trans. Dana Miller (Brookline, MA: Holy Transfiguration Monastery Press, 1984), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God.  Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19-21 as their model: "19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God." As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. [[Thomas Hopko]] writes, "[I]t is precisely the presence of God’s mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives. . . . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be "all and in all," with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon. But not all will rejoice in God's gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain."&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Thomas Hopko, "Foreword," in ''The Orthodox Church'', Sergius Bulgakov (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1988), xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of ''[[apokatastasis]]'', or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by [[Origen]], but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including [[Gregory of Nyssa]]. The [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553 C.E.) affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origen's brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesn't teach.  It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as [[Olivier Clément]], Metropolitan [[Kallistos Ware]], and Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=25 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud &amp; Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2011), 251.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a [[wikt:theologoumenon#English|theologoumena]], it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection.  As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, "It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved,"&lt;ref&gt;Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Church (New York: Penguin, 1997), 262.&lt;/ref&gt; as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints====
{{main|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Degrees of glory}}
[[File:000 preach-my-gospel 1207575 tmb.jpg|framed|Plan of Salvation in LDS Religion]]

[[Joseph F. Smith]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness—a spirit prison or "hell" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19-25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-20?lang=eng (1 Peter 3:18-20)] and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the [[Harrowing of Hell]] doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned "permanently" to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived– Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial.(1 Cor 15:44-42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where we can live eternally with our families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally. According to "True to the Faith" (a handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith), "The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have "received the testimony of Jesus" and been "made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood" (D&amp;C 76:51, 69). To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/kingdoms-of-glory.p1?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] occasionally use terms such as "afterlife"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|title=Is Gehenna a Place of Fiery Torment?|date=April 1, 2011|page=31|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011252}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand [[Ecclesiastes]] 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reasoning From the Scriptures|pages=168–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the [[Great Flood]] or at [[Armageddon]], are given no hope of an afterlife. However, they believe that after Armageddon there will be a bodily resurrection of "both righteous and unrighteous" dead (but not the "wicked"). Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insight on the Scriptures|volume=2|pages=574–576}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners are punished with eternal death (non-existence).

====Seventh-day Adventists====
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, teaches that the first death, or death brought about by living on a planet with sinful conditions (sickness, old age, accident, etc.) is a sleep of the soul. Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God = a living soul. Like Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten." (Eccl. 9:5 KJV). Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is [[immortality|immortal]]. Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus' second coming. Until then, all those who have died are "asleep". When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord. The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years (the millennium) where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels. During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation. Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth. Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous. Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin. The universe will be then free from sin forever. This is called the second death. On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored. The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more. God will reign in perfect harmony forever. (Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10; Rev. 20; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 19; 2 Peter 3:13; Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15.)&lt;ref&gt;White, E.G.

===Islam===
[[File:Mohammed´s Paradise.jpg|thumb|An artists representation of "Muhammed's Paradise". A [[Persian miniature]] from ''The History of Mohammed'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris.]]
[[File:Idris the prophet.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] is shown the afterlife places by an [[Angels in Islam|angel]]. In hell, the inmates are tormented by a [[Shaitan|demon]].]]
{{Main|Islamic view of death|Barzakh|Akhirah}}
The Islamic belief in the afterlife as stated in the [[Quran]] is descriptive. The [[Arabic]] word for Paradise is ''[[Jannah]]'' and Hell is ''[[Jahannam]]''. Their level of comfort while in the grave (according to some commentators) depends wholly on their level of ''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'' or faith in the one almighty creator or supreme being ([[God]] or [[Allah]]). In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy ''iman'' one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of ''iman'' chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice [[Islam]] long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire ''[[tasbih]]'' and recite the names of Allah in such manner as ''Subahann Allah'' or "[[Glory (religion)|Glory]] be to Allah" over and over again to acquire good deeds.

In the Quran, God gives warning about grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife (''[[Akhirah]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|17|10|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admonishes mankind that Hell is prepared for those who deny the meeting with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|18|103|e=106|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship Allah alone, which includes being kind to other human beings and life including bugs, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual's ultimate abode, be it punishment or ''Jannat'' in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.

''Jannah'' and ''Jahannam'' both have different levels. ''Jannah'' has eight gates and seven levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. ''Jahannam'' possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting homes during [[Judgment Day]], which commences after the Angel [[Israfil]] blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.

In the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e61?_hi=2&amp;_pos=1 |title=Afterlife - Oxford Islamic Studies Online |doi=10.1093/0195156498.001.0001 |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central doctrine of the Quran is the Last Day, on which the world will be destroyed and Allah will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour.

Until the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time.

The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: "Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them?").

On the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by Allah according to their deeds. One's eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge (as thin as human hair and sharper than a razor) in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever.

====Ahmadiyya====
[[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an "embryonic soul" begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one's own rights over that of others becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iU1Yn4sSXEkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=elementary+study+of+islam&amp;q=elementary%20study%20of%20islam | title=An Elementary Study of Islam | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad| page=50 |publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=1-85372-562-5| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sufi====
The Sufi scholar [[Ibn 'Arabi]] defined [[Barzakh#Sufism|Barzakh]] as the intermediate realm or "isthmus." It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, "is anything that separates two things". It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.&lt;ref name="Ibn Al-Arabi 2006 29n,50n, 59,64–8, 73,75–8, 82, 102"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Al-Arabi|first=Muhyiddin|title=The Universal Tree and The Four Birds|year=2006|publisher=Anqa Publishing|pages=29n,50n, 59, 64–8, 73, 75–8, 82, 102|editor=Angela Jaffray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith on life after death}}
The teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] state that the nature of the afterlife is beyond the understanding of those living, just as an unborn fetus cannot understand the nature of the world outside of the [[womb]]. The [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] state that the soul is immortal and after death it will continue to progress until it attains [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God's presence]]. In Bahá'í belief, souls in the afterlife will continue to retain their individuality and consciousness and will be able to recognize and communicate spiritually with other souls whom they have made deep profound friendships with, such as their [[Marriage|spouses]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Smith|first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|title= burial, "death and afterlife", evil, evil spirits, sin |year= 2000|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1|pages= 96–97, 118–119, 135–136, 322–323| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í scriptures also state there are distinctions between souls in the afterlife, and that souls will recognize the worth of their own deeds and understand the consequences of their actions. It is explained that those souls that have turned toward God will experience gladness, while those who have lived in error will become aware of the opportunities they have lost. Also, in the Baha'i view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The [[Upanishads]] describe reincarnation (''punarjanma'') (see also: [[samsara]]). The [[Bhagavad Gita]], an important Hindu script, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, [[Krishna]] says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is nothing but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called ''mukti'' (Sanskrit: मुक्ति) and staying finally with supreme God forever; is ''[[moksha]]'' (Sanskrit: मोक्ष) or salvation.

The [[Garuda Purana]] deals solely with what happens to a person after death. The God of Death [[Yama]] sends his representatives to collect the soul from a person's body whenever he is due for death and they take the soul to Yama. A record of each person's timings &amp; deeds performed by him is kept in a ledger by Yama's assistant, Chitragupta.

According to the Garuda Purana, a soul after leaving the body travels through a very long and dark tunnel towards the South. This is why an oil lamp is lit and kept beside the head of the corpse, to light the dark tunnel and allow the soul to travel comfortably.

The soul, called ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or ''[[karma]]'' performed by one in last birth. Rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad karmas in "[[Naraka (Hinduism)|naraka]]" or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in ''[[swarga]]'' or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as ''Mrutyulok'' or human world. A person stays with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only &amp; only ''yajna karma'' (means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only) in last birth and the same is called as ''moksha'' or ''[[nirvana]]'', which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul. ''Atma'' moves with ''[[Parmatma]]'' or the greatest soul. According to Bhagavad Gita an ''Atma'' or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elements—Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of ''narkas'' or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad ''karmas'' and dealt with accordingly.

Hindus also believe in ''karma''. ''Karma'' is the accumulated sums of one's good or bad deeds. ''Satkarma'' means good deeds, ''vikarma'' means bad deeds. According to [[Hinduism]] the basic concept of karma is 'As you sow, you shall reap'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good karma brings good rewards and bad karmas lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when [[Arjuna]] hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus "Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands. Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a ''[[kshatriya]]'' (warrior) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles."{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}

===Buddhism===
{{main|Buddhist eschatology}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
Buddhists maintain that [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] takes place without an unchanging [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] or soul passing from one form to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Carl B. |title=Breaking the circle: death and the afterlife in Buddhism |date=1993 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |isbn=0-585-03949-6 |page=viii |quote=Buddhists believe in karma and rebirth, and yet they deny the existence of permanent souls.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions ([[Karma in Buddhism|kamma or karma]]). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a [[Preta|hungry ghost]] or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness ([[metta]]), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.

Yet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to [[Theravada]] Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] of [[Mahayana]] believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called [[Pure Land]]. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha's name.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.

"Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition."{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}

===Sikhism===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
[[Sikhism]] may have a belief in the afterlife. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. However it's been a matter of great debate amongst the Sikhs about Sikhism's belief in afterlife. Many believe that Sikhism endorses the afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'', but a large number of Sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic.

Also it has been noted by many scholars that the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] includes poetic renditions from multiple saints and religious traditions like that of [[Kabir]], [[Baba Farid|Farid]] and [[Ramananda]]. The essential doctrine is to experience the divine through simple living, meditation and contemplation while being alive. Sikhism also has the belief of being in union with God while living. Accounts of afterlife are considered to be aimed at the popular prevailing views of the time so as to provide a referential framework without necessarily establishing a belief in the afterlife. Thus while it is also acknowledged that living the life of a householder is above the metaphysical truth, Sikhism can be considered agnostic to the question of an afterlife. Some scholars also interpret the mention of reincarnation to be naturalistic akin to the biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2011/j1312p52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

But if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned in ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and in ''[[Dasam granth]]'', so from that it can be concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being to attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. Like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Thus, in the view of Sikhism, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1248308791&amp;ucat=7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
[[Jainism]] also believes in the after life. They believe that the soul takes on a body form based on previous karmas or actions performed by that soul through eternity. Jains believe the soul is eternal and that the freedom from the cycle of reincarnation is the means to attain eternal bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jhaveri|first1=Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai|title=Death the Awakener|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/death-the-awakener-2110.htm|website=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|publisher=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional African religions===
[[Traditional African religion]]s are diverse in their beliefs in an afterlife. [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies such as the [[Hadza people|Hadza]] have no particular belief in an afterlife, and the death of an individual is a straightforward end to their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bond|first1=George C.|editor1-last=Obayashi|editor1-first=Hiroshi|title=Death and Afterlife: Perspectives of World Religions|date=1992|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0-313-27906-3|pages=3–18|chapter=Living with Spirits: Death and Afterlife in African Religions|quote=The entire process of death and burial is simple, without elaborate rituals and beliefs in an afterlife.

===Shinto===
{{further|Shinto#Afterlife}}
It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a [[Japanese funeral|Buddhist funeral]] at the time of death. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called ''[[yomi]]'' (黄泉), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This ''yomi'' very closely resembles the Greek [[Greek underworld|Hades]]; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even [[Elysium]]-like descriptions such as in the legend of [[Okuninushi]] and [[Susanoo]]. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called ''kegare''. However, death is also viewed as a path towards [[apotheosis]] in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor [[Ojin]] who was enshrined as [[Hachiman]] the God of War after his death.

===Unitarian Universalism===
Some [[Unitarian Universalist]]s believe in [[universalism]]: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bond |first1=Jon |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |title=Unitarians: unitarian view of afterlife, unitarian universalist association uua, unitarian universalist association |publisher=En.allexperts.com |date=2004-06-13 |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106125811/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |archivedate=2015-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism - Page 147, Mark W. Harris - 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although Unitarians historically believed in a literal hell, and Universalists historically believed that everyone goes to heaven, modern Unitarian Universalists can be categorized into those believing in a heaven, reincarnation and oblivion. Most Unitarian Universalists believe that heaven and hell are symbolic places of consciousness and the faith is largely focused on the worldly life rather than any possible afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Searching for Spiritual Unity&amp;nbsp;...

===Spiritualism===
According to [[Edgar Cayce]], the afterlife consisted of nine realms equated with the nine planets of astrology. The first, symbolized by Saturn, was a level for the purification of the souls. The second, Mercury's realm, gives us the ability to consider problems as a whole. The third of the nine soul realms is ruled by Earth and is associated with the Earthly pleasures. The fourth realm is where we find out about love and is ruled by Venus. The fifth realm is where we meet our limitations and is ruled by Mars. The sixth realm is ruled by Neptune, and is where we begin to use our creative powers and free ourselves from the material world. The seventh realm is symbolized by Jupiter, which strengthens the soul's ability to depict situations, to analyze people and places, things, and conditions. The eighth afterlife realm is ruled by Uranus and develops psychic ability. The ninth afterlife realm is symbolized by Pluto, the astrological realm of the unconscious. This afterlife realm is a transient place where souls can choose to travel to other realms or other solar systems, it is the souls liberation into eternity, and is the realm that opens the doorway from our solar system into the cosmos.&lt;ref name="Afterlife"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sarah|last=Bartlett|date=2015|title=The Afterlife Bible: The Complete Guide to Otherworldly Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9781841814490|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=9781841814490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream [[Spiritualist]]s postulate a series of seven realms that are not unlike Edgar Cayce's nine realms ruled by the planets. As it evolves, the soul moves higher and higher until it reaches the ultimate realm of spiritual oneness. The first realm, equated with hell, is the place where troubled souls spend a long time before they are compelled to move up to the next level. The second realm, where most souls move directly, is thought of as an intermediate transition between the lower planes of life and hell and the higher perfect realms of the universe. The third level is for those who have worked with their karmic inheritance. The fourth level is that from which evolved souls teach and direct those on Earth. The fifth level is where the soul leaves human consciousness behind. At the sixth plane, the soul is finally aligned with the cosmic consciousness and has no sense of separateness or individuality. Finally, the seventh level, the goal of each soul, is where the soul transcends its own sense of "soulfulness" and reunites with the World Soul and the universe.&lt;ref name="Afterlife"/&gt;

===Wicca===
The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as [[The Summerland]]. Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;Solitary Wicca For Life: Complete Guide to Mastering the Craft on Your Own - Page 162, Arin Murphy-Hiscock - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Frashokereti}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Zoroastrianism states that the ''urvan'', the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the [[Gathas|Ustavaiti Gathas]] with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the [[Yasna]]. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul's good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon [[Vizaresa]] (Vīzarəša), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness ([[hell]]).

[[Jamshid|Yima]] is believed to have been the first [[king]] on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima's realm, the [[spirits]] live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.

Rituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses [[Chinvat bridge]] which is the [[Final Judgment]] of the soul. Rashnu and [[Sraosha]] are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include [[Bahman|Vahman]] and [[Ahura Mazda|Ormazd]]. [[Rashnu]] is the [[yazata]] who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.

[[Misvan Gatu]] is the "place of the mixed ones" where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu's scale is equal.

The [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply [[scientific method]]s to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like [[William Crookes]], and philosophers such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[William James]].

Parapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of [[haunting]], [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]], and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref&gt;David Fontana (2005): Is there an afterlife.

W. Norton &amp; Co. | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-393-05962-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable. Although MacDougall's results varied considerably from "21 grams", for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul's mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/religion/soulweight.asp Urban Legends] - Reference Page (Soul man).&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the 2003 movie ''[[21 Grams]]'' is a reference to MacDougall's findings. His results have never been reproduced, and are generally regarded either as meaningless or considered to have had little if any scientific merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Robert Ezra|title=Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science|page=90|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J|isbn=0-691-14597-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Tipler]] has argued that [[physics]] can explain immortality, though such arguments are not [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] and thus do not qualify, in [[Karl Popper]]'s views, as science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Franl, J. | title = The Physics of Immortality – Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead | publisher = Anchor | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-385-46799-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 25 years of parapsychological research, [[Susan Blackmore]] came to the conclusion that there is no [[empirical evidence]] for an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Chapters/Kurtz.htm |title=Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers pp 85–94 |publisher=Susanblackmore.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kurtz | first = Paul | title = Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-57392-884-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Modern philosophy===
There is still the position, based on the philosophical question of [[personal identity]], termed [[open individualism]], and in some ways similar to the old belief of [[monopsychism]], that concludes that individual existence is illusory, and our consciousness continues existing after death in other conscious beings. Positions regarding existence after death were supported by some notable physicists such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Freeman Dyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolak | first = Daniel | title = I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-4020-2999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain problems arise with the idea of a particular person continuing after death. [[Peter van Inwagen]], in his argument regarding resurrection, notes that the materialist must have some sort of physical continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc|title=I Look for the Resurrection of the Dead and the Life of the World to Come |author=Peter van Inwagen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012631/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc |archivedate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hick]] also raises some questions regarding personal identity in his book, ''Death and Eternal Life'' using an example of a person ceasing to exist in one place while an exact replica appears in another. If the replica had all the same experiences, traits, and physical appearances of the first person, we would all attribute the same identity to the second, according to Hick.

===Process philosophy===
In the [[panentheistic]] model of [[process philosophy]] and theology the writers [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]] rejected that the universe was made of [[Matter|substance]], instead reality is composed of living experiences (occasions of experience). According to Hartshorne people do not experience subjective (or personal) immortality in the afterlife, but they do have objective immortality because their experiences live on forever in [[God]], who contains all that was. However other process philosophers such as [[David Ray Griffin]] have written that people may have subjective experience after death.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes (Albany: State University of New York, 1984) p.&amp;nbsp;32–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Griffin, "The Possibility of Subjective Immortality in Whitehead's Philosophy," in The Modern Schoolman, LIII, November. 1975, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&amp;C=2598 What Is Process Theology? by Robert B. Mellert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109062948/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&amp;C=2598 |date=2013-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2736&amp;C=2480 A Whiteheadian Conception of Immortality by Forrest Wood, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205005800/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2736&amp;C=2480 |date=2011-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Regarding the [[mind–body problem]], most neuroscientists take a [[physicalism|physicalist]] position according to which consciousness derives from and/or is reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity occurring in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Schwartz. ''Appendix D: Consciousness and the Neurobiology of the Twenty-First Century''. In Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM. (2000). ''Principles of Neural Science, 4th Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580394,00.html "The Brain: The Mystery of Consciousness"]. Time. Monday, January 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this premise is that once the brain stops functioning at [[brain death]], consciousness fails to survive and [[eternal oblivion|ceases to exist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernat JL|date=8 Apr 2006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68508-5|issue=9517|journal=Lancet|pages=1181–1192|pmid=16616561|title=Chronic disorders of consciousness|volume=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Laureys|Laureys, Steven]]; Tononi, Giulio. (2009). ''The Neurology of Consciousness: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropathology''. Academic Press. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-0-12-374168-4}} "In brain death there is irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain including the brainstem. Consciousness is, therefore, permanently lost in brain death."&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological proposals for the origin of a belief in an afterlife include cognitive disposition, cultural learning, and as an intuitive religious idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pereira|first1=Vera|last2=Faísca|first2=Luís|last3=de Sá-Saraiva|first3=Rodrigo|title=Immortality of the Soul as an Intuitive Idea: Towards a Psychological Explanation of the Origins of Afterlife Beliefs|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=1|page=121|doi=10.1163/156853712X633956|url=http://sapientia.ualg.pt/bitstream/10400.1/4894/1/Immortality%20of%20the%20soul%20as%20an%20intuitive%20idea.%20Towards%20a%20psychological%20explanation%20of%20the%20origins%20of%20afterlife%20beliefs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, children were able to recognize the ending of physical, mental, and perceptual activity in death, but were hesitant to conclude the ending of will, self, or emotion in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Misailidi|first1=Plousia|last2=Kornilaki|first2=Ekaterina N|title=Development of Afterlife Beliefs in Childhood: Relationship to Parent Beliefs and Testimony|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|date=April 2015|volume=61|issue=2|pages=290–318|issn=0272-930X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics}}
The interdisciplinary study of '''biology and political science''' is the application of theories and methods from the biology toward the scientific understanding of [[political behavior]]. The field is sometimes called '''[[biopolitics]]''', a term that will be used in this article as a synonym although it has other, less related meanings. More generally, the field has also been called "[[politics]] and the [[life sciences]]".&lt;ref&gt;Blank, Robert H., and Samuel M. Hines. 2001. ''Biology and Political Science''. New York: Routledge; Somit, A., and S. A. Peterson. 1998. "Review article: Biopolitics after three decades - A balance sheet." British Journal of Political Science 28:559-71; Masters, Roger D. 1989. ''The Nature of Politics''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
The field can be said to originate with the 1968 manifesto of [[Albert Somit]], ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', which appeared in the ''[[Midwest Journal of Political Science]]''.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Maxwell|title=The Sociobiological Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OPxMX-2h2cC&amp;pg=PA142|year=1991|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0768-4|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{jstor|2110295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "biopolitics" was appropriated for this area of study by [[Thomas Thorton]], who used it as the title of his 1970 book.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"/&gt;

The [[Association for Politics and the Life Sciences]] was formed in 1981 and exists to study the field of biopolitics as a subfield of political science. APLS owns and publishes an academic peer-reviewed journal called ''Politics and the Life Sciences'' (PLS). The journal is edited in the [[United States]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]’s School of Public Policy, in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Politics and the Life Sciences|url=http://www.aplsnet.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s and since, biopolitics research has expanded rapidly, especially in the areas of [[evolutionary theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Sidanius, Jim, and Robert Kurzban. 2003. "Evolutionary Approaches to Political Psychology." In ''Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology'', ed. D. O. Sears, L. Huddie and R. Jervis. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[genetics]],&lt;ref&gt;Alford, J. R., C. L. Funk, and J. R. Hibbing. 2005. "Are political orientations genetically transmitted?" American Political Science Review 99 (2):153-67; Hatemi, Peter K., Carolyn L. Funk, Hermine Maes, Judy Silberg, Sarah E. Medland, Nicholas Martin, and Lyndon Eaves. 2009. "Genetic Influences on Political Attitudes over the Life Course." Journal of Politics 71 (3):1141-56.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Darren. 2011. "From SCAN to Neuropolitics. In ''Man is By Nature a Political Animal'', edited by P. K. Hatemi and R. McDermott. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical link between biology and politics on the one hand, and sociological organicism on the other, is inescapable.  The essential difference here is that the early modern application of biological ideas to politics revolved around the idea that society was a ‘social organism’, whereas the subject this article describes expressly sets out to separate the essential logic of the association of biology to human social life, from this earlier model.  Hence the emphasis upon ‘politics’, denoting the primacy of the individual who engages in social life, as in political behaviour, underpinned by biological foundations.  In this sense the rise of Biopolitics represents the replacement of sociological organicism that had been eradicated by the end of the Second World War, with an acceptable form of political organicism.  Some discussion bearing on this point may be found in ''Biology and Politics : Recent Explorations'' by Albert Somit, 1976, which is a collection of essays, one brief essay by William Mackenzie is ''Biopolitics : A Minority Viewpoint'', in which he talks about the ‘founding father’ of Biopolitics as being Morley Roberts, because of his 1938 book of that name.  But Roberts was not using the term in its modern, politically sanitized sense, but in the context of society viewed as a true living being, a social organism.  And in a reply to Somit’s ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', published in the same journal, we find ''Some Questions about a More Biologically Oriented Political Science'' by Jerone Stephens, which sets out to warn against lurching back into the errors of previous venturers into the realms of biology and politics, as in sociological organicism.

The '''Buddhist Digital Resource Center''' (BDRC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Joining digital technology with scholarship, BDRC ensures that the ancient wisdom and cultural treasures of the [[Buddhist]] literary tradition are not lost, but are made available for future generations. BDRC is committed to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Current programs focus on the preservation of texts in [[Pali]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]].

==History==
In 2017, [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|TBRC]] announced the expansion of institutional mission to include the preservation of texts in languages beyond [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], including [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. To reflect this expansion, they have officially changed organizational name from [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center]] (TBRC) to Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC). In 2017, BDRC will begin preserving and making accessible texts in languages beyond Tibetan, starting with [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbrc.org/?locale=bo#!footer/news/20170210 Introducing Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17436">The '''candidate gene''' approach to conducting [[genetic association]] studies focuses on associations between genetic variation within pre-specified genes of interest and phenotypes or disease states. This is in contrast to [[genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS), which scan the entire genome for common genetic variation. Candidate genes are most often selected for study based on ''a priori'' knowledge of the gene's biological functional impact on the trait or disease in question.&lt;ref name="Kwon JM, Goate AM.

This approach usually uses the [[case-control study]] design to try to answer the question, "Is one allele of a candidate gene more frequently seen in subjects with the disease than in subjects without the disease?"&lt;ref name="Kwon JM, Goate AM.

==Selection==
Suitable candidate genes are generally selected based on known biological, physiological, or functional relevance to the disease in question. This approach is limited by its reliance on existing knowledge about known or theoretical biology of disease. However, more recently developed molecular tools are allowing insight into disease mechanisms and pinpointing potential regions of interest in the genome. [[Genome-wide association studies]] and [[quantitative trait locus]] (QTL) mapping examine common variation across the entire genome, and as such can detect a new region of interest that is in or near a potential candidate gene. [[Microarray]] data allow researchers to examine differential gene expression between cases and controls, and can help pinpoint new potential genes of interest.&lt;ref name="Wayne ML, McIntyre LM. Combining mapping and arraying: An approach to candidate gene identification.."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wayne ML, McIntyre LM | title = Combining mapping and arraying: An approach to candidate gene identification | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 23 | pages = 14903–6 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12415114 | pmc = 137517 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.222549199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great variability between organisms can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish normal variation in SNP from a candidate gene from disease-associated variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tiffin N, Adie E, Turner F, Brunner HG, van Driel MA, Oti M, Lopez-Bigas N, Ouzounis C, Perez-Iratxeta C, Andrade-Navarro MA, Adeyemo A, Patti ME, Semple CA, Hide W | title = Computational disease gene identification: a concert of methods prioritizes type 2 diabetes and obesity candidate genes | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 3067–81 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16757574 | pmc = 1475747 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In analyzing large amounts of data, there are several other factors that can help lead to the most probable variant. These factors include priorities in SNPs, relative risk of functional change in genes, and linkage disequilibrium among SNPs.&lt;ref name = a/&gt;

In addition, the availability of genetic information through online databases enables researchers to mine existing data and web-based resources for new candidate gene targets.&lt;ref name="Zhu M, Zhao S. Candidate Gene Identification Approach: Progress and Challenges eskeredo."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu M, Zhao S | title = Candidate gene identification approach: progress and challenges | journal = International Journal of Biological Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = 420–7 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17998950 | doi = 10.7150/ijbs.3.420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many online databases are available to research genes across species.
* Gene is one such database that allows access to information about phenotypes, pathways, and variations of many genes across species.  
* When examining functionality between genes in pathways, the Gene Ontology Consortium can help map these relationships. The GO Project describes gene products in three different ways via a species-independent manner: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Using this information can further a priori knowledge of a pathway and thus help to choose the most likely candidate gene involved. 
* Topp Gene is another useful database that allows users to prioritize candidate genes using functional annotations or network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen J, Bardes EE, Aronow BJ, Jegga AG | title = ToppGene Suite for gene list enrichment analysis and candidate gene prioritization | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W305-11 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19465376 | pmc = 2703978 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkp427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ToppGene aids researchers in selecting a subset of likely candidate genes from larger sets of candidate genes, likely discovered through high-throughput genome technologies.

==Prior to the candidate-gene approach==
Before the candidate-gene approach was fully developed, various other methods were used to identify genes linked to disease-states. These methods studied genetic linkage and positional cloning through the use of a genetic screen, and were effective at identifying relative risk genes in Mendelian diseases.&lt;ref name = a&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabor HK, Risch NJ, Myers RM | title = Candidate-gene approaches for studying complex genetic traits: practical considerations | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 391–7 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11988764 | doi = 10.1038/nrg796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these methods are not as beneficial when studying complex diseases for several reasons:&lt;ref name = a/&gt;

# Complex diseases tend to vary in both age of onset and severity. This can be due to variation in [[penetrance]] and [[expressivity (genetics)|expressivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Lobo I |title=Same genetic mutation, different genetic disease phenotype.|journal=Nature Education|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most human diseases, variable expressivity of the disease phenotype is the norm. This makes choosing one specific age group or phenotypic marker more difficult to select for study.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;
# The origins of complex disease involve many biological pathways, some of which may differ between disease phenotypes.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;
# Most importantly, complex diseases often illustrate genetic heterogeneity – multiple genes can be found that interact and produce one disease state. Oftentimes, each single gene is partially responsible for the phenotype produced and overall risk for the disorder.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gizer IR, Ficks C, Waldman ID | title = Candidate gene studies of ADHD: a meta-analytic review | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–90 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19506906 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-009-0694-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the drawbacks of linkage analysis studies, they are nevertheless useful in preliminary studies to isolate genes linked to disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teixeira LV, Lezirovitz K, Mandelbaum KL, Pereira LV, Perez AB | title = Candidate gene linkage analysis indicates genetic heterogeneity in Marfan syndrome | journal = Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research = Revista Brasileira De Pesquisas Medicas E Biologicas | volume = 44 | issue = 8 | pages = 793–800 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21789464 | doi = 10.1590/s0100-879x2011007500095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
A study of candidate genes seeks to balance the use of data while attempting to minimize the chance of creating false positive or negative results.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Because this balance can often be difficult, there are several criticisms of the candidate gene approach that are important to understand before beginning such a study. For instance, the candidate-gene approach has been shown to produce a high rate of false positives, which requires that the findings of single genetic associations be treated with great caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sullivan PF | title = Spurious genetic associations | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 61 | issue = 10 | pages = 1121–6 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17346679 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.11.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critique is that findings of association within candidate-gene studies have not been easily replicated in follow up studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hutchison KE, Stallings M, McGeary J, Bryan A | title = Population stratification in the candidate gene study: fatal threat or red herring? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 130 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–79 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14717650 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.130.1.66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Population stratification]] has often been blamed for this inconsistency; therefore caution must be taken in regards to what criteria define a certain phenotype, as well as other variations in design study.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

Additionally, because these studies incorporate ''a priori'' knowledge, some critics argue that our knowledge is not sufficient to make predictions from. Therefore, results gained from these 'hypothesis-driven' approaches are dependent on the ability to select plausible candidates from the genome, rather than use an anonymous approach. The limited knowledge of complex disease can result in 'information bottleneck', which can be overcome by [[comparative genomics]] across different species.&lt;ref name = b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim J, Lee T, Kim TH, Lee KT, Kim H | title = An integrated approach of comparative genomics and heritability analysis of pig and human on obesity trait: evidence for candidate genes on human chromosome 2 | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 13 | pages = 711 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23253381 | pmc = 3562524 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-13-711 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias can also be overcome by carefully choosing genes based on what factors are most likely to be involved in phenotype.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

These critiques are important to remember as one examines their experimental approach. With any other scientific method, the candidate gene approach itself is subject to critique, but still proven to be a powerfully effective tool for studying the genetic makeup of [[complex traits]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

==Use in research studies==
The candidate gene approach is a powerful tool to studying complex diseases, particularly if its limitations are overcome by a wide complementary approach. One of the earliest successes in this field was finding a single base mutation in the non-coding region of the APOC3 (apolipoprotein C3 gene) that associated with  higher risks of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rees A, Shoulders CC, Stocks J, Galton DJ, Baralle FE | title = DNA polymorphism adjacent to human apoprotein A-1 gene: relation to hypertriglyceridaemia | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8322 | pages = 444–6 | date = February 1983 | pmid = 6131168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study by Kim et al., genes linked to the obesity trait in both pigs and humans were discovered using [[comparative genomics]] and chromosomal heritability.&lt;ref name = b/&gt; By using these two methods, the researchers were able to overcome the criticism that candidate gene studies are solely focused on prior knowledge. Comparative genomics was completed by examining both human and pig [[QTL]] through a method known as GCTA ([[genome-wide complex trait analysis]]), which allowed the researchers to then map genetic variance to specific chromosomes. This allowed the parameter of heritability to provide understanding of where phenotypic variation was on specific chromosomal regions, thus extending to candidate markers and genes within these regions.  Other studies may also use computational methods to find candidate genes in a widespread, complementary way, such as one study by Tiffin et al. studying genes linked to type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tiffin N, Adie E, Turner F, Brunner HG, van Driel MA, Oti M, Lopez-Bigas N, Ouzounis C, Perez-Iratxeta C, Andrade-Navarro MA, Adeyemo A, Patti ME, Semple CA, Hide W | title = Computational disease gene identification: a concert of methods prioritizes type 2 diabetes and obesity candidate genes | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 3067–81 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16757574 | pmc = 1475747 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl381 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have similarly used candidate genes as part of a multi-disciplinary approach to examining a trait or phenotype. One example of manipulating candidate genes can be seen in a study completed by Martin E. Feder on heat-shock proteins and their function in ''Drosophila melanogaster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feder ME | title = Engineering Candidate Genes in Studies of Adaptation: The Heat-Shock Protein Hsp70 in Drosophila melanogaster | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 154 | issue = S1 | pages = S55-S66 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 29586709 | doi = 10.1086/303283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feder designed a holistic approach to study Hsp70, a candidate gene that was hypothesized to play a role in how an organism adapted to stress. ''Drosophila'' is a highly useful model organism for studying this trait due to the way it can support a diverse number of genetic approaches for studying a candidate gene. The different approaches this study took included both genetically modifying the candidate gene (using site-specific homologous recombination and the expression of various proteins), as well as examining the natural variation of Hsp70. He concluded that the results of these studies gave a multi-faceted view of Hsp70. By engineering and modifying these candidate genes, they were able to confirm the ways in which this gene was linked to a change phenotype. Understanding the natural and historical context in which these phenotypes operate by examining the natural genome structure complemented this.

In addition, centralspindlin's interaction with the [[ESCRT#ESCRT-III|ESCRT III]] allows for abscission to occur.&lt;ref name="cytokinesis" /&gt;

== Structure ==

Centralspindlin is a heteroteramer consisting of two different subunit proteins:&lt;ref name="cytokinesis" /&gt;
# A [[KIF23]] dimer (Kinesin 6 motor protein, also known as MKLP1 in mammals and ZEN-4 in ''C. elegans'')
::Consists of a motor domain linked to a parallel coiled coil and a globular region by a linker
# A [[RACGAP1]] dimer (Also known as MgcRacGAP in mammals or CYK-4 in ''C. elegans'')
::Contains a coiled-coil and an important RhoGAP domain
Both KIF23 and RacGAP1 dimerize via their parallel coiled coil domain.&lt;ref name="Ms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;Pavicic-Kaltenbrunner et al. [http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/early/2007/10/17/mbc.E07-05-0468.full.pdf "Cooperative assembly of CYK-4/MgcRacGAP and ZEN-4/MKLP1 to form the centralspindlin complex"], ''Molecular Biology of the Cell'', 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Centralspindlin oligomerizes in order to link the mitotic spindle with the plasma membrane&lt;ref name="cytokinesis" /&gt; The sequences mediating interactions between KIF23 and RacGAP1 are highly variable between species. However, a high affinity interaction between these subunits is essential for the proper functioning of the Centralspindlin complex.&lt;ref name="complex" /&gt;

=== Subunits ===

'''KIF23''' interacts with microtubules at sites of overlap,&lt;ref name="Ms" /&gt; linking the centraspindlin complex to the mitotic spindle.
'''RacGAP1''' recruits [[ECT2]] to the central spindle.&lt;ref name="research" /&gt; ECT2 is a Guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for [[RhoA]]. Cytokinesis is initiated when RhoA is activated by ECT2.&lt;ref name="ect2"&gt;Tatsumoto et al [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2169345/pdf/9909086.pdf "Human Ect2 Is an Exchange Factor for Rho Gtpases, Phosphorylated in G2/M Phases, and Involved in Cytokinesis"], ''[[Journal of Cell Biology]]'', 29 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
RacGAP1 is also involved in tethering the central spindle to the plasma membrane. Without this interaction, cytokinesis cannot occur.&lt;ref name="cslink" /&gt;

[[File:Torque Converter Centrifugal Pendulum Absorber.png|thumb|right|[[Schaeffler Group|Schaeffler]] torque converter with centrifugal pendulum absorber]]

A '''centrifugal pendulum absorber''' is a type of [[Tuned mass damper]]. It reduces the amplitude of a [[Torsional vibration]] in drive trains that use a combustion engine.

== History ==
The centrifugal pendulum absorber was first patented in 1937 by R. Sarazin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarazin|title=US Patent 2,079,226 - Means adapted to reduce the torsional oscillations of crankshafts|date=4 May 1937|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/2079226|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a different version by R. Chilton in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chilton|first=Roland|title=US Patent 2,112,984 - Pendulum counterweight|date=5 April 1938|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/2112984|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, both Sarazin and Chilton are credited with the invention. Sarazin's work was used during [[World War II]] by Pratt &amp; Whitney for aircraft engines with increased power output. The power increase caused an increase in torsional vibrations which threatened the durability. This resulted in the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp|Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 engine]] that used pendulum weights attached to the crank shaft.

The use of centrifugal pendulum absorbers in land vehicles did not start until later. Although internal combustion engines had always caused torsional vibrations in the drive train, the vibration amplitude was generally not high enough to affect durability or driver comfort. One application existed in tuned racing engines where torsional crank shaft vibrations could cause damage to the cam shaft or valves. In this application, a centrifugal pendulum absorber, the Rattler® absorber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rattler® Absorber|url=http://www.tciauto.com/tc/engine-products/engine-balancers/rattler-absorbershtml|work=www.tciauto.com|last=TCI|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is directly attached to the crank shaft. Although the design differs from that of Sarazin or Chilton, the Rattler® still follows the same physical principle.

In 2010, centrifugal pendulum absorbers following the patents of Sarazin and Chilton were introduced in a [[BMW 320D]]. The reason for it was again the increase in torsional vibrations from higher power engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kroll|author2=Koy|author3=Seebacher|title=Land in sight? Torsional vibration damping for future engines|year=2010|publisher=Schaeffler|page=3|url=http://www.schaeffler.com/remotemedien/media/_shared_media/08_media_library/01_publications/schaeffler_2/symposia_1/downloads_11/Schaeffler_Kolloquium_2010_02_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the 4-cylinder diesel engine [[BMW N47]]. Unlike the previous designs, the centrifugal pendulum absorber was not attached to the combustion engine but attached to a [[dual mass flywheel]].

== Function ==
The function of a centrifugal pendulum absorber is as with any [[tuned mass damper|tuned mass absorbers]] based on an absorption principle rather than a damping principle. The distinction is significant since dampers reduce the vibration amplitude by converting the vibration energy into heat. Absorbers store the energy and return it to the vibration system at the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCutcheon|first=Kimble|title=No Short Days: The struggle to Develop the R-2800 "Double Wasp" Crankshaft|url=http://www.enginehistory.org/NoShortDays/Development%20of%20the%20R-2800%20Crankshaft.pdf|work=enginehistory.org|accessdate=16 October 2013|pages=3–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centrifugal pendulum absorbers like tuned mass absorbers are not part of the force/torque flow.

The centrifugal pendulum absorber differs from the tuned mass absorber in the absorption range. It is effective for an entire order instead of a narrow frequency range.

== Modern Applications ==
[[Internal combustion engine]]s follow a development trend towards a reduction in the number of cylinders, increased energy output per cylinder and driving at lower engine speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 Emerging Trends in Automotive Engineering|url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/automotive/3-emerging-trends-automotive-engineering|work=www.asme.org|last=Crawford|first=Mark|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to an increased engine efficiency but causes the engine's torsional vibrations to increase. The vibrations lead to durability concerns as well as a comfort reduction for the passengers and have to be avoided through the use of [[torsion damper]]s and absorbers. This situation moves the balance between the cost of the centrifugal pendulum absorber technology and the benefit for the drive train efficiency.

[[Image:Pinus coulteri MHNT Cone.jpg|thumb|A mature female [[Coulter pine]] (''Pinus coulteri'') cone, the heaviest pine cone]]
[[File:Pinus ponderosa scopulorum pollen cones.jpg|thumb|Immature male or pollen cones of [[Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'' var. ''scopulorum'')]]

A '''cone''' (in formal [[botany|botanical]] usage: '''[[strobilus]]''', plural '''strobili''') is an organ on [[plant]]s in the division [[Pinophyta]] ([[conifer]]s) that contains the [[plant sexuality|reproductive]] structures. The familiar woody cone is the female cone, which produces [[seeds]]. The male cones, which produce [[pollen]], are usually [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] and much less conspicuous even at full maturity. The name "cone" derives from the fact that the shape in some species resembles a [[cone (geometry)|geometric cone]]. The individual plates of a cone are known as ''scales''.

The male cone ('''microstrobilus''' or '''pollen cone''') is structurally similar across all conifers, differing only in small ways (mostly in scale arrangement) from species to species. Extending out from a central axis are microsporophylls (modified leaves). Under each microsporophyll is one or several [[sporangium|microsporangia]] ([[pollen]] sacs).

The female cone ('''megastrobilus''', '''seed cone''', or '''ovulate cone''') contains [[ovule]]s which, when fertilized by pollen, become seeds. The female cone structure varies more markedly between the different conifer families, and is often crucial for the identification of many species of conifers.

==Female cone of the conifer families==

===Pinaceae cones===
[[Image:Picea Pungens Young Cones.jpg|thumb|right|Young cones of a [[ Blue Spruce]]]]

The members of the [[pinaceae|pine family]] ([[pine]]s, [[spruce]]s, [[fir]]s, [[Cedrus|cedar]]s, [[larch]]es, etc.) have cones that are imbricate (that is, with scales overlapping each other like fish scales). These are the "archetypal" cones. The scales are spirally arranged in [[fibonacci number]] ratios.

The female cone has two types of scale: the [[bract]] scales, derived from a modified leaf, and the seed scales (or ovuliferous scales), one [[subtended]] by each bract scale, derived from a highly modified [[branch#branchlet|branchlet]]. On the upper-side base of each seed scale are two ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization by pollen grains. The bract scales develop first, and are conspicuous at the time of pollination; the seed scales develop later to enclose and protect the seeds, with the bract scales often not growing further. The scales open temporarily to receive gametophytes, then close during fertilization and maturation, and then re-open again at maturity to allow the seed to escape. Maturation takes 6–8 months from pollination in most Pinaceae genera, but 12 months in cedars and 18–24 months (rarely more) in most pines. The cones open either by the seed scales flexing back when they dry out, or (in firs, cedars and [[pseudolarix|golden larch]]) by the cones disintegrating with the seed scales falling off. The cones are conic, [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] or [[ovoid]] (egg-shaped), and small to very large, from 2–60&amp;nbsp;cm long and 1–20&amp;nbsp;cm broad.

After ripening, the opening of non-[[serotinous]] pine cones is associated with their moisture content—cones are open when dry and closed when wet.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Colin; Vincent, Julian F. V.; Rocca, Anne-Marie. 1997. How pine cones open. Nature 390: 668.&lt;/ref&gt; This assures that the small, wind disseminated seeds will be dispersed during relatively dry weather, and thus, the distance traveled from the parent tree will be enhanced.  A pine cone will go through many cycles of opening and closing during its life span, even after seed dispersal is complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/bot00/bot00763.htm |title=Ask a Scientist: Pine Cone Wet and Dry |publisher=Newton.dep.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process occurs with older cones while attached to branches and even after the older cones have fallen to the [[forest floor]].  The condition of fallen pine cones is a crude indication of the forest floor's moisture content, which is an important indication of [[wildfire]] risk.  Closed cones indicate damp conditions while open cones indicate the forest floor is dry.

As a result of this, pine cones have often been used by people in temperate climates to predict dry and wet weather, usually hanging a harvested pine cone from some string outside to measure the humidity of the air.

===Araucariaceae cones===
[[File:Pinhas.jpg|thumb|''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]'' cones and nuts]]
Members of the [[Araucariaceae]] (''[[Araucaria]]'', ''[[Agathis]]'', ''[[Wollemia]]'') have the bract and seed scales fully fused, and have only one ovule on each scale. The cones are spherical or nearly so, and large to very large, 5–30&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, and mature in 18 months; at maturity, they disintegrate to release the seeds. In ''Agathis'', the seeds are winged and separate readily from the seed scale, but in the other two genera, the seed is wingless and fused to the scale.

===Podocarpaceae cones===
[[Image:Podocarpus macrophyllus (seed s3).jpg|left|thumb|Berry-like Podocarpus cone]]
The cones of the [[Podocarpaceae]] are similar in function, though not in development, to those of the Taxaceae (q.v. below), being berry-like with the scales highly modified, evolved to attract [[bird]]s into dispersing the seeds. In most of the genera, two to ten or more scales are fused together into a usually swollen, brightly coloured, soft, edible fleshy [[aril]]. Usually only one or two scales at the apex of the cone are fertile, each bearing a single wingless seed, but in ''[[Saxegothaea]]'' several scales may be fertile. The fleshy scale complex is 0.5–3&amp;nbsp;cm long, and the seeds 4–10&amp;nbsp;mm long. In some genera (e.g. ''[[Prumnopitys]]''), the scales are minute and not fleshy, but the seed coat develops a fleshy layer instead, the cone having the appearance of one to three small [[plum]]s on a central stem. The seeds have a hard coat evolved to resist digestion in the bird's stomach.

===Taxodiaceae cones===
[[Image:Sequoiadendron giganteum MHNT.BOT.2004.0.191.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sequoiadendron giganteum|Giant Sequoia]] cones]]
Members of the [[cupressaceae|cypress family]] ([[cupressus|cypresses]], [[thuja|arborvitae]], [[juniper]]s, [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwoods]], etc.) differ in that the bract and seed scales are fully fused, with the bract visible as no more than a small lump or spine on the scale. The botanical term [[galbulus]] (plural galbuli; from the [[Latin]] for a cypress cone) is sometimes used instead of strobilus for members of this family. The female cones have one to 20 ovules on each scale. They often have peltate scales, as opposed to the imbricate cones described above, though some have imbricate scales. The cones are usually small, {{convert|0.3|–|6|cm|in|abbr=in|disp=or|frac=32}} long, and often spherical or nearly so, like those of [[Nootka cypress]], while others, such as [[western redcedar]] and [[California incense-cedar]], are narrow. The scales are arranged either spirally, or in decussate whorls of two (opposite pairs) or three, rarely four. The genera with spiral scale arrangement were often treated in a separate family (Taxodiaceae) in the past. In most of the genera, the cones are woody and the seeds have two narrow wings (one along each side of the seed), but in three genera (''[[Platycladus]], [[Microbiota (plant)|Microbiota]]'' and ''[[Juniperus]]''), the seeds are wingless, and in ''Juniperus'', the cones are fleshy and [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sciadopityaceae cones===
The cones and seeds of ''[[Sciadopitys]]'' (the only member of the family) are similar to those of some Cupressaceae, but larger, 6–11&amp;nbsp;cm long; the scales are imbricate and spirally arranged, and have 5-9 ovules on each scale.

===Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae cones===
[[Image:Taxus baccata MHNT.jpg|left|thumb|Berry-like [[Taxus baccata|yew]] cone]]
Members of the yew family and the closely related Cephalotaxaceae have the most highly modified cones of any conifer. There is only one scale in the female cone, with a single poisonous ovule. The scale develops into a soft, brightly coloured sweet, juicy, berry-like aril which partly encloses the deadly seed. The seed alone is poisonous. The whole 'berry' with the seed is eaten by birds, which digest the sugar-rich scale and pass the hard seed undamaged in their droppings, so dispersing the seed far from the parent plant.

===Cycadaceae cones ===

Though not included under the conifers, this group of cone-bearing plants retains some types of 'primitive' characteristics.  Its leaves unfurl, much like ferns.  There are three extant families of [[Cycads]] of about 305 species.  It reproduces with large cones, and is related to the other conifers in that regard, but it does not have a woody trunk like most cone-bearing families.

===Welwitschiaceae cones ===

Like the Cycads, this unique cone-bearing plant is not considered a conifer, but belongs in the Order [[Welwitschiales]]. [[Welwitschia mirabilis]] is often called a [[living fossil]] and is the only species in its genus, which is the only genus in its family, which is the only family in its Order.  The male cones are on male plants, and female cones on female plants.  After emergence of the two [[cotyledons]], it sets only two more leaves.  Those two leaves then continue to grow longer from their base, much like fingernails.  This allows it great drought tolerance, which is likely why it has survived in the desert of [[Namibia]], while all other representatives from its order are now extinct.

==Location and distribution==
[[File:Male cone of Cedar of Lebanon.JPG|thumb|Male cone of Cedar of Lebanon]]
[[File:Larch with unusual terminal branch.JPG|thumb|left|Larch cone with unusual branch growth from tip]]

For most species found in Australia,  male and female cones occur on the same plant ([[tree]] or [[shrub]]), with female usually on the higher branches towards the top of the plant. This distribution is thought to improve chances of [[cross-fertilization]], as pollen is unlikely to be blown vertically upward within the crown of one plant, but can drift slowly upward in the wind, blowing from low on one plant to higher on another plant. In some conifers, male cones additionally often grow clustered in large numbers together, while female cones are more often produced singly or in only small clusters.

A further characteristic arrangement of pines is that the male cones are located at the base of the branch, while the female at the tip (of the same or a different branchlet). However, in larches and cedars, both types of cones are always at the tips of short shoots, while both sexes of fir cones are always from side buds, never terminal. There's also some diversity in bearing in Cupressaceae. Some, ''[[Cupressus]]'' for instance, has little or no differentiation in the positions of male and female cones.

===Cone crops===

Cone crop potential can be predicted in various ways. An early indication of a potential crop can be a period of abnormally hot, dry weather at the time of bud differentiation, particularly if the current and preceding cone crops have been poor (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).&lt;ref name="nien5"&gt;{{Silvics |last1=Nienstaedt |first1=Hans |first2=John C. |last2=Zasada |volume=1 |genus=Picea |species=glauca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of cone crop potential can be made by counting female reproductive buds in fall or winter, and an experienced observer can detect the subtle morphological differences and distinguish between reproductive buds and vegetative buds (Eis 1967b).&lt;ref name="eis2"&gt;Eis, S. 1967b. Cone crops of white and black spruce are predictable. For. Chron. 43(3):247–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

White spruce seed collection is expensive, and collection from cone caches of [[red squirrel]]s is probably the cheapest method. The viability of seed from cached cones does not vary during current caching, but viability drops essentially to zero after being in caches for 1 or 2 years (Wagg 1964).&lt;ref name="wagg"&gt;Wagg, J.W.B. 1964. Viability of white spruce seed from squirrel-cut cones. For. Chron. 40(1):98–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collection of cones in seed orchards has been facilitated by the counter-intuitive technique of “topping” and collection of cones from the severed crown tops at one-third the cost of collection from untopped [[tree]]s and without decreasing cone production (Slayton 1969, Nienstaedt 1981).&lt;ref name="slay"&gt;Slayton, S.H. 1969. A new technique for cone collection. USDA, For. Serv., Tree Plant. Notes 20(3):13. (Cited in Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nien1"&gt;Nienstaedt, H. 1981. Top pruning white spruce seed orchard grafts does not reduce cone production. USDA, For. Serv., Tree Plant. Notes 32(2):9–13. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudocones==
[[Image:Developing Pineapple Gall.JPG|thumb|left|Developing Pineapple pseudocone galls on Norway Spruce.]]
[[File:Sitka Spruce with Pineapple Gall.JPG|thumb|upright|Pseudocone on Sitka Spruce]]
[[Norway spruce|Norway]] and [[Sitka spruce]] are prone to the formation of [[Pineapple gall]] pseudocones caused by the woolly aphid, ''Adelges abietis''. These are not cones, although they closely resemble them.

[[Alder]] trees are not even conifers, however the mature seed bearing structures closely resemble cones.

==Cultural uses of cones==
[[Image:Pine cone cow on grass.jpg|thumb|Home-made spruce cone cow]]
[[Image:Blason ville fr Sarrant (Gers).svg|thumb|Cone in the coat of arms of [[Sarrant]].]]
Because of their widespread occurrence, conifer cones have been a traditional part of the [[handicraft|arts and crafts]] of cultures where conifers are common.  Examples of their use includes seasonal wreaths and decorations, fire starters, bird feeders, toys, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familycrafts.about.com/od/pineconecrafts/Pine_Cone_Craft_Projects.htm |title=Pine Cone Craft Projects |publisher=Familycrafts.about.com |date=2013-08-23 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An intriguing derivation of the [[impossible bottle]] [[mechanical puzzle]] takes advantage of the fact that pine cones open and close based on their level of dryness.  In constructing ''the pine cone in the bottle'' display, a closed, damp cone of suitable size is inserted into a narrow-mouthed bottle and allowed to open upon drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=zupperzipper |url=http://www.instructables.com/id/pine-cones-in-a-bottle |title=Pine Cone in the Bottle Display |publisher=Instructables |date=2008-07-13 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cone cows'' are traditional homemade [[toy]]s, made by children using material found in nature. The most common design is a [[spruce]] or pine cone with sticks or [[match]]es for legs, which can easily be attached by forcing them between the cone scales. Playing with cone cows often includes building an animal enclosure from sticks. For the most part, cone cows have been displaced by manufactured toys, at least in affluent countries, but the creation of cone cows still enjoys some popularity as an outdoor activity for children.

Cone cows are a part of children's culture in Finland where they are known as ''Käpylehmä'' (plural: ''Käpylehmät'') and [[Sweden]] where they are known as ''kottkor'' or ''kottdjur'' (cone animals). Schools and other institutions teach children how to make cone cows as part of outdoors education on nature and history.

In Finland there is a fairground with cone cow sculptures large enough for children to ride on. In Sweden, a video game was released in which the player may build virtual cone cows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/recensioner/spel/article109235.ab Kapsyljakt med Anki och Pytte review] "You build cone cows"&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish artist [[Lasse Åberg]] has created artwork with cone cows, which has been included in an [[alphabet book]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorstedt.se/templates/raben/Book.aspx?id=23250 Åbergs ABC]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "a little book about cone cows, small fears, swarming helicopters and such"&lt;/ref&gt; and featured on a Swedish [[postage stamp]] among other classic toys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cws.huginonline.com/P/134112/PR/200010/886184_2_12.html Posten.se press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913223636/http://cws.huginonline.com/P/134112/PR/200010/886184_2_12.html |date=2010-09-13 }} "Motives include [..] life in the countryside, which shows both the cone cow, a doll in a traditional outfit, and a horse and carriage toy"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postmuseum.posten.se/frimbas/frimarks/F2000043.asp Livet på landet] image of the stamp from the official postal site&lt;/ref&gt;

Cones are also occasionally used as a charge in [[heraldry|heraldic]] coats of arms.

===Symbolism===
Pinecones are symbolic for the Pineal Gland.
Pinecones were also used as symbols of fertility in ancient Assyrian art. In Christian symbolism, they were closely symbolically related to the tree of life. &lt;ref&gt;The Continuum Encyclopedia of Symbols by Udo Becker (2000) Page 234&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">A '''copywriting agency''' is a business that provides writing and editing services to businesses and other organizations. Like individual copywriters, [[copywriting]] agencies may offer writing on a for-hire or per-project basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://job-descriptions.careerplanner.com/Copy-Writers.cfm|title=Job Duties and Tasks for: "Copy Writer"|publisher=CareerPlanner.com|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, because copywriting agencies often offer the services of many staff members, they may offer a broader range of services than can individuals. These services include but not limited to writing, editing, content or marketing consulting, [[brand]]ing, [[Product naming|naming]], [[scriptwriting]], [[speechwriting]], [[information architecture]], print and [[web design]] and layout, [[Software engineering|software development]], [[social network]]ing consulting and implementation, and [[project management]]. An agency may also partner with other businesses—for example, design or advertising firms—or with in-house client teams. Depending on the project, agency staff may work onsite with the client, from the agency offices, or virtually from any location.

Copywriting agencies may be designed on an employee model, with full- or part-time employees providing services to clients. Others may work with a regular team of trusted contractors, while still others function more like middlemen, connecting clients and editorial freelancers and taking a cut of the proceeds from each project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careercenter.aaaa.org/jobs/5402501/copywriter|title=Copywriter|publisher=AAAA Career Center|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business and nonprofit clients often hire copywriting agencies for larger projects that fall outside of existing skills and time or staffing needs, or for projects that require expertise in a specific discipline or area of knowledge. Many agencies specialize in one or more industries—doing work for clients, for example, in publishing, finance, technology, biotechnology, medicine, agriculture, the environment, engineering, government, the military, education, the arts, or the nonprofit world. Others employ writers, editors, etc. with varying specialties, so as to work for a variety of clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-15/how-to-hire-an-ad-agencybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=How to Hire an Ad Agency|last=McKee|first=Steve|date=15 August 2007|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowing for overall economic trends, job prospects for both individual copywriters and copywriting agencies expanded during the 1990s and 2000s, for reasons including an increased need for production and editing of online contentand an increase in business outsourcing and freelancing. As of 2012, employment for freelance writers is expected to continue to grow.

'''Dancing Dots Braille Music Technology''', L.P., is an American company based in [[Philadelphia]] that was founded in 1992 to develop and adapt music technology for the blind. Its founder, Bill McCann, is a blind musician. Among the products it offers are several programs that produce a musical version of [[Braille]] by converting print [[musical notation]], allowing blind musicians access to the [[Sheet music|scores]] used by their sighted counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rudolph | first = Thomas E. | title = Teaching Music With Technology | publisher = GIA Publications | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-57999-313-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OnPnMsWOkVAC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22Dancing+Dots%22&amp;client=firefox-a | page = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also offers programs that aid blind musicians in [[Transcription (music)|transcribing]] their compositions to Braille.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams |first=John M. |title=Blind musicians get a techno boost |work=[[Business Week]] |date=2000-11-19 |accessdate=2008-10-27 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2000/nf20001129_316.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523214017/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2000/nf20001129_316.htm |archivedate=2011-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing Dots created the latter products to help speed the process of Braille transcription for blind composers, who might otherwise have to wait between two weeks and six months to have their compositions transcribed by one of the less than one hundred certified Braille music transcribers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Solomon | first = Karen | date = 2000-02-24 | title = You gotta feel the music | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | accessdate = 2008-10-26 | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/02/34495}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing Dots has developed more products to help blind musicians in the areas of [[MIDI]] and [[digital audio]] production and musical instruction.

==History==
The company was founded in 1992 by Bill McCann, a blind [[trumpeter]]. It struggled financially in its early years in the long lead between developing technology and releasing its first product in 1997, a difficult period assisted by federal contracts beginning in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Byrd | first = Jerry W. | title = U.S. says customer is king | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB2A64F8AAB5388&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | date = 1994-09-21 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the company released its GOODFEEL Braille Music Translator to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Jennifer | date = 1997-06-15 | title = Software Hits Right Note for Blind Musicians; Technology: GOODFEEL program translates music into Braille.

==Products and services==
Dancing Dots maintains a website at which it markets its products, as well as related and complementary products by other companies. Dancing Dots has customers throughout the U.S. and twenty-six other countries.

With GOODFEEL combined with a few mainstream products, sighted musicians can prepare a Braille score with no knowledge of braille. Music scanning software can be used to speed data entry. Blind users can make sound recordings and print and Braille editions of their compositions. The company provides customers who may not need to purchase their own copy of GOODFEEL a transcription service for individual scores.

Dancing Dots is also the publisher of several courses to assist blind musicians, including ''An Introduction to Music for the Blind Student: A Course in Braille Music Reading'' and ''An Introduction to the Piano for the Blind Student''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27742">In [[physics]] and [[cosmology]], '''digital physics''' is a collection of theoretical perspectives based on the premise that the [[universe]] is describable by [[information]]. It is a form of [[digital ontology]] about the physical reality. According to this theory, the universe can be conceived of as either the output of a deterministic or probabilistic computer program, a vast, digital computation device, or mathematically [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to such a device.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt;

==History==
The operations of [[computer]]s must be compatible with the principles of [[information theory]], [[statistical thermodynamics]], and [[quantum mechanics]]. In 1957, a link among these fields was proposed by [[Edwin Jaynes]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E. T., 1957, "[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics,]" ''Phys. Rev.'' 106: 620. &lt;br&gt;Jaynes, E. T., 1957, "[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.2.pdf Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics II,]" ''Phys. Rev.'' 108: 171.&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated an interpretation of [[probability theory]] as generalized Aristotelian [[logic]], a view linking fundamental physics with [[digital computers]], because these are designed to implement the [[logical operations|operations]] of [[classical logic]] and, equivalently, of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E. T., 1990, "[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prob.as.logic.pdf Probability Theory as Logic,]" in Fougere, P.F., ed., ''Maximum-Entropy and Bayesian Methods''. Boston: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis that the [[universe]] is a [[digital computer]] was proposed by [[Konrad Zuse]] in his book ''Rechnender Raum'' (translated into English as ''[[Calculating Space]]''). The term ''digital physics'' was{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} employed by [[Edward Fredkin]], who later came to prefer the term ''[[digital philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Fredkin's [http://www.digitalphilosophy.org Digital Philosophy web site.]&lt;/ref&gt; Others who have modeled the universe as a giant computer include [[Stephen Wolfram]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[A New Kind of Science]]'' [http://www.wolframscience.com website.] [http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_reviews.html Reviews of ANKS.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juergen Schmidhuber]],&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.,"&gt;Schmidhuber, J., "[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html Computer Universes and an Algorithmic Theory of Everything]"; [ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/everything.pdf A Computer Scientist's View of Life, the Universe, and Everything].&lt;/ref&gt; and Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]].&lt;ref&gt;G. 't Hooft, 1999, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9903084 Quantum Gravity as a Dissipative Deterministic System,]" ''Class. Quantum Grav.'' '''16''': 3263–79.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors hold that the [[probabilistic]] nature of [[quantum physics]] is not necessarily incompatible with the notion of computability. Quantum versions of digital physics have recently been proposed by [[Seth Lloyd]]&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, S., "[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501135 The Computational Universe: Quantum gravity from quantum computation.]"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paola Zizzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Zizzi, Paola, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0304032 Spacetime at the Planck Scale: The Quantum Computer View.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]'s binary theory of ur-alternatives, pancomputationalism, computational universe theory, [[John Archibald Wheeler]]'s "It from bit", and [[Max Tegmark]]'s [[ultimate ensemble]].

===Overview===
Digital physics suggests that there exists, at least in principle, a [[computer program|program]] for a [[universal computer]] that computes the evolution of the [[universe]]. The computer could be, for example, a huge [[cellular automaton]] (Zuse 1967&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuse, Konrad, 1967, Elektronische Datenverarbeitung vol 8., pages 336–344&lt;/ref&gt;), or a universal [[Turing machine]], as suggested by Schmidhuber (1997&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt;), who pointed out that there exists a short program that can compute all possible computable universes in an [[asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] way.

[[Loop quantum gravity]] could lend support to digital physics, in that it assumes space-time is quantized.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt; [[Paola Zizzi]] has formulated a realization of this concept in what has come to be called "computational loop quantum gravity", or CLQG.&lt;ref&gt;Zizzi, Paola, "[https://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0406069 A Minimal Model for Quantum Gravity.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zizzi, Paola, "[https://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0412076 Computability at the Planck Scale.]"&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories that combine aspects of digital physics with loop quantum gravity are those of Marzuoli and Rasetti&lt;ref&gt;Marzuoli, A. and Rasetti, M., 2002, "[https://arxiv.org/quant-ph/0209016 Spin Network Quantum Simulator,]" ''Phys. Lett.'' A306, 79–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marzuoli, A. and Rasetti, M., 2005, "[https://arxiv.org/quant-ph/0410105 Computing Spin Networks,]" ''Annals of Physics'' 318: 345–407.&lt;/ref&gt; and Girelli and Livine.&lt;ref&gt;Girelli, F.; Livine, E. R., 2005, "[https://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0501075]" ''Class. Quantum Grav.'' 22: 3295–3314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weizsäcker's ur-alternatives===
Physicist [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]'s [[theory of ur-alternatives]] (theory of archetypal objects), first publicized in his book ''The Unity of Nature'' (1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Weizsäcker |first1= Carl Friedrich |title= Die Einheit der Natur |date=1971 |publisher= Hanser |location=München |isbn= 978-3-446-11479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiz71&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker |first= Carl Friedrich |authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker |year= 1980 |title= The Unity of Nature |location= New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt; further developed through the 1990s,&lt;ref name=Weiz85&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | year= 1985 | title= Aufbau der Physik | location= [[Munich]] | isbn= 978-3-446-14142-1 | language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Weizsäcker|first1=Carl Friedrich |title=The Structure of Physics|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-1-4020-5234-7|pages=XXX, 360|edition=Görnitz, Thomas; Lyre, Holger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiz92&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | year= 1992 | title= Zeit und Wissen | language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of digital physics as it [[axiom]]atically constructs quantum physics from the distinction between empirically observable, binary alternatives. Weizsäcker used his theory to derive the 3-dimensionality of space and to estimate the [[entropy]] of a [[proton]]. In 1988 Görnitz has shown that Weizsäcker's assumption can be connected with the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Görnitz|first1=Thomas|title=Abstract Quantum Theory and Space-Time Structure  I. Ur Theory and Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|date=1988|volume=27|issue=5|pages=527–542|bibcode=1988IJTP...27..527G|doi=10.1007/BF00668835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pancomputationalism&lt;!--'Pancomputationalism' 'and 'Naturalist computationalism' redirect here--&gt;===
{{also|Metaphysical naturalism|Mathematicism}}
'''Pancomputationalism''' (also known as '''naturalist computationalism''')&lt;ref&gt;Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic, [https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.301.4845 "Info‐Computational Philosophy Of Nature: An Informational Universe With Computational Dynamics"] (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; is a view that the universe is a computational machine, or rather a network of computational processes which, following fundamental physical laws, computes (dynamically develops) its own next state from the current one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philpapers.org/browse/pancomputationalism Papers on pancomputationalism on philpapers.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

A computational universe is proposed by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in a paper based on Zuse's 1967 thesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/digitalphysics.html Zuse's Thesis]&lt;/ref&gt;. He pointed out that a simple explanation of the universe would be a [[Turing machine]] programmed to execute all possible programs computing all possible histories for all types of computable physical laws. He also pointed out that there is an optimally efficient way of computing all computable universes based on [[Leonid Levin]]'s universal search algorithm (published in 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Leonid|title = Universal search problems (Russian: Универсальные задачи перебора, Universal'nye perebornye zadachi)|journal = Problems of Information Transmission (Russian: Проблемы передачи информации, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii)|volume = 9|issue = 3|pages = 115–116|year = 1973}} [http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=ppi&amp;paperid=914&amp;volume=9&amp;year=1973&amp;issue=3&amp;fpage=115&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2000, he expanded this work by combining Ray Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference with the assumption that quickly computable universes are more likely than others. This work on digital physics also led to limit-computable generalizations of algorithmic information or [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and the concept of Super Omegas, which are limit-computable numbers that are even more random (in a certain sense) than [[Gregory Chaitin]]'s number of wisdom [[Chaitin's constant|Omega]].

===Wheeler's "it from bit"===

Following Jaynes and Weizsäcker, the physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler]] proposed an "it from bit" doctrine: information sits at the core of physics, and every "it", whether a particle or field, derives its existence from observations.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John Archibald; Ford, Kenneth (1998). ''Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics''. [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] {{ISBN|0-393-04642-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John A. (1990). "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links". In Zurek, Wojciech Hubert. ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. [[Addison-Wesley]]. {{ISBN|9780201515091}}. OCLC 21482771&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, David. J., 1995, "[http://consc.net/papers/facing.html Facing up to the Hard Problem of Consciousness]", ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'' 2(3): 200–19. This paper cites John A. Wheeler (1990) ''op. cit.'' Also see Chalmers, D., 1996. ''The Conscious Mind''. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The toughest nut to crack in Wheeler's research program of a digital dissolution of physical being in a unified physics, Wheeler says, is time. In a 1986 eulogy to the mathematician [[Hermann Weyl]], Wheeler proclaimed: "Time, among all concepts in the world of physics, puts up the greatest resistance to being dethroned from ideal continuum to the world of the discrete, of information, of bits. ... Of all obstacles to a thoroughly penetrating account of existence, none looms up more dismayingly than 'time.' Explain time? Not without explaining existence. Explain existence? Not without explaining time. To uncover the deep and hidden connection between time and existence ... is a task for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John Archibald, 1986, "[http://www.weylmann.com/wheeler.pdf Hermann Weyl and the Unity of Knowledge]", ''[[American Scientist]]'', 74: 366-375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eldred, Michael, 2009, '[http://www.arte-fact.org/dgtlon_e.html#ps2 Postscript 2: On quantum physics' assault on time]'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eldred, Michael, 2009, [http://www.arte-fact.org/dgtlcast.html ''The Digital Cast of Being: Metaphysics, Mathematics, Cartesianism, Cybernetics, Capitalism, Communication''] ontos, Frankfurt 2009 137 pp. {{ISBN|978-3-86838-045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital vs. informational physics===
Not every informational approach to physics (or [[ontology]]) is necessarily [[Ontology (computer science)|digital]]. According to [[Luciano Floridi]],&lt;ref&gt;Floridi, L., 2004, "[http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV37Floridi.pdf Informational Realism,]" in Weckert, J., and Al-Saggaf, Y, eds., ''Computing and Philosophy Conference'', vol. 37."&lt;/ref&gt; "informational structural realism" is a variant of [[structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|structural]] [[scientific realism|realism]] that supports an ontological commitment to a world consisting of the totality of informational objects dynamically interacting with each other. Such informational objects are to be understood as constraining affordances.

Pancomputationalists like Lloyd (2006), who models the universe as a [[quantum computer]], can still maintain an analogue or hybrid ontology; and informational ontologists like [[Kenneth M. Sayre|Kenneth Sayre]] and Floridi embrace neither a digital ontology nor a pancomputationalist position.&lt;ref&gt;See Floridi talk on Informational Nature of Reality, abstract at the E-CAP conference 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational foundations==

===Turing machines===
{{Main|Turing machine}}

===The Church–Turing–Deutsch thesis===
The classic [[Church–Turing thesis]] claims that any computer as powerful as a [[Turing machine]] can, in principle, calculate anything that a human can calculate, given enough time. Turing moreover showed that there exist [[universal Turing machine]]s which can compute anything any other Turing machine can compute—that they are generalizable Turing machines. &lt;!-- A stronger version, not attributable to Church or Turing,&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Jack Copeland]], ''Computation'' in Luciano Floridi (ed.), ''The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of computing and information'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, ISBN 0-631-22919-1, pp. 10–15&lt;/ref&gt; claims that [Surely not that universal Turing machines exist! That isn't even a "claim", let alone a stronger one]. --&gt; But the limits of practical computation are set by [[physics]], not by theoretical computer science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Turing did not show that his machines can solve any problem that can be solved 'by instructions, explicitly stated rules, or procedures', nor did he prove that the universal Turing machine 'can compute any function that any computer, with any architecture, can compute'. He proved that his universal machine can compute any function that any Turing machine can compute; and he put forward, and advanced philosophical arguments in support of, the thesis here called Turing's thesis. But a thesis concerning the extent of effective methods—which is to say, concerning the extent of procedures of a certain sort that a human being unaided by machinery is capable of carrying out—carries no implication concerning the extent of the procedures that machines are capable of carrying out, even machines acting in accordance with 'explicitly stated rules.' For among a machine's repertoire of atomic operations there may be those that no human being unaided by machinery can perform."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: "[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/church-turing/#Bloopers The Church–Turing thesis]" – by [[B. Jack Copeland]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, a modification of Turing's assumptions ''does'' bring practical computation within Turing's limits; as [[David Deutsch]] puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I can now state the physical version of the Church–Turing principle: 'Every ''finitely'' realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by ''finite'' means.' This formulation is both better defined and more physical than Turing's own way of expressing it."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Deutsch]], "Quantum Theory, the Church–Turing Principle and the Universal Quantum Computer."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Emphasis added)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This compound conjecture is sometimes called the "strong Church–Turing thesis" or the [[Church–Turing–Deutsch principle]]. It is stronger because a human or Turing machine computing with pencil and paper (under Turing's conditions) is a finitely realizable physical system.

==Experimental confirmation==

So far there is no experimental confirmation of either binary or quantized nature of the universe, which are basic for digital physics.
The few attempts made in this direction would include the experiment with [[holometer]] designed by [[Craig Hogan]], which among others would detect a bit structure of space-time.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Salles, "Do we live in a 2-D hologram? New Fermilab experiment will test the nature of the universe", Fermilab Office of Communication, August 26, 2014
[http://www.fnal.gov/pub/presspass/press_releases/2014/2-D-Hologram-20140826.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The experiment started collecting data in August 2014.

A new result of the experiment released on December 3, 2015, after a year of data collection, has ruled out Hogan's theory of a pixelated universe to a high degree of statistical significance (4.6 sigma). The study found that [[space-time]] is not [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] at the scale being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.fnal.gov/2015/12/holometer-rules-out-first-theory-of-space-time-correlations/|title=Holometer rules out first theory of space-time correlations {{!}} News|website=news.fnal.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Physical symmetries are continuous===
One objection is that extant models of digital physics are incompatible {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} with the existence of several continuous characters of physical [[symmetry in physics|symmetries]], e.g., [[rotational symmetry]], [[translational symmetry]], [[Lorentz symmetry]], and the [[Lie group]] gauge invariance of [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills theories]], all central to current physical theory.

Proponents of digital physics claim that such continuous symmetries are only convenient (and very good) approximations of a discrete reality. For example, the reasoning leading to systems of [[natural units]] and the conclusion that the [[Planck length]] is a minimum meaningful unit of distance suggests that at some level, space itself is quantized.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, computers can manipulate and solve formulas describing real numbers using [[symbolic computation]], thus avoiding the need to approximate real numbers by using an infinite number of digits.

A number—in particular a [[real number]], one with an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of digits—was defined by [[Turing]] to be [[computable real|computable]] if a [[Turing machine]] will continue to spit out digits endlessly. In other words, there is no "last digit". But this sits uncomfortably with any proposal that the universe is the output of a virtual-reality exercise carried out in real time (or any plausible kind of time). Known physical laws (including [[quantum mechanics]] and its [[continuous spectrum|continuous spectra]]) are very much infused with [[real number]]s and the mathematics of the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"So ordinary computational descriptions do not have a cardinality of states and state space trajectories that is sufficient for them to map onto ordinary mathematical descriptions of natural systems. Thus, from the point of view of strict mathematical description, the thesis that everything is a computing system in this second sense cannot be supported".&lt;ref name="Piccinini"&gt;[[Gualtiero Piccinini|Piccinini, Gualtiero]], 2007, "Computational Modelling vs. Computational Explanation:  Is Everything a Turing Machine, and Does It Matter to the Philosophy of Mind?" ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' 85(1): 93–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For his part, [[David Deutsch]] generally takes a "[[multiverse]]" view to the question of continuous vs. discrete. In short, he thinks that “within each universe all observable quantities are discrete, but the multiverse as a whole is a continuum. When the equations of quantum theory describe a continuous but not-directly-observable transition between two values of a discrete quantity, what they are telling us is that the transition does not take place entirely within one universe. So perhaps the price of continuous motion is not an infinity of consecutive actions, but an infinity of concurrent actions taking place across the multiverse.”  January, 2001 The Discrete and the Continuous, an abridged version of which appeared in The Times Higher Education Supplement.

===Locality===
Some argue that extant models of digital physics violate various postulates of [[quantum physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review on ''A New Kind of Science'' by Stephen Wolfram|journal=Quantum Information and Computation (QIC)|date=September 2002|arxiv=quant-ph/0206089}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if these models are not grounded in [[Hilbert space]]s and probabilities, they belong to the class of theories with local [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] that have so far been ruled out experimentally using [[Bell's theorem]]. This criticism has two possible answers. First, any notion of locality in the digital model does not necessarily have to correspond to locality formulated in the usual way in the emergent [[spacetime]]. A concrete example of this case was given by [[Lee Smolin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=September 2012}} Another possibility is a well-known loophole in [[Bell's theorem]] known as [[superdeterminism]] (sometimes referred to as predeterminism).&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Bell, 1981, "Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality," ''Journal de Physique'' '''42''' C2: 41–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In a completely deterministic model, the experimenter's decision to measure certain components of the spins is predetermined. Thus, the assumption that the experimenter could have decided to measure different components of the spins than he actually did is, strictly speaking, not true.

[[File:Słuchawki referencyjne K-701 firmy AKG.jpg|thumb|Headphones on a stand]] 

'''Headphones''' (or '''head-phones''' in the early days of telephony and radio) are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They are [[electroacoustics (acoustical engineering)|electroacoustic]] [[transducer]]s, which convert an [[electrical signal]] to a corresponding [[sound]]. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a [[loudspeaker]], which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear.   Headphones are also known as '''earspeakers, earphones'''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/earphone |title=earphone |accessdate=4 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119123425/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/earphone |archivedate=19 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or, [[colloquially]], '''cans'''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley R. Alten ''Audio Basics'' Cengage 2011 {{ISBN|0-495-91356-1}} page&amp;nbsp;63&lt;/ref&gt; Circumaural ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place.  The other type, known as '''earbuds''' or '''earpieces'''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal.  In the context of [[telecommunication]], a [[Headset (audio)|headset]] is a combination of headphone and [[microphone]]. Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio [[amplifier]], [[radio]], [[CD player]], [[portable media player]], [[mobile phone]], [[video game console]], or [[electronic musical instrument]], either directly using a cord, or using [[wireless]] technology such as [[Bluetooth]], [[DECT]] or [[FM radio]].  The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]], to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of [[Hi fi|high fidelity]] headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|title=Headphones : The Ultimate buying guide - Hi-fidelity headphones|website=StereoCompare|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307135117/http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Headphones are made in a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities.  Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the [[high fidelity]] of expensive units designed for music listening by [[audiophile]]s.   Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) [[phone connector (audio)|phone jack]] for plugging the headphones into the audio source. Some stereo earbuds are wireless, using [[Bluetooth]] connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829052849/http://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |archivedate=2016-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Due to the spread of wireless devices in recent years headphones are increasingly used by people in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit.  Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as [[audio engineer]]s mixing sound for live concerts or [[sound recording]]s and [[DJ]]s, who use headphones to [[cue (audio)|cue]] up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and [[call center]] employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.

=={{anchor|history}}History==
[[Image:Brandes Superior Matched Tone c. 1919-21.jpg|thumb|right|Brandes radio headphones, circa 1920]]
Headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece, and were the only way to listen to electrical [[audio signal]]s before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by [[Nathaniel Baldwin]], who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=181|title=Howeth: Chapter XI|date=1963|work=|accessdate=5 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html Utah History To Go. ''Ruin Followed Riches for a Utah Genius'' (Will Bagley for the Salt Lake Tribune, July 8, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911070726/http://www.historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html |date=September 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early headphones used [[Moving iron speaker|moving iron drivers]],&lt;ref name="hearthis"/&gt; with either single-ended or balanced armatures.  The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm.  The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves.  The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor [[sound quality]]. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] varied; headphones used in [[telegraph]] and telephone work had an impedance of 75&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]s. Those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity. Impedance of 1000 to 2000&amp;nbsp;ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and [[triode]] receivers.  Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.

In early powered radios, the headphone was part of the [[vacuum tube]]'s [[Plate electrode|plate]] circuit and carried dangerous voltages. It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded. The use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if they touched the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset.

In 1958, [[John C. Koss]], an [[audiophile]] and [[jazz musician]] from [[Milwaukee]], produced the first stereo headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founded 1958 - World's First SP/3 Stereophone|url=https://www.koss.com/history/|website=koss.com|accessdate=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183148/https://www.koss.com/history/|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hearthis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Now hear this: the history of headphones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|last=Smith|first=Caspar|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 October 2011|accessdate=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913182953/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, headphones were used only by the US navy, telephone and radio operators, and individuals in similar industries.&lt;ref name="hearthis"/&gt;

Smaller earbud type earpieces, which plugged into the user's ear canal, were first developed for [[hearing aids]]. They became widely used with [[transistor radio]]s, which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the [[Regency TR-1]]. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere.  The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a [[crystal earpiece|piezoelectric crystal]] to produce sound.  The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm radio and [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]], which is the most commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio, which was released in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony history 1960s|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|website=Sony official website|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205195855/http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|archivedate=2016-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model: &lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-sony-1960-efm-117j-radio-47603127|title=Vintage Sony 1960’S EFM-117J Radio|website=[[WorthPoint]]|accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the [[Walkman]] portable tape player in 1979.

== Applications ==
Headphones may be used with stationary [[Compact disc player|CD]] and [[DVD player]]s, [[home cinema|home theater]], [[personal computer]]s, or portable devices (e.g., [[digital audio player]]/[[MP3 player]], [[mobile phone]]). [[Cordless]] headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a [[radio]] or [[infrared]] signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a [[Silent disco]] or [[Silent Gig]].
[[File:Headphones-Sennheiser-HD555.jpg|thumb|[[Sennheiser]] HD 555 headphones, used in [[Audio Production|audio production]] environments (2007)]]
In the [[professional audio]] sector, headphones are used in live situations by [[disc jockey]]s with a [[DJ mixer]], and [[sound engineer]]s for monitoring signal sources. In radio studios, [[DJ]]s use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate [[acoustic feedback]] while monitoring their own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones.

Wired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable. The most common connectors are 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm (¼″) and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connectors]]. The larger 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today. Adapters are available for converting between 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm devices.

== Electrical characteristics ==
[[Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers]] may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers.

=== Impedance ===
Headphones are available with low or high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (typically measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz). Low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32&amp;nbsp;ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600&amp;nbsp;ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered [[CMOS]]-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.

The impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. To ensure an even frequency response, adequate [[damping factor]], and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siau |first=John |title=The "0-Ohm" Headphone Amplifier |url=http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210012625/http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient, but also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but produce less volume for a given output level.

Historically, many headphones had relatively high impedance, often over 500&amp;nbsp;ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance [[Valve amplifier#Operation|tube amplifiers]]. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external [[headphone amplifier]] may be beneficial.

=== Sensitivity ===
Sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound. It thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level. It can be measured in [[decibel]]s of [[sound pressure]] level per milli[[watt]] (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per [[volt]] (dB (SPL) / V).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608015203/http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably.  As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using [[Ohm's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\mathrm{V} = \mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\mathrm{mW} - 10 \cdot \log_{10}{\frac{\mathrm{Impedance}}{1000}}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, online calculators can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headphone Sensitivity &amp; Efficiency Calculator|url=http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115085636/http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|archivedate=15 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the sensitivity per volt is known, the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage.  For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100&amp;nbsp;dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 [[root mean square]] (RMS) [[voltage]] produces a maximum volume of 100&amp;nbsp;dB.

Pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones.  The maximum [[sound pressure]] level is a matter of preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120&amp;nbsp;dB.  In contrast, the American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] recommends an average SPL of no more than 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the [[European Union]] standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40–4000&amp;nbsp;Hz noise) of no more than 100&amp;nbsp;dB to avoid accidental hearing damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BS EN 50332 tests for headphones and earphones with portable music players|accessdate=22 November 2014|ref=http://www.isvr.co.uk/labtests/en50332.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110&amp;nbsp;dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage.

The sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125&amp;nbsp;dB/mW and usually measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Earphone/Headphone Specifications |url=http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2991/~/understanding-earphone-%2F-headphone-specifications |work=Shure Customer Help |publisher=Shure |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Headphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability. Generally, headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories: ''circumaural (over-ear)'', ''supra-aural (on-ear)'', ''earbud'' and ''in-ear''.

=== Circumaural ===
[[Image:Headphones 1.jpg|thumb|Circumaural headphones have large pads that surround the outer ear.]]
'''Circumaural headphones''' (sometimes called '''full size headphones''' or over-ear headphones) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears. Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise. Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over {{convert|500|g|lb|0}}. Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight. These are commonly used by drummers in recording.

=== Supra-aural ===
[[Image:GradoPrestige-HeadphoneArticle.jpg|thumb|A pair of supra-aural (on-ear) headphones]]
'''Supra-aural headphones''' or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with [[personal stereo]]s during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.

=== Open or closed back ===
Both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups:

'''Open-back''' headphones have the back of the earcups open. This leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone, but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound, due to including sounds from the environment.

'''Closed-back''' (or sealed) styles have the back of the earcups closed. They usually block some of the ambient noise. Closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones.

'''Semi-open''' headphones, have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Some{{Who|date=July 2015}} believe the term "semi-open" is purely there for marketing purposes. There is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone. Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents.

=== Ear-fitting headphones ===

Since the early days of the [[transistor radio]], earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices. They are sold at times with foam pads for comfort. (The use of the term ''earbuds'', which has been around since at least 1984, did not hit its peak until after 2001, with the success of Apple's MP3 player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202030114/https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==== In-ear headphones ====
{{Main article|In-ear monitor}}
[[Image:InEarMonitors.jpg|thumb|upright|In-ear monitors extend into the ear canal, providing isolation from outside noise.]]
In-ear headphones, also known as in-ear monitors (IEMs) or canalphones, are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the [[ear canal]] itself. IEMs are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by [[audio engineer]]s and [[musician]]s as well as audiophiles.

The outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials, such as plastic, [[aluminum]], ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headphones as a Driving Distraction|url=https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|publisher=The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents|format=pdf|accessdate=14 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023105/https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generic or custom-fitting ear canal plugs are made from [[silicone]] rubber, [[elastomer]], or foam. Custom in-ear headphones use castings of the ear canal to create custom-molded plugs that provide added comfort and noise isolation.&lt;ref name="timebuds" /&gt;

==== Mixed fitting pivoting earphones ====

This type combines advantages of earbuds and in-ear headphones – depending on the environment and requirements of the user, they provide passive noise reduction for quality mode (conversation or active music listening) or they give control over the sound environment around user in comfort mode (stand by or background voice/music listening).{{cn|date=August 2017}}

=== Headset ===
{{Main article|Headset (audio)}}
[[File:Plantronics headset.jpg|thumb|left|A typical example of a headset used for [[voice chat]]s]]

A headset is a headphone combined with a [[microphone]]. Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.

==== Telephone headsets ====
[[File:Se bluetooth headset.jpg|thumb|[[Sony Ericsson]] Cordless bluetooth headset]]
Telephone headsets connect to a [[fixed-line]] telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the [[handset]] of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are fitted with a standard [[4P4C]] commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless [[bluetooth]] headsets are available, and often used with [[mobile telephone]]s. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by [[call centre]] workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.

For older models of telephones, the headset microphone [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is different from that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound [[amplifier|amplification]] for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or [[AC adaptor]]s.

== Ambient noise reduction ==
[[File:In-ears-earphones.png|thumb|left|In-ears are among those good for noise isolation]]

Unwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation, or, often in conjunction with isolation, by active [[Noise-cancelling headphones|noise cancellation]].

Passive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12&amp;nbsp;dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers to facilitate the drummer monitoring the recorded sound while reducing sound directly from the drums as much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25&amp;nbsp;dB.

Active noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20&amp;nbsp;dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments with other types of noise.

== Transducer technology ==
Headphones use various types of [[transducer]] to convert electrical signals to sound.

=== Moving-coil ===
[[Image:Headphone-transducer.jpg|thumb|right|A typical moving-coil headphone transducer]]
The [[Loudspeaker|moving coil driver]], more commonly referred to as a "dynamic" driver is the most common type used in headphones.  It consists of a stationary [[magnet]] element affixed to the frame of the headphone, which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or [[Neodymium magnet|neodymium]].  A [[voice coil]], a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like.   When the varying current of an [[audio signal]] is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field that reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air to produce [[sound wave]]s.

=== Electrostatic ===
[[Image:Es spk.gif|thumb|right|Electrostatic loudspeaker diagram]]
Electrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated. Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon. In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1000&amp;nbsp;volts.

Due to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane, often only a few micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;kHz. The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with moving coil drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.{{citation needed|reason=Such broad claims need sources|date=May 2015}}

Electrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100&amp;nbsp;V to over 1&amp;nbsp;kV, and are on the user's head. Since the invention of insulators, there's no actual danger. They do not need to deliver significant [[electric current]], which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault.

=== Electret ===
An [[electret]] driver functions along the same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver. However the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, whereas electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator. Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon. Original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics.

===Orthodynamic===

Orthodynamic (also known as Planar Magnetic) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones, with some fundamental differences. They operate similarly to [[Loudspeaker#Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers|Planar Magnetic Loudspeakers]].

An orthodynamic driver consists of a relatively large membrane that contains an embedded wire pattern. This membrane is suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets.
A current passed through the wires embedded in the membrane produces a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent magnets to induce movement in the membrane, which produces sound.

=== Balanced armature ===
[[Image:Bal Arm.JPG|thumb|left|Balanced armature transducer with armature balanced and exerting no force on diaphragm]]

A balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is [[electric current]] through the coil, it [[Electromagnet|magnetizes]] the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to make [[sound]].

[[Image:JH16 Balanced Armatures.jpg|upright|thumb|A custom in-ear monitor which uses 8 balanced armatures in a triple crossover configuration (4 low/2 mid/2 high). Headphone designs often use multiple balanced armatures to provide a higher fidelity sound.]]
The design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=isn't more sound from less power the definition of high efficiency?}}. Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during [[World War II]] for use in military [[sound powered telephone]]s. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, in the range of 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.

Today they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids, where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage.&lt;ref&gt;

They generally are limited at the extremes of the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20&amp;nbsp;Hz and above 16&amp;nbsp;kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.

The earliest loudspeakers for radio receivers used balanced armature drivers for their cones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IMSAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&amp;dq=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmp-GsiOTXAhWhwFQKHV8fD80Q6AEILjAB|title=A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System: The early years (1875-1925)|last=Joel|first=Amos E.|last2=Laboratories|first2=Bell Telephone|last3=Schindler|first3=G.

=== Thermoacoustic technology ===
The thermoacoustic effect generates sound from the audio frequency Joule heating of the conductor, an effect that is not magnetic and does not vibrate the speaker.
In 2013 a carbon nanotube thin-yarn earphone based on the thermoacoustic mechanism was demonstrated by a research group in Tsinghua University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang Wei |author2=Xiaoyang Lin |author3=Kaili Jiang |author4=Peng Liu |author5=Qunqing Li |author6=Shoushan Fan |title=Thermoacoustic Chips with Carbon Nanotube Thin Yarn Arrays. |journal=Nano Letters |year=2013 |doi=10.1021/nl402408j |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl402408j |pmid=24041369 |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=4795–801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The as-produced CNT thin yarn earphone has a working element called CNT thin yarn thermoacoustic chip. Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Other transducer technologies ===
Transducer technologies employed much less commonly for headphones include the [[Oskar Heil|Heil]] [[Air Motion Transformer]] (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and [[Plasma speaker|Plasma-ionisation]]. The first [[Air Motion Transformer|Heil AMT]] headphone was marketed by [[ESS Laboratories]] and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter from one of the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only [[Precide]] of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models used a flat sheet of film that limited the maximum volume of air movement. Currently, TakeT produces a piezoelectric film headphone shaped similarly to an AMT transducer but, which like the Precide driver, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.

[[Magnetostriction]] headphones, sometimes sold under the label ''Bonephones'', work by vibrating against the side of head, transmitting sound via [[bone conduction]]. This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed, or for people who are [[deaf]] for reasons that don't affect the nervous apparatus of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Magnetostriction headphones though, are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, in the early 1990s, a French company called Plasmasonics tried to market a plasma-ionisation headphone. There are no known functioning examples left.

== Benefits and limitations ==
[[Image:Sony MDR-V6 headphones.jpg|thumb|Two [[Sony MDR-V6]] headphones, one folded for travel]]
Headphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound, either for [[privacy]] or to prevent disturbing others, as in listening in a public [[library]]. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20&amp;nbsp;Hz within 3&amp;nbsp;dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15" or 18") [[speaker driver]] to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, as is the case with [[in-ear monitor]] headphones). Headphones' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that they only need to move relatively small volumes of air.

Marketed claims such as 'frequency response 4&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz' are usually overstatements; the product's response at frequencies lower than 20&amp;nbsp;Hz is typically very small.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html cnet reviews: Headphone Buying Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820010315/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html |date=2011-08-20 }} "Even the flimsiest, cheap headphones routinely boast extremely low bass-response performance—15 or 20Hz—but almost always sound lightweight and bright."&lt;/ref&gt; 
Headphones are also useful for [[video game]]s that use 3D positional audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gun fire).

Although modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo recordings]] since the release of the [[Walkman]], there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard [[Panning (audio)|panned]] sounds are also heard only in one ear rather than from one side.

[[Binaural recording]]s use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2&amp;nbsp;kHz, often using a [[dummy head recording|dummy head]]. They can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening is more common than headphone listening.

It is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones, to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction, by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels.

Headsets can have [[ergonomic]] benefits over traditional telephone handsets. They allow [[call centre|call center]] agents to maintain better [[human position|posture]] without needing to hand-hold a [[transceiver#Telephony|handset]] or tilt their head sideways to cradle it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/checklist.html United States Department of Labor.

== Dangers and volume solutions ==

Using headphones at a sufficiently high [[volume]] level may cause temporary or permanent [[hearing impairment]] or [[deafness]]. The headphone volume often has to compete with the [[background noise]], especially in loud places such as subway stations, aircraft, and large crowds.

[[Koss Corporation|Koss]] introduced the "Safelite" line of cassette players in 1983 with such a warning light. The line was discontinued two years later for lack of interest.

The government of [[France]] has imposed a limit on all music players sold in the country:&lt;ref name="imposed"&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/1364&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en Europa.eu.

Motorcycle and other power-sport riders benefit by wearing foam earplugs when legal to do so to avoid excessive road, engine, and wind noise, but their ability to hear music and [[intercom]] speech is actually enhanced when doing so. The ear can normally detect 1-billionth of an atmosphere of sound pressure level,&lt;ref&gt;A standard [[threshold of hearing]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] for the human ear is 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] ({{cite web |last=Marsh |first=Andrew |title=Human Ear and Hearing |url=http://www.kemt.fei.tuke.sk/Predmety/KEMT320_EA/_web/Online_Course_on_Acoustics/hearing.html |work=Online Course on Acoustics |publisher=The School of Architecture and Fine Arts, The University of Western Australia |accessdate=23 August 2010 |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721180215/http://www.kemt.fei.tuke.sk/Predmety/KEMT320_EA/_web/Online_Course_on_Acoustics/hearing.html |archivedate=21 July 2010 |df= }}); Standard [[atmospheric pressure]] is 101,325&amp;nbsp;Pa. 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; / 100,000 = 0.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;, a ratio of less than a billionth.&lt;/ref&gt; hence it is incredibly sensitive. At very high sound pressure levels, muscles in the ear tighten the tympanic membrane and this leads to a small change in the geometry of the ossicles and stirrup that results in lower transfer of force to the oval window of the inner ear (the [[acoustic reflex]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/sound/protect.html#c1|title=The Ear's Protective Mechanisms|work=gsu.edu|accessdate=21 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503013758/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/protect.html#c1|archivedate=3 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of hearing damage also depends on the exposure time. The higher the volume, the faster hearing loss occurs. According to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] work safety guidelines, workers should be exposed to 90dBA noise for a maximum of 8 hours to avoid hearing loss. An increase to just 95dBA cuts the safe exposure to only 4 hours. But there is little specific consensus on the safe level of exposure. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] has an 8-hour recommended exposure limit set to 85dBA. Additionally, an increase to 93dBA instead of 95dBA halves the safe exposure time to 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-noise.pdf|title=OSHA Fact Sheet Laboratory Safety Noise|last=|first=|date=|website=OSHA.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231722/https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-noise.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-29|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have found that people are more likely to raise volumes to unsafe levels while performing strenuous exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Loud Noise during Exercise Damage my Hearing?|url=http://www.healthyhearing.com/content/faqs/Hearing-loss/Causes/31070-Loud-noise-during-exercise|website=Healthy Hearing|accessdate=8 November 2014|location=Item 4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109002409/http://www.healthyhearing.com/content/faqs/Hearing-loss/Causes/31070-Loud-noise-during-exercise|archivedate=9 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Finnish study&lt;ref&gt;Airo, Erkko; J.

(1996)&lt;/ref&gt; recommended that exercisers should set their headphone volumes to half of their normal loudness and only use them for half an hour.

Noise cancelling headphones can be considered dangerous because of a lack of awareness the listener may have with their environment. Noise cancelling headphones are so effective that a person may not be able to hear oncoming traffic or pay attention to people around them. There is also a general danger that music in headphones can distract the listener and lead to dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/w_DietAndFitnessNews/deaf-danger-perils-earbuds-exercising/story?id=13925714#.UcMJhufVDoI |title=Deaf to Danger: The Perils of Earbuds |last1=Greenfield |first1=Paige |date=25 June 2011 |website=ABC News |accessdate=20 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214122323/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/w_DietAndFitnessNews/deaf-danger-perils-earbuds-exercising/story?id=13925714#.UcMJhufVDoI |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual way of limiting sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power. This has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of the efficiency of the headphones; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency, high-impedance equipment, while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient earphones.

The '''history of flower arrangement''' dates back to [[ancient Egyptian]] times.

== The Ancient Egyptians ==
The earliest known flower arranging dates back to ancient Egypt.  Egyptians were decorating with flowers as early as 2,500 BCE.  They regularly placed cut flowers in [[vase]]s,&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210629/floral-decoration, Encyclopædia Britannica,  "Floral decoration," retrieved 15 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  and highly stylized arrangements were used during burials, for processions, and simply as table decorations. Illustrations of arranged flowers have been found on Egyptian carved stone reliefs and painted wall decorations.

Flowers were selected according to symbolic meaning, with emphasis on religious significance.  The [[lotus flower]] or [[Nelumbo|water lily]], for example, was considered sacred to [[Isis]] and was often included in arrangements.  Many other flowers have been found in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians, and [[garlands]] of flowers were worn by loved ones and left at the tombs.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060629-egypt-flowers.html, John Roach, National Geographic News, "Ancient Flowers Found in Egypt Coffin", 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included blue [[scilla]], poppy-flowered [[anemone]], ''[[Iris sibirica]]'', [[delphinium]], [[narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[palm tree]], [[papyrus]] and [[rose]].&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; Egyptian wall paintings depicting roses have been found in tombs dating from the fifth century B.C. to Cleopatra’s time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flowermonthclub.com/flower-history|title=History of Flowers - Fresh Flower Facts {{!}} Flower of the Month Club|work=The Fresh Cut Flower of the Month Club|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The Ancient Greeks and Romans ==
The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also used flowers. The ancient Greeks used flowers and herbs for adornment and decorations included in artwork. They did not often use vases, focusing instead on [[garlands]] and [[wreaths]]. They would place plant material, such as olive branches, in terracotta. The leafy branches were probably used for weddings. They also tossed petals onto floors and beds. Like the Egyptians, the Greeks and Romans had preferences for the flowers and foliage they used.

The most popular foliage used by the Greeks and the Romans were [[acorn]]s, [[oak]] leaves, [[Bay Laurel|laurel]], [[ivy]], [[bay]]{{clarify|date=August 2018}} and [[parsley]]. [[Laurel wreath]]s were presented to winners of athletic competitions in the ancient [[Olympics]]; these wreaths were also awarded to individuals winning competition in poetic meets, while in Rome they symbolized a military victory and crowned the successful commander in honor of his triumph. The garland wreath was a symbol to the Greeks of power, honor, allegiance, dedication; it was awarded in honor of athletes, poets, civic leaders, soldier, and heroes.

The preferred flowers include roses, [[hyacinths]], [[honeysuckle]], [[Violet (plant)|violets]], and [[lilies]].  Other flowers such as [[tulips]], [[Consolida|larkspur]], and [[Tagetes|marigold]]s were also selected for their shape, color, and form.

Wealth and power led the Romans and Greeks to the greater luxury in the use of flowers which, like the Egyptian, were used in religious rites. At banquets, roses were strewn on the floor to a depth of one foot, and the flowers "rained" from the ceiling. The fragrance of so many roses was almost suffocating. The Romans used the roses at many meals and because of its overwhelming fragrance it{{vague|date=February 2014}} was known as the "Hour of Rose". 

== Ancient China ==
The Chinese were making flower arrangements as far back as 207 BCE to 220 CE, in the [[Han Dynasty|Han era of ancient China]].  Flowers were an integral component of religious teaching and medicine.

Practitioners of [[Buddhist|Buddhism]], [[Taoist|Taoism]], and [[Confucian]]ism placed cut flowers on their altars, a practice which dates back to 618-906 CE.  They created paintings, carvings, and embroidered items with depictions of flowers.  The paintings can be found on vases, plates, scrolls, and silk, while carvings were done on wood, bronze, jade and ivory.

Buddhist teachings forbade the taking of a life, so religious practitioners worked sparingly when taking cuttings from plants.  Flowers and leaves that were used to make basket arrangements were selected based on their symbolic meaning.  For example, the [[bamboo]], the [[peach]] tree, and the [[pear]] tree symbolized [[longevity]].  The [[wikt:tiger lily|tiger lily]], the [[pomegranate]], and the [[orchid]] symbolized [[fertility]].  The most honored of all flowers was the [[peony]].  Considered the “king of flowers”, it symbolized wealth, good fortune, and high status.

During the period 500CE to 1453CE, the [[Byzantine Empire]] made its contribution to floral arrangements, which typically included a cone shape design.  The foliage was placed in [[chalice]]s and [[urn]]s, which were further decorated with brightly colored flowers and fruit.  Flowers commonly included in these arrangements were [[Bellis perennis|daisies]], lilies, [[cypress]], [[carnations]], and [[pine]].  Ribbons were also commonly used, and leaves and tiny flowers were set in arching lines to give an twisted effect to garlands.

== Flower arranging reaches Europe ==
Flower arranging arrived in [[Europe]] around 1000 CE, and was particularly popular in churches and monasteries where flowers and plants were used for food as well as for decoration.  As [[crusade]]rs came back from the [[Middle East]], they brought with them new and interesting plants.  As a result, European countries began experimenting with plants that were previously unknown to them.

'''MIDDLE AGES (''AD 476–1400'')'''

During this era, monks were known for having gardens with herbs and wildflowers. In the later part of the Gothic period flowers reached a more dominant role, such as flowers beginning to blossom in altar pictures, manuscripts, and paintings.

An important aspect of the monastery plan was to include a medicinal herb garden, which would “furnish the physician with the pharmaceutical products needed for his cures. A dependence on the power of herbs without reference to their Creator [God] was, however, regarded as improper for a Christian” [12]. Because God “causes herbs to grow,” their medical utility is fundamentally spiritual [13]. In addition, many plants were used by monks and Christians in general in sacred rituals and ceremonies. They often had associations appealing to spiritual bases as well as to medicinal effects.

'''RENAISSANCE(''AD 1400–1600'')'''

The flower design started in Italy and grew through Europe. Paintings of impressive floral arrangements in vases were popular. In the paintings, fruit blossoms and leaves were woven into garlands to decorate walls and vaulted ceilings, and petals were piled into baskets or strewn on the floors, streets, or allowed to float down from balconies.

'''BAROQUE ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1775'')'''

At the beginning of this period floral designs were symmetrical and oval-shaped, with asymmetric crescents and S-shapes becoming popular later on.{{when|date=February 2014}}

'''DUTCH'''–'''FLEMISH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1750'')'''

The baroque arrangements in the Dutch-Flemish style were more compact and proportioned. Their major characteristic was the variety of flowers within the bouquet.

'''FRENCH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1814'')'''

During the French Baroque period, a soft, almost fragile appeal became a major characteristic of floral design. Arrangements were asymmetrical using the C-crescent or the S-shape. In the empire period they used simple lines in triangle shapes and strong color contrast. The typical empire design would be arranged in an urn containing an abundance of large richly colored flowers.

'''GEORGIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1714–1760'')'''

The designs in this period were formal and symmetrical and often tightly arranged with a variety of flowers. Oriental design became influential due to active trading. At the end of the period the designs became more informal due to the fact that the fragrance of the flowers, which were believed to rid the air of diseases, became more important. Small, handheld arrangements called [[nosegays]] or tussie-mussies were used to carry sweet scents, and also helped mask the odors of society where bathing was often believed to be unhealthy.

'''VICTORIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1820–1901'')'''

Flowers were considered fashionable in this period. Large mass flowers were placed tightly into containers to create compact arrangements that were asymmetrical and stacked tightly. There was no definite style, but many different flowers and colours  made the arrangement look almost unplanned. The tussie-mussie bouquets were still serving to eliminate odors. At the end of this period attempts were made to set up rules for a proper arranging of flowers, which is when it became an artful skill or profession in Europe.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] helped to give an extra spark to the art of flower arranging in Europe. It was during this time period that a wide variety of arrangement styles began to develop. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, flower arrangements were commonplace and a wide variety of materials were used to make containers, including [[marble]], heavy [[Venetian glass]], and [[bronze]].

Flower arrangements made during this time introduced a whole new element&amp;nbsp;– the usage of tropical fruits. These arrangements also focused on creating colour contrast. Some of the popular flowers included the Lilium Candidum (or Madonna Lily, used as a symbol for fertility and chastity), narcissus, pinks, iris, [[jasmine]], [[pansies]], French marigolds, [[cornflowers]], and [[rosemary]].

'''Ibn Zafar al Siqilli''', ({{lang-ar|ابن ظفر الصقلي}}), or ({{lang-ar|احجة الدين أبو عبد الله محمد بن أبي محمد بن محمد بن ظفر الصقلي}}), or '''Abū ‘Abd Allāh Muḥammad Ibn Abī Muḥammad Ibn Ẓafar al-Siqillī al-Makkī al-Mālikī''' (are among the several variants), was a [[philosopher]], [[polymath]] and Arab-Sicilian politician of the [[Normans|Norman]] period (1104 - 1170), and has come to be known in the West as "[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s Arab Precursor".

==Biography==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to be physically small and frail. His [[demonym]] 'al-Siqillī' indicates he was born in [[Sicily]], but the [[patronym]] 'al-Makkī' suggests his family origins were in [[Mecca]], where he is believed to have been raised and educated. Nicknamed 'The Wanderer', the precise chronology of his travels are uncertain.  He probably spent his youth in [[Fatimid Egypt]] and [[Mahdia]] in [[Tunisia]], but left there in 1148 when it fell to the Normans. After a period in Sicily, Ibn Ẓafar first went to Egypt, then to [[Aleppo]] in 1146, where he taught at the [[Madrasa]] Ibn Abī ‘Aṣrūn under the patronage of Ṣāfīal-Dīn. In 1154 he returned to Sicily under the patronage of Amīr Abū ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Abī al-Qāsim Ibn ‘Alī al-Qurashī, known as Ibn Hajar, a Sicilian Arab noble, who served as a general in the Norman army. Due to the civil unrest of the Muslim population some time later, Ibn Ẓafar left Sicily definitively and took refuge in [[Hamat]], in Syria, where he died in poverty in 1170, or 1172. The geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yāqūt al-Rūmī]] referred to him as a ‘refined [[philologist]]’, and both [[Al-Dhahabi|Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī]] and [[Ibn Khallikan|Ibn Khallikān]] praised his scholarship and thought.&lt;ref name="MAB"&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13530190020000493 R. Hrair Dekmejian  &amp;  Adel Fathy Thabit  ''Machiavelli’s Arab Precursor: Ibn Zafar al-Siqillī'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ia801900.us.archive.org/5/items/WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan/Vol4Of4WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan.pdf Khallikan, ''Obituaries of Eminent Men              '', Vol.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to have authored 32 books&lt;ref&gt;Arié, Miniatures pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solwan, or Waters of Comfort===
''Sulwān al-Muṭā fī Udwān al-Atbā'' ({{lang-ar|سلوان المطاع في عدوان الأتباع}}) (Consolation for the Ruler During the Hostility of his Subjects) is his magnum opus.&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt; When [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], the famous Florentine, dedicated his treatise, '[[The Prince]]', to [[Lorenzo di Medici]] four centuries later, Ibn Ẓafar was almost unknown to the [[Western world]].  He remained in relative obscurity even after [[Michele Amari]]'s [[Italian language|Italian]] translation appeared in 1851.  Amari's introduction had included a biographical account of Ibn Ẓafar and his manuscript's history, and Richard Bentley published an English version in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof01ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof02ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt;  At the beginning of the 20th century another Sicilian and political scientist philosopher, [[Gaetano Mosca]], wrote of the striking parallels between Ibn Ẓafar's treatise and Machiavelli's.  Ibn Ẓafar's name is rarely credited as the precursor to its famous successor.

The treatise is a form  of [[Wisdom literature]] with a long Arabian and Persian tradition, called '[[Mirrors for princes]]', which purported to be handbooks for princes and caliphs offering counsel on the proper use of power, good governance and the conduct of commerce and trade.   Ibn Ẓafar dedicated the first edition of 'Sulwan' to an unknown king facing revolt - possibly the ruler of [[Damascus]] expelled by [[Nur Eddin]] - and the second edition to his patron Abū al-Qāsim (Ibn Hajar).

'''Ibtina theory''' is a new [[theory]] in the field of "logic of understanding religion" and has direct influence on the issues of [[philosophy of religion]]. Ibtina theory is a theory for explaining the process and mechanism of "religious knowledge" formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.iict.ac.ir/uploads/3_95_98_Rashad.pdf |format=PDF |title=Prof. Dr. Ali Akba Rashadi : CV |publisher=En.iict.ac.ir |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The theory was formulated and developed for the first time by [[Ali Akbar Rashad]] in 2009 and considered, studied and criticized by philosophers of religion as a new theory.&lt;ref name="iict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rashad.iict.ac.ir/index.aspx?fkeyid=&amp;siteid=17&amp;pageid=3019|title=علي اكبر رشاد - biography|publisher=rashad.iict.ac.ir|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldjusticeproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldjusticeproject.org/world-justice-forum-iv/agenda/speaker/ali-akbar-rashad|title=Ali-Akbar Rashad &amp;#124; The World Justice Project|publisher=worldjusticeproject.org|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Akbar Rashad explained the theory in his book “Logic of Understanding Religion”, moreover, many books and articles has been written and published by Iranian thinkers affected by this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rashad, Ali-Akbar, ''Nazariye Ibtina'' ("Ibtina theory"), Sazmane Entesharate Pajuheshgahe Farhang va Anisheye Eslami (IICT), Tehran, 1389.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, an assembly held by [[National Secretary of Chairs and Forums for Theorization, Critique, Innovation and Debate]]” (affiliate center of Iranian [[Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution]]) to investigate and criticize the claims of this theory; consequently, after numerous debates and discussions it has been announced as a new theory in the field of “logic of Understanding Religion”  and “Philosophy of Religious Knowledge”.

In the same year, Ali Akbar Rahad was nominated for "eminent theoretician" (Farabi International Award) for his theorizing and then received prizes and awards from [[UNESCO]], [[ISESCO]], [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology]] (Iran) and the [[President of Iran]].&lt;ref name="iict2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rashad.iict.ac.ir/index.aspx?siteid=17&amp;siteid=17&amp;pageid=2822|title=علي اكبر رشاد - نظریه ابتناء برساختگی|publisher=rashad.iict.ac.ir|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iict3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.iict.ac.ir/index.aspx?siteid=3&amp;pageid=889&amp;newsview=621|title=News &amp;gt; The new theory of "Ibtina" by Professor Dr. Ali Akbar Rashad unveiled|publisher=en.iict.ac.ir|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claims of the theory ==
[[Ali Akbar Rashad]] explained in his books and articles that Ibtina theory it to explain the process and mechanism of religious knowledge formation.
He claims that religious knowledge is "the outcome of Permissible effort to explore religious statements and teachings". In another word (expression), "epistemic system derived from the usage of valid and permissible methodology for exploring religious propositions" is called religious knowledge. Philosophy of religious knowledge is also "philosophical quasi-science which is in charge of ultra-perspective and rational study on general principles for resulting religious knowledge of fundamental problems of religious knowledge".&lt;ref name="elmedini"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmedini.ir/author/rashad/|title=علی اکبر رشاد &amp;laquo; علم دینی|author=ElmeDini &amp;#124; BY Ahmmahdi|publisher=elmedini.ir|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claims that “some theories on the process and method of formation and resulting [[knowledge]] –in general sense (proper and improper) more or less have been presented by some philosophers. But, no one has presented a revised discussion of the process and mechanism of religious knowledge formation.”
Although through some theories that has been presented on the religious knowledge we can acquire some view points of masters of knowledge. But they never present the discussion in the clear and self-evident manner about the process and mechanism of religious knowledge formation.
From among the western thinkers, [[Hermeneuticians]] have discussed on the method of knowledge formation and the influence of some epistemic and non-epistemic factors in interpretation of the text.
But they have not explained the process of religious knowledge formation.
Also the theory of contraction and expansion which is a hermeneutical theory, concerns the justification of the problem of "religious knowledge evolution", but not the explanation of "knowledge formation".&lt;ref&gt;Rashad, Ali-Akbar, ''Manteqe Fahme Din'' ("Logic of Understanding Religion"), Sazmane Entesharate Pajuheshgahe Farhang va Anisheye Eslami (IICT), Tehran, 1389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in the heart of [[Paris]], [[France]], '''Institut Choiseul''' for International Politics and Geoeconomics is an independent research center that analyzes [[international relations]], economic and political strategies as well as international cultures.

==Theoretical background==
The French [[think tank]] contributes to the massive body of international relations studies by examining the new balance of global power prevalent in the [[post-Cold War era]] from a [[geoeconomics]] perspective: a perspective which compliments the traditional vision of the international order as primarily [[geopolitical]]. In this respect, the institute conforms to the thought of French [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]] and [[political scientist]] [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choiseul.info/missions-valeurs.php?lang=uk&amp;PHPSESSID=5b70f574edc21682ed10e51cadd2b0a4 Institut Choiseul – Valeurs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to international relations==
In 1997, then named the "European Institute of Geoeconomics", the Institute created an academic journal of the same name, entitled ''Geoeconomics'' (in French, ''[[:fr:Géoéconomie|Géoéconomie]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choiseul-editions.com/choiseul-editions.html Editions Choiseul : revues économiques et géopolitiques&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that broadened the field of international relations in adding to the discourse a consideration for economics as a powerful force involved in shaping inter-state and political interactions. The research and activities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choiseul.info/activites.php Institut Choiseul – Activités&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of the institute equally seek to link the theoretical world with current events, and also seek to provide a European vision into the major geopolitical and economic issues. [[Pascal Lorot]] has been president of Institut Choiseul since 2003.

==Publications==
Institut Choiseul currently publishes five other academic journals, in addition to ''Géoéconomie'':
*''Maghreb-Machrek'' ([[Maghreb|Northern Africa]] and [[Mashriq|the Arab world]])
*''Problèmes d'Amérique latine'' ([[Latin American studies|Problems of Latin America]])
*''Monde chinois'' ([[Sinophone world]])
*''Politique américaine'' ([[American politics]])
*''Nordiques'' ([[Nordic countries]])

[[Image:ILAC logo high resolution.png|thumb|200px|ILAC logo.]]

Institutional Learning and Change (ILAC) was an Initiative of the [[CGIAR]] created in 2003 and discontinued in 2015.
The Initiative was hosted by the CGIAR Center Bioversity International, in Rome, Italy.

The Initiative was funded by a series of Funders, such as Rockefeller Foundation, Germany (GIZ), Netherlands (DGIS), and later by IFAD.

Initially the Initiative focused on impact evaluation theories and practices, supporting CGIAR practitioners on experimenting with alternative methodologies, besides advocating for changes in impact studies methodologies. Later in 2010 the Initiative shifted its focus to work more towards monitoring for learning and adaptive management.

The main output of the Initiative was a study on CGIAR activities and partnerships, through analyzing interactions of researchers and non-researchers of the CGIAR with their partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">'''''Into the Open''''', subtitled "New Paintings, Prints and Sculptures by Contemporary Black Artists", was an exhibition of art by black artists displayed at various venues in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1984.

This exhibition was the first major survey by a municipal gallery of contemporary work by [[black artists]] in Britain, and is considered one of the landmark exhibitions of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Chambers, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dYDoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=%22into+the+open%22+exhibition+black+artists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI4PjDjrXdxwIVh9gaCh2mewRj#v=onepage&amp;q=%22into%20the%20open%22%20exhibition%20black%20artists&amp;f=false ''Black Artists in British Art: A History since the 1950s''], I.B. Tauris, 2014, p. 113. {{ISBN|1780762720}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was curated, at the invitation of [[Sheffield City Arts Department]], by two people closely involved with black artists in Britain: [[Pogus Caesar]] and [[Lubaina Himid]].  Their stated aim was to give an indication of the range and richness of art made by contemporary [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro Caribbean]] artists.

The ''Into the Open'' exhibition toured in the United Kingdom in 1984, appearing at three venues: the [[Mappin Art Gallery]] in [[Sheffield]] (4 August–9 September 1984), the [[Nottingham Castle#Nottingham Castle Museum|Castle Museum]] in [[Nottingham]] (16 September–21 October 1984), and the [[Newcastle Media Workshops]] in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] (2–24 November 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Chambers (2014), note 20, pp. 255–56.&lt;/ref&gt; It was organized by the Sheffield Arts Department and was subsidised by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]].

'''Islamic''' decoration, which tends to avoid using [[figurative art|figurative]] images, makes frequent use of '''geometric patterns''' which have developed over the centuries.

The [[geometry|geometric]] designs in [[Islamic art]] are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, which may be overlapped and [[Islamic interlace patterns|interlaced]], as can [[arabesque]]s (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including a wide variety of [[tessellation]]s. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]] embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.

Geometric patterns occur in a variety of forms in [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]] including [[kilim]] carpets, [[Persia]]n [[girih]] and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[zellige]] tilework, [[muqarnas]] decorative vaulting, [[jali]] pierced stone screens, [[ceramics]], leather, stained glass, woodwork, and metalwork.

Interest in Islamic geometric patterns is increasing in the West, both among craftsmen and artists including [[M. C. Escher]] in the twentieth century, and among [[mathematician]]s and [[physicist]]s including [[Peter J. Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]] who controversially claimed in 2007 that tilings at the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]] could generate [[quasi-periodic]] patterns like [[Penrose tilings]].

== Background ==

===Islamic decoration===

[[Islamic art]] mostly avoids [[figurative art|figurative]] images to avoid becoming objects of worship.&lt;ref name=Bouaissa&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bouaissa|first1=Malikka|title=The crucial role of geometry in Islamic art|url=http://www.alartemag.be/en/en-art/the-crucial-role-of-geometry-in-islamic-art/|publisher=Al Arte Magazine|accessdate=1 December 2015|date=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Islamic [[geometry|geometric]] patterns derived from simpler designs used in earlier cultures: [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Sasanian]]. They are one of three forms of Islamic decoration, the others being the [[arabesque]] based on curving and branching plant forms, and [[Islamic calligraphy]]; all three are frequently used together.&lt;ref name=Heilbrunn&gt;{{cite web |title=Geometric Patterns in Islamic Art |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geom/hd_geom.htm |website=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometric designs and arabesques are forms of [[Islamic interlace patterns]].&lt;ref name=Hankin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hankin|first1=Ernest Hanbury|authorlink1=Ernest Hanbury Hankin|title=The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art. Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India No. 15|date=1925|publisher=Government of India Central Publication Branch|url=http://www.islamic-art.org/ArticlesOnline/BAViewPDF.asp?ArticleID=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===

Authors such as [[Keith Critchlow]]{{efn|Critchlow is a professor of architecture, and the author of a book on Islamic patterns.}} argue that Islamic patterns are created to lead the viewer to an understanding of the underlying reality, rather than being mere decoration, as writers&lt;!-- such as the mosaic artist Robert Field--&gt; interested only in pattern sometimes imply.&lt;ref name=Critchlow&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Keith Critchlow |author=Critchlow, Keith |title=Islamic Patterns : an analytical and cosmological approach |publisher=Thames and Hudson |year=1976 |isbn=0-500-27071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Field&gt;{{cite book |author=Field, Robert |title=Geometric Patterns from Islamic Art &amp; Architecture |publisher=Tarquin Publications |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-899618-22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Wade{{efn|Wade is the author of a series of books on pattern in various artforms.}} states that "Much of the art of Islam, whether in architecture, ceramics, textiles or books, is the art of decoration – which is to say, of transformation." Wade argues that the aim is to transfigure, turning mosques "into lightness and pattern", while "the decorated pages of a Qur’an can become windows onto the infinite."&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=David |title=The Evolution of Style |url=http://patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/the-evolution-of-style |website=Pattern in Islamic Art |accessdate=12 April 2016 |quote=Much of the art of Islam, whether in architecture, ceramics, textiles or books, is the art of decoration – which is to say, of transformation. The aim, however, is never merely to ornament, but rather to transfigure. ... The vast edifices of mosques are transformed into lightness and pattern; the decorated pages of a Qur’an can become windows onto the infinite. Perhaps most importantly, the Word, expressed in endless calligraphic variations, always conveys the impression that it is more enduring than the objects on which it is inscribed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, Doris Behrens-Abouseif{{efn|Behrens-Abouseif is a professor of the history of art and architecture at [[SOAS]].}} states in her book ''Beauty in Arabic Culture'' that a "major difference" between the philosophical thinking of Medieval Europe and the Islamic world is exactly that the concepts of the good and the beautiful are separated in Arabic culture. She argues that beauty, whether in poetry or in the visual arts, was enjoyed "for its own sake, without commitment to religious or moral criteria".&lt;ref name=Behrens-Abouseif&gt;{{cite book |last1=Behrens-Abouseif |first1=Doris |title=Beauty in Arabic Culture |date=1999 |publisher=Markus Wiener |isbn=978-1-558-76199-5 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Mathematics and art|Girih}}

Many Islamic designs are built on squares and circles, typically repeated, overlapped and interlaced to form intricate and complex patterns.&lt;ref name=Heilbrunn/&gt; A recurring motif is the 8-pointed star, often seen in Islamic tilework; it is made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees with respect to the other. The fourth basic shape is the [[polygon]], including [[pentagon]]s and [[octagon]]s. All of these can be combined and reworked to form complicated patterns with a variety of [[symmetry|symmetries]] including reflections and rotations. Such patterns can be seen as mathematical [[tessellation]]s, which can extend indefinitely and thus suggest [[infinity]].&lt;ref name=Heilbrunn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hussain&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hussain |first1=Zarah |title=Introduction to Islamic art |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/art/art_1.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 December 2015 |date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are constructed on grids that require only [[ruler]] and [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] to draw.&lt;ref name=Bellos&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bellos |first1=Alex |last2=Broug (Illustrator) |first2=Eric |title=Muslim rule and compass: the magic of Islamic geometric design |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/feb/10/muslim-rule-and-compass-the-magic-of-islamic-geometric-design |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=1 December 2015 |date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artist and educator [[Roman Verostko]] argues that such constructions are in effect [[algorithm]]s, making Islamic geometric patterns forerunners of modern [[algorithmic art]].&lt;ref name=Verostko&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verostko |first1=Roman |title=Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.verostko.com/algorithm.html |date=1999 |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle symbolizes unity and diversity in nature, and many Islamic patterns are drawn starting with a circle.&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite web |last1=Henry |first1=Richard |title=Geometry – The Language of Symmetry in Islamic Art |url=http://artofislamicpattern.com/resources/educational-posters/ |website=Art of Islamic Pattern |accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the decoration of the 15th-century mosque in [[Yazd]], Persia is based on a circle, divided into six by six circles drawn around it, all touching at its centre and each touching its two neighbours' centres to form a regular hexagon. On this basis is constructed a six-pointed star surrounded by six smaller irregular hexagons to form a tessellating star pattern. This forms the basic design which is outlined in white on the wall of the mosque. That design, however, is overlaid with an intersecting tracery in blue around tiles of other colours, forming an elaborate pattern that partially conceals the original and underlying design.&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lockerbie&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lockerbie |first1=John |title=Islamic Design: Arabic / Islamic geometry 01 |url=http://www.catnaps.org/islamic/geometry.html#ribbon |website=Catnaps.org |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar design forms the logo of the Mohammed Ali Research Center.&lt;ref name=MOHA&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Art and Geometric Design |url=http://www.moha.center/index.php/news-moha-en/209-moha-logo-design-en# |publisher=MOHA |accessdate=3 December 2015 |date=2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203133727/http://www.moha.center/index.php/news-moha-en/209-moha-logo-design-en |archivedate=3 December 2015}} The logo's construction is demonstrated in an animation on the MOHA website.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early Western students of Islamic patterns, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]], defined a "geometrical arabesque" as a pattern formed "with the help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact."&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt; He observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as the residual spaces between the polygons are reasonably symmetrical. For example, a grid of octagons in contact has squares (of the same side as the octagons) as the residual spaces. Every octagon is the basis for an 8-point star, as seen at [[Tomb of Akbar the Great|Akbar's tomb, Sikandra]] (1605–1613). Hankin considered the "skill of the Arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons .. almost astounding."&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt; He further records that if a star occurs in a corner, exactly one quarter of it should be shown; if along an edge, exactly one half of it.&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt;

== Evolution ==

=== Early stage ===

The earliest geometrical forms in Islamic art were occasional isolated geometric shapes such as 8-pointed stars and lozenges containing squares. These date from 836 in the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], Tunisia, and since then have spread all across the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abdullahi, Yahya |author2=Bin Embi, Mohamed Rashid |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095263513000216 |title=Evolution of Islamic geometric patterns |journal=Frontiers of Architectural Research |year=2013 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=243–251 |doi=10.1016/j.foar.2013.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle stage ===
[[File:Turkey, Konya - Alaeddin Mosque 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Middle stage patterns on geometric borders around a [[Mihrab]] in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]], [[Konya]], [[Turkey]]. 1220 onwards|alt=Middle stage Islamic patterns]]

The next development, marking the middle stage of Islamic geometric pattern usage, was of 6- and 8-point stars, which appear in 879 at the Ibn Tulun Mosque, Cairo, and then became widespread.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;

A wider variety of patterns were used from the 11th&amp;nbsp;century. Abstract 6- and 8-point shapes appear in the Tower of Kharaqan at [[Qazvin]], Persia in 1067, and the Al-Juyushi Mosque, Egypt in 1085, again becoming widespread from there, though 6-point patterns are rare in Turkey.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;

In 1086, 7- and 10-point girih patterns (with heptagons, 5- and 6-pointed stars, triangles and irregular hexagons) appear in the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan]]. 10-point girih became widespread in the Islamic world, except in the Spanish [[Al-Andalus]].&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt; Soon afterwards, sweeping 9-, 11-, and 13-point girih patterns were used in the [[Barsian mosque and minaret|Barsian Mosque]], also in Persia, in 1098; these, like 7-point geometrical patterns, are rarely used outside Persia and central Asia.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;

Finally, marking the end of the middle stage, 8- and 12-point girih rosette patterns appear in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]] at [[Konya]], Turkey in 1220, and in the [[Abbasid]] palace in [[Baghdad]] in 1230, going on to become widespread across the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;

=== Late stage ===
[[File:Mihrab at Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri.jpg|thumb|upright|Late stage: geometric, vegetal, and calligraphic patterns around the Mihrab at the [[Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri]]. 1571-5|alt=Elaborate late stage Islamic woodwork]]

The beginning of the late stage is marked by the use of simple 16-point patterns at the Hasan Sadaqah mausoleum in Cairo in 1321, and in the Alhambra in Spain in 1338–1390. These patterns are rarely found outside these two regions. More elaborate combined 16-point geometrical patterns are found in the Sultan Hasan complex in Cairo in 1363, but rarely elsewhere. Finally, 14-point patterns appear in the [[Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri|Jama Masjid]] at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in [[India]] in 1571–1596, but in few other places.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;{{efn|One such place is the Mustansiriyya Madrasa in Baghdad, as illustrated by Broug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Design |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-500-51695-9 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Artforms ==
Several artforms in different parts of the Islamic world make use of geometric patterns. These include
ceramics,&lt;ref name=MWNFceramics/&gt;
girih strapwork,&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;
jali pierced stone screens,&lt;ref name=MetJali/&gt;
kilim rugs,&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;
leather,&lt;ref name=MWNFleather/&gt;
metalwork,&lt;ref name=Gibb1954/&gt;
muqarnas vaulting,&lt;ref name=Tabbaa/&gt;
shakaba stained glass,&lt;ref name=King/&gt;
woodwork,&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt; and
zellige tiling.&lt;ref name=Njoku/&gt;

=== Ceramics ===
{{further information|Islamic pottery}}

Ceramics lend themselves to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the [[Ayyubid]] period, 13th&amp;nbsp;century. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals lend themselves to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited to the shape of the vessel they were making.&lt;ref name=MWNFceramics&gt;{{cite web |title=Geometric Decoration and the Art of the Book.

=== Girih tilings and woodwork ===
{{Main article|Girih}}

Girih are elaborate [[Islamic interlace patterns|interlacing patterns]] formed of five standardized shapes. The style is used in [[Iranian architecture|Persian Islamic architecture]] and also in decorative woodwork.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt; Girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork, [[stucco]], and mosaic [[faience]] tilework. In woodwork, especially in the [[Safavid]] period, it could be applied either as lattice frames, left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass; or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings, whether sacred or secular. In architecture, girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from the 15th&amp;nbsp;century to the 20th&amp;nbsp;century. Most designs are based on a partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points; this is made into a pattern using 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries which can fill the plane. The visible pattern superimposed on the grid is also geometric, with 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-pointed stars and a variety of convex polygons, joined by straps which typically seem to weave over and under each other.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gereh-Sazi|url=http://english.tebyan.net/newindex.aspx?pid=177143|publisher=Tebyan|accessdate=4 December 2015|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visible pattern does not coincide with the underlying tiling.&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;{{cite web |title=Gereh-Sāzī |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gereh-sazi |publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

=== Jali ===
[[File:Kairo Ibn Tulun Moschee BW 6.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]: window with girih-style 10-point stars (at rear), with floral roundels in hexagons forming a frieze at front]]
{{Main article|Jali}}

Jali are pierced stone screens with regularly repeating patterns. They are characteristic of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], for example in the [[Mughal dynasty]] buildings at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] and the [[Taj Mahal]]. The geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5- and 8-pointed stars. The patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition. Jali functioned as windows or room dividers, providing privacy but allowing in air and light.&lt;ref name=MetJali&gt;{{cite web |title=For Educators: Geometric Design in Islamic Art: Image 15 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/learn/for-educators/publications-for-educators/art-of-the-islamic-world/unit-three/featured-works-of-art/image-15 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jali forms a prominent element of the architecture of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=i&lt;!--sic--&gt;ntypes. p&lt;!--sic--&gt;erforate |url=https://intypes.cornell.edu/expanded.cfm?erID=107 |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of perforated walls has declined with modern building standards and the need for security.

=== Kilim ===
{{Main article|Kilim}}
[[File:Wolf's Mouth Kilim Motif.jpg|thumb|upright|Somewhat [[kilim motifs|geometric motifs]] such as the [[Wolf]]'s Mouth (Kurt Aǧzi), to protect the flocks against wolves, are often woven into tribal [[kilim]]s.]]

A kilim is an Islamic&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Muhammad |last2=Begum|first2=Nasima |title=Islamic Textile Art and how it is Misunderstood in the West – Our Personal Views |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |publisher=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; flatwoven carpet (without a pile), whether for household use or a [[prayer mat]]. The pattern is made by winding the [[weft]] threads back over the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges.&lt;ref name=Lockerbie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CARPETS v. Flat-woven carpets: Techniques and structures |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carpets-v |publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]] |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turkish Kilim Rug |url=http://www.rugs-oriental.net/turkish-kilim-rug.html |website=Through the Collector's Eye |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kilim motifs]] are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from [[wolf|wolves]].&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A. S. Edition=1st |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leather ===

Islamic leather is often embossed with patterns similar to those already described. Leather book covers, starting with the [[Quran]] where figurative artwork was excluded, were decorated with a combination of kufic script, medallions and geometric patterns, typically bordered by geometric [[braid]]ing.&lt;ref name=MWNFleather&gt;{{cite web |title=Geometric Decoration and the Art of the Book. Leather |url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/exhibitions/ISL/geometric/exhibition.php?theme=4  |publisher=Museum with no Frontiers |accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metalwork ===
Metal artefacts share the same geometric designs that are used in other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of [[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|Hamilton Gibb]], the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.&lt;ref name=Gibb1954&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibb |first=Sir Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen |authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JY3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA991 |year=1954 |publisher=Brill Archive|pages=990–992 |id=GGKEY:N71HHP1UY5E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even where metal objects such as bowls and dishes do not seem to have geometric decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do not repeat) and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12th&amp;nbsp;century. Eva Baer{{efn|Baer is Emeritus Professor of Islamic Studies at Tel Aviv University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baer |first1=Eva |title=Ayyubid Metalwork With Christian Images |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IZ7ZIpb-TAgC&amp;redir_esc=y |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.&lt;ref name=Baer1983&gt;{{cite book |last=Baer |first=Eva |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s__yi4pD-VEC&amp;pg=PA122 |year=1983 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-602-4 |pages=122–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muqarnas ===

{{Main article|Muqarnas}}

Muqarnas are elaborately carved ceilings to [[semi-dome]]s, often used in mosques. They are typically made of stucco (and thus do not have a structural function), but can also be of wood, brick, and stone. They are characteristic of Islamic architecture of the Middle Ages from Spain and Morocco in the west to Persia in the east. Architecturally they form multiple tiers of [[squinch]]es, diminishing in size as they rise. They are often elaborately decorated.&lt;ref name=Tabbaa&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tabbaa |first1=Yasser |title=The Muqarnas Dome: Its Origin and Meaning |url=http://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/4158/original/DPT0869.pdf?1384781045 |website=Archnet |pages=61–74 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stained glass ===
{{Main article|Shabaka (window)}}

Geometrically patterned [[stained glass]] is used in a variety of settings in Islamic architecture. It is found in the surviving summer residence of the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]], [[Azerbaijan]], constructed in 1797. Patterns in the [[Shabaka (window)|"shabaka" windows]] include 6-, 8-, and 12-point stars. These wood-framed decorative windows are distinctive features of the palace's architecture. Shabaka are still constructed the traditional way in [[Sheki, Azerbaijan|Sheki]] in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite book |author=King, David C.

=== Zellige ===
{{Main article|Zellige}}

Zellige are glazed terracotta tiles set into plaster, forming colourful mosaic patterns including regular and semiregular [[tessellation]]s. The tradition is characteristic of [[Morocco]], but is also found in Moorish Spain.

[[File:Kharaghan.jpg|thumb|Tomb towers of two [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] princes at Kharaghan, [[Qazvin province]], Iran, covered with many different brick patterns like those that inspired Ahmad Rafsanjani to create [[auxetic]] materials]]

In 2016, Ahmad Rafsanjani described the use of Islamic geometric patterns from tomb towers in Iran to create [[auxetic]] materials from perforated rubber sheets. These are stable in either a contracted or an expanded state, and can switch between the two, which might be useful for surgical [[stent]]s or for spacecraft components. When a conventional material is stretched along one axis, it contracts along other axes (at right angles to the stretch). But auxetic materials expand at right angles to the pull. The internal structure that enables this unusual behaviour is inspired by two of the 70 Islamic patterns that Rafsanjani noted on the tomb towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Jonathan |title=Islamic art inspires stretchy, switchable materials |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35818924 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=16 March 2016 |date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish studies''' (or '''Judaic studies''') is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] centered on the study of [[Jew]]s and [[Judaism]]. Jewish studies is [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] and combines aspects of [[history]] (especially [[Jewish history]]), [[Middle Eastern studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[Oriental studies]], [[religious studies]], [[archeology]], [[sociology]], [[language]]s ([[Jewish languages]]), [[political science]], [[area studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[ethnic studies]]. Jewish studies as a distinct field is mainly present at colleges and universities in [[North America]].

Related fields include [[Holocaust research]] and [[Israel Studies]], and in Israel, [[Jewish thought]].

==History==
[[File:Kurtze Beschreibung einer wohleingerichteten Synagog.jpg|thumb|300px|In the 18th century, as interest in the "curiosities" of the Jewish religion rose, some non-Jews had models of synagogues erected, furnished with a full array of Jewish books and ceremonial objects, and accessible to a broad public, constituting the world's first "Jewish museums." This title page is from a book by Moritz Wilhelm Christiani, which describes such a replica, owned by Georg Serpilius, a Christian Hebraist.]]
The Jewish tradition generally places a high value on learning and study, especially of [[religious text]]s. [[Torah study]] (study of the [[Torah]] and more broadly of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as [[Rabbinic literature]] such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]) is considered a [[Mitzvah|religious obligation]].

Since the [[Renaissance]] and the growth of [[higher education]], many people, including people not of the Jewish faith, have chosen to study Jews and Judaism as a means of understanding the Jewish religion, heritage, and Jewish history.

Religious instruction specifically for Jews, especially for those who wish to join the [[rabbi]]nate, is taught at Jewish [[Seminary|seminaries]] (and in [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[yeshiva]]s). Among the most prominent are the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Hebrew Union College]]. For the majority of Jewish students attending regular academic colleges and universities there is a growing choice of Jewish studies courses and even degrees available at many institutions.

The subject of [[antisemitism]] and [[the Holocaust]], as well as the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the revival of the [[Hebrew language]] have all stimulated unusual interest in greater in-depth academic study, research, reading and lecturing about these core areas of knowledge related to current events. In the United States, the unique position that [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]] have held within the nation's complex social structure has created substantial scholarship, especially with regards to topics such as interfaith marriage, political activism, and influence on popular culture.

In a 1966 article published in the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'', the Hebrew literature scholar [[Arnold Band|Arnold J. Band]] was among the first to call attention to the "spread of Jewish studies as an accepted academic discipline in the American liberal arts colleges and universities since the Second World War".&lt;ref name="Band"&gt;Band, Arnold (1966). "[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1966_3_SpecialArticles.pdf Jewish Studies in American Liberal-Arts Colleges and Universities]," ''American Jewish Year Book'' 67 (1966), 1–30; here: p. 3. Retrieved 2016-07-01 from the website of the American Jewish Committee Archives. Also reprinted, with a postscript by Band, in: Band, ''Studies in Modern Jewish Literature''.

"The first to address the postwar rise of Jewish studies, Band's article quickly set off a reaction amongst the new generation of Jewish studies professors." Available as a [http://www.ajsnet.org/ajs.pdf PDF file] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726190104/http://www.ajsnet.org/ajs.pdf |date=2016-07-26 }} on the website of the Association for Jewish Studies, "[http://www.ajsnet.org/mission.htm About Us]" page. Retrieved 2016-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article Band offered a definition of Jewish (Judaic) studies as "the discipline which deals with the historical experiences, in the intellectual, religious, and social spheres, of the Jewish people in all centuries and countries".&lt;ref&gt;Band (1966), p. 5. In the 2002 reprint, ''Studies in Modern Jewish Literature'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political situation in the [[Middle East]], especially the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], has raised the profile of Jews, Judaism, and [[Zionism]] on campuses, spurring many on to study this subject for non-degree as well as for credits in obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Master of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]]. A growing number of mature students are even obtaining [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] in Jewish studies judging by the quantity of courses and programs available. Many hope to obtain employment in the field of Jewish education or in Jewish communal service agencies.

Some Christians search for an understanding of the Jewish background for [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Christianity]] and for the source of [[monotheism]] that sprang from Judaism. There are those who are seeking an understanding of the complex and volatile relationship between [[Islam]] and Judaism. Others are searching for [[spirituality]] and [[philosophy]] and therefore seek classes in [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) and [[Jewish philosophy]]. There are also those who have a genuine concern and attachment to modern [[Israel]] as [[Christian Zionists]] and therefore seek to learn more about the subjects related to their beliefs.

Jewish studies have been offered at universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, Mervin F. (ed.) (1985). ''World Register of University Studies in Jewish Civilization: Inventory of Holdings'' (Vol. 1). Markus Wiener Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are only a few significant examples of places where Jewish studies are offered and flourish in an academic setting:

==Colleges that offer Jewish Studies==
Several colleges in the United States and Israel offer Jewish Studies or Judaic Studies as a major.

===Israel===

====Hebrew University of Jerusalem====
The Institute of Jewish Studies of The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] was established in 1924, a few months before the official opening of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewish.huji.ac.il/about.html |title=הפקולטה למדעי הרוח, האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים - המכון למדעי היהדות על שם מנדל |publisher=Jewish.huji.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely considered to be the world's premier center of Jewish studies,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} the institute has includes eight teaching departments and 18 research institutes, oversees the publication of a wide variety of journals and periodicals and has student body of over 1200 students pursuing undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees in Jewish studies.

===Europe===

====University College London====
[[University College London]] (UCL) houses the largest department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies in Europe. The department is the only one in the UK to offer a full degree course and research supervision in Jewish Studies at the BA Honours, MA, MPhil and PhD levels in every subject of Hebrew and Jewish Studies—philology, history, and literature—covering virtually the entire chronological and geographical span of the Hebrew and Jewish civilisation from antiquity through the Middle Ages to the modern period. As the first university in England to open its doors to Women, Roman Catholics and Dissenters, UCL was also the first to admit Jewish students. This traditional link of the College with the Anglo-Jewish community is very much alive today. Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid (1778–1859), one of the leading figures in the struggle for Jewish emancipation in England, was among the principal founders of University College and the chief promotor of its Hebrew department. At his instigation, [[Hyman Hurwitz]] was appointed as the first Professor of Hebrew in 1828. In 1967 the department was renamed the Department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies and extended to include, in addition to the established courses in Hebrew language and literature, a much wider range of courses with an emphasis on Jewish history. The department acts as host to both the Jewish Historical Society of England (JHSE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhse.org/ |title=jhse.org |publisher=jhse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute of Jewish Studies (IJS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/ijs/index.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416002941/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/ijs/index.htm |date=April 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which organises annual public lecture series and international conferences on all aspects of Jewish civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/home/index.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503054431/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/home/index.php |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lifting Operations Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998''' (LOLER) are set of regulations created under the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] which came into force in Great Britain on 5 December 1998 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2307/contents/made|title=Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Citation Ltd|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced a number of other pieces of legislation which covered the use of [[lifting equipment]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Lifting+Operations+and+Lifting+Equipment+Regulations+1998&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;filesize=66680 Statute Law - Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment regulations 1998 - schedule 2, revocation of instruments] The regulations replaced the 'Quarries (Ropeways and Vehicles) Regulations 1958', 'Construction (Lifting Operations) Regulations 1961', 'Offices, Shops and Railway Premises (Hoists and Lifts) Regulations 1968', 'Offshore Installations (Operational Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations 1976', 'The Hoists and Lifts (Metrication) Regulations 1983', 'The Construction (Metrication) Regulations 1984', 'The Health and Safety (Miscellaneous Modifications) Regulations 1989', 'The Lifting Plant and Equipment (Records of Test and Examination etc.) Regulations 1992'&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the regulations was to reduce the risk of injury from lifting equipment used at work.&lt;ref name="HSE simple guide"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg290.pdf HSE - Simple guide to the Lifting Operations and Lifting equipment regulations 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;  Areas covered in the regulations include the requirement for lifting equipment to be strong and stable enough for safe use and to be marked to indicate safe working loads; ensuring that any equipment is positioned and installed so as to minimise risks; that the equipment is used safely ensuring that work is planned, organised and performed by a competent person; that equipment is subject to ongoing thorough examination and where appropriate, inspection by competent people.&lt;ref name="HSE simple guide"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifting equipment==
The regulations define lifting equipment as "work equipment for lifting or lowering loads and includes its attachments used for anchoring, fixing or supporting it".&lt;ref name="mid suffolk"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/work-equipment-machinery/lift-equipment.htm What is lifting equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations involve anything which involves the lifting of goods or people at work. Equipment covered would include lifts, cranes, ropes, slings, hooks, shackles, eyebolts, rope and pulley systems and forklift trucks.&lt;ref name="LHC LOLER"&gt;[http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/factsht/71fact.htm London Hazards Centre - Lifting Operations Lifiting Equipment Regulations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324061410/http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/factsht/71fact.htm |date=2011-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations apply to all workplaces and all the provisions of the '[[Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998]]' also apply to lifting equipment.&lt;ref name="LHC LOLER"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safe working load===
A [[safe working load]] (SWL) should, according to the regulations be marked onto lifting equipment with the relevant SWL being dependent on the configuration of the equipment, accessories for lifting such as eye bolts, lifting magnets and lifting beams should also be marked.&lt;ref name="loler 98"&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Lifting+Operations+and+Lifting+Equipment+Regulations+1998&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;filesize=66680 Loler 1998 - Regulation 7]&lt;/ref&gt;  The load itself would be based on the maximum load that the equipment can lift safely.  Lifting equipment that is designed for lifting people must also be appropriately and clearly marked.&lt;ref name="loler 98"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passenger lifts===
The regulations stated that all lifts provided for use with work activities should be thoroughly examined by a 'competent person' at regular intervals.&lt;ref name="HSE lift guidance"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation 9 of the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations requires all employers to have their equipment thoroughly examined prior to it being put into service and after there has been any major alteration that could affect its operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/work-equipment-machinery/passenger-lifts.htm passenger lifts]  Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (LOLER&lt;/ref&gt; Owners or people responsible for the safe operation of a lift at work are known as 'dutyholders' and have a responsibility to ensure that the lift has been thoroughly examined and is safe to use.  Lifts when in use should be thoroughly examined every six months if, at any time, the lift has been used to carry people.  Lifts used to only carry loads should be examined every 12 months.&lt;ref name="HSE lift guidance"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Any substantial or significant changes should have been made to the equipment then this would also require an examination as would any change in operating condition which is likely to affect the integrity of the equipment.&lt;ref name="HSE lift guidance"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg339.pdf HSE - Thorough examination and testing of lifts - simple guidance]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LOLER Inspections ===
These are a legal requirement and should be carried out by a competent person, usually your insurance company will request a 3rd party independent Inspector. These inspections should be carried out at 6month intervals for all lifting items and 12 months for those that could be covered by [[Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998|PUWER]] although a competent person may deem different time scales:

Standards state that as a minimum;
* Every six months for lifting equipment used for lifting/lowering persons.
* Every six months for lifting accessories.
* Every 12 months for all other lifting equipment not falling into either of the above categories
* A competent person may deem different time scale

==Prosecutions arising from the regulations==
On 17 January 2011 a Liverpool nursing home was fined £18,000 after Frances Shannon, an 81-year-old woman fell to the ground whilst being lifted out of bed.

The Christopher Grange nursing home run by the Catholic Blind Institute was prosecuted by the health and safety executive for failing to carry out regular checks of the sling equipment which was used to lift Mrs Shannon, who suffered a broken shoulder and injuries to her back and elbow.  

Taken to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Mrs Shannon died the day following the incident.  Speaking of the prosecution Sarah Wadham, the HSE's inspecting officer, said that the incident could have been prevented, saying to the press "There should have been regular checks of the sling and it should have been thoroughly examined at least once every six months. Sadly this did not happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moderngov.rotherham.gov.uk/documents/s43180/BULLETIN%20March%2011.pdf|title=Rotherham Local Government Bulletin March 2011|last=Team|first=Emergency and Safety|date=March 2011|website=Rotherham Local Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Blind Institute was charged under section 9 of the Lifting Operation and Lifting Equipment regulations and ordered to also pay £13,876 costs.

==Requirements That LOLER 1998 Places On Employers and Workers== 
LOLER 1998 essentially puts in place four key protocols that all employers and workers must abide by:
1) All equipment must be safe and suitable for purpose    
The manufacturer must identify any hazards associated with the equipment in question, they must  then assess these hazards to bring them down to acceptable levels. All lifting equipment is normally put through an independent type testing process to establish that it will safely perform the tasks required to one of the below standards.
• BS (British Standard, used mainly in the UK)
• ISO Standards (International Standard)
• EN ([[Euronorm]], used throughout Europe)
• CEN/CENELEC (Euronorm Standards)
The above standards are a published specification that establishes a common language and contains a technical specification or other precise criteria. They are designed to be used consistently as a rule, guideline or definition.

2) All personnel must be suitably trained.
All manufacturers of lifting equipment are obliged to send out instructions for use of all products. 
The employer is then obliged to make sure employees are aware of these instructions and use the lifting equipment correctly.
To achieve this the employees must be competent. Competence is achieved through experience, technical knowledge and training. 

3) All equipment must be maintained in a safe condition.
It is good practice for all personnel using lifting equipment to conduct a pre-use inspection on all items.
Regulation 9 of LOLER also outlines specific requirements for the formal inspection of lifting equipment at mandatory intervals. 
These inspections are to be performed by a competent person and the findings of the inspections recorded.
Maximum fixed periods for thorough examinations and inspection of lifting equipment as stated in regulation 9 of LOLER are:
•Lifting Accessories – 6 Months
•Lifting Appliances – 12 Months
•Man Riding Equipment – 6 Months
Or in accordance with a written scheme of examination. Any inspection record must be made in line with the requirements of schedule 1 of LOLER
The only exception to this is: If the lifting equipment has not been used before and; In the case of lifting equipment issued with an EC declaration of conformity, the employer has possession of such declaration and it is not made more than 12 months before the lifting equipment is put into service.

== LOLER &amp; Record Keeping ==
You are legally required to ensure that reports of thorough examinations are kept available for consideration by health and safety inspectors for at least two years or until the next report, whichever is longer.

Records must be kept for all equipment. All equipment manufactured should be given a “birth certificate”.  This should prove that when first made, it complied with any requirement.  In Europe today, this document would normally be an EC Declaration of conformity plus a manufacturers certificate if called for by the standard worked to.

They may be kept electronically as long as you can provide a written report if requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.garageequipmentonline.com/loler-puwer-and-mvr|title=Loler, Puwer and MVR|last=Pengelly|first=Jason|date=21 March 2017|website=Garage Equipment Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6074">The '''lining of paintings'''  is a process of restoration used to strengthen,  flatten or consolidate  oil or tempera paintings on canvas by attaching a new canvas to the back of the existing one.The process is sometimes referred to as relining. In cases of extreme decay, the original canvas may be completely removed and replaced.

==Purpose==
The purpose of lining a painting is to flatten or consolidate its surface or strengthen its support by attaching a new canvas to the back of the existing one.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt; The process has sometimes been referred to as relining.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt; In cases of extreme decay, the original layer canvas may be completely removed, and the new canvas fixed to the priming on the reverse of the paint layer.&lt;ref name=fielding/&gt;

Lining has been very widely practiced, and during the 19th century, some painters had their works lined immediately after, or sometimes even before, completion.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt; There have been some doubts concerning its benefits more recently, especially since the Greenwich Comparative Lining Conference of 1974.&lt;ref name=hackney&gt;{{cite web|title=Tate Papers – Paintings on Canvas: Lining and Alternatives |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/7412 |publisher=Tate Gallery|author=Hackney, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The procedure as carried out in the 19th century is described by [[Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding|Theodore Henry Fielding]] in his ''Knowledge and Restoration of Old Paintings'' (1847). The picture was removed from the stretcher and laid on a flat surface.  The edges of the canvas were trimmed,  leaving the original support  smaller than the new lining. A sheet of paper covered in thin paste was laid on the surface of the painting, which was then placed face-down on a board or table. The back of the picture was then coated with paste, copal varnish, or a glue made from cheese. The new lining canvas was pressed down onto the back of the picture by hand;  then the outer edges of the lining cloth were fastened to the table by means of a large number of tacks, and a piece of wood with a rounded edge was passed over the back of the cloth, to ensure perfect adhesion.  When the glue had dried sufficiently, the lining was smoothed with a moderately hot iron. Fielding cautions that "the greatest care must be taken that the hand does not stop for an instant, or the mark of the iron will be so impressed on the painting, that nothing can obliterate it." The picture was then nailed to a new stretcher, and the paper was washed off with a sponge and cold water.&lt;ref name=fielding&gt;{{cite book|first=Theodore Henry|last= Fielding|title=Knowledge and Restoration of Old Paintings |location=London|year=1847|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/download/The_Knowledge_and_Restoration_of_Old_Pai.pdf?id=n8hAAAAAYAAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U0YWE3oRKsOgru4rR6CmEv5v-HthQ|publisher=R. Ackermann &amp; Co| pages=56–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding also describes the process for the complete removal and replacement of the canvas. In this, the picture was covered with paper, as if for lining, then fastened to a board or table, after which the old cloth was rubbed away with a small rasp with very fine teeth; when the restorer had gone "as far as may be prudent", the remainder of the cloth could be taken off with a [[pumice stone]], until the ground on which the picture was painted became visible. It was then ready to receive its new cloth, which had previously been covered with [[copal varnish]], glue, or paste. In this procedure, the hot iron was not used.&lt;ref name=fielding/&gt;

The use of hand-ironing is liable to produce a flattening of [[impasto]]. This problem was mitigated by the introduction in the 1950s of vacuum hot-table processes, designed for use with wax-resin adhesives, which exerted a more even pressure on the paint surface; however the longer periods of heating and high temperatures involved often led to other types of textural alteration.&lt;ref name=ackroyd&gt;{{cite journal|author= Ackroyd, Paul|title=The Structural Conservation of Canvas Paintings: Changes in Attitude and Practice since the Early 1970's|journal= Reviews in Conservation|issue=3|year= 2002|pages=3–14|url=http://www.viks.sk/chk/revincon13.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wax-based adhesives seem to have been in use for lining from the 18th century, although the earliest well-documented case of their employment is in the lining of Rembrandt's ''[[The Night Watch|Night Watch]]'' in 1851. Although, initially, pure [[beeswax]] was used, mixtures incorporating resins such as [[dammar]] and mastic, or balsams such as Venice turpentine, were soon found preferable.&lt;ref name=bomford/&gt; During the 20th century, it came to be realised that the impregnation of the paint layer with wax could have deleterious effects, including darkening of the picture, especially where canvas or ground were exposed.&lt;ref name=bomford&gt;{{cite journal|journal=National Gallery Technical Bulletin|volume=5|year=1981|title=Wax-Resin Lining and Colour Change: An Evaluation|first1=David|last1= Bomford|first2= Sarah|last2= Staniforth|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/technical-bulletin/bomforth_staniforth1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although experiments with synthetic fabrics were carried out during the 1960s and 1970s, traditional linen cloths are still usually used for lining.&lt;ref name=ackroyd/&gt; However [[polyester]] canvas is often used for strip-lining, where only the edges of the painting are backed, and for loose-lining, in which no adhesive is used. This latter technique helps protect the painting from atmospheric pollution, but does not flatten or consolidate the paint surface.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt;

[[File:Rattling Earth's Force Field.ogv|thumb|A rendering of the [[magnetic field lines]] of Earth's magnetosphere]]

A '''magnetosphere''' is a region of [[outer space|space]] surrounding an [[astronomical object]] in which [[charged particle]]s are manipulated or affected by that object's [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web

In the space environment close to a planetary body, the magnetic field resembles a [[magnetic dipole]].

This is studied under the specialized scientific subjects of [[plasma physics]], [[space physics]] and [[aeronomy]].

==History==
{{main|Magnetosphere chronology}}
Study of Earth's magnetosphere began in 1600, when [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] discovered that the magnetic field on the surface of Earth resembled that on a [[terrella]], a small, magnetized sphere. In the 1940s, [[Walter M. Elsasser]] proposed the model of [[dynamo theory]], which attributes [[Earth's magnetic field]] to the motion of  Earth's [[iron]] [[outer core]]. Through the use of [[magnetometer]]s, scientists were able to study the variations in Earth's magnetic field as functions of both time and latitude and longitude. 

Beginning in the late 1940s, rockets were used to study [[cosmic rays]]. In 1958, [[Explorer 1]], the first of the Explorer series of space missions, was launched to study the intensity of cosmic rays above the atmosphere and measure the fluctuations in this activity. This mission observed the existence of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] (located in the inner region of Earth's magnetosphere), with the follow up [[Explorer 3]] later that year definitively proving its existence. Also during 1958, [[Eugene Parker]] proposed the idea of the [[solar wind]], with the term 'magnetosphere' being proposed by [[Thomas Gold]] in 1959 to explain how the solar wind interacted with the Earth's magnetic field. The later mission of Explorer 12 in 1961 led by the Cahill and Amazeen observation in 1963 of a sudden decrease in magnetic field strength near the noon-time meridian, later was named the [[magnetopause]]. By 1983, the [[International Cometary Explorer]] observed the magnetotail, or the distant magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Van Allen"/&gt;

==Structure and behavior==
Magnetospheres are dependent on several variables: the type of astronomical object, the nature of sources of plasma and momentum, the [[frequency|period]] of the object's spin, the nature of the axis about which the object spins, the axis of the magnetic dipole, and the magnitude and direction of the flow of [[solar wind]].

The planetary distance where the magnetosphere can withstand the solar wind pressure is called the Chapman–Ferraro distance. This is usefully modeled by the formula wherein &lt;math&gt;R_P&lt;/math&gt; represents the radius of the planet, &lt;math&gt;B_{\it surf}&lt;/math&gt; represents the magnetic field on the surface of the planet at the equator, and &lt;math&gt;V_{SW}&lt;/math&gt; represents the velocity of the solar wind:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{CF}=R_{P} \left( \frac{B_{\it surf}^2}{\mu_{0} \rho V_{SW}^2} \right) ^{\frac{1}{6}}&lt;/math&gt;

A magnetosphere is classified as "intrinsic" when &lt;math&gt;R_{CF} \gg R_{P}&lt;/math&gt;, or when the primary opposition to the flow of solar wind is the magnetic field of the object. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], Earth, [[Jupiter]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]], for example,  exhibit intrinsic magnetospheres. A magnetosphere is classified as "induced" when &lt;math&gt;R_{CF} \ll R_P&lt;/math&gt;, or when the solar wind is not opposed by the object's magnetic field. In this case, the solar wind interacts with the atmosphere or ionosphere of the planet (or surface of the planet, if the planet has no atmosphere). [[Venus]] has an induced magnetic field, which means that because Venus appears to have no [[Dynamo theory|internal dynamo effect]], the only magnetic field present is that formed by the solar wind's wrapping around the physical obstacle of Venus (see also [[Atmosphere of Venus#Induced magnetosphere|Venus' induced magnetosphere]]). When &lt;math&gt;R_{CF} \approx R_P&lt;/math&gt;, the planet itself and its magnetic field both contribute. It is possible that [[Mars]] is of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanc|first1=M.|last2=Kallenbach|first2=R.|last3=Erkaev|first3=N.V.|title=Solar System Magnetospheres|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=116|date=2005|issue=116|pages=227–298|doi=10.1007/s11214-005-1958-y|bibcode=2005SSRv..116..227B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bow shock===
[[File:Red Giant Plunging Through Space.jpg|thumb|[[Thermographic camera|Infrared image]] and artist's concept of the bow shock around [[R Hydrae]]]]
{{main|Bow shock}}
The bow shock forms the outermost layer of the magnetosphere; the boundary between the magnetosphere and the ambient medium. For stars, this is usually the boundary between the [[stellar wind]] and [[interstellar medium]]; for planets, the speed of the solar wind there decreases as it approaches the magnetopause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparavigna|first1=A.C.|last2=Marazzato|first2=R.|title=Observing stellar bow shocks|date=10 May 2010|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1005/1005.1527.pdf|format=PDF|bibcode=2010arXiv1005.1527S|arxiv=1005.1527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetosheath===
{{main|Magnetosheath}}
The magnetosheath is the region of the magnetosphere between the bow shock and the magnetopause. It is formed mainly from shocked solar wind, though it contains a small amount of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] from the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=cluster&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-last=Paschmann|editor1-first=G.|editor2-last=Schwartz|editor2-first=S.J.|editor3-last=Escoubet|editor3-first=C.P.|editor4-last=Haaland|editor4-first=S.|title=Outer Magnetospheric Boundaries: Cluster Results|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=2005|volume=118|issue=1–4|isbn=978-1-4020-3488-6|doi=10.1007/1-4020-4582-4 |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1250411/files/978-1-4020-4582-0_BookTOC.pdf|series=Space Sciences Series of ISSI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an area exhibiting high particle [[energy flux]], where the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field varies erratically. This is caused by the collection of solar wind gas that has effectively undergone [[thermalization]]. It acts as a cushion that transmits the pressure from the flow of the solar wind and the barrier of the magnetic field from the object.&lt;ref name="Van Allen"/&gt;

===Magnetopause===
{{main|Magnetopause}}
The magnetopause is the area of the magnetosphere wherein the pressure from the planetary magnetic field is balanced with the pressure from the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; It is the convergence of the shocked solar wind from the magnetosheath with the magnetic field of the object and plasma from the magnetosphere. Because both sides of this convergence contain magnetized plasma, the interactions between them are complex. The structure of the magnetopause depends upon the [[Mach number]] and [[Beta (plasma physics)|beta]] of the plasma, as well as the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=C.T.|title=The Magnetopause|journal=Physics of Magnetic Flux Ropes|date=1990|pages=439–453|url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/ssc/tutorial/magnetopause.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetopause changes size and shape as the pressure from the solar wind fluctuates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Magnetopause|url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wmpause.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetotail===
Opposite the compressed magnetic field is the magnetotail, where the magnetosphere extends far beyond the astronomical object. It contains two lobes, referred to as the northern and southern tail lobes. Magnetic field lines in the northern tail lobe point towards the object while those in the southern tail lobe point away. The tail lobes are almost empty, with few charged particles opposing the flow of the solar wind. The two lobes are separated by a plasma sheet, an area where the magnetic field is weaker, and the density of charged particles is higher.&lt;ref name="tail"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tail of the Magnetosphere|url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wtail.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Earth's [[equator]], the magnetic field lines become almost horizontal, then return to reconnect at high latitudes. However, at high altitudes, the magnetic field is significantly distorted by the solar wind and its solar magnetic field. On the dayside of Earth, the magnetic field is significantly compressed by the solar wind to a distance of approximately {{convert|65,000|km|sp=us}}. Earth's bow shock is about {{convert|17|km|sp=us}} thick&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cluster reveals Earth's bow shock is remarkably thin|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=49637|newspaper=[[European Space Agency]]|date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and located about {{convert|90,000|km|sp=us}} from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cluster reveals the reformation of Earth's bow shock|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=40994|newspaper=European Space Agency|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetopause exists at a distance of several hundred kilometers above Earth's surface. Earth's magnetopause has been compared to a [[sieve]] because it allows solar wind particles to enter. [[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability|Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities]] occur when large swirls of plasma travel along the edge of the magnetosphere at a different velocity from the magnetosphere, causing the plasma to slip past. This results in [[magnetic reconnection]], and as the magnetic field lines break and reconnect, solar wind particles are able to enter the magnetosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cluster observes a 'porous' magnetopause|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=50977|newspaper=European Space Agency|date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth's nightside, the magnetic field extends in the magnetotail, which lengthwise exceeds {{convert|6,300,000|km|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Earth's magnetotail is the primary source of the [[Aurora (astronomy)|polar aurora]].&lt;ref name=tail/&gt; Also, NASA scientists have suggested that Earth's magnetotail might cause "dust storms" on the Moon by creating a potential difference between the day side and the night side.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/magnetotail_080416.html NASA, ''The Moon and the Magnetotail''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other objects===
The [[magnetosphere of Jupiter]] is the largest planetary magnetosphere in the Solar System, extending up to {{convert|7,000,000|km|sp=us}} on the dayside and almost to the orbit of [[Saturn]] on the nightside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.igpp.ucla.edu/people/mkivelson/Publications/279-Ch24.pdf|format=PDF|title=The configuration of Jupiter's magnetosphere|first=K.K.|last=Khurana|author2=Kivelson, M.G.|display-authors=etal|isbn=978-0-521-81808-7|encyclopedia=Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor= Bagenal, F. |editor2=Dowling, T.E. |editor3=McKinnon, W.B.|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter's magnetosphere is stronger than Earth's by an [[order of magnitude]], and its [[magnetic moment]] is approximately 18,000 times larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=C.T.|title=Planetary Magnetospheres|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=56|issue=6|pages=687–732|date=1993|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0034-4885/56/6/001/rp930601.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/56/6/001|bibcode=1993RPPh...56..687R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIMS is formed by inner-shell electrons that are normally resistant to molecular formation.  However, in stellar conditions, the inner-shell electrons become reactive to form molecular structures (MIMS) from combinations of all elements in the periodic table.  
 
MIMS upon dissociation can emit x-ray photons with energies up to 100 keV at extremely high conversion efficiencies from compression energy to photon energy.  MIMS is predicted to exist and dominate radiation processes in extreme astrophysical environments, such as large planet cores, star interiors, and [[black hole]] and [[neutron star]] surroundings. There, MIMS is predicted to enable highly energy-efficient transformation of the stellar compression energy into the radiation energy.

The right schematic illustration shows the proposed four stages of the K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) formation and x-ray generation process.  Stage I: Individual atoms are subjected to the stellar compression and ready for absorbing the compression energy.  Stage II: The outer electron shells fuse together under increasing "stellar" pressure.    Stage III: At the peak pressure, via pressure ionization K-shell orbits form the K-MIMS, which is vibrationally hot and encapsulated by a Rydberg-like pseudo-L-Shell structure.  Stage IV: The K-MIMS cools down by ionizing ("boiling-off") a number of pseudo-L-shell electrons and subsequent optical decay by emitting an x-ray photon.  The dissociated atoms return their original atoms states and are ready for absorbing the compression energy.

MIMS also can be readily produced in laboratory and industrial environments, such as hypervelocity particle impact, [[laser fusion]] and [[z-machine]]. MIMS can be exploited for highly energy-efficient production of high intensity x-ray beams for a wide range of innovative applications, such as [[photolithography]], [[x-ray lasers]], and [[inertial fusion]].

==History==

The inner-shell-bound metastable quasimolecules were proposed to exist in the x-ray generating scattering process since the work by Mott in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  The existence of high energy quasimolecules in highly compressed matter (or strongly coupled plasma) was theoretically predicted in the ab initio quantum calculation by Younger et al. in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  In 2008, from the

To search for many-body effects in the highly compressed stellar materials, Bae and his colleagues at BNL generated and studied such materials by impacting various bio and water [[nanoparticle]] at hypervelocities (v~100&amp;nbsp;km/s) on various targets.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In their study, anomalous signals were discovered, when the nanoparticles were directly impacted on and detected by Si particle detectors that had windows sufficiently thick enough to block the penetration of the nanoparticles completely. By exploiting the discovered anomalous signals, the feasibility of generating highly compressed "stellar" matter at shock pressures on the order of 10 TPa (100 Mbar) with the nanoparticle impact in a non-destructive laboratory setup was proven.  However, the nature of the signals and the underlying physics of their generation mechanism had not been understood for 15 years.

It was not until 2008 that Bae was able to unlock the mystery of the anomalous BNL signals owing to emerging sciences of the stellar materials.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal

After extensive analyses and theoretical modeling of these data, which involve a wide range of elements in the periodic table, a successful integration of the data into the frame of the unified MIMS model was demonstrated. Thereby, the MIMS model was firmly established and confirmed for any combinations of all elements in the periodic table.

Specifically, the extensive analyses&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; of the data that relate to hard x-ray generating collisions have resulted in a universal law (Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–dependency) of the binding energy of the homonucleus MIMS bound by K-shell electrons (K-MIMS).  Here Z is the atomic number of the constituent atoms of the K-MIMS.  Bae further developed a unified theory to elucidate the Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent behavior of the homonucleus K-MIMS, which behaves much like the helium excimer molecule: He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The MIMS theory also predicted a 1/Z dependency law for the bond length of the homonucleus K-MIMS.  Based on the MIMS theory the uranium K-MIMS, for example, is predicted to have a 100 times smaller bond length, a 2,000 times larger binding energy, and a 5,000 times larger characteristic x-ray energy than the He excimer molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huber|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The predicted bond lengths of the bismuth and uranium K-MIMS are in excellent agreement with that estimated from the experimental results by researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal

In typical environment, the ground state of rare gas atom dimers is electronically non-binding, but if their closed outershell electrons are excited, dimers can readily form transient bound molecules, excimers.  For example, the ground [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] state (1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1sσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is electronically repulsive, but excitation of an electron can lead to Rydberg states (for example, the metastable, 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1sσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;2sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;: a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) with the He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title =Excimers |last = Birks|first = J.B.|journal = [[Reports on Progress in Physics]]|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |date = 1975|issue = 38|page = 903}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The low-lying metastable excited states of the dimer (the He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excimer) are strongly covalently bound.   The metastable excimer can radiate to the free repulsive ground state.

The excimer formation is a critical step in energy-efficient conversion of the atomic electron excitation/ionization energy into the radiation energy in rare gas plasma for the excimer lasers. Without forming the excimers, the energy of the excited atoms would be rapidly lost by non-radiative collisional decay processes in the high pressure environment.  In other words, the excimer formation is a crucial step needed for efficient transformation of the atomic excitation energy to the radiation energy in an ultra-high pressure environment.  Analogously, the MIMS formation is a crucial step required for efficiently transforming the atomic core-excitation energy into the radiation energy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

[[File:K-MIMS binding energy - Z2 Fitting-New.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|K-MIMS binding energy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;]]

Based on the MIMS model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; a schematic potential curve was proposed for the K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) and illustrated in the right figure. In the "electronically-cold" highly compressed plasma, a K-shell core ion with a hole, [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;], collides with another core ion without a hole, [K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;], to form a near-dissociative K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) and its excess energy transforms into the vibration energy.  Such a vibrationally hot K-MIMS in the plasma is denoted here by &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Subsequently, a Rydberg-like pseudo-L-shell forms around the K-MIMS core ions that are proposed to go through a rapid relaxation into the lowest vibrational state by ionizing a number of electrons in the pseudo-L-shell.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The vibrationally cold K-MIMS without an L-shell hole is denoted by [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;].   The vibrational energy is quenched by ionizing the bound [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;] MIMS into a higher ionic state [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;] with n holes in the pseudo-L-shell, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 8.  Because the n holes can be distributed among 2s and 2p orbits, thus the maximum value of n is 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1235049|title = Vibrational autoionization in polyatomic molecules|last = Pratt|first = S.T.|journal = [[Annual Review of Physical Chemistry]] |date = 2005|pages = 281–308|volume = 56 |doi=10.1146/annurev.physchem.56.092503.141204 |pmid=15796702|bibcode = 2005ARPC...56..281P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statistically distributed K-MIMS decays into the lower L-shell MIMS (L-MIMS), [K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;],
by emitting an x-ray photon, and subsequently the L-MIMS dissociates into two atomic ions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Based on the previously proposed MIMS model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; a wide range of the K-MIMS  binding energies were extracted from the extensive ranges of experimental data from He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* excimer to UAu* MIMS (for 2 ≤ Z ≤ 92). The right shows these data plotted against the constituent atom atomic number Z.  The lowest bound state (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* excimer has a binding energy of 1.96 eV, which is plotted in the right figure. These data are plotted against Z in the figure.

The overall data trend shows a Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dependency. Overall fitting is excellent, thus indicates that the K-MIMS can be modeled with a He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*-like excimer with core K-shell ions with an atomic number Z to the first order. Note that the binding energies are about one order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding K-shell satellite x-ray energies, which follow the (Z-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dependency of the [[Moseley's law]].

[[File:K-MIMS Bond Length-New.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|K-MIMS bond length.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;]]

An intuitive analytical theory has been developed and is presented here to illuminate the universal Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent behavior of K-MIMS by Bae. In this theory, the homologous molecular characteristics of K-MIMS is proposed to be primarily determined by the 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonding molecular orbit of the homologous core molecular ion under the assumption that other effects of surrounding electrons and atoms can be considered as a minor perturbation.  The quantum characteristics of excimer can be described by a stable core molecular ion surrounded by Rydberg-like electron orbits.  The lowest metastable electronic state of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1sσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;2sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, thus the proposed K-MIMS model should have a similar molecular orbital.  In this case the bonding of K-MIMS is expected to be primarily dominated by the 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital.  Intuitively, the 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital can be approximated in the frame of the [[LCAO]] model by a linear combination of the two 1s atomic orbitals, of which size is proportional to 1/Z.  Therefore, the K-MIMS size, thus the bond length, is predicted to be proportional to 1/Z.  Therefore, to the first order the K-MIMS bond length is predicted to be proportional to 1/Z.   The right figure shows the predicted K-MIMS bond length as a function of the constituent atom atomic number, Z.  The bond length of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is ~1.05 A, and the solid line represents a 1/Z curve that is extrapolated from the bond length of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

Currently, there is no other direct experimental data or theoretical results on the bond length of the K-MIMS.  However, in the recent work by Mokler's group,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; the sizes of quasimolecules were estimated from the x-ray cross-section enhancement of both projectile x-rays and target x-rays in H-like ion impact.   The enhancement was interpreted to result from an extensive K-K electron sharing (transition of a hole) between the projectile and target ions due to the quasimolecule effect during the collision.  Based on the K-MIMS theory as illustrated in the right figure, the K-K sharing distance can approximate the K-MIMS bond length.  The two data points are the K-K sharing distances of U&lt;sup&gt;91+&lt;/sup&gt; ion impact on Au and Bi&lt;sup&gt;82+&lt;/sup&gt; ion impact on Au, which were estimated from the cross sections.  The Z values were approximated by the (Z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; +Z&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)/2, where Z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the atomic number of the projectile ion and Z&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is that of the target atom.  The predicted 1/Z curve is in excellent agreement with these data points as shown in the right figure.

MIMS can be also formed with two different elements.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal

Based on [[Equation of state|Equation of State]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (EOS) of materials,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; it can be predicted that pressures required to form homonucleus L-shell MIMS are on the order of 100 Mbar (10 TPa), while homonucleus K-shell MIMS on the order of 10 – 100 Gbar (1,000 – 10,000 TPa).  Pressures required to form heteronucleus MIMS are predicted to be considerably smaller than that for homonucleus MIMS.

==Other models for inner-shell bound molecules==

===Quasimolecules in heavy ion collisions===

In the field of x-ray generation by heavy ion impact on solids, the search for the x-ray signatures of the inner-shell-bound quasimolecule in the x-ray generating scattering process can be traced down to the work by Mott in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On the Theory of Excitation by Collision with Heavy Particles|last = Mott|first = N.F.|journal = [[Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1017/s0305004100009816|pmid = |pages = 553|date = 1931|volume = 27|issue = 4|bibcode = 1931PCPS...27..553M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The quasimolecule can be considered as a collisional complex that is a manifestation of MIMS during collision processes.  However, the actual experimental searches for such x-ray signatures of the quasimolecule in x-ray generation in heavy ion impact started much later, in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One of the primary motivations of these researches was to explore a super-heavy quasimolecule/quasiatom with a combined atomic number exceeding 100, which was predicted to behave like a transuranium atom in the united atom frame.

In the early heavy ion collision researches, the cross-sections for carbon K x-ray production were measured for a wide range of ions incident on a carbon target, at energies from 20 to 80 keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =  |last = Der|display-authors = etal|first = R.C.|title =Production of carbon characteristic x-rays by heavy-ion bombardment |journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.21.1731|pmid = |date = 1968|pages = 1731–1732|volume = 21|issue = 26|bibcode = 1968PhRvL..21.1731D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon Kα x-ray generation cross sections for the heavy ions, such as Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Xe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, were discovered to be several orders of magnitude larger than those by light ions, such as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which were consistent with the values predicted by the direct Coulomb scattering theory.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  The anomalous cross sections for heavy ions were qualitatively interpreted in terms of the electron-promotion mechanism of the molecular orbital theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Interpretation of Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - Ar collisions |last = Fano|first = U.|journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.14.627|pmid = |last2 = Lichten|first2 = W.|date = 1965|volume = 14|issue = 16 |pages = 627–629|bibcode = 1965PhRvL..14..627F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his papers, Bae proposed that the production of the shocked regions that are able to bear abundant MIMS by the heavy ion impacts as in the nanoparticle impact&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; can be another major factor for the observed x-ray yield enhancement.

More importantly, there had been extensive theoretical and experimental researches on intense K-shell satellites above the Kα line of various solids that were bombarded by heavy ions with kinetic energies on the order of 10 MeV.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In the researches, the K-shell satellites were interpreted to result from radiative decays of atoms with multiple holes, one of which is in the K-shell and others in the L-shell.  Striking differences between the satellite spectra obtained with light ions, such as electrons and protons, and the spectra with heavy ions were discovered.  In addition to the intensity difference, the x-ray spectra obtained with heavy ions showed many more peaks with multiple L-shell holes than those with light ions.  The x-ray energies of the satellites were consistent with those obtained by the ab initio calculations based on the atomic model x-ray emissions that involve varying number of L-shell holes.  However, the satellite data for larger number of L-shell holes significantly deviated from the calculation results.  Based on the MIMS model, the x-ray satellite structures are now understood to result from the interaction between the vibrational state of K-MIMS and the L-shell electron ionization channels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Younger's quasimolecules===
Overall, Younger et al.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1233866|title = Quantum calculations of the electronic structures of a many-atom plasma |last = Younger|display-authors = etal|first = S.M.|journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.61.962|pmid = 10039479|date = 1988|volume = 61|issue = 8 |pages = 962–965|bibcode = 1988PhRvL..61..962Y |format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the possibility of forming transient molecular states with closed-shell electrons in ab initio calculations for the first time for frozen or slow moving ion systems that can be approximated with the [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]].

Persinger''' (June 26, 1945 – August 14, 2018) was an American-Canadian [[professor]] of psychology at [[Laurentian University]], a position he had held from 1971 until his death in 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His most well-known hypotheses include the temporal lobes as the central correlate for [[Mysticism|mystical]] experiences, subtle changes in [[geomagnetic]] activity as mediators of [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] phenomena, the tectonic strain within the Earth's crust as the source of [[Ball lightning|luminous phenomena]] attributed to [[Unidentified flying object|unidentified aerial objects]], and the importance of specific quantifications for energy (10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt; Joules), photon flux density (picoWatt per meter squared), and small shifts in magnetic field intensities (picoTesla to nanoTesla range) for integrating cellular activity as well as human [[thought]] with universal phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neuropsychological bases of God beliefs|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|publisher=Prager Publishers|year=1987|isbn=978-0275926489|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=Fall 2001|title=The Neuropsychiatry of Paranormal Experiences|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4857/87022759ddf1dca6c2411937a3f9889115e2.pdf|journal=Neuropsychiatric Practice and Opinion|volume=13:4|pages=515–524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=1983|title=Religious and Mystical Experiences as Artifacts of Temporal Lobe Function: A General Hypothesis|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=57|issue=3_suppl|pages=1255–1262|doi=10.2466/pms.1983.57.3f.1255|pmid=6664802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=Summer 2010|title=10-20 Joules as a Neuromolecular Quantum in Medicinal Chemistry: An Alternative Approach to Myriad Molecular Pathways?|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cmc/2010/00000017/00000027/art00009|journal=Current Medicinal Chemistry|volume=17|issue=27|pages=3094–3098|doi=10.2174/092986710791959701|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=2015|title=Inverse relationship between photon flux densities and nanotesla magnetic fields over cell aggregates: Quantitative evidence for energetic conservation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211546315000455|journal=FEBS Open Bio|volume=5|pages=413–418|doi=10.1016/j.fob.2015.04.015|pmid=26005634|pmc=4436372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=December 2008|title=Quantitative discrepancy in cerebral hemispheric temperature associated with "two consciousnesses" is predicted by neuroquantum relations|url=|journal=NeuroQuantology|volume=6|pages=369–378|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=2007|title=A theory of neurophysics ad quantum neuroscience: implications for brain function and the limits of consciousness|url=|journal=Intern.

==Early life==
Persinger attended [[Carroll College (Wisconsin)|Carroll College]] from 1963 to 1964 and graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1967. He received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[physiological psychology]] from the [[University of Tennessee]] in 1969 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Research and academic work==
Persinger's work focuses on the commonalities that exist between the sciences, and aims to integrate fundamental concepts of various branches of science.&lt;ref name="SpaceTimeObs"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Persinger |first1 = M.

=== Clinical and experimental neuropsychology ===

=== Geophysical and human interaction research ===
One of Persinger's lifelong endeavors has been to establish a mechanism underlying geophysical-behavioral correlates using experimental simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulligan|first=Bryce|date=2012|title=Experimental simulation of the effects of sudden increases in geomagnetic activity upon quantitative measures of human brain activity: Validation of correlational studies|url=|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=516|pages=54–56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=2014|title=Infrasound, human health, and adaptation: an integrative overview of recondite hazards in a complex environment|url=|journal=Natural Hazards|volume=70|pages=501–525|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michon|first=A.L.|date=1997|title=Experimental simulation of the effects of increased geomagnetic activity upon nocturnal seizures in epileptic rats|url=|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=224|pages=53–56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=June 1995|title=Vestibular experiences of humans during brief periods of partial sensory deprivation are enhanced when daily geomagnetic activity exceeds 15-20 nT|url=|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=194|issue=1–2|pages=69–72|via=|pmid=7478216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=1999|title=Wars and increased solar-geomagnetic activity: Aggression or change in intraspecies dominance?|url=|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=88|pages=1351–1355|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=2001|title=Geophysical variables and behavior: CIV.

The shared photon origin was considered one source for "[[Entanglement (physics)|entanglement]]" between living systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=2016|title=The Biomass of the Earth as the Direct Energy-Mass Equivalence from ~3.5 Billions of Years of Solar Flux|url=https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.psjd-eee6525a-f4df-4d8e-bf94-fcf39f938dc2|journal=World Scientific News|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parapsychological research ===
Persinger has stated that he studies parapsychological phenomena because "the ultimate subject matter of science is the unknown".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He believes that verifiable spontaneous and experimental types of parapsychological phenomena are physical and associated with non-local interactions between human brain activity and geophysical processes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, Persinger has presented evidence that the moderate strength correlation between geomagnetic activity at the time of a [[Precognition|precognitive]] experience and what the geomagnetic activity would be two to three days before the event was considered supportive evidence that energetic antecedents before the event,  not the event itself, was being discerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=1988|title=Increased geomagnetic activity and the occurrence of bereavement hallucinations: Evidence for melatonin-mediated microseizuring in the temporal lobe?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304394088902224|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=88|issue=3|pages=271–274|via=|doi=10.1016/0304-3940(88)90222-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Review of the physical properties with [[William G.

=== Physical cosmology ===
Later in his career, Persinger and his lifelong colleague Stanley Koren quantitatively, through calculations, explored the non-traditional relationships between the smallest and largest increments of space and time.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=2014|title=Evidence for a Causal Relationship Between Mach's Principle and the Quantitative Latency for Universal Entanglement|url=http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-7e1025e3-3f45-4f2f-a208-b189a89da574|journal=International Letters of Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=May 2016|title=Inflections of periodicities of background photon spectral power densities are predicted by the lorentz contraction for a potential indicator for the intrinsic structure of space|url=|journal=Journal of Advances in Physics|volume=|pages=4014–4017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the time required for the universe to expand one [[Planck length|Planck's length]] was [[Planck time|Planck's time]], and the time for Planck's length to expand one Planck's length was [[Age of the universe|the age of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=2007|title=A THEORY OF NEUROPHYSICS AND QUANTUM NEUROSCIENCE: IMPLICATIONS FOR BRAIN FUNCTION AND THE LIMITS OF CONSCIOUSNESS|journal=International Journal of Neuroscience|volume=117|issue=2|pages=157–175|doi=10.1080/00207450500535784|pmid=17365106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This duration for a [[proton]] was about 3 ms, which considered the optimal point duration for interactive magnetic fields.

{{Mythology}}
'''Myth''' is a [[folklore genre]] consisting of narratives that play a fundamental role in society, such as foundational tales.  The main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = oflaherty&gt;{{cite book|last =Doniger O'Flaherty|first = Wendy|quote =I think it can be well argued as a matter of principle that, just as 'biography is about chaps', so mythology is about gods.|page = 19|title = Hindu Myths|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Af7TFlN5hmsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date =1975|publisher = Penguin|isbn = 9780140443066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests and are closely linked to [[religion]] or spirituality.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} In fact, many societies group their myths, legends and history together, considering myths to be true accounts of their remote past.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|p= 102}} [[Creation myth]]s particularly, take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p= 1}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} Other myths explain how a society's [[norm (social)|customs]], [[institution]]s and [[taboo]]s were established and sanctified.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} There is a complex relationship between [[myth and ritual|recital of myths and enactment of rituals]].

The study of myth began in [[ancient history]]. Rival classes of the [[Greek myths]] by [[Euhemerus]], [[Plato]] and [[Sallustius]] were developed by the [[Neoplatonists]] and later revived by [[Renaissance]] mythographers. Today, the study of myth continues in a wide variety of academic fields, including [[folklore studies]], [[philology]], and [[psychology]]. The term '''mythology''' may either refer to the study of myths in general, or a body of myths regarding a particular subject. The academic comparisons of bodies of myth is known as [[comparative mythology]].

===''Myth''===
Definitions of ''myth'' to some extent vary by scholar. Finnish [[folklore studies|folklorist]] Lauri Honko offers a widely cited definition:
{{quote|Myth, a story of the gods, a religious account of the [[cosmogony|beginning of the world]], the [[creation myth|creation]], fundamental events, the exemplary deeds of the gods as a result of which the world, nature and culture were created together with all parts thereof and given their order, which still obtains.

Scholars in other fields use the term ''myth'' in varied ways.{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p=147}}{{sfn|Doty|2004|pp= 11–12}}{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 5}} In a broad sense, the word can refer to any [[traditional story]],{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p=57}}{{sfn|Kirk|1973|p= 74}}{{sfn|Apollodorus|1976|p= 3}} [[popular misconception]] or [[imagination|imaginary]] entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Collegiate Dictionary|chapter=myth|page=770|edition=10th|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]], Inc|location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while myth and other folklore genres may overlap, myth is often thought to differ from genres such as [[legend]] and [[Folklore genre|folktale]] in that neither are considered to be sacred narratives.&lt;ref name="SALAMON-GOLDBERG-2012"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qhsdhM9tI3EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last1 =Salamon|first1=  Hagar |first2= Harvey E.|last2= Goldberg|date = 2012|chapter =Myth-Ritual-Symbol|editor1-first= Regina F.|editor1-last= Bendix |editor2-first= Galit|editor2-last= Hasan-Rokem |title = A Companion to Folklore|page = 125|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 7}} Some kinds of folktales, such as [[fairy stories]], are not considered true by anyone, and may be seen as distinct from myths for this reason.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9, 17}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 10–11}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|pp= 99–101}} Main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans,{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oflaherty" /&gt; while legends generally feature humans as their main characters.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} However, many exceptions or combinations exist, as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]''.{{sfn|Kirk|1973|pp=22, 32}}{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p= 55}} Moreover, as stories spread between cultures or as faiths change, myths can come to be considered folktales, their divine characters recast as either as humans or demihumans such as [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf|elves]] and [[faerie]]s.&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Doty|2004|p=114}}{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 13}} Conversely, historical and literary material may acquire mythological qualities over time. For example, the [[Matter of Britain]] (the legendary history of Great Britain, especially those focused on [[King Arthur]] and [[Round Table|the knights of the Round Table]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/romance-literature-and-performance#toc50951|title=romance {{!}} literature and performance|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Matter of France]], seem distantly to originate in historical events of the fifth and eighth-centuries respectively, and became mythologised over the following centuries.

In colloquial use, the word ''myth'' can also be used of a collectively held belief that has no basis in fact, or any false story.&lt;ref&gt;"myth, n., §2" OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670. Accessed 23 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage, which is often [[pejorative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howells|first=Richard|title=The Myth of the Titanic|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34BdSTbnSKUC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=myth+pejorative&amp;source=web&amp;ots=X4AT1P_6XR&amp;sig=3UkHYLBt7fQrRDjP4ZOOtQzbBfA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result}}&lt;/ref&gt; arose from labeling the religious myths and beliefs of other cultures as incorrect, but it has spread to cover non-religious beliefs as well.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967, pp. 23, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as commonly used by [[folklore studies|folklorists]] and academics in other relevant fields, such as [[anthropology]], the term ''myth'' has no implication whether the narrative may be understood as true or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Winzeler, Robert L. (2012) ''Anthropology and Religion: What We Know, Think, and Question'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the term ''myth'' is widely used to imply that a story is not [[objective truth|objectively true]], the identification of a narrative as a myth can be highly political: many adherents of religions view their religion's stories as [[truth|true]] and therefore object to the stories being characterised as myths. Nevertheless, scholars now routinely speak of [[Christian mythology]], [[Jewish mythology]], [[Islamic mythology]], [[Hindu mythology]], and so forth. Traditionally, Western scholarship, with its Judaeo-Christian heritage, has viewed narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as being the province of [[theology]] rather than mythology; meanwhile, identifying religious stories of colonised cultures, such as stories in [[Hinduism]], as myths enabled Western scholars to imply that they were of lower truth-value than the stories of [[Christianity]]. Labelling all religious narratives as ''myths'' can be thought of as treating different traditions with parity.&lt;ref name=leeming=preface&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|title=Preface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR7|page=vii|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2005|author=David Leeming}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mythology''===
In present use, ''mythology'' usually refers to the collected myths of a group of people, but may also mean the study of such myths.{{sfn|Kirk|1973|p=8}} For example, [[Greek mythology]], [[Roman mythology]] and [[Hittite mythology]] all describe the body of myths retold among those cultures. Folklorist [[Alan Dundes]] defines myth as a [[sacred]] [[narrative]] that explains how the world and humanity evolved into their present form. Dundes classified a sacred narrative as "a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society".&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; Anthropologist [[Bruce Lincoln]] defines ''myth'' as "ideology in narrative form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lincoln |first= Bruce |year= 2006 |title= An Early Moment in the Discourse of "Terrorism": Reflections on a Tale from Marco Polo |jstor= 3879351 |journal= [[Comparative Studies in Society and History]] |volume= 48 |issue= 2 |pages= 242–259 |quote= More precisely, mythic discourse deals in master categories that have multiple referents: levels of the cosmos, terrestrial geographies, plant and animal species, logical categories, and the like.

===''Mythography''===
The compilation or description of myths is sometimes known as ''mythography'', a term which can also be used of a scholarly anthology of myths (or, confusingly, of the study of myths generally).&lt;ref&gt;"mythography, n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018, https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124691. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Key mythographers in the Classical tradition include [[Ovid]] (43 BCE–17/18 CE), whose tellings of myths have been profoundingly influential; [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius]], a Latin writer of the late fifth to early sixth centuries, whose ''Mythologies'' (Latin: ''Mitologiarum libri III'') gathered and gave moralistic interpretations of a wide range of myths; the anonymous medieval [[Vatican Mythographers]], who developed anthologies of Classical myths that remained influential to the end of the Middle Ages; and the Renaissance scholar [[Natalis Comes]], whose ten-book ''Mythologiae'' became a standard source for classical mythology in later Renaissance Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', 2 vols (Gainesville, 1994–2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent mythographies include the thirteenth-century ''[[Prose Edda]]'' attributed to the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]], which is the main surviving survey of [[Norse Mythology]] from the Middle Ages.

===''Mythos''===
Because ''myth'' is sometimes used in a pejorative sense, some scholars have opted to use the term ''mythos'' instead.&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic?

"Conscious generation" of mythology was termed ''mythopoeia'' by, amongst others, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/235084 mythopoeia, n.]" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018.

==Origins of the terms ''myth'' and ''mythology''==
[[File:Francesco Hayez 028.jpg|thumb|''Odysseus Overcome by Demodocus' Song'', by Francesco Hayez, 1813–15]]
The word ''myth'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] ''μῦθος'' [''mȳthos''], meaning 'speech, narrative, fiction, myth, plot'. In Anglicised form, this Greek word began to be used in English (and was likewise adapted into other European languages) in the early nineteenth century, in a much narrower sense, as a scholarly term for 'a traditional story, typically involving supernatural beings or forces, which embodies and provides an explanation, aetiology, or justification for something such as the early history of a society, a religious belief or ritual, or a natural phenomenon'.&lt;ref name =mythmythos&gt;"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670 myth, n.]", "[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124705 mythos, n.]" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|μυθολογία}} [''mythología''] ("story," "lore," "legends," "the telling of stories") combines the word ''mȳthos'' with the suffix -''λογία'' [''-logia''] ("study"), and meant 'romance, fiction, story-telling'.&lt;ref name="oedlogy"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "-logy, ''comb. form''". Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, [[Plato]] used ''mythología'' as a general term for "fiction" or "story-telling" of any kind.

The Greek term ''mythología'' was then borrowed into [[Latin language|Latin]]. [[Late Latin]] ''mythologia'', which occurs in the title of Latin author [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]]' fifth-century ''Mythologiæ'', denoted the explication of Greek and Roman stories about their gods, which we now call [[classical mythology]]. Fulgentius's ''Mythologiæ'' explicitly treated its subject matter as [[allegory|allegories]] requiring interpretation and not as true events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fabius Planciades |last=Fulgentius|title=Fulgentius the Mythographer|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=73mJIuYfmzEC}}|year=1971|publisher=Ohio State University Press|isbn=978-0-8142-0162-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term was then adopted in [[Middle French]] as ''mythologie''. Whether from French or Latin usage, English adopted the word "mythology" in the fifteenth century, at first in the sense 'the exposition of a myth or myths; the interpretation of fables; a book of such expositions'. The word is first attested in [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Troy Book]]'' of c. 1425.&lt;ref name=oedmlogy&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed.

''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

From Lydgate until the seventeenth or eighteenth-century, ''mythology'' was used to mean a [[moral]], [[fable]], [[allegory]] or a [[parable]], or collection of traditional stories,&lt;ref name="oedmlogy" /&gt;{{refn|All which [''sc.''

It came eventually to be applied to similar bodies of [[traditional stories]] among other [[polytheism|polytheistic]] cultures around the world.&lt;ref name="oedmlogy" /&gt;

Thus the word ''mythology'' entered the English language before the word "myth"; [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]'s ''[[Johnson's Dictionary|Dictionary]]'', for example, has an entry for ''mythology'', but not for ''myth''. {{refn|[[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]'s ''[[Johnson's Dictionary|Dictionary]]'', for example, has entries for mythology,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Samuel.

===Meanings in Ancient Greece===
The term μῦθος (''mythos'') appears in the works of [[Homer]] and other poets of Homer's era.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson (2004), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In these works, the term had several meanings: conversation, narrative, speech, story, tale, and word.

Like the related term λόγος (''[[logos]]''), ''mythos'' expresses whatever can be delivered in the form of words; these can be contrasted with  ἔργον (''ergon''), a Greek term for action, deed, and work.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' lacks an explicit distinction between true or false narratives.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

In the context of the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the term ''mythos'' referred to the myth, the narrative, the plot, and the story of a play.&lt;ref name="Wiles"&gt;Wiles (2000), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Wiles, the Greek term ''mythos'' in this era covered an entire spectrum of different meanings, from undeniable falsehoods to stories with religious and symbolic significance.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

According to philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), the spirit of a theatrical play was its ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' was also used for the source material of [[Greek tragedy]]. The tragedians of the era could draw inspiration from [[Greek mythology]], a body of "traditional storylines" which concerned [[Deity|gods]] and [[hero]]es.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; David Wiles observes that modern conceptions about Greek tragedy can be misleading. It is commonly thought that the ancient audience members were already familiar with the ''mythos'' behind a play, and could predict the outcome of the play. However, the Greek dramatists were not expected to faithfully reproduce traditional myths when [[Theatrical adaptation|adapting them for the stage]]. They were instead recreating the myths and producing new versions.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; Storytellers like [[Euripides]] (c. 480–406 BCE) relied on [[suspense]] to excite their audiences. In one of his works, [[Merope (Messenia)|Merope]] attempts to kill her son's murderer with an axe, unaware that the man in question is actually her son. According to an ancient description of audience reactions to this work, the audience members were genuinely unsure of whether she would commit [[filicide]] or she will be stopped in time. They rose to their feet in terror and caused an uproar.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

David Wiles points that the traditional ''mythos'' of Ancient Greece, was primarily a part of its [[oral tradition]]. The [[Greeks]] of this era were a literate culture, but produced no [[Religious text|sacred texts]]. There were no definitive or authoritative versions of myths recorded in texts and preserved forever in an unchanging form.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"&gt;Wiles (2000), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Instead multiple variants of myths were in circulation. These variants were adapted into songs, dances, poetry, and visual art. Performers of myths could freely reshape their source material for a new work, adapting it to the needs of a new audience or in response to a new situation.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

Children in Ancient Greece were familiar with traditional myths from an early age. According to the philosopher [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BCE), mothers and [[nursemaid]]s narrated myths and stories to the children in their charge: David Wiles describes them as a repository of mythological lore.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

[[Bruce Lincoln]] has called attention to the apparent meaning of the terms ''mythos'' and ''logos'' in the works of [[Hesiod]]. In ''[[Theogony]]'', Hesiod attributes to the [[Muse]]s the ability to both proclaim truths and narrate plausible falsehoods (falsehoods which seem like real things).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"&gt;Lincoln (1999), pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; The verb used for narrating the falsehoods in the text is ''legein'', which is etymologically associated with ''logos''. There are two variants in the manuscript tradition for the verb used to proclaim truths. One variant uses ''gerusasthai'', the other ''mythesasthai''. The latter is a form of the verb ''mytheomai'' (to speak, to tell), which is etymologically associated with ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In the ''[[Works and Days]]'', Hesiod describes his dispute with his brother Perses. He also announces to his readers his intention to tell true things to his brother. The verb he uses for telling the truth is ''mythesaimen'', another form of ''mytheomai''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

Lincoln draws the conclusion that Hesiod associated the "speech of ''mythos''" (as Lincoln calls it) with telling the [[truth]]. While he associated the "speech of ''logos''" with telling [[lie]]s, and hiding one's true thoughts (dissimulation).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; This conclusion is strengthened by the use of the plural term ''logoi'' (the plural form of ''logos'') elsewhere in Hesiod's works. Three times the term is associated with the term "[[seduction|seductive]]" and three times with the term "falsehoods".&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In his genealogy of the gods, Hesiod lists ''logoi'' among the children of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess personifying strife. Eris' children are ominous figures, which personify various physical and verbal forms of conflict.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

==Interpreting myths==

===Comparative mythology===
{{Main article|Comparative mythology}}
Comparative mythology is the systematic comparison of myths from different cultures. It seeks to discover underlying themes that are common to the myths of multiple cultures. In some cases, comparative mythologists use the similarities between separate mythologies to argue that those mythologies have a common source. This source may inspire myths or provide a common "protomythology" that diverged into the mythologies of each culture.{{sfn|Littleton|1973|p=32}}

===Functionalism===
A number of commentators have argued that myths function to form and shape society and social behaviour. [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] argued that one of the foremost functions of myth is to establish models for behavior{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 8}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}} and that myths may provide a religious experience. By telling or reenacting myths, members of traditional societies detach themselves from the present, returning to the mythical age, thereby coming closer to the divine.{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 19}}

[[Lauri Honko|Honko]] asserted that, in some cases, a society reenacts a myth in an attempt to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age. For example, it might reenact the healing performed by a god at the beginning of time in order to heal someone in the present.&lt;REF NAME="HONKO-1984"/&gt; Similarly, [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]] argued that modern culture explores religious experience. Since it is not the job of science to define human morality, a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past, which is in contrast with the technological present.{{sfn|Barthes|1972}}

[[Devdutt Pattanaik|Pattanaik]] defines mythology as "a subjective truth of people that is communicated through stories, symbols and rituals". He adds, "unlike fantasy that is nobody’s truth, and history that seeks to be everybody’s truth, mythology is somebody’s truth."&lt;ref name="PD2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/why-i-insist-on-calling-myself-a-mythologist|title=Why I Insist On Calling Myself A Mythologist|last=Pattanaik|first=Devdutt|date=14 September 2015|website=Swarajya|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euhemerism===
{{Main article|Euhemerism}}
{{See also|Herodotus}}
One theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of historical events.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to this theory, storytellers repeatedly elaborate upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gain the status of gods.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} For example, the myth of the wind-god [[Aeolus]] may have evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails and interpret the winds.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}} [[Herodotus]] (fifth-century BCE) and [[Prodicus]] made claims of this kind.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} This theory is named ''[[euhemerism]]'' after mythologist [[Euhemerus]] (c. 320 BCE), who suggested that Greek gods developed from legends about human beings.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}}&lt;ref&gt;"Euhemerism", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegory===
Some theories propose that myths began as allegories for natural phenomena: [[Apollo]] represents the sun, [[Poseidon]] represents water, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to another theory, myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts: [[Athena]] represents wise judgment, [[Aphrodite]] desire, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} [[Max Müller|Müller]] supported an allegorical theory of myth. He believed myths began as allegorical descriptions of nature and gradually came to be interpreted literally. For example, a poetic description of the sea as "raging" was eventually taken literally and the sea was then thought of as a raging god.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}}

===Personification===
{{See also|Mythopoeic thought}}
Some thinkers claimed that myths result from the [[Anthropomorphism|personification]] of objects and forces. According to these thinkers, the ancients worshiped natural phenomena, such as fire and air, gradually deifying them.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 195}} For example, according to this theory, ancients tended to view things as gods, not as mere objects.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 4}} Thus, they described natural events as acts of personal gods, giving rise to myths.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 15}}

===Myth-ritual theory===
{{See also|Myth and ritual}}
According to the myth-ritual theory, myth is tied to ritual.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 61}} In its most extreme form, this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals.{{sfn|Graf|1996|p= 40}} This claim was first put forward by [[William Robertson Smith|Smith]],{{sfn|Meletinsky|2014| pp=19–20}} who argued that people begin performing rituals for reasons not related to myth. Forgetting the original reason for a ritual, they account for it by inventing a myth and claiming the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 63}} [[James Frazer|Frazer]] claimed that humans started out with a belief in magical rituals; later, they began to lose faith in magic and invented myths about gods, reinterpreting their rituals as religious rituals intended to appease the gods.{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

==History of the academic discipline==
Historically, important approaches to the study of mythology have included those of [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Schiller]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Freud]], [[Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[Northrop Frye|Frye]], the Soviet school, and the [[Myth and Ritual School]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Lanoue, Foreword to Meletinsky, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria (1916) (14801987593).jpg|thumb|right|''Myths and legends of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]]'' (1916)]]
The critical interpretation of myth began with the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Presocratics]].{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} Euhemerus was one of the most important pre-modern mythologists. He interpreted myths as accounts of actual historical events – distorted over many retellings. Sallustius&lt;ref&gt;On the Gods and the World, ch. 5, See Collected Writings on the Gods and the World, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; divided myths into five categories – theological, physical (or concerning natural laws), animistic (or concerning soul), material, and mixed. Mixed concerns myths that show the interaction between two or more of the previous categories and are particularly used in initiations.

Plato famously condemned poetic myth when discussing education in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]].'' His critique was primarily on the grounds that the uneducated might take the stories of gods and heroes literally. Nevertheless, he constantly referred to myths throughout his writings. As [[Platonism]] developed in the phases commonly called [[Middle Platonism]] and [[neoplatonism]], writers such as [[Plutarch]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]], [[Olympiodorus the younger|Olympiodorus,]] and [[Damascius]] wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and Orphic myths.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most extended passage of philosophic interpretation of myth is to be found in the fifth and sixth essays of Proclus’ ''Commentary on the Republic'' (to be found in ''The Works of Plato I'', trans. Thomas Taylor, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1996); Porphyry’s analysis of the Homeric Cave of the Nymphs is another important work in this area (''Select Works of Porphyry'', Thomas Taylor The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1994). See the external links below for a full English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythological themes were consciously employed in literature, beginning with [[Homer]]. The resulting work may expressly refer to a mythological background without itself becoming part of a body of myths ([[Cupid and Psyche]]). Medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature. ''Euhemerism'', as stated earlier, refers to the rationalization of myths, putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts. An example of this would be following a cultural or religious paradigm shift (notably the re-interpretation of [[Paganism|pagan]] mythology following [[Christianization]]).

===European Renaissance===
[[File:Bartolomeo di Giovanni - The Myth of Io - Walters 37421.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=The ancient Roman poet Ovid, in his "The Metamorphoses," told the story of the nymph Io who was seduced by Jupiter, the king of the gods. When his wife Juno became jealous, Jupiter transformed Io into a heifer to protect her. This panel relates the second half of the story. In the upper left, Jupiter emerges from clouds to order Mercury to rescue Io. In the lower left, Mercury guides his herd to the spot where Io is guarded by the hundred-eyed Argus. In the upper center, Mercury, disguised as a shepherd, lulls Argus to sleep and beheads him. Juno then takes Argus's eyes to ornament the tail feathers of her peacock and sends the Furies to pursue Io, who flees to the Nile River. At last, Jupiter prevails on his wife to cease tormenting the nymph, who, upon resuming her natural form, escapes to the forest and ultimately becomes the Egyptian goddess Isis|This panel by [[Bartolomeo di Giovanni]] relates the second half of the [[Metamorphoses]].

Interest in polytheistic mythology revived during the [[Renaissance]], with early works of mythography appearing in the sixteenth century, among them the ''[[Theologia mythologica|Theologia Mythologica]]'' (1532).

===Nineteenth century===
The first modern, Western scholarly theories of myth appeared during the second half of the nineteenth century{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} — at the same time as the word ''myth'' was adopted as a scholarly term in European languages.&lt;ref name="mythmythos" /&gt; They were driven partly by a new interest in Europe's ancient past and [[vernacular]] culture, associated with [[Romantic Nationalism]] and epitomised by the research of [[Jacob Grimm]] (1785–1863). This movement drew European scholars' attention not only to Classical myths, but also material now associated with [[Norse mythology]], [[Finnish mythology]], and so forth. Western theories were also partly driven by Europeans' efforts to comprehend and control the cultures, stories and religions they were encountering through [[colonialism]]. These encounters included both extremely old texts such as the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', and current oral narratives such as [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]] or stories told in [[traditional African religions]].&lt;ref name = shippey&gt;Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous'', ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1–28 (esp. pp. 4–13).&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual context for nineteenth-century scholars was profoundly shaped by emerging ideas about [[evolution]]. These ideas included the recognition that many Eurasian languages—and therefore, conceivably, stories—were all descended from a lost common ancestor (the [[Indo-European language]]) which could rationally be reconstructed through the comparison of its descendant languages. They also included the idea that [[Cultural evolution|cultures might evolve]] in ways comparable to species.&lt;ref name = shippey/&gt; In general, nineteenth-century theories framed myth as a failed or obsolete mode of thought, often by interpreting myth as the primitive counterpart of modern science within a [[Unilineal evolution|unilineal]] framework that imagined that human cultures are travelling, at different speeds, along a linear path of cultural development.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 3–4}}

One of the dominant mythological theories of the later nineteenth century was "nature mythology", whose foremost exponents included [[Max Müller]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]. This theory posited that "primitive man" was primarily concerned with the natural world. It tended to interpret myths that seemed distasteful European Victorians—for example tales about sex, incest, or cannibalism—as being metaphors for natural phenomena like agricultural fertility.&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to conceive impersonal natural laws, early humans tried to explain natural phenomena by attributing souls to inanimate objects, giving rise to [[animism]]. According to Tylor, human thought evolved through stages, starting with mythological ideas and gradually progressing to scientific ideas.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 4}} Müller also saw myth arising from language, even calling myth a "disease of language". He speculated that myths arose due to the lack of abstract nouns and neuter gender in ancient languages. Anthropomorphic figures of speech, necessary in such languages, were eventually taken literally, leading to the idea that natural phenomena were in actuality conscious beings or gods.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}} Not all scholars, not even all nineteenth-century scholars, accepted this view. [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] claimed "the primitive mentality is a condition of the human mind, and not a stage in its historical development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mâche|title=Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion| year=1992| page= 8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YNCVOY423HsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first = Francois-Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship, noting the fundamental lack of evidence for "nature mythology" interpretations among people who actually circulated myths, has likewise abandoned the key ideas of "nature mythology".&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Dorson, 'The Eclipse of Solar Mythology', in ''Myth: A Symposium'', ed. by Thomas A. Sebeok (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1955), 25–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James George Frazer]] saw myths as a misinterpretation of magical rituals, which were themselves based on a mistaken idea of natural law: this idea was central to the "[[myth and ritual]]" school of thought.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 67–68}} According to Frazer, humans begin with an unfounded belief in impersonal magical laws. When they realize applications of these laws do not work, they give up their belief in natural law in favor of a belief in personal gods controlling nature, thus giving rise to religious myths. Meanwhile, humans continue practicing formerly magical rituals through force of habit, reinterpreting them as reenactments of mythical events. Finally humans come to realize nature follows natural laws, and they discover their true nature through science. Here again, science makes myth obsolete as humans progress "from magic through religion to science."{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

Segal asserted that by pitting mythical thought against modern scientific thought, such theories imply modern humans must abandon myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}}

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Prometheus by Gustave Moreau.jpg|thumb|''[[Prometheus]]'' (1868) by [[Gustave Moreau]]. In the mythos of [[Hesiodus]] and possibly [[Aeschylus]] (the [[Greek mythos|Greek]] trilogy ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' and ''[[Prometheus Pyrphoros]]''), Prometheus is bound and tortured for giving fire to humanity]]

The earlier twentieth century saw major work developing [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] approaches to interpreting myth, led by [[Sigmund Freud]], who, drawing inspiration from Classical myth, began developing the concept of the [[Oedipus complex]] in his 1899 ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. [[Carl Jung|Jung]] likwise tried to understand the psychology behind world myths. Jung asserted that all humans share certain innate unconscious psychological forces, which he called ''[[archetypes]]''. He believed similarities between the myths of different cultures reveals the existence of these universal archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;Boeree.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-twentieth century saw the influential development of a [[structuralist theory of mythology]], led by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]. Strauss argued that myths reflect patterns in the mind and interpreted those patterns more as fixed mental structures, specifically pairs of opposites (good/evil, compassionate/callous), rather than unconscious feelings or urges.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 113}} Meanwhile, [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] developed analyses of myths focusing on their social functions in the real world. He is associated with the idea that myths such as [[Origin myth|origin stories]] might provide a "mythic charter"—a legitimisation—for cultural norms and social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Birenbaum, ''Myth and Mind'' (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988), pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, following the Structuralist Era (roughly the 1960s to 1980s), the predominant anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth as a form of narrative that can be studied, interpreted and analyzed like ideology, history and culture. In other words, myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that is connected to power, political structures, and political and economic interests. These approaches contrast with approaches such as those of Campbell and Eliade that hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred meanings that transcend cultural specifics. In particular, myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences. Most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense that history is factual, real, accurate, and truth, while myth is the opposite.

In the 1950s, Barthes published a series of essays examining modern myths and the process of their creation in his book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', which stood as an early work in the emerging [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] approach to mythology, which recognised myths' existence in the modern world and in [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wsGDVdYoRA4C&amp;dq=Barthes+Mythologies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKp_nv8q_cAhWlF5oKHSWQB6oQ6AEIJDAA|title = Mythologies|date = 1972|publisher = Hill and Wang|last = Barthes|first = Roland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth century saw rapid [[secularisation]] in Western culture. This made Western scholars more willing to analyse narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as myths; theologians such as [[Rudolf Bultmann]] argued that a modern Christianity needed to [[Demythologization|demythologize]];&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Bultmann, ''Jesus Christ and Mythology'' (New York: Scribner, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; and other religious scholars embraced the idea that the mythical status of Abrahamic narratives was a legitimate feature of their importance.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}} This, in his appendix to ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', and in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] attributed modern humans’ anxieties to their rejection of myths and the sense of the sacred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Christian theologian [[Conrad Hyers]] wrote that
{{quote|...myth today has come to have negative connotations which are the complete opposite of its meaning in a religious context... In a religious context, however, myths are storied vehicles of supreme truth, the most basic and important truths of all. By them people regulate and interpret their lives and find worth and purpose in their existence. Myths put one in touch with sacred realities, the fundamental sources of being, power, and truth. They are seen not only as being the opposite of error but also as being clearly distinguishable from stories told for entertainment and from the workaday, domestic, practical language of a people. They provide answers to the mysteries of being and becoming, mysteries which, as mysteries, are hidden, yet mysteries which are revealed through story and ritual. Myths deal not only with truth but with ultimate truth.{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=107}}}}

===Twenty-first century===
Both in nineteenth-century research that tended to see existing records of stories and folklore as imperfect fragments of partially lost myths, and in twentieth-century structuralist work that sought to identify underlying patterns and structures in often diverse versions of a given myth, there had been a tendency to synthesise sources to attempt to reconstruct what scholars supposed to be more perfect or underlying forms of myths. From the late twentieth century, however, researchers influenced by [[postmodernism]] tended instead to argue that each account of a given myth has its own cultural significance and meaning, and argued that rather than representing degradation from a once more perfect form, myths are inherently plastic and variable.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. John McKinnell, ''Both One and Many: Essays on Change and Variety in Late Norse Heathenism'', Philologia: saggi, ricerche, edizioni a cura bi Teresa Pàroli, 1 (Rome, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; There is, consequently, no such thing as the 'original version' or 'original form' of a myth. One prominent example of this movement was [[A.K. Ramanujan]]'s essay ''[[Three Hundred Ramayanas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Ramanujan, ‘Three Hundred Rāmāyaṇas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation’, in ''[http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft3j49n8h7/ Many Rāmāyaṇas: The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia]'', ed. by Paula Richman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), pp. 22–48; [http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf reprinted] in A.K. Ramanujan, ''The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 131–60, {{ISBN|9780195668964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondingly, scholars challenged the precedence that had once been given to texts as a medium for mythology, arguing that other media, such as the visual arts or even landscape and place-naming, could be as or more important.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ken Dowden, ''The Uses of Greek Mythology'' (London: Routledge, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern mythology==
[[File:10,000 Belgian francs of 1929 edited.jpg|thumb|left|1929 [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[banknote]], depicting [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[caduceus]]]]
In modern society, myth is often regarded as a collection of stories. Scholars in the field of [[cultural studies]] research how myth has worked itself into modern discourses. Mythological discourse can reach greater audiences than ever before via digital media. Various mythic elements appear in [[television]], [[Film|cinema]] and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/nctefiles/resources/journals/ej/1026-jul2013/ej1026exploring.pdf|title=Exploring the Boundaries of Narrative: Video Games in the English Classroom|last=Ostenson|first=Jonathan|date=2013|website=www2.ncte.org/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although myth was traditionally transmitted through the oral tradition on a small scale, the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cinematic Mythmaking: Philosophy in Film|last=Singer|first=Irving|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] psychology myths are the expression of a culture or society’s goals, fears, ambitions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Indick|first=William|date=November 18, 2004|title=Classical Heroes in Modern Movies: Mythological Patterns of the Superhero|url=|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of modern visual storytelling is rooted in the mythological tradition. Many contemporary films rely on ancient myths to construct narratives. [[The Walt Disney Company]] is well-known among cultural study scholars for "reinventing" traditional childhood myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Folklore Studies and Popular Film and Television: A Necessary Critical Survey|last=Koven|first=Michael|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=176–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many films are not as obvious as Disney fairy tales, the plots of many films are based on the rough structure of myths. Mythological archetypes, such as the cautionary tale regarding the abuse of technology, battles between gods and creation stories, are often the subject of major film productions. These films are often created under the guise of [[cyberpunk]] [[action film]]s, [[fantasy]], [[drama]]s and [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] tales.{{sfn|Corner|1999|pp=47–59}}

21st-century films such as ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', ''[[Immortals (2011 film)|Immortals]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' continue the trend of mining traditional mythology to frame modern plots. Authors use mythology as a basis for their books, such as [[Rick Riordan]], whose [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians|Percy Jackson and the Olympians]] series is situated in a modern-day world where the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek deities]] are manifest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/percy-jackson-problem|title=The Percy Jackson Problem|last=Mead|first=Rebecca|date=2014-10-22|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-11-06|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=February 2008}}
'''Near Eastern Archaeology''' (sometimes known as '''Middle Eastern archaeology''') is a regional branch of the wider, global discipline of [[archaeology]]. It refers generally to the excavation and study of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[material culture]] of the [[Near East]] from antiquity to the recent past.

==Definition==
The description "Near Eastern" for this branch of archaeology is, of course, highly Eurocentric and Americocentric, reflecting the origins and growth of the field in Western academic traditions. However, in the absence of better solutions, and the continued heavy involvement of Western academics, the term has taken hold and remains in frequent use.

The definition of the Near East is usually based on the [[Fertile Crescent]]; the region between the Nile Valley (modern [[Egypt]]) and Mesopotamia (modern [[Iraq]]). Also usually included are [[Iran]], the [[Arabian peninsula]] and its islands, Anatolia (modern-day [[Turkey]]), [[Cyprus]] and [[North Africa]] west of Egypt. The history of archaeological investigation in this region grew out of the 19th century discipline of [[Biblical archaeology]], efforts mostly by Europeans to uncover evidence for [[Bible|Biblical]] ([[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments) narratives. Much archaeological work in this region is still influenced by that discipline, although within the last three decades there has been a marked tendency by some archaeologists to dissociate their work from Biblical frameworks.

Near Eastern Archaeology is a term with a wide, often generalised application, and is frequently divided into further regional sub-branches, the archaeology of modern states in the region or along broad thematic lines. Regions can be loosely defined, but are often based on recognizable entities that evidence cultural cohesion and coincide with topographical zones. Scholars may differ on the way the region is divided. Regional divisions also may change from period to period.

The most common fields of study are [[Biblical archaeology]] dealing with the region and history of the [[Bible]]; [[Assyriology]] dealing with [[Mesopotamia]]; [[Egyptology]] dealing with the ancient history of what is today [[Egypt]] and parts of the [[Sudan]]; and [[prehistoric archaeology]] which is not tied to a region but instead deals with the origins of [[culture]] before the invention of [[writing]].

==Geographic subdivisions==
[[Egyptology]] is one example of a specialized branch that deals with the Nile Valley cultures of Egypt and associated regions in sub-Saharan Africa, the Sinai Peninsula to the east, and parts of North Africa. It includes language studies, history and archaeology and their related disciplines. Nowadays, there is much work also done on the prehistoric archaeological record and its practitioners are best described as prehistorians.

The name [[Levant]] (or Syria-Palestine) is used to refer to the area adjacent to the east coast of the Mediterranean. The southern region included in this term encompasses [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], and part of [[Jordan]]. [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] was its ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] name and was also in use during the [[Crusade]]s (1095–1291), the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule (1517-1917) and the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]] (1918–1948). The same region is also called the [[Holy Land]], the [[Land of Israel]], and [[Canaan]] because of biblical associations. The foregoing names can be perceived as having political overtones, meaning that the more neutral, geographically based term the [[southern Levant]] has become popular with archaeologists who wish to refer to this area without prejudice or political orientation.  In many contexts the Sinai Peninsula is also considered to be part of the southern Levant, although it is part of the modern state of Egypt. Archaeologically, it is distinguished from the heartland of Egypt, the Nile Valley and Delta.

The term northern Levant can be used to refer to [[Lebanon]], the Syrian littoral and portions of the Mediterranean coast of Turkey in the province of [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. More usually,  these regions are included in greater Syria, a name used to refer to the whole area between Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Arabia. The Mediterranean coast of Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and parts of Northern Israel are also known as [[Phoenicia]], after the ancient kingdom. However, this term suffers from the same problems as Canaan and equivalents and so is generally now only used in a strict historical sense.

The landmass of [[Anatolia]], most of modern Turkey, is bordered by several seas and includes parts of Northern Mesopotamia. The [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rise in Turkey and flow south into Iraq.

[[Cyprus]] (ancient [[Alashiya]]), a large island in the eastern Mediterranean was a separate cultural entity during most periods of human occupation. However, its proximity to both Anatolia and the northern and southern Levant was responsible for influences from and to both these regions. This was especially the case as Cyprus was an important source of copper for much of the region.

[[Mesopotamia]] ("The Land of Two Rivers") is considered to begin more or less near the modern border with Iraq and refers to the flat valley of the southern [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers and their tributaries. These rivers empty into the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway that separates Iraq from Iran. Sumerology is a very specialized discipline that deals with the history, language and archaeology of ancient [[Sumer]] (southern Mesopotamia), mostly during the [[4th millennium BCE|4th]] and 3rd millennium BCE. [[Assyriology]] deals with the [[Assyria]]ns who succeeded the Sumerians and covers much of the region while that language was still in use.

[[Iran]], sometimes known as [[Persia]], includes a large plateau and its periphery, including the [[Zagros Mountains]]. Sub-disciplines of this region deal mostly with the languages, history and archaeology of regions within this large area.

The Arabian Peninsula and its offshore islands is a separate geographical zone that has contacts with Sinai, the well-watered regions to the north, and by sea with the far-east.

==Organisations==
Due to the historic interest in the archaeology of the Near East, especially due to the Biblical links of the area, there are a large number of organisations dedicated to the archaeological investigation of the region. These include the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] which publishes the journal ''[[Near Eastern Archaeology Magazine]]'', the [[Council for British Research in the Levant]] which publishes the journal [http://www.art.man.ac.uk/ARTHIST/levant.htm Levant], and [[The Netherlands Institute for the Near East]] which publishes the journal [http://www.nino-leiden.nl/publication/bibliotheca-orientalis Bibliotheca Orientalis].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6672">The '''numerical response''' in [[ecology]] is the change in [[predator]] density as a function of change in prey density. The term numerical response was coined by M. E. Solomon in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M. E. "The Natural Control of Animal Populations." Journal of Animal Ecology. 19.1 (1949). 1-35&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the [[functional response]], which is the change in predator's rate of prey consumption with change in prey density. As Holling notes, total predation can be expressed as a combination of functional and numerical response.&lt;ref&gt;Holling, C. S. "The components of predation as revealed by a study of small-mammal predation of the European pine sawfly." Canadian Entomologist 91: 293-320. (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; The numerical response has two mechanisms: the '''demographic response''' and the '''aggregational response'''. The numerical response is not necessarily proportional to the change in prey density, usually resulting in a time lag between prey and predator populations.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, R. E. The Economy of Nature. 6th Edition. New York: Freeman and Company. 2010. p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is often a scarcity of predators when the prey population is increasing.

== Demographic response ==

The demographic response consists of changes in the rates of predator reproduction or survival due to a changes in prey density. The increase in prey availability translates into higher energy intake and reduced energy output. This is different from an increase in energy intake due to increased foraging efficiency, which is considered a functional response. This concept can be articulated in the [[Lotka-Volterra]] Predator-Prey Model.

&lt;math&gt;dP/dt = acVP-mP&lt;/math&gt;

a = conversion efficiency: the fraction of prey energy assimilated by the predator and turned into new predators&lt;br /&gt;
P = predator density&lt;br /&gt;
V = prey density&lt;br /&gt;
m = predator mortality

Demographic response consists of a change in dP/dt due to a change in V and/or m. For example, if V increases, then predator growth rate (dP/dt) will increase. Likewise if the energy intake increases (due to greater food availability) and a decrease in energy output (from foraging), then predator mortality (m) will decrease and predator growth rate (dP/dt) will increase. In contrast, the functional response consists of a change in conversion efficiency (a) or capture rate (c).

The relationship between available energy and reproductive efforts can be explained with the [[Biological life cycle|life history]] theory in the trade-off between fecundity and growth/survival. If an organism has more net energy, then the organism will sacrifice less energy dedicated to survival per reproductive effort and will therefore increase its reproduction rate.

In [[parasitism]], functional response is measured by the rate of infection or laying of eggs in host, rather than the rate of prey consumption as it is measured in predation.  Numerical response in parasitism is still measured by the change in number of adult parasites relative to change in host density.  Parasites can demonstrate a more pronounced numerical response to changes in host density since there is often a more direct connection (less time lag) between food and reproduction in that both needs are immediately satisfied by its interaction with the host.&lt;ref&gt;Holling, C. S. "The components of predation as revealed by a study of small-mammal predation of the European pine sawfly." Canadian Entomologist 91: 293-320.(1959)&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Aggregational response ==

The aggregational response, as defined by Readshaw in 1973, is a change in predator population due to immigration into an area with increased prey population.&lt;ref&gt;Readshaw, J.L. The numerical response of predators to prey density. In: Hughes, Ed., Quantitative Evaluation of Natural Enemy Effectiveness. J. Applied Biol. 10:342-351. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment conducted by Turnbull in 1964, he observed the consistent migration of spiders from boxes without prey to boxes with prey. He proved that hunger impacts predator movement.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, A. L. The search for prey by a web-building spider Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. L. Koch) (Araneae, Theridiidae). Canadian Entomologist 96: 568-579. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riechert and Jaeger studied how predator competition interferes with the direct correlation between prey density and predator immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Riechert, Susan E. Thoughts on Ecological Significance of Spiders. BioScience. 24(6): 352-356. 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, R.G. Competitive Exclusion: Comments on survival and extinction of species. BioScience. 24: 33-39. 1974&lt;/ref&gt; One way this can occur is through exploitation competition: the differential efficiency in use of available resources, for example, an increase in spiders' web size (functional response). The other possibility is interference competition where site owners actively prevent other foragers from coming in vicinity.

== Ecological relevance ==

The concept of numerical response becomes practically important when trying to create a strategy for [[pest control]]. The study of spiders as a biological mechanism for pest control has driven much of the research on aggregational response. Antisocial predator populations that display territoriality, such as spiders defending their web area, may not display the expected aggregational response to increased prey density.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, A. L. The search for prey by a web-building spider Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. L. Koch) (Araneae, Theridiidae). Canadian Entomologist 96: 568-579. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi-Ginzburg equations|Arditi-Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 1989. [http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: ratio dependence].  ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 139: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models.  According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong.  They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 2012. ''How Species Interact: Altering the Standard View on Trophic Ecology''. Oxford University Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10977">'''Nutrient sensing''' is a [[cell (biology)|cell's]] ability to recognize and respond to fuel substrates such as [[glucose]]. Each type of fuel used by the cell requires an alternate pathway of utilization and accessory [[molecules]]. In order to conserve resources a cell will only produce molecules that it needs at the time.  The level and type of fuel that is available to a cell will determine the type of [[enzymes]] it needs to express from its [[genome]] for utilization. [[Receptor (biochemistry)|Receptors]] on the [[cell membrane|cell membrane's]] surface designed to be activated in the presence of specific fuel molecules communicate to the cell [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] via a means of [[cascading interactions]]. In this way the cell is aware of the available nutrients and is able to produce only the molecules specific to that nutrient type.

==Nutrient Sensing in Mammalian Cells==

A rapid and efficient response to disturbances in nutrient levels is crucial for the survival of organisms from bacteria to humans. Cells have therefore evolved a host of molecular pathways that can sense nutrient concentrations and quickly regulate gene expression and protein modification to respond to any changes.&lt;ref&gt;Zagorski, Nick. "Nutrient Sensing, Signaling, &amp; Regulation." Journal of Biological Chemistry. (2010): n. page. Web. 9 Apr. 2013. http://www.jbc.org/site/meeting2010/nutrient&lt;/ref&gt;

Cell growth is regulated by coordination of both extracellular nutrients and intracellular metabolite concentrations. AMP-activated kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 serve as key molecules that sense cellular energy and nutrients levels, respectively.
*The interplay among nutrients, metabolites, gene expression, and protein modification are involved in the coordination of cell growth with extracellular and intracellular conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Molecular Cell, Volume 49, Issue 3, 379-387, 7 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Living cells use ATP as the most important direct energy source. Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate (or AMP and pyrophosphate) provides energy for most biological processes. The ratio of ATP to ADP and AMP is a barometer of cellular energy status and is therefore tightly monitored by the cell. In eukaryotic cells, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a key cellular energy sensor and a master regulator of metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yuan, Hai-Xin|title=Nutrient Sensing, Metabolism, and Cell Growth Control|work=Cell Press|year=2013|accessdate=2 April 2013|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/cbio101/coursework/yuan2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrient Sensing and Epigenetics==

Nutrient sensing and signaling is a key regulator of epigenetic machinery in cancer. During glucose shortage, the energy sensor AMPK activates arginine methyltransferase CARM1 and mediates histone H3 hypermethylation (H3R17me2), leading to enhanced autophagy. In addition, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) signals glucose availability to TET3 and inhibits TET3 by both decreasing its dioxygenase activity and promoting its nuclear export. These observations strongly suggest that nutrient signaling directly targets epigenetic enzymes to control epigenetic modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang YP, Lei QY | title = Metabolic recoding of epigenetics in cancer | journal = Cancer Commun (Lond) | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 25 | pmid = 29784032 | doi = 10.1186/s40880-018-0302-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation of Tissue Growth Through Nutrient Sensing==

Nutrient sensing is a key regulator of tissue growth. The main mediator of cellular nutrient sensing is the protein kinase TOR (target of rapamycin). TOR receives information from levels of cellular amino acids and energy, and it regulates the activity of processes involved in cell growth, such as protein synthesis and autophagy. Insulin-like signaling is the main mechanism of systemic nutrient sensing and mediates its growth-regulatory functions largely through the protein kinase pathway. Other nutrition-regulated hormonal mechanisms contribute to growth control of modulating the activity of insulin-like signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19694515 | doi=10.1146/annurev-genet-102108-134815 | volume=43 | title=Regulation of tissue growth through nutrient sensing | year=2009 | journal=Annu. Rev. Genet. | pages=389–410 | last1 = Hietakangas | first1 = V | last2 = Cohen | first2 = SM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrient Sensing in Plants==

Higher plants require a number of essential nutrient elements for completing their life cycles. Mineral nutrients are mainly acquired by roots from the rhizosphere and are subsequently distributed to shoots. To cope with nutrient limitations, plants have evolved a set of elaborate responses consisting of sensing mechanisms and signaling processes to perceive and adapt to external nutrient availability.&lt;ref&gt;Cui, Xiaofeng. "Nutrient Sensing in Plants." Molecular Plant. (2013): n. page. Web. 9 Apr. 2013 http://mplant.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/10/19/mp.sss107.full&lt;/ref&gt;

*Plants obtain most necessary nutrients by taking them up from the soil into their roots. Although plants cannot move to a new environment when nutrient availability is less than favorable, they can modify their development to favor root colonization of soil areas where nutrients are abundant. Therefore, plants perceive the availability of external nutrients, like nitrogen, and couple this nutrient sensing to an appropriate adaptive response.

==Types of Nutrients in Plants==

Potassium and phosphorus are important macronutrients for crops but are often deficient in the field. Very little is known about how plants sense fluctuations in K and P and how information about K and P availability is integrated at the whole plant level into physiological and metabolic adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;"Getting to the Root of Nutrient Sensing." Cell Press. (2010): n. page. Web. 9 Apr. 2013 http://phys.org/news195736788.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nutrient Sensing and Signaling in Plants." ADVANCES IN BOTANICAL RESEARCH INCORPORATING ADVANCES IN PLANT PATHOLOGY. 43. 49. Web. 9 Apr. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller amounts of other [[Nutrient|micronutrients]] are also important for the growth of the crop. All of these nutrients are equally important for the growth of the plant and lack of one nutrient can result in poor growth of the plant as well as becoming more vulnerable to diseases or can lead to death.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agroservicesinternational.com/Education/Fert1.html|title=What Nutrients do Plants need?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/genbio/raven6b/graphics/raven06b/other/raven06_39.pdf|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nutrients along with CO2 and energy from the sun aids in the development of the plant.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Nitrogen Sensing===
As one of the most vital nutrients for the development and growth of all plants, [[nitrogen]] sensing and the signalling response are vital for plants to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruok|first1=Gabriel|last2=Benoît|first2=Lacombe|last3=Agnieszka|first3=Bielach|last4=Perrine-Walker|first4=Francine|last5=Malinska|first5=Katerina|last6=Mounier|first6=Emmanuelle|last7=Hoyerova|first7=Klara|last8=Tillard|first8=Pascal|last9=Leon|first9=Sarah|last10=Ljung|first10=Karin|last11=Zazimalova|first11=Eva|title=Nitrate-Regulated Auxin Transport by NRT1.1 Defines a Mechanism for Nutrient Sensing in Plants|journal=Developmental Cell|date=June 15, 2010|volume=18|issue=6|pages=927–937|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2010.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants absorb nitrogen through the soil in the form of either [[nitrate]] or [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Cheng-Hsun|last2=Tsay|first2=Yi-Fang|title=Nitrate, ammonium, and potassium sensing and signaling|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|date=October 2010|volume=13|issue=5|pages=604–610|doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2010.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In soil with low oxygen levels, ammonia is the primary nitrogen source, but toxicity is carefully controlled for with the transcription of ammonium transporters (AMTs).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This metabolite and others including glutamate and glutamine have been shown to act as a signal of low nitrogen through regulation of nitrogen transporter gene transcription.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coruzzi|first=Gloria M|last2=Zhou|first2=Li|date=2001-06-01|title=Carbon and nitrogen sensing and signaling in plants: emerging ‘matrix effects’|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526600001680|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|volume=4|issue=3|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/s1369-5266(00)00168-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; NRT1.1, also known as CHL1, is the nitrate transceptor (transporter and receptor) found on the plasma membrane of plants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is both a high and low affinity transceptor that senses varying concentrations of nitrate depending on its T101 residue phosphorylation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has been shown that nitrate can also act as just a signal for plants, since [[mutants]] unable to metabolize are still able to sense the [[ion]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, many plants show the increase of nitrate-regulated genes in low nitrate conditions and consistent [[mRNA]] transcription of such genes in soil high in nitrate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This demonstrates the ability to sense nitrate soil concentrations without [[metabolic]] products of nitrate and still exhibit downstream genetic effects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Potassium Sensing ===
[[Potassium]] (K+), one of the essential [[Nutrient|macronutrients]] is found in plant soil. K+ is the most abundant cation and it is very limited in plant soil. Plants absorb K+ from the soil through channels that are found at the [[Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase|plasma membrane]] of root cells. Potassium is not assimilated into organic matter like other nutrients such as [[nitrate]] and [[ammonium]] but serves as a major osmoticum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674205214601416?_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_docanchor=&amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb|title=Nutrient Sensing in Plants | doi=10.1093/mp/sss107 | volume=5|journal=Molecular Plant|pages=1167–1169 | last1 = Cui | first1 = Xiaofeng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penn State Mont Alto''' is a [[Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth Campus]]. It is located in [[Mont Alto, Pennsylvania|Mont Alto]], in south central [[Pennsylvania]], between [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] and [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]]. It incorporates the '''Pennsylvania State Forest Academy''', founded in 1903 by Governor [[Samuel W. Pennypacker]].

==Institution==
Approximately 1,200 students attend the school with more than 30% being over the age of 24. The majority of the student population at Penn State Mont Alto commute to classes, rather than live in the provided residence halls.

The campus is well known for its [[forestry]] and [[nursing]] majors. While many students elect to continue their education at University Park, Penn State Mont Alto does offer four-year degrees in business as well as English.

Today, Mont Alto offers four baccalaureate degrees and eight associate degrees, and serves nearly 1,300 students annually. The campus serves an additional 2,500 annually through its Continuing Education unit, with courses on campus, at the Chambersburg Mall and other sites.

==History==

=== Pennsylvania State Forest Academy===
[[Joseph Rothrock]], an explorer, botanist and medical doctor founded the academy to train men for service in the state forests.

In May 1903, [[Samuel W. Pennypacker]], governor of Pennsylvania, established the '''Pennsylvania State Forest Academy''' in Mont Alto. With the precipitous closure of the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]] in the same month, the new Pennsylvania school became one of three forestry schools in the nation, along with [[Yale]] and [[Biltmore Forest School|Biltmore]]. [[George Wirt]], the academy's first administrator, patterned the curriculum after curricula in [[Germany]]. All first year students were required to bring a horse with them to the academy until the late 1920s. The horses were used to fight forest fires in the [[Michaux State Forest]].&lt;ref name="ma.psu.edu"&gt;[http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/15737.htm Penn State Mont Alto: Interesting Mont Alto Facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901081552/http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/15737.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/admissions/whypsu/student/forestrymontalto.htm Penn State Undergraduate Admissions - College as an investment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The yearbook of the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy was called "The Oak Leaf". It was published in 1914, 1920, 1923 and 1927, and may now be viewed online through the [[Pennsylvania State University Libraries]] along with other items documenting the history of this campus.&lt;ref name="Forestry Education in Pennsylvania"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libraries.psu.edu/about/collections/forestry-education-pennsylvania|title=Forestry Education in Pennsylvania {{!}} University Libraries|website=libraries.psu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merger with Penn State ===

In 1929 the Forest Academy merged with [[Pennsylvania State University]], establishing '''Penn State Mont Alto'''. Students were adamantly opposed to the merger, and they protested by hanging two state officials in effigy.&lt;ref name="ma.psu.edu" /&gt;

The campus closed from 1943 to 1946 because the students and faculty were fighting in WWII.&lt;ref name="ma.psu.edu" /&gt;

In 1963, Penn State Mont Alto became a Commonwealth Campus.

In 1997, Mont Alto joined the Commonwealth College, and began to offer baccalaureate degrees.

==Overview of the campus==

===Residence halls===
Penn State Mont Alto offers three residence halls to students: Mont Alto Hall, Penn Gate I, and Penn Gate II.

*Mont Alto Hall offers traditional dorm life. All three floors of the building are broken up into an east and a west side, with only one gender belonging to a particular wing. Each room holds two people, although it is possible to obtain a single room given certain circumstances. The rooms are not carpeted, and lack a central AC unit. They do however, include a heater. Each resident is provided with a desk, a phone jack, an Ethernet connection, a dresser, and a closet. The "Microfridge", a combination microwave and refrigerator, is standard as well. Every wing of the building includes a bathroom that the entire hall shares, making for two per floor. Mont Alto Hall also includes a basement with washers/dryers and study rooms. This hall is a mere 4-5 minute walk from virtually anything on campus, with the exception of the Penn Gate dorms and other parts of the campus east of PA 233 (softball fields, etc.).
*Penn Gate II offers four-person suite living. Similar to Mont Alto Hall, the building is three stories tall. While halls themselves are not gender specific, each individual suite is. The four-person suite includes two spacious bedrooms as well as a bathroom that is shared by all four people in the suite. Each room is carpeted and also includes a central air conditioning unit. Penn Gate II is located east of PA 233, and is a fairly long walk (5-10 minute) to campus.
*Penn Gate I is a third residence hall offered at Mont Alto. Located directly adjacent to Penn Gate II, Penn Gate I was not in use during the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 school years due to low enrollment. However, it was reopened for the 2006-2007 school year. Penn Gate I offers a similar four-person suite living accommodation that is provided at Penn Gate II.

===Classroom buildings===
*Conklin Hall was originally built as a dormitory by students of the forestry school starting in 1909 and completed in 1911. The building is now home to the Student Center, Student Affairs offices and the archives.&lt;ref name="history.html"&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/ur/archives/intercom_2002/Feb7/montalto.html history.html&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The General Studies Building is where the majority of classes at Penn State Mont Alto are held. The three story brick building includes many traditional classrooms for lectures. The first floor holds an auditorium that is frequently used for special shows and speakers, as well as large lecture classes. In addition to the auditorium, the first floor holds the Learning Center, a place where students can go to study with a professional or student tutor. Several computer labs are held in the building as well.
*The Science and Technology building is primarily used for science courses at Penn State Mont Alto. In it, you will find several labs specific to different courses such as chemistry and nursing. Many general education courses are held in this building as well, particularly those with large class sizes. It was built in the 1970s.
*The Bookstore has a computer lab in the basement. Classes such as Computer Science and Management &amp; Information Systems are typically held here.

===Other notable buildings===
*Wiestling Hall is the primary building on the campus, located in the center of the campus mall.  Built in 1803, it is the oldest building in the Penn State system. Originally built as an iron master's house it has served as the campus dining hall, classroom and dormitory. The second floor of Wiestling Hall is home to faculty and staff offices. The third floor of Wiestling has never been renovated, and remains true to the 1803 design. This third floor is only accessible through two hidden entranceways on the second floor of the building. Local legend holds that Wiestling is haunted by a ghost named Sarah and by the ghost of Col. Wiestling, the first ironmaster who lived there. In 2004, Wiestling Hall was modernized and now it serves as the student building and houses the campus Student Government Association office.
*History has it that [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] spent time at Emmanuel Chapel before his raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859. Penn State Mont Alto bought the chapel in 1992 for $1 and reopened it in 1999.&lt;ref name="history.html"/&gt;
*The MAC (Multipurpose Activities Center) is the gym at Penn State Mont Alto. This building sports a few classrooms, a basketball gym, a weight room, a racquetball court, and a multipurpose room used for conferences, dances, and other occasions. Two tennis courts are located outside of the MAC as well.
*The [http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/montalto.html library at Penn State Mont Alto] includes a variety of books and research databases that serve faculty, staff, and students, as well as members of the local community. Any Pennsylvania resident may borrow items from the Penn State University library system.
*The most recent building to be added at Penn State Mont Alto was the Bookstore.
*The dining hall was built in 1968.
*September 10, 2014, Penn State Mont Alto opened its Veterans Center. The center was spearheaded by the Penn State Mont Alto Student Veterans Association (SVA) which received a $10,000 VetCenter Initiative grant from the SVA and The Home Depot Foundation partnership to refurbish the spring house on campus (built in 1905). It had previously served as a faculty lounge and mailroom. Now it has computers for Internet access and space for student veterans to study and gather.

==Arboretum==
The '''Mont Alto Arboretum''' is an [[arboretum]] located on the campus ({{coord|40.81004|-77.87744|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-PA|display=inline}}). It was established on [[Arbor Day]] in 1905, just two years after the founding of the [[Pennsylvania State Forest Academy]] in Mont Alto. According to the college, on that day students searched for native tree species not present on campus, and brought back more than 400 specimens (30 [[species]]). These original plantings were then augmented by seeds from other trees native to the United States. This arboretum continues to provide a training ground for students, as well as a research site for the development of new hybrids.

==Athletics==
Penn State–Mont Alto teams participate as a member of the [[United States Collegiate Athletic Association]] (USCAA). The Nittany Lions are a member of the [[Pennsylvania State University Athletic Conference]] (PSUAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, softball, tennis and volleyball.

[[Nilli Lavie]] presented the '''perceptual load theory''' in the mid-nineties as a potential resolution to the early/late selection debate.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|last2=Tsal|first2=Yehoshua|title=Perceptual load as a major determinant of the locus of selection in visual attention|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=1994|volume=56|issue=2|pages=183–197|url=http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/lavielab/reprints/Lavie%20&amp;%20Tsal_1994.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017|doi=10.3758/bf03213897}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= two&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|title=Perceptual load as a necessary condition for selective attention|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1995|volume=21|issue=3|pages=451–468|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fb33/666f554fca9ef4b0da105dc493a9c70edbe0.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.3.451}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate can be summated through two questions, firstly; when in the information processing stream does attention select target information? Secondly; to what degree do distractor stimuli get processed? Prior to Lavie’s theory there were several other suggestions as to how targets are perceived amongst distractor stimuli.

Researcher’s such as Donald Broadbent &lt;ref name= three&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broadbent|first1=Donald. E|title=Perception and Communication|date=1958|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that selection occurs during the early stages of processing by suggesting that information has to go through a sensory filter, and as that filter has a limited capacity all information that is not directly attended to will decay. Whilst researchers such as Deutsch and Deutsch argued that this filtering &lt;ref name= four&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=J. A.|last2=Deutsch|first2=D|title=Attention: some theoretical considerations|journal=Psychological Review|date=Jan 1963|volume=70|issue=1|pages=80–90|doi=10.1037/h0039515}}&lt;/ref&gt; of irrelevant stimuli occurs in the late stages of processing, in that, all of the information is processed on a sensory level but just before the level of working memory the semantic content of the message is the filter. 
Lavie attempts to resolve this debate by stating that both early and late selection occur varying on the stimulus presented.

From the perspective of perceptual load theory stimulus variation means whether the stimulus has high or low perceptual load. Perceptual load refers to the complexity of the physical stimuli, particularly the distractor stimuli e.g. a square surrounded by circles is a scene with low perceptual load whereas a square surrounded by lots of different shapes has high perceptual load. Due to the assumed limited capacity of attentional resources and that distractors have to be processed before the target it is suggested that, in high load tasks the targets attentional resources are depleted faster therefore being able to attend to the target sooner compared to a low load task. This is because the low load task needs to process more of the distractors to exhaust mental resources, therefore the distractors cause a greater inference in finding the target. This demonstrates that selection occurs both in the early stages of processing (high load condition) when the degree of inference is low as the majority of the resources process the target and enables the individual to ignore distractors. As well as the late stages (low load condition) when the distractors are perceived because they take up fewer attentional resources and as such spill over to the distractors which results in them being perceived, causing an interference.&lt;ref name= five&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartwright-finch|first1=Ula|last2=Lavie|first2=Nilli|title=The role of perceptual load in inattentional blindness|journal=Cognition|date=2007|volume=102|issue=3|pages=321–340|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.01.002|pmid=16480973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= six&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|last2=Hirst|first2=A|last3=de Fockhert|first3=J.

==Key assumptions==

Perceptual load theory makes three main assumptions, these are;&lt;ref name= one /&gt;&lt;ref name= two /&gt;

# Attentional resources are limited in capacity.
# Task-relevant stimuli are processed before task-irrelevant stimuli. 
# That all of the attentional resources have to be used up.

Therefore, if the task-relevant stimulus uses all of the attentional resources then none of the task-irrelevant stimuli (distractors) will be processed.

==Criticisms==

In spite of the collection of research that has accumulated over the 90’s and early 2000’s there has been a counter argument posited by Lavie’s PhD supervisor, Tsal Yehoshua. However, it should be noted that in spite of the relevance of Tsal’s critique some of the first critiques to the perceptual load theory pointed out how a visual cue can eliminate the inference effect supposedly created by perceptual load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D. N.|last2=McGrath|first2=A.|last3=McNeil|first3=C.|title=Cuing interacts with perceptual load in visual search|journal=Psychological Science|date=2002|volume=13|issue=3|pages=284–287|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00452|pmid=12009052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paquet|first1=L|last2=Craig|first2=G. L|title=Evidence for selective target processing with a low perceptual load flankers task|journal=Cognition|date=1997|volume=25|issue=2|pages=182–189|doi=10.3758/bf03201111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dilution Effects===

Primarily; the critique that Tsal makes is that perceptual load theory is not a solution to the early selection versus late selection debate but rather is purely an early selection model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benoni|first1=H|last2=Tsal|first2=Y|title=Conceptual and methodological concerns in the theory of perceptual load|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2013|volume=4|page=522|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00522|pmid=23964262|pmc=3741554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggested reason that causes the inference rates to change between simple versus complex displays is dilution not load.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsal|first1=Y|last2=Benoni|first2=H|title=Where have we gone wrong? Perceptual load does not affect selective attention|journal=Vision Research|date=2010|volume=50|issue=13|pages=1292–1298|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.04.018|pmid=20430048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning that the high load condition has lower inference because the higher number/more complex distractors, not because of perceptual load. This was tested in a series of experiments &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; which took the classic perceptual load experiments &lt;ref name= one /&gt; and added a new condition, the dilution condition. The way this condition varied is that it makes the distractors in the task the same colour, and making that colour differ from the target letter. This creates a condition that is low in load, and high in dilution and thus isolates dilution as a variable. The result of this manipulation was not that of a higher inference rate in low perceptual load conditions comparative to high as seen in the original perceptual load experiments. Rather that inference levels were significantly lower in the low load and dilution conditions compared to the high load.

===Distractor Salience===

Another proposed theory to explain results attained by Lavie’s original experiments is that of distractor salience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eltiti|first1=Stacy|last2=Wallace|first2=Denise|last3=Fox|first3=Elaine|title=Selective target processing: Perceptual load or distractor salience?|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=2005|volume=67|issue=5|pages=876–885|doi=10.3758/bf03193540}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the title suggests this theory concerns the salience, or prominence, of a distractor as being the primary factor in inducing these results instead of load. By manipulating the onset versus offset of the distractor, research displayed the effect of salience on selective information. In this research onset and offset differed in terms of when the distractor was presented, either simultaneously with the singleton search task (onset) or having it appear with a fixation point before the task (offset). This resulted in an inference effect on reaction times when searching for the target in the onset condition regardless of whether the trial was a high load trial or a low load trial. This demonstrates that the effect seen in Lavie’s work &lt;ref name= one /&gt; is not as a result of load manipulation, but of distractor salience.

===Methodological Issues===

There are also some crucial methodological issues with perceptual load theory research pertaining to experimental design.&lt;ref name= two /&gt;&lt;ref name= five /&gt;&lt;ref name= six /&gt;&lt;ref name= seven /&gt;&lt;ref name= eight /&gt; Specifically, the use of a blocked design compared to a mixed design in the experiments. In this case, blocked experimental design is when all of the trials with either low or high perceptual load are carried out sequentially within a block of trials. Whereas, a mixed experimental design has combination of both low and high perceptual load trials that are randomly intermixed within a block of trials. The issue with using a blocked design is that the repetition of the same experimental condition can allow for attention to be localised in one particular spot. Research has shown that when conducting a perceptual load task under a mixed design there is no significant difference in interference between low load and high load conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Janice E|last2=Jones|first2=Craig|title=Attention to local form information can prevent access to semantic information|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=2010|volume=55|issue=2|pages=609–625|doi=10.1080/02724980143000370|pmid=12047062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, suggesting that when the trials are blocked it is not perceptual load that causes the difference in interference rather how localised the participants field of attention was. This has since been expanded and developed by &lt;ref name= nineteen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhe|last2=Cave|first2=Kyle R|title=Perceptual load vs. dilution: the roles of attentional focus, stimulus category, and target predictability|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=June 2013|volume=4|pages=1–14|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00327|pmid=23761777|pmc=3675768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhe|last2=Cave|first2=Kyle R|title=Identifying Visual Targets Amongst Interfering Distractors: Sorting Out the Roles of Perceptual Load, Dilution, and Attentional Zoom|journal=Attention, Pereception, and Psychophsics|date=2016|volume=78|issue=7|pages=1822–38|doi=10.3758/s13414-016-1149-9|pmid=27250363}}&lt;/ref&gt; and be coined as ‘Attentional Zoom’.

===Attentional Zoom===

As previously discussed attentional zoom was coined by researchers Zhe Chen and Kyle Cave as an alternative explanation to the results seen in perceptual load theory. The pair also critique other attempts into understanding the data presented by perceptual load theory, such as dilution.&lt;ref name=nineteen /&gt; Attentional zoom theory states that participants can process distractors when they are within their attentional focus. So when an individual is induced to have a small attentional focus and the distractors fall outside of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eriksen|first1=Charles W|last2=St James|first2=J. D.|title=Visual attention within and around the field of focal attention: A zoom lens model|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=1986|volume=40|issue=4|page=225|doi=10.3758/BF03211502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise for a larger attentional focus that incorporates distractors a higher level of inference is seen. This can be demonstrated as separate from dilution as in &lt;ref name= nineteen /&gt; dilution through luminance decrease had no effect on distractor processing whilst being cued as to whether a target would appear in either one of two locations or one of six did. According to dilution theory the two trials should be show similar levels of inference regardless of cueing, however, what this experiment reveals is that when cued for two locations the attentional focus of the participants narrowed, thus reducing the effect of the distractor as it was outside the attentional view. Whereas, when the target was cued for six the attentional focus was forced to widen and as such the distractor could be processed causing an inference effect.

'''Pseudorealism''', also spelled '''pseudo-realism''', is a term used in a variety of discourses connoting [[art]]istic and dramatic techniques, or work of art, film and literature perceived as superficial, ''not-real'', or non-realistic.&lt;ref name="ELS-AM"&gt;Eric Loren Smoodin, Ann Martin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-Fs0Vwa_nQC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xaHOTtSkB8OViQKC6LXPBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;f=false ''Hollywood quarterly: film culture in postwar America, 1945-1957.'' Page 235.] ''University of California Press.''&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, the term is highly subjective.&lt;ref name="huxley"&gt;[http://www.huxley.net/  A Defence Of Paradise-Engineering.] ''BLTC Research'', 1998. ''Use of term: pseudo-realism.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term pseudo-realism has been used to describe a certain type of cultural commodities such as film productions and TV programmes which portray everyday life in excessively realistic detail in order to achieve greater impact on viewers.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite book |title=The Culture Industry Revisited: Theodor W.

Following the great shift towards expressionism in painting, André Bazin used the word ''pseudoreal'' in reference to mechanical means which freed the plastic arts from the drive toward 'unachievable likeness'. Meanwhile, [[photorealist]]ic CGI animation and [[3D computer graphics]] used today have become indistinguishable from cine-photography. In that regard, the [[special effects]] augmenting feature film through photographic deception of the eye have gained an entirely different dimension.&lt;ref name="Surman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Surman |url=https://www.academia.edu/168038/CGI_Animation_Pseudorealism_Perception_and_Possible_Worlds  |title=CGI Animation - Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds |work=Master's Thesis |publisher=GameCareerGuide.com (reprint)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer generated imagery and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] animation are used not only to bolster reality based images but also to create imaginary worlds.  
{{quote|We understand the CGI feature film to be an image of pseudorealism in Bazin’s terms – a fundamental deception of the eye. Of course the cinema itself in whatever incarnation involves a deception of the eye, that of the ‘persistence of vision’ effect. Though things appear to exist and have causal properties, they are the product of man-made parameters. — David Surman, "CGI Animation: Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds" &lt;ref name="Surman"/&gt;}}

Christopher Hitchens equates ''pseudo-realism'' with [[Socialist realism]] of the Stalinist era as exposed by Orwell.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;Christopher Hitchens, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GnOe11NJXUC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=definition+of+pseudo-realism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4f_qyMo9cg&amp;sig=VUkTJ3B4EpDI3VQTv8Bu9cIqhsk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iprOToTmOYPKiALAnP28Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20pseudo-realism&amp;f=false  ''Why Orwell Matters''.

Various researchers have undertaken efforts to examine the '''psychological effects of Internet use'''. Some research employs studying [[brain function]]s in [[Internet]] users. Some studies assert that these changes are harmful, while others argue that asserted changes are beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/2010/06/17/carr-pinker-the-shallows-and-t-1/ |title=Carr, Pinker, the shallows, and the nature-nurture canard : Neuron Culture |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date= |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assertions==
American writer [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] asserts that Internet use reduces the deep [[thinking]] that leads to true [[creativity]]. He also says that [[hyperlink]]s and [[overstimulation]] means that the brain must give most of its attention to short-term decisions. Carr also states that the [[Information overload|vast availability of information]] on the [[World Wide Web]] overwhelms the brain and hurts [[long-term memory]]. He says that the availability of stimuli leads to a very large [[cognitive load]], which makes it difficult to remember anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1 |title=Author Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains &amp;#124; Magazine |publisher=Wired.com |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16423330 |title=The effects of the Internet: Fast forward |publisher=The Economist |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abandonment rate of online video users for different Internet connectivities.jpg|thumbnail|In a recent study&lt;ref name="people.cs.umass.edu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.cs.umass.edu/~ramesh/Site/HOME_files/imc208-krishnan.pdf| title= Video Stream Quality Impacts Viewer Behavior, by Krishnan and Sitaraman, ACM Internet Measurement Conference|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving millions of users watching online videos, users with faster Internet connectivity (e.g., fiber) abandoned a slow-loading video at a faster rate than similar users with slower Internet connectivity (e.g., cable or mobile).  Commentators have argued that the  [[Ramesh Sitaraman|Sitaraman]] study shows that when humans get accustomed to a faster flow of information on the Internet, they become more impatient and have less tolerance for delays.&lt;ref name="nickcarr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; ]]
Computer scientist [[Ramesh Sitaraman]] has asserted that Internet users are impatient and are likely to get more impatient with time.&lt;ref name= "NPR"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/10/168974423/in-video-streaming-rat-race-fast-is-never-fast-enough/| title =NPR Morning Edition: In Video-Streaming Rat Race, Fast is Never Fast Enough, October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a large-scale research study&lt;ref name="people.cs.umass.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121113134805.htm| title = Science Daily: How Online Video Stream Quality Affect Viewer Behavior, November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that completed in 2012 involving millions of users watching videos on the Internet, Krishnan and Sitaraman show that users start to abandon online videos if they do not start playing within two seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/tech/web/video-loading-study/| title =CNN: Online viewers ditch slow-loading video after 2 seconds, November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition,  users with faster Internet connections (such as [[FTTH]]) showed less patience and abandoned videos at a faster rate than users with slower Internet connections. Many commentators have since argued that these results provide a glimpse into the future: as  Internet services become faster and provide more instant gratification,  people become less patient&lt;ref name="nickcarr"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.roughtype.com/?p=2069 | title= Patience is a Network Effect, by Nicholas Carr, Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;[http://edge.org/response-detail/23721 The Patience Deficit], by Nicholas Carr, Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and less able to delay gratification and work towards longer-term rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/02/01/the-growing-culture-impatience-where-instant-gratification-makes-crave-more-instant-gratification/q8tWDNGeJB2mm45fQxtTQP/story.html?s_campaign=8315| title =Boston Globe: Instant gratification is making us perpetually impatient, Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], however, argues that people have control over what they do, and that research and reasoning never came naturally to people. He says that "experience does not revamp the basic information-processing capacities of the brain" and asserts that  the Internet is actually making people smarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/opinion/11Pinker.html?scp=1&amp;sq=mind%20over%20mass%20media&amp;st=cse |title=Mind Over Mass Media |publisher=The New York Times |date=2010-06-10|accessdate=4 July 2010 | first=Steven | last=Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MRI studies==
The BBC describes the research published in the peer-reviewed science journal ''[[PLoS ONE]]'':

:"A research team led by Hao Lei of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan carried out brain scans of 35 men and women aged between 14 and 21. Seventeen of them were classed as having [[Internet addiction disorder]] (IAD) on the basis of answering yes to questions such as, “Have you repeatedly made unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back or stop Internet use?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16505521 |title=Web addicts have brain changes, research suggests |author=Helen Briggs |work=BBC News |date=11 January 2012 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialised [[MRI brain scan]]s showed changes in the [[white matter]] of the brain—the part that contains nerve fibres—in those classed as being web addicts, compared with non-addicts. Furthermore, the study says, "We provided evidences demonstrating the multiple structural changes of the brain in IAD subjects. VBM results indicated the decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the cerebellum and the left rostral ACC (rACC)."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0020708 |title=Microstructure Abnormalities in Adolescents with Internet Addiction Disorder  |vauthors=Yuan K, Qin W, Wang G, Zeng F, Zhao L, etal |work=PLoS ONE |volume= 6|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020708 |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |pmid=21677775 |pmc=3108989 |page=e20708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCLA professor of psychiatry Gary Small studied brain activity in experienced web surfers versus casual web surfers. He used MRI scans on both groups to evaluate brain activity.  The study showed that when Internet surfing, the  brain activity of the experienced Internet users  was far more extensive than that of the novices, particularly in areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with problem-solving and decision making. However, the two groups had no significant differences in brain activity when reading blocks of text.  This  evidence suggested that the distinctive neural pathways of experienced Web users had developed because of their Web use. Dr. Small concluded that “The current explosion of digital technology not only is changing the way we live and communicate, but is rapidly and profoundly altering our brains.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1 |title=The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains |author=Nicholas Carr |work=Wired Magazine |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on traditional reading===
In an August 2008 article in ''The Atlantic'' ("[[Is Google Making Us Stupid?]]"), Nicholas Carr experientially asserts that using the Internet can lead to lower [[attention span]] and make it more difficult to read in the traditional sense (that is, read a book at length without mental interruptions). He says that he and his friends have found it more difficult to concentrate and read whole books, even though they read a great deal when they were younger (that is, when they did not have access to the Internet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/ |title=Is Google Making Us Stupid? |author=Nicholas Carr |work=The Atlantic |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assertion is based on anecdotal evidence, not controlled research.

Researchers from the University College London have done a 5-year study on Internet habits, and have found that people using the sites exhibited “a form of skimming activity,” hopping from one source to another and rarely returning to any source they’d already visited. The 2008 report says, "It is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense; indeed there are signs that new forms of “reading” are emerging as users “power browse” horizontally through titles, contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins. It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1108/00012530810887953 | volume=60 | title=The Google generation: the information behaviour of the researcher of the future | year=2008 | journal=Aslib Proceedings | pages=290–310 | author=Rowlands Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain power==
Research suggests that using the Internet helps boost brain power for middle-aged and older people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6395627/Internet-use-may-improve-brain-function-in-adults-says-UCLA-study.html | work=The Telegraph UK | title=Internet use 'may improve brain function in adults', says UCLA study | first=Tom |last=Chivers | date=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (research on younger people has not been done). The study compares brain activity when the subjects were reading and when the subjects were surfing the Internet. It found that Internet surfing uses much more brain activity than reading does. Lead researcher Professor Gary Small said: "The study results are encouraging, that emerging computerized technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle-aged and older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailychump.org/internet-use-increases-brain-activity-in-seniors/ | work=DailyChump | title=Internet Use Increases Brain Activity in Seniors | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet searching engages complicated brain activity, which may help exercise and improve brain function."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7667610.stm | work=BBC News | title=Internet use 'good for the brain' | date=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productivity==
One of the most widely debated effects of [[social networking]] has been its influence on productivity. In many schools and workplaces, social media sites are blocked because employers believe their employees will be distracted and unfocused on the sites. It seems, at least from one study, that employers do, indeed, have reason to be concerned. A survey from [[Hearst Communications]] found that productivity levels of people that used social networking sites were 1.5% lower than those that did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jung|first=Brian|title=The Negative Effect of Social Media on Society and Individuals|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/negative-effect-social-media-society-individuals-27617.html|work=Chron|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logically, people cannot get work done when they are performing other tasks. If the employees suffer from degrading self-control, it will be even harder for them to get back to work and maintain productivity.

==Effects of social networking and behavior==
[[Evgeny Morozov]] has said that social networking could be potentially harmful to people. He writes that they can destroy privacy, and notes that "Insurance companies have accessed their patients’ Facebook accounts to try to disprove they have hard-to-verify health problems like depression; employers have checked social networking sites to vet future employees; university authorities have searched the web for photos of their students’ drinking or smoking [[cannabis (drug)|pot]]." He also said that the Internet also makes people more complacent and risk averse. He said that because much of the ubiquity of modern technology—cameras, recorders, and such—people may not want to act in unusual ways for fear of getting a bad name. People can see pictures and videos of you on the Internet, and this may make you act differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/06/losing-our-minds-to-the-web/ |title=Losing our minds to the web |publisher=Prospect Magazine |date=2010-06-22 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attention span==
According to the [[New York Times]], many scientists say that "people's ability to focus is being undermined by bursts of information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/technology/07brain.html?ref=matt_richtel&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Attached to Technology and Paying a Price | first=Matt | last=Richtel | date=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 53,573 page views taken from various users, 17% of the views lasted less than 4 seconds while 4% lasted more than 10 minutes. In regards to page content, users will only read 49% of a site that contains 111 words or fewer while users will opt to read 28% of an average website (approximately 593 words). For each additional 100 words on a site, users will spend 4.4 seconds longer on the site.&lt;ref name="Attention Span Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Attention Span Statistics|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/attention-span-statistics/|work=Statistic Brain|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is found that those who read articles online go through the article more thoroughly than those who read from print-based materials. Upon choosing their reading material, online readers read 77% of the content, which can be compared to broadsheet newspaper where the corresponding number is 62%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=Belinda|title=Web news readers have greater attention span: study|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/31/us-internet-attention-idUSL292443320070331|work=Reuters|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=31 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of anonymity ==

{{See also|Internet anonymity|Anonymous post}}

Interacting on the Internet mostly does not involve "physical" interactions with another person (i.e. face-to-face conversation), and therefore easily leads to a person feeling free to act differently online, as well as unrestraint in [[civility]] and minimization of authority, etc.

People who are [[Social anxiety|socially anxious]] are more likely to use electronic communication as their only means of communication. This, in turn, makes them more likely to disclose personal information to strangers online that they normally wouldn't give out face-to-face.&lt;ref&gt;Cyberbullying: Bullying in the Digital Age&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is a likely cause for the prevalence of [[cyberbullying]], especially for children who do not understand "social networking etiquette."

Internet anonymity can lead to [[Online disinhibition effect|online disinhibition]], in which people do and say things online that they normally wouldn't do or say in person.  Psychology researcher [[John Suler]] differentiates between ''benign disinhibition'' in which people can grow psychologically by revealing secret emotions, fears, and wishes and showing  unusual acts of kindness and generosity and ''toxic disinhibition'', in which people use rude language, harsh criticisms, anger, hatred and threats or visit pornographic or violent sites that they wouldn't in the 'real world.'  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1089/1094931041291295 | volume=7 | title=The Online Disinhibition Effect | year=2004 | journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior | pages=321–326 | author=Suler John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet addiction ==

{{Main|Internet addiction disorder|}}

People become [[Internet addiction disorder|addicted]] or dependent on the Internet through excessive computer use that interferes with daily life.  [[Kimberly Young|Kimberly S. Young]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Young K | year = 1998 | title = The relationship between depression and internet addiction | url = | journal = CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 25–28 | doi=10.1089/cpb.1998.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  links internet addiction disorder with existing mental health issues, most commonly depression. Young states that the disorder has significant effects socially, psychologically and occupationally.

"Aric Sigman’s presentation to members of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health outlined the parallels between screen dependency and alcohol and drug addiction: the instant stimulation provided by all those flickering graphics leads to the release of [[dopamine]], a chemical that’s central to the brain’s reward system".&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

A 2009 study suggested that brain structural changes were present in those classified by the researchers as Internet addicted, similar to those classified as chemically addicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Zhou Y, etal | year = 2009 | title = Gray matter abnormalities in Internet addiction: A voxel-based morphometry study | url = | journal = European Journal of Radiology | volume = 79| issue = | pages = 92–95| doi = 10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.10.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, the researchers selected seventeen subjects with online gaming addiction and another seventeen naive internet users who rarely used the internet. Using a magnetic resonance imaging scanner, they performed a scan to "acquire 3-dimensional T1-weighted images" of the subject's brain. The results of the scan revealed that online gaming addiction "impairs gray and white matter integrity in the orbitofrontal cortex of the prefrontal regions of the brain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weng|first1=Chuan-Bu|title=Gray matter and white matter abnormalities in online game addiction|date=2013|pmid=23328472|volume=92|journal=Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi|pages=3221–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Keath Low, psychotherapist, the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] "has a major impact on our ability to perform such tasks as planning, prioritizing, paying attention to and remembering details, and controlling our attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Low|first1=Keath|title=Executive functions and ADD - ADHD. What are executive functions? How do executive functions relate to ADD - ADHD?|url=http://add.about.com/od/adhdthebasics/a/Execu-Functions.htm|website=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Keith Low believes that these online gaming addicts are incapable of prioritizing their life or setting a goal and accomplishing it because of the impairment of their orbitofrontal cortex.

==Escapism ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}
{{Main|Escapism}}

Ease of access to the Internet can increase [[escapism]] in which a user uses the Internet as an "escape" from the perceived unpleasant or banal aspects of daily/[[real life]]. Because the internet and virtual realities easily satisfy social needs and drives, according to Jim Blascovich and Jeremy Bailensen, "sometimes [they are] so satisfying that addicted users will withdraw physically from society.”  Stanford psychiatrist Dr. Elias Aboujaoude believes that advances in virtual reality and  immersive 3-D have led us to  “where we can have a ‘full life’ [online] that can be quite removed from our own.” Eventually, virtual reality may drastically change a person’s social and emotional needs.  “We may stop ‘needing’ or craving real social interactions because they may become foreign to us,” Aboujaoude says.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/the-good-and-the-bad-of-escaping-to-virtual-reality/385134/ Monica Kim, "The Good and the Bad of Escaping to Virtual Reality", ''The Atlantic'', February 20, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on children==
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}
[[Internet]] has its impact on all age groups from elders to children. According to the article 'Digital power: exploring the effects of social media on children’s spirituality', children consider the Internet as their third place after home and school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Digital power: exploring the effects of social media on children’s spirituality | doi=10.1080/1364436X.2014.924908 | volume=19 | journal=International Journal of Children's Spirituality | pages=133–143 | year=2014 | author=Yust Karen-Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main effects social media has had on children is the effect of cyber bullying. A study carried out by 177 students in Canada found that “15% of the students admitted that they cyberbullied others” while “40% of the cyber victims had no idea who the bullies were”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Q|year=2010|title=cyberbullying in high schools: A Study of student behaviours and beliefs about this new phenomenon|url=|journal=journal of aggression, Maltreatment and trauma|volume=|pages=372–392|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological harm cyber bullying can cause is reflected in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It also opens up avenues for manipulation and control.  Cyber bullying has ultimately led to depression, anxiety and in severe cases suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth between the ages of 10 and 24. Cyber bullying is rapidly increasing. Some writers have suggested monitoring and educating children from a young age about the risks associated with cyber bullying. {{Cite: Adams Richar,2015, [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/16/bullying-at-school-in-decline-but-cyberbullying-is-on-the-increase 'Fewer school bullies but cyberbullying is on the increase']}}  Not only does cyberbullying effect children but a huge issue is insomnia. This is because of the amount of time spent using the internet. children use on average 27 hours of internet a week and it is on the increase. {{ cite: Jerald J. Block, M.D.2008

== Effects on parenting ==
"A psychologist, Aric Sigman, warned of the perils of “passive [[parenting]]” and “benign [[neglect]]” caused by parent's reliance on gadgets".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|title=How technology is taking hold of our children's lives|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9282582/How-technology-is-taking-hold-of-our-childrens-lives.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=26 May 2012|author=Rowan Pelling|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, parents' internet addictions can have drastic effects on their children.   In 2009, a three-year-old girl from New Mexico died of malnutrition and dehydration on the same day that her mother was said to have spent 15 hours playing World of Warcraft online.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; In another case in 2014, a Korean couple became so immersed in a video game that allowed them to raise a virtual child online that they let their real baby die.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2014/08/15/korean-couple-let-baby-die-while-they-played-video-game-261483.html Sean Elder, "Korean Couple Let Baby Die While They Played Video Game", ''Newsweek'', August 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
The effects of the Internet on parenting can be observed a how parents utilize the Internet, the response to their child's Internet consumption, as well as the effects and influences that the Internet has on the relationship between parent and child.

===Parental Internet use and opinions towards family impact===
Overall, parents are seen to do simple tasks such as sending e-mails and keep up with current events whereas social networking sites are less frequented. In regards to researching parental material, a study conducted in January 2012 by the [[University of Minnesota]] found that 75% of questioned parents have stated that the Internet improves their method of obtaining parenting related information, 19.7% found parenting websites too complex to navigate, and 13.1% of the group did not find any useful parenting information on any website.&lt;ref name=parenting_20&gt;{{cite web|title=Parents' Use of Technology and the Internet|url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/fsos/projects/parent20/pdf/p20summaryreport-july2012.pdf|publisher=University of Minnesota|author=Jessie Connell|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have shown that parents view the Internet as a hub of information especially in their children's education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mesch|first=Gustavo|title=Family Relations and the Internet: Exploring a Family Boundaries Approach|journal=The Journal of Family Communication|year=2007|pages=119–138|url=http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/gustavo/files/1436.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They feel that it is a valuable commodity that can enhance their learning experience and when used in this manner it does not contribute to any family tension or conflicts. However, when the Internet is used as a social medium (either online gaming or social networking sites) there is a positive correlation between the use of the Internet and family conflicts. In conjunction with using the Internet for social means, there is a risk of exposing familial information to strangers, which is perceived to parents as a threat and can ultimately weaken family boundaries.

===Parental response to child #nline consumption===
A report released in October 2012 by [[Ofcom]] focused on the amount of online consumption done by children aged 5–15 and how the parents react to their child’s consumption. Of the parents interviewed, 85% use a form of online mediation ranging from face-to-face talks with their children about online surfing to cellphone browser filters. The remaining 15% of parents do not take active measures to adequately inform their children of safe Internet browsing; these parents have either spoken only briefly to their children about cautious surfing or do not do anything at all.

Parents are active in monitoring their child’s online use by using methods such as investigating the browsing history and by regulating Internet usage. However, since parents are less versed in Internet usage than their children they are more concerned with the Internet interfering with family life than online matters such as [[child grooming]] or [[cyber-bullying]].

When addressing those with lack of parental control over the Internet, parents state that their child is rarely alone (defined for children from 5–11 years old) or that they trust their children when they are online (for children 12–15 years old). Approximately 80% of parents ensure that their child has been taught Internet safety from school and 70% of parents feel that the benefits of using the Internet are greater than the risks that come along with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/media-literacy/oct2012/main.pdf|work=Ofcom|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely an American study, conducted by PewInternet released on November 20, 2012, reveal that parents are highly concerned about the problems the Internet can impose on their teenage children. 47% of parents are tend to worry about their children being exposed to inappropriate material on the Internet and 45% of the parents are concerned about their children’s behaviour towards each other both online offline. Only 31% of parents showed concern about the Internet taking away social time from the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parents, Teens, and Online Privacy|url=http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Teens-and-Privacy/Main-Report/Introduction.aspx|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=10 February 2013|author1=Mary Madden |author2=Sandra Cortesi |author3=Urs Gasser |author4=Amanda Lenhart |author5=Maeve Duggan |date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of Internet use on parent-child relationships===
Researcher Sanford Grossbart and others explores the relationship between the mother and child and how Internet use affects this relationship. This study forms its basis around Marvin Sussman and Suzanne Steinmetz’s idea that the relationship between parent and child is highly influenced by the changing experiences and events of each generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sussman |first1=Marvin |title=Handbook of Marriage and the Family|year=1987|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|author2=Suzanne Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Parental warmth” is a factor in how receptive a parent is to being taught the nuances of the Internet by their child versus the traditional method of the parent influencing the child. If the parent displayed “warm” tendencies she was more open to learning how to use the Internet from their child even if the parent happened to be more knowledgeable on the subject. This fosters teaching in a positive environment, which sustains a strong relationship between mother and child, encourages education, and promotes mature behaviour. “Cooler” mothers only allowed themselves to be taught if they thought that their child held the same amount of knowledge or greater and would dismiss the teaching otherwise suggesting a relationship that stems from the majority of influence coming from the parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sanford Grossbart |author2=Stephanie McConnell Hughes |author3=Susie Pryor |author4=Amber Yost |title=Socialization Aspects of Parents, Children, and the Internet|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|year=2002|volume=29|pages=66–70|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=8559|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite ''warm'' and ''cool'' parenting methods, parents who encounter a language barrier rely more heavily on their children to utilize the Internet. Vikki Katz of [[Rutgers University]] has studied the interaction between immigrant parents and children and how they use technology. Katz notes that the majority resources that immigrants find helpful are located online, however the search algorithms currently in place do not direct languages other than English appropriately.  Because of this shortcoming, parents strongly encourage their bilingual children to bridge the gap between the Internet and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=Alex|title=Immigrant Parents Rely On Kids For Help Online|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/12/141232534/immigrant-parents-rely-on-kids-for-help-online|work=NPR|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet is increasingly being used as a virtual babysitter when parents actively download applications specifically for their children with intentions to keep them calm. A survey conducted by [[Ipsos]] has found that half of the interviewed parents believe children ages 8–13 are old enough to own or carry smartphones thus increasing online content consumption in younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atagana|first=Michelle|title=US parents relying on mobile devices to entertain their kids [Survey]|url=http://memeburn.com/2012/09/us-parents-relying-on-mobile-devices-to-entertain-their-kids-survey/|work=Memeburn|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arabic]] word ''qada'' (قُضِي) means literally "carrying out or fulfilling". In [[Islamic]] [[jurisprudence]] it refers to fulfilling or completing those duties that one may have missed due to some reason or other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.as-sidq.org/glossary.html | title=Islamic Glossary | work=As-Sidq Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also mean ''qadee'', a [[court]] judgement or the art of adjudication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.islaminme.com/articles/it_03.htm | title=Islamic terms | work=Islam in me}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''qadee'' is binding and enforceable, unlike a [[fatwa]], which is merely a legal opinion. Issued by a [[Qadi|Qaadee]] ([[judge]]) in response to a specific case and circumstances. The ''qaadee'' may request a ''fatwa'' to help determine the legal outcome of a specific case but is not bound to follow it. The decision is based on recognized legal precedent.

Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 14(3):329--366, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Arbab: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-24933-4_9 Puff, The Magic Protocol]. In Gul Agha, Olivier Danvy, Jose Meseguer, editors, Talcott Festschrift, volume 7000 of LNCS, pages 169-206. Springer, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[domain-specific language]] for programming and analyzing coordination protocols that compose individual ''processes'' into full ''systems'', broadly construed.
Examples of classes of systems that can be composed with Reo include [[Component-based software engineering|component-based]] systems, [[Service-oriented architecture|service-oriented]] systems, [[Thread (computing)|multithreading]] systems, [[Systems biology|biological]] systems, and cryptographic protocols.
Reo has a graphical syntax in which every Reo program, called a ''connector'' or ''circuit'', is a labeled directed [[hypergraph]].
Such a graph represents the [[Dataflow|data-flow]] among the processes in the system.
Reo has [[Semantics (computer science)|formal semantics]], which stand at the basis of its various formal verification techniques and compilation tools.

== Definitions ==

In Reo, a concurrent system consists of a set of components which are glued together by a circuit that enables flow of data between components.
Components can perform I/O operations on the ''boundary nodes'' of the circuit to which they are connected.
There are two kinds of I/O operations: put-requests dispatch data items to a node, and get-requests fetch data items from a node.
All I/O operations are blocking, which means that a component can proceed only after its pending I/O operation has been successfully processed.

The figure on the top-right shows an example of a producers-consumer system with three components: two producers on the left and one consumer on the right.
The circuit in the middle defines the protocol, which states that the producers should send data synchronously, while the consumer receives those data in alternating order.

Formally, the structure of a circuit is defined as follows:

'''Definition 1.''' A ''circuit'' is a triple &lt;math&gt;R = (N, B, C, t)&lt;/math&gt; where:
# {{mvar|N}} is a set of ''nodes'';
# &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq N&lt;/math&gt; is a set of ''boundary nodes'';
# &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq 2^N \times 2^N&lt;/math&gt; is a set of ''channels'';
# &lt;math&gt;t : C \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; assigns a ''types'' to every channel.
such that &lt;math&gt;|I \cup O| = 2&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;(I,O) \in C&lt;/math&gt;.
If  &lt;math&gt;c = (I,O) \in C&lt;/math&gt; is a channel, then {{mvar|I}} is called the set of input nodes of {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|O}} is called the set of output nodes of  {{mvar|c}}.

The dynamics of a circuit resemble the flow of signals through an [[electronic circuit]].

Nodes have fixed merger-replicator behavior: the data of one of the incoming channels is propagated to all outgoing channels, without storing or altering the data (i.e., replicator behavior). If multiple incoming channels can provide data, the node makes a nondeterministic choice among them (i.e., merger behavior).
Nodes with only incoming or outgoing channels are called ''sink nodes'' or ''source nodes'', respectively; nodes with both incoming and outgoing channels are called ''mixed nodes''.

In contrast to nodes, channels have user-defined behavior represented by their type.
This means that channels may store or alter data items that flow through them.
Although every channel connects exactly two nodes, these nodes need not to be input and output.
For instance, the vertical channel in the figure on the top-right has two inputs and no outputs.
The channel type defines the behavior of the channel with respect to data.
Below is a list of common types:
* {{math|'''Sync'''}}: Atomically gets data from its input node and propagates it to its output node.
* {{math|'''LossySync'''}}: Same as Sync, but can lose data if its output node is not ready to take data.
* {{math|'''Fifo'''{{angbr|''n''}}}}: Gets data from its input node, temporarily stores it in an internal buffer of size {{mvar|n}}, and propagates it to its output node (whenever this output node is ready to take data).
* {{math|'''SyncDrain'''}}: Atomically gets data from both its input nodes and loses it.
* {{math|'''Filter'''{{angbr|''c''}}}}: Atomically gets data from its input node and propagates it to its output node if the filter condition {{mvar|c}} is satisfied; loses the data otherwise.

=== Exogeneity ===

One way to classify coordination languages is in terms of their ''locus'': locus of coordination refers to where coordination activity takes place, classifying coordination models and languages as ''endogenous'' or ''exogenous''.&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Arbab: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-34874-3_12 Composition of Interacting Computations]. In Dina Goldin, Scott Smolka, and Peter Wegner, editors, Interactive Computation, pages 277-321. Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Endogenous models and languages, such as [[Linda (coordination language)|Linda]], provide primitives that must be incorporated within a computation for its coordination.
In applications that use such models, primitives that affect the coordination of each module are inside the module itself.
In contrast, Reo is an exogenous language that provides primitives that support coordination of entities from without.
In applications that use exogenous models, primitives that affect the coordination of each module are outside the module itself.

Endogenous models are sometimes more natural for a given application.
However, they generally lead to an intermixing of coordination primitives with computation code, which entangles the semantics of computation with coordination protocols. 
This intermixing tends to scatter communication/coordination primitives throughout the source code, making the cooperation model and the coordination protocol of an application nebulous and implicit: generally, there is no piece of source code identifiable as the cooperation model or the coordination protocol of an application, that can be
designed, developed, debugged, maintained, and reused, in isolation from the rest of the application code.
On the other hand, exogenous models encourage development of coordination modules separately and independently of the computation modules they are supposed to coordinate. Consequently, the result of the substantial effort invested in the design and development of the coordination component of an application can manifest itself as tangible "pure
coordinator modules" which are easier to understand, and can also be reused in other applications.

=== Compositionality / Reusability ===

Reo circuits are compositional.
This means that one can construct complex circuits by reusing simpler circuits.
To be more explicit, two circuits can be glued together on their boundary nodes to form a new joint circuit.
Unlike many other models of concurrency (e.g., [[pi-calculus]]), synchrony is preserved under composition.
This means that if we compose a circuit with synchronous flow between nodes A and B with another circuit with synchronous flow between nodes B and C, the joint circuit has synchronous flow between nodes A and C.
In other words, the composition of two synchronous circuits yields a synchronous circuit.

== Semantics ==

The semantics of a Reo circuit is a formal description of its behavior.
Various semantics for Reo exist.&lt;ref&gt;Sung-Shik Jongmans and Farhad Arbab: [https://dx.doi.org/10.7561/SACS.2012.1.201 Overview of Thirty Semantic Formalisms for Reo]. Scientific Annals of Computer Science 22(1):201-251, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the first semantics of Reo was based on the [[coalgebra]]ic notion of streams (i.e., infinite sequences).&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Arbab and Jan Rutten: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-40020-2_2 A Coinductive Calculus of Component Connectors]. In Martin Wirsing, Dirk Pattinson, and Rolf Hennicker, editors, Proceedings of WADT 2002, volume 2755 of LNCS, pages 34--55. Springer, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
This semantics is based on the concept of a ''timed data stream'', which is a pair consisting of a stream of data items and a stream of monotonically increasing time stamps (real numbers).
By associating every node with such a timed data stream, the behavior of a channel can be modeled as a relation on the streams on the connected nodes.

Later, an [[Automata theory|automaton]]-based semantics was developed, which is called [[constraint automata]].&lt;ref&gt;Christel Baier, Marjan Sirjani, Farhad Arbab, and Jan Rutten: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2005.10.008 Modeling component connectors in Reo by constraint automata]. Science of Computer Programming 61(2):75-113, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A constraint automaton is a labeled transition system, where transition labels consist of a ''synchronization constraint'' and a ''data constraint''.
A synchronization constraint specifies which nodes synchronize in the execution step modeled by the transition, and a data constraint specifies which data items flow on these nodes.

One limitation of constraint automata (and timed data streams) is that they cannot directly model ''context-sensitive'' behavior, where the behavior of a channel depends on the (un)availability of a pending I/O operation.
For example, using constraint automata, it is impossible to directly model the behavior of a LossySync, which should lose data only if its output node has no pending get-request.
To solve this problem, another semantics of Reo has been developed, called ''connector coloring''.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Clarke and David Costa and Farhad Arbab: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2007.01.009 Connector colouring I: Synchronisation and context dependency]. Science of Computer Programming 66(3):205-225, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other semantics for Reo make it possible to model timed&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Arbab, Christel Baier, Frank de Boer, and Jan Rutten: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10270-006-0009-9 Models and temporal logical specifications for timed component connectors]. Software and Systems Modeling 6(1):59-82, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or probabilistic&lt;ref&gt;Christel Baier: [https://dx.doi.org/10.3217/jucs-011-10-1718 Probabilistic Models for Reo Connector Circuits]. Journal of Universal Computer Science 11(10):1718-1748, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; behavior.

== Implementations ==

The [http://reo.project.cwi.nl Extensible Coordination Tools] (ECT) are a set of plug-ins for [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] that constitute an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for Reo.
The ECT consists of a graphical editor for drawing circuits and an animation engine for animating data-flow through circuits.
For code generation, the ECT contains a Reo-to-Java compiler, which generates code for circuits based on their constraint automaton semantics.
In particular, on input of a Reo circuit, it produces a Java class, which simulates the constraint automaton that models the circuit.
For verification, the ECT contains a tool that translates Reo circuits to process definitions in [[mCRL2]].
Users can subsequently use mCRL2 for model checking against [[Modal μ-calculus|mu-calculus]] property specifications.
(Alternatively, the Vereofy model checker also supports verification of Reo circuits.)

Another implementation of Reo is developed in the Scala programming language and executes circuits in a distributed fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Jose Proenca: [http://hdl.handle.net/1887/17624 Synchronous Coordination of Distributed Components]. PhD thesis, Leiden University, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[mereology]], a '''simple''' is any thing that has no proper parts. Sometimes the term "atom" is used, although in recent years{{when?|date=January 2010}} the term "simple" has become the standard. 

Simples are to be contrasted with [[Gunk (mereology)|atomless gunk]] (where something is "gunky" if it is such that every proper part has a further proper part). Necessarily, given the definitions, everything is either composed of simples, gunk or a mixture of the two. Classical mereology is consistent with both the existence of gunk and either finite or infinite simples (see Hodges and Lewis 1968).

Given a mereology containing the [[null individual]], no object other than the null individual would be simple.

==The Simple Question==
Mirroring the [[special composition question]] is the Simple Question.&lt;ref&gt;Markosian 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It asks what the jointly necessary and sufficient conditions are for ''x'' to be a mereological simple. In the literature this question explicitly concerns what it is for a material object to lack proper parts, although there is no reason why similar questions cannot be asked of things from other [[ontological]] categories.

There have been many suggested answers to the Simple Question. Answers include that ''x'' is a simple if and only it is a point-sized object; that ''x'' is a simple if and only if it is indivisible; or that ''x'' is a simple if and only if it is maximally continuous. Kris McDaniel has argued that what it is for an object to be a simple is a matter of brute fact, and that there is no non-trivial answer to the Simple Question (2007b).

==Extended simples==
Of those philosophers who believe the material world contains simples, there has recently been debate over whether there can be extended simples (see Braddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006, Hudson 2006, Markosian 1998, 2004, McDaniel 2007a, 2007b, McKinnon 2003, Parsons 2000, Sider 2006, Simons 2004 ''inter alia''). An extended simple is (i) a material object; (ii) simple, and (iii) it occupies an extended region of space.

Various reasons have been offered in favor of the claim that extended simples are possible, including: (a) that they are conceivable (Markosian 1998), (b) that purportedly plausible modal principles claiming, roughly, that there are no necessary connections between distinct existences [[logical consequence|entail]] their possibility (McDaniel 2007a, Saucedo 2009, Sider 2006), and (c) that contemporary physical theories entail that there are extended simples (Braddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006). One might also argue in favor of the possibility of extended simples by noting that their existence is consistent with the answer to the Simple Question one endorses. In the literature, however, the reasoning is often reversed: Those who think that extended simples are possible often use their purported possibility to argue against answers to the Simple Question that entail their impossibility and those who think that they are impossible uses their purported impossibility to argue against answers to the Simple Question that entail (or strongly suggest) their possibility.

There have been arguments against extended simples. Arguments include variants on Lewis' argument from temporary intrinsics, as well as arguments that intuitively an extended object must have, for instance, a right half and a left half, and thus have parts (cf Zimmerman 1996: 10) Similarly, one who endorses the [[Doctrine of Arbitrarily Undetatched Parts]], which states that necessarily, if an object occupies region ''R'' then every occupiable proper sub-region of ''R'' is exactly occupied by a proper part of that object (see van Inwagen 1981), might use that principle in an argument against the possibility of extended simples.

If there are no extended simples, the only remaining options would material objects being made of unextended simples (objects that have a space-time extension of 0) or atomless gunk.

Some philosophers seem to have held that the whole universe is one enormous extended simple. According to some interpretations of Descartes and Spinoza, for instance, they held this view. More recently, this view has been defended in Schaffer 2007.

==Non-material simples==
The use of 'simple' is not restricted to material objects. Anything, no matter what ontological category it is from, is a simple if and only if it has no proper parts. Thus Lewis has argued that singletons are simples (Lewis 1991) and spacetime points are often thought to be simples (although in some non-standard spacetimes, points have proper parts). Similarly, there is a question of whether things from other categories--for instance, fictional characters and properties, if there are such things--are simples. Furthermore, just as every material object may be made of atomless gunk rather than simples, so too for objects from other ontological categories. For instance, some have held that spacetime is gunky, claiming that every region of spacetime has a proper sub-region.

'''Soro Mik'aya Patjxa''' is a high-altitude archaeological site located in the Ilave Basin in Peru, about {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the current shoreline of [[Lake Titicaca]]. Soro Mik'aya Patjxa was a seasonal residential site that was reused consistently by hunter-gatherers over a period of over a thousand years.

==Description==
Situated on a [[fluvial terrace]], the site was first identified by [[Mark Aldenderfer]] in 1995.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1299}} The excavated portion of Soro Mik'aya Patjxa consists of one [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|cultural layer]] of interest. 13 pits were excavated at the site.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1300}} The site was occupied at least 1,500 years before the advent of low-level agriculture in the region at around 5,000 [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Watson|Haas|2017|p=4}} 

==Artefacts==
Over 80,000 [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] were recovered at the site. The artefact assemblage at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa consists primarily of flaked lithics, and also includes bones, [[ground stone]]s, charred plant remains, pigment stones ([[red ocher]]) and ceramic [[sherd]]s.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1302}}{{sfn|Haas|Stefanescu|Garcia-Putnam|Aldenderfer|2017|p=Supplementary}} As the ceramic sherds were found to stylistically post-date 1,000 AD, the sherds are considered to be intrusive.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1302}}

==Human remains==
The remains of 16 individuals were recovered from pit burials at the site. Five of the crania from the site exhibit signs of [[artificial cranial deformation|intentional cranial modification]].{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1304}} [[Isotope analysis|Isotopic analysis]], estimates of travel distance to nearby lower elevation areas, demographic profiling, and the evidence for the high use of local lithic materials suggest that the individuals at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa were permanent inhabitants of a high-altitude environment.{{sfn|Haas|Stefanescu|Garcia-Putnam|Aldenderfer|2017|}}

==Diet==
The people at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa likely relied heavily on hunting large, terrestrial mammals and intensive processing and consumption of plants.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1310}} [[Projectile point]]s dominate the flaked lithic assemblage at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1309-1310}} Additionally, the faunal assemblage is dominated by large mammals, most likely coming from ''[[Hippocamelus antisensis]]'' and the [[vicuña]]. The remains of [[guinea pig]], ''[[Lagidium viscacia]]'' and [[Orestias (fish)|carache fish]] were also identified from the small faunal remains at the site. The majority of the faunal bones recovered from the site shows evidence of burning.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1310}} 

The presence of large quantities of ground stones at the site and dental wear analysis indicate that the consumption of plants was an important part of the diet at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa. Only one of the 251 teeth recovered from the site shows evidence for [[dental caries]], a low rate which is typical of hunter-gatherers. Dental wear analysis suggests a diet typical of terrestrial hunter-gatherers.{{sfn|Watson|Haas|2017|p=9-10}} Dental wear analysis also reveals evidence for lingual surface attrition of the maxillary anterior teeth (LSAMAT), a condition which has been linked with the intensive consumption of [[tubers]] by hunter-gatherers.{{sfn|Watson|Haas|2017}}

==Archaeogenetics==
In 2018, researchers successfully sequenced the genome from ''SMP5'', a 50-55 male directly dated to around 6800 BP. ''SMP5'' shares a genetic component with later ancient DNA samples from the Lake Titicaca region, a component that is also found in modern Andean populations. When compared against modern populations, ''SMP5'' shows closest genetic affinity for the [[Quechua people]] and the [[Aymara people]]. Unlike later ancient individuals sequenced from the Lake Titicaca region, ''SMP5'', along with ''USR1'' from the [[Upward Sun River site]], ''[[Anzick-1]]'', [[Kennewick man]], and the individual tested from the [[Saqqaq culture]], shows a genetic affinity for modern [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberian populations]], especially the [[Yakuts]].{{sfn|Lindo|Haas|Hofman|Apata|2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1539">A '''standard ruler''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] object for which the actual physical size is known. By measuring its angular size in the sky, one can use simple [[trigonometry]] to determine its distance from [[Earth]]. In simple terms, this is because objects of a fixed size appear smaller the further away they are.

Measuring distances is of great importance in [[cosmology]], as the relationship between the distance and [[redshift]] of an object can be used to [[Hubble's law|measure the expansion rate]] and geometry of the Universe. Distances can also be measured using [[Standard candle|standard candles]]; many different types of standard candles and rulers are needed to construct the [[cosmic distance ladder]].

== Relationship between angular size and distance ==

The relation between the angular diameter, θ, actual (physical) diameter, r, and distance, D, of an object from the observer is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta \approx \frac{r}{D} &lt;/math&gt;
 
where θ is measured in [[radians]].

Because space is [[Expansion of space|expanding]], there is no one, unique way of measuring the distance between source and observer. The distance measured by a standard ruler is what is known as the [[angular diameter distance]]. Standard candles measure another type of distance called the [[luminosity distance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29689">'''Task allocation and partitioning''' refers to the way that tasks are chosen, assigned, subdivided, and coordinated (here, within a single colony of social insects). Closely associated are issues of [[communication]] that enable these actions to occur.
This entry focuses exclusively on [[social insects]]. For information on human task allocation and partitioning, see [[division of labour]], [[task analysis]], and [[workflow]].

==Definitions==
*'''Task allocation''' "... is the process that results in specific workers being engaged in specific tasks, in numbers appropriate to the current situation. [It] operates without any central or hierarchical control..."&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deborah M. Gordon |year=1996 |title=The organization of work in social insect colonies |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=380 |pages=121–124 |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~dmgordon/Gordon1996_Nature.pdf |format=PDF |pmid= |doi=10.1038/380121a0 |issue=6570 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729191717/http://www.stanford.edu/~dmgordon/Gordon1996_Nature.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of task allocation is individual-centric. It focuses on decisions by individuals about what task to perform. However, different biomathematical models give different weights to inter-individual interactions vs. environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;
*'''Task partitioning''' refers to the division of one task into sequential actions done by more than one individual.&lt;ref name="Ratnieks"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Francis L. W.

For example, "hygienic behavior" is a task in which worker bees uncap and remove diseased brood cells that may be affected by American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae) or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arathi | first1 = H.

Therefore, the task is partitioned, and performed by multiple individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arathi | first1 = H.

==Introduction==
Social living provides a multitude of advantages to its practitioners, including predation risk reduction, environmental buffering, food procurement, and possible mating advantages. The most advanced form of sociality is [[eusociality]], characterized by overlapping generations, cooperative care of the young, and reproductive division of labor, which includes sterility or near-sterility of the overwhelming majority of colony members. With few exceptions, all the practitioners of eusociality are insects of the orders Hymenoptera ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s), Isoptera ([[termite]]s), Thysanoptera ([[thrips]]), and Hemiptera ([[aphid]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John R. Krebs  |author2=Nicholas B.

Social insects have been extraordinarily successful ecologically and evolutionarily. This success has at its most pronounced produced colonies 1) having a persistence many times the lifespan of most individuals of the colony, and 2) numbering thousands or even millions of individuals.
Social insects can exhibit division of labor with respect to non-reproductive tasks, in addition to the aforementioned reproductive one. In some cases this takes the form of markedly different, alternative morphological development ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]), as in the case of soldier castes in ants, termites, thrips, and aphids, while in other cases it is age-based (temporal polyethism), as with [[honey bee]] foragers, who are the oldest members of the colony (with the exception of the queen).  Evolutionary biologists are still debating the fitness-advantage gained by social insects due to their advanced division of labor and task allocation, but hypotheses include: increased resilience against a fluctuating environment, reduced energy costs of continuously switching tasks, increased longevity of the colony as a whole, or reduced rate of pathogen transmission.&lt;ref name="Duarte, A. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duarte | first1 = A. | last2 = Pen | first2 = I. | last3 = Keller | first3 = L. | last4 = Weissing | first4 = F.

Division of labor, large colony sizes, temporally-changing colony needs, and the value of adaptability and efficiency under Darwinian competition, all form a theoretical basis favoring the existence of evolved communication in social insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carl Anderson  |author2=Daniel W.

==Worker Polymorphism==
One of the most well known mechanisms of task allocation is worker polymorphism, where workers within a colony have morphological differences. This difference in size is determined by the amount of food workers are fed as larvae, and is set once workers emerge from their pupae. Workers may vary just in size (monomorphism) or size and bodily proportions (allometry).  An excellent example of the monomorphism is in bumblebees (''Bombus'' spp.). Bumblebee workers display a large amount of body size variation which is normally distributed. The largest workers may be ten times the mass of the smallest workers. Worker size is correlated with several tasks: larger workers tend to forage, while smaller workers tend to perform brood care and nest thermoregulation. Size also affects task efficiency. Larger workers are better at learning, have better vision, carry more weight, and fly at a greater range of temperatures. However, smaller workers are more resistant to starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Couvillon|first=MJ|author2=Jandt JM |author3=Duong NHI |author4=A Dornhaus |title=Ontogeny of worker body size distribution in bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies|journal=Ecological Entomology|year=2010|volume=35|pages=424–435|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2010.01198.x |pmc=4444232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other eusocial insects as well, worker size can determine what polymorphic role they become.  For instance, larger workers in ''[[Myrmecocystus mexicanus]]'' (a North America species of honeypot ant) tend to become repletes, or workers so engorged with food that they become immobile and act a living food storage for the rest of the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rissing | first1 = Steven W | year = 1984 | title = Replete Caste Production and Allometry of Workers in the Honey Ant, ''Myrmecocystus mexicanus'' Wesmael (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) | url = | journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 347–350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ants and termites, on the other hand, workers vary in both size and bodily proportions, which have a bimodal distribution. This is present in approximately one in six ant genera. In most of these there are two developmentally distinct pathways, or castes, into which workers can develop. Typically members of the smaller caste are called minors and members of the larger caste are called majors or soldiers. There is often variation in size within each caste. The term soldiers may be apt, as in ''Cephalotes'', but in many species members of the larger caste act primarily as foragers or food processors. In a few ant species, such as certain ''Pheidole'' species, there is a third caste, called supersoldiers.

==Temporal polyethism==
Temporal polyethism is a mechanism of task allocation, and is ubiquitous among eusocial insect colonies. Tasks in a colony are allocated among workers based on their age. Newly emerged workers perform tasks within the nest, such as brood care and nest maintenance, and progress to tasks outside the nest, such as foraging, nest defense, and corpse removal as they age. In honeybees, the youngest workers exclusively clean cells, which is then followed by tasks related to brood care and nest maintenance from about 2–11 days of age. From 11– 20 days, they transition to receiving and storing food from foragers, and at about 20 days workers begin to forage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas D. Seeley |year=1982 |title=Adaptive significance of the age polyethism schedule in honeybee colonies |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=287–293 |jstor=4599548 |doi=10.1007/BF00299306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar temporal polyethism patterns can be seen in primitive species of wasps, such as ''Ropalidia marginata'' as well as the eusocial wasp [[Vespula germanica]]. Young workers feed larvae, and then transition to nest building tasks, followed by foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dhruba Naug  |author2=Raghavendra Gadagkar  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998 |title=The role of age in temporal polyethism in a primitively eusocial wasp |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=37–47 |jstor=4601416 |doi=10.1007/s002650050409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species of ants also display this pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=[[Bert Hölldobler]] &amp; [[E. O. Wilson]] |year=1990 |title=[[The Ants]] |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=0-674-04075-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern is not rigid, though. Workers of certain ages have strong tendencies to perform certain tasks, but may perform other tasks if there is enough need. For instance, removing young workers from the nest will cause foragers, especially younger foragers, to revert to tasks such as caring for brood.&lt;ref name="Muscedere 2009 911–918"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muscedere|first=ML|author2=Willey TA |author3=Traniello JFA |title=Age and task efficiency in the ant Pheidole dentata: young minor workers are not specialist nurses|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=2009|volume=77|pages=911–918|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.12.018|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes in task preference are caused by epigenetic changes over the life of the individual. Honeybee workers of different ages show substantial differences in DNA methylation, which causes differences in gene expression. Reverting foragers to nurses by removing younger workers causes changes in DNA methylation similar to younger workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herb|first=BR|author2=Wolschin F |author3=Hansen K |author4=Aryee MJ |author5=Langmead B |author6=Irizarry R |author7=Amdam GV |author8=AP Feinbert |title=Reversible switching between epigenetic states in honeybee behavioral subcastes|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2012|volume=15|pages=1371–1375|doi=10.1038/nn.3218|issue=10 |pmid=22983211 |pmc=3518384}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Temporal polyethism is not adaptive because of maximized efficiency; indeed older workers are actually more efficient at brood care than younger workers in some ant species.&lt;ref name="Muscedere 2009 911–918"/&gt; Rather it allows workers with the lowest remaining life expectancy to perform the most dangerous tasks. Older workers tend to perform riskier tasks, such as foraging, which has high risks of predation and parasitism, while younger workers perform less dangerous tasks, such as brood care. If workers experience injuries, which shortens their life expectancies, they will start foraging sooner than healthy workers of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuszewska|first=K|author2=Woyciechowski M |title=Reversion in honeybee, Apis mellifera, workers with different life expectancies|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=2012|volume=85|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response-Threshold Model==
A dominant theory of explaining the self-organized division of labor in social insect societies such as honey bee colonies is the Response-Threshold Model.  It predicts that individual worker bees have inherent thresholds to stimuli associated with different tasks.  Individuals with the lowest thresholds will preferentially perform that task.&lt;ref name="Duarte, A. 2012"/&gt;  Stimuli could include the “search time” that elapses while a foraging bee waits to unload her nectar and pollen to a receiver bee at the hive, the smell of diseased brood cells, or any other combination of environmental inputs that an individual worker bee encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thenius | first1 = R. | last2 = Schmickl | first2 = T. | last3 = Crailsheim | first3 = K. | year = 2008 | title = Optimisation of a honeybee-colony's energetics via social learning based on queuing delays | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 193–210 | doi=10.1080/09540090802091982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Response-Threshold Model only provides for effective task allocation in the honey bee colony if thresholds are varied among individual workers.  This variation originates from the considerable genetic diversity among worker daughters of a colony due to the queen’s multiple matings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tarapore | first1 = D. | last2 = Floreano | first2 = D. | last3 = Keller | first3 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Task-dependent influence of genetic architecture and mating frequency on division of labour in social insect societies | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 675–684 | doi=10.1007/s00265-009-0885-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network representation of information flow and task allocation==
To explain how colony-level complexity arises from the interactions of several autonomous individuals, a [[Biological network|network]]-based approach has emerged as a promising area of social insect research. Social insect colonies can be viewed as a self-organized network, in which interacting elements (i.e. [[Node (networking)|nodes]]) communicate with each other. As decentralized networks, colonies are capable of distributing information rapidly which facilitates robust responsiveness to their dynamic environments.&lt;ref name="sciencemag"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer H. Fewell |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/301/5641/1867.short |title=Social Insect Networks |publisher=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |date=2003-09-26 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The efficiency of information flow is critical for colony-level flexibility because worker behavior is not controlled by a centralized leader but rather is based on local information.

Social insect networks are often non-randomly distributed, wherein a few individuals act as ‘hubs,’ having disproportionately more connections to other nestmates than other workers in the colony.&lt;ref name="sciencemag" /&gt; In harvester ants, the total interactions per ant during recruitment for outside work is right-skewed, meaning that some ants are more highly connected than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://171.66.127.193/content/8/64/1562.full.pdf+html |title=The effect of individual variation on the structure and function of interaction networks in harvester ants |publisher=171.66.127.193 |date=2011-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer simulations of this particular interaction network demonstrated that inter-individual variation in connectivity patterns expedites information flow among nestmates.

Task allocation within a social insect colony can be modeled using a network-based approach, in which workers are represented by nodes, which are connected by edges that signify inter-node interactions.  Workers performing a common task form highly connected clusters, with weaker links across tasks. These weaker, cross-task connections are important for allowing task-switching to occur between clusters.&lt;ref name="sciencemag" /&gt; This approach is potentially problematic because connections between workers are not permanent, and some information is broadcast globally, e.g. through pheromones, and therefore does not rely on interaction networks. One alternative approach to avoid this pitfall is to treat tasks as nodes and workers as fluid connections.

To demonstrate how time and space constraints of individual-level interactions affect colony function, social insect network approaches can also incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics. These effects can impose upper bounds to information flow rate in the network. For example, the rate of information flow through '' [http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Temnothorax_rugatulus Temnothorax rugatulus] '' ant colonies is slower than would be predicted if time spent traveling and location within the nest were not considered.&lt;ref name="plosone"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0020298 |title=Time-Ordered Networks Reveal Limitations to Information Flow in Ant Colonies |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2013-11-26 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020298 |volume=6 |pages=e20298 |pmid=21625450 |pmc=3098866 | last1 = Blonder | first1 = B | last2 = Dornhaus | first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In  ''Formica fusca'' L. ant colonies, a network analysis of spatial effects on feeding and the regulation of food storage revealed that food is distributed heterogeneously within colony, wherein heavily loaded workers are located centrally within the nest and those storing less food were located at the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/26/7/2725.full.pdf+html |title=Collective regulatory stock management and spatiotemporal dynamics of the food flow in ants |publisher=[[The FASEB Journal]] |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of inter-nest pheromone trail networks maintained by super-colonies of Argentine ants (''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Linepithema_humile Linepithema humile]'') have shown that different colonies establish networks with very similar topologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/62/1298.full.pdf+html |title=Structure and formation of ant transportation networks |publisher=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] |date=2011-09-07 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Insights from these analyses revealed that these networks – which are used to guide workers transporting brood, workers and food between nests – are formed through a pruning process, in which individual ants initially create a complex network of trails, which are then refined to eliminate extraneous edges, resulting in a shorter, more efficient inter-nest network.

Long-term stability of interaction networks has been demonstrated in ''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Odontomachus_hastatus Odontomachus hastatus]'' ants, in which initially highly connected ants remain highly connected over an extended time period.&lt;ref name="Jeanson"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeanson, R |year=2012 |title=Long-term dynamics in proximity networks in ants |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=83 |pages=915–923 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Temnothorax_rugatulus Temnothorax rugatulus]'' ant workers are not persistent in their interactive role, which might suggest that social organization is regulated differently among different eusocial species.&lt;ref name="plosone" /&gt;

A network is pictorially represented as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], but can equivalently be represented as an [[adjacency list]] or [[adjacency matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Goodrich &amp; [[Roberto Tamassia]] |year=2002 |title=Algorithm Design |publisher=Wiley |page=296 |isbn=978-0-471-38365-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, workers are the nodes of the graph, but Fewell prefers to make the tasks the nodes, with workers as the links.&lt;ref name="Fewell J 1870"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jennifer H.

# It increases both the physical and temporal reach of information. With connectivity, information can travel farther and faster, and additionally can persist longer, including both direct persistence (i.e. through pheromones), memory effects, and by initiating a sequence of events.
# It can help overcome task inertia and burnout, and push workers into performing hazardous tasks. For reasons of indirect fitness, this latter stimulus should not be necessary if all workers in the colony are highly related genetically, but that is not always the case.
# Key individuals may possess superior knowledge, or have catalytic roles. Examples, respectively, are a sentry who has detected an intruder, or the colony queen.
O'Donnell provides a comprehensive survey, with examples, of factors that have a large bearing on worker connectivity.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt; They include:
* [[Degree (graph theory)|graph degree]]
* size of the interacting group, especially if the network has a modular structure
* sender distribution (i.e. a small number of controllers vs. numerous senders)
* strength of the interaction effect, which includes strength of the signal sent, recipient sensitivity, and signal persistence (i.e. pheromone signal vs. sound waves)
* recipient memory, and its decay function
* socially-transmitted inhibitory signals, as not all interactions provide positive stimulus
* specificity of both the signal and recipient response
* signal and sensory modalities, and activity and interaction rates

==Task taxonomy and complexity==
Anderson, Franks, and McShea have broken down insect tasks (and subtasks) into a hierarchical [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; their focus is on task partitioning and its complexity implications. They classify tasks as individual, group, team, or partitioned; classification of a task depends on whether there are multiple vs. individual workers, whether there is division of labor, and whether subtasks are done concurrently or sequentially. Note that in their classification, in order for an action to be considered a task, it must contribute positively to inclusive fitness; if it must be combined with other actions to achieve that goal, it is considered to be a subtask. In their simple model, they award 1, 2, or 3 points to the different tasks and subtasks, depending on its above classification. Summing all tasks and subtasks point values down through all levels of nesting allows any task to be given a score that roughly ranks relative complexity of actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carl Anderson, Nigel R. Franks &amp; Daniel W. McShea |year=2001 |title=The complexity and hierarchical structure of tasks in insect societies |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=643–651 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1795}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also the review of task partitioning by Ratnieks and Anderson.&lt;ref name="Ratnieks"/&gt;

==Note: model-building==
All models are simplified abstractions of the real-life situation. There exists a basic tradeoff between model precision and parameter precision. A fixed amount of information collected, will, if split amongst the many parameters of an overly precise model, result in at least some of the parameters being represented by inadequate sample sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stephen P. Ellner  |author2=John Guckenheimer  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Dynamic Models in Biology |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=289–290 |isbn=978-0-691-12589-3 |chapter=Building dynamic models}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the often limited quantities and limited precision of data from which to calculate parameters values in non-human behavior studies, such models should generally be kept simple. Therefore, we generally should not expect models for social insect task allocation or task partitioning to be as elaborate as human [[workflow]] ones, for example.

==Metrics for division of labor==
With increased data, more elaborate metrics for division of labor within the colony become possible. Gorelick and Bertram survey the applicability of metrics taken from a wide range of other fields. They argue that a single output statistic is desirable, to permit comparisons across different population sizes and different numbers of tasks. But they also argue that the input to the function should be a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representation (of time spent by each individual on each task), in order to provide the function with better data. They conclude that "... normalized matrix-input generalizations of [[Shannon index|Shannon's]] and [[Simpson index|Simpson's index]] ... should be the indices of choice when one wants to simultaneously examine division of labor amongst all individuals in a population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Gorelick  |author2=S. M. Bertram  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=Quantifying division of labor: borrowing tools from sociology, sociobiology, information theory, landscape ecology, and biogeography |journal=[[Insectes Sociaux]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=105–112 |doi=10.1007/s00040-007-0923-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Note that these indexes, used as metrics of [[biodiversity]], now find a place measuring division of labor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9056">The '''Obscene Device Law''' is a [[Texas]] [[statute]] prohibiting the sale of [[sex toy]]s. The law was introduced in 1973, and was last updated in 2003. While the law technically remains in effect, in 2008 a U.S. District Judge released a report declaring it to be "facially unconstitutional and unenforceable".

==History==
In 1973, the [[Texas Legislature]] passed Section 43.21 of the [[Texas Penal Code]], which, in part, prohibited the sale or promotion of "obscene devices"', being defined as "a device including a [[dildo]] or [[artificial vagina]], designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of [[Sex organ|human genital organs]]." The legislation was last updated in 2003, and Section 43.23 currently states "A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.43.htm#43.23 |title=Penal Code Chapter 43.

==Prosecuted cases==
Prosecution under the statute is rare but has occasionally occurred. In [[Burleson, Texas|Burleson]] in 2004, Joanne Webb, a mother of three and a former schoolteacher, faced up to one year in prison for selling a [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]] to two undercover police officers posing as a married couple at a private party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/11/obscenity.trial.reut/ |title=Texas mom faces trial for selling sex toys |date=February 11, 2004 |work=[[CNN]] |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130110202251/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/11/obscenity.trial.reut/ |archivedate=January 10, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later acquitted, and the undercover officers were issued reprimands. In 2007, a [[lingerie]] shop in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] was raided, and items "deemed to be illegal by the Texas Penal Code" were confiscated. The clerk on duty at the time was arrested and may have had to [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klbk13.tv/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&amp;id=2259 |title=Police Raid Lingerie Shop |date=May 21, 2007 |work=klbk13.tv |access-date=May 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070525044229/http://www.klbk13.tv/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&amp;id=2259 |archivedate=May 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, attorneys Mary and Ted Roberts used the obscenity statute in an elaborate extortion scheme against a number of men who had engaged in extramarital relations with Mary Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tdcaa.com/node/2483 |title=There's something about Mary1 … |date= |work=Texas District &amp; County Attorneys Association |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918140525/http://www.tdcaa.com/node/2483 |archivedate=September 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals==

Reliable Consultants, Inc., who operate four retail stores in Texas that carry a stock of sexual devices, and PHE, Inc., which is also engaged in the retail distribution of sexual devices through their website and catalogs, both filed [[lawsuit]]s against the legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} claiming that the statute is [[unconstitutional]]. In an appeal from the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]], a three-judge panel of the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]] overturned the statute on February 12, 2008, by a vote of 2–1, holding that "the statute has provisions that violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1263575.html |title=PHE v.

The 13th District Court of Appeals ruled that until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rules that 43.23 is unconstitutional, the promotion of obscene devices remains illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dallascriminaldefenselawyerblog.com/2008/10/are-dildos-illegal-in-texas-ag.html |title=Are Dildos Illegal in Texas (again)? |last=Guest |first=Robert |date=October 6, 2008 |work=Dallas Criminal Defense Lawyer Blog |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730174954/http://www.dallascriminaldefenselawyerblog.com/2008/10/are-dildos-illegal-in-texas-ag.html |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, despite the actions of the federal courts and the Texas Attorney General described elsewhere in this article, section 43.23 remains in effect in the twenty-county area of Texas covered by the jurisdiction of the 13th District Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daxlegal.com/dildos-sexually-obscene-toys-illegal-in-texas-for-now/ |title=Dildos &amp; Sexually Obscene "Toys" Illegal in Texas … for now &amp;#124; Austin Attorney Dax Garvin |work=Dax Legal |date=January 31, 2012 |accessdate=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716030219/http://daxlegal.com/dildos-sexually-obscene-toys-illegal-in-texas-for-now/ |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That would usually mean that the United States Supreme Court would grant a writ of [[certiorari]] and rule in order to clear up the disagreement between the two circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/08/dildos_at_the_supreme_court.php |title=Dildos at the Supreme Court? |last=Brayton |first=Ed |date=August 11, 2008 |work=[[ScienceBlogs]] |access-date=August 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018121053/http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/08/dildos_at_the_supreme_court.php |archivedate=October 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2008, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel released a two-page document dated October 29, 2008, in which he stated that the Texas Attorney General's Office notified him that they would not file a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The next month, on November 13, Yeakel filed a "joint status report" that noted the parties had come to an agreement. "Texas Penal Code §§ 43.23, to the extent that it applies to "obscene devices" as defined in Texas Penal Code § 43.21(a)(7), is declared to be facially unconstitutional and unenforceable throughout the State of Texas".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/322594597/2008-11-13-Texas-Western-Court-Order-Obscenity-Law&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vico La scienza nuova.gif|right|thumb|''Principj di Scienza Nuova'' - title page of 1744 edition.]]

'''''The New Science''''' (original Italian title '''''Scienza Nuova''''' {{IPA-it|ˈʃentsa ˈnwɔːva|}}) is the major work of Italian philosopher [[Giambattista Vico]], published in 1725. It has been highly influential in the [[philosophy of history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and for historicists like [[Isaiah Berlin]] and [[Hayden White]]. The central concepts were highly original, and prefigured the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

The original full title is ''Principi di Scienza Nuova d'intorno alla Comune Natura delle Nazioni'', which may be literally translated as "Principles/Origins of New/Renewed Science About/Surrounding the Common Nature of Nations".

==Production and publication==
In 1720, Vico began work on the ''Scienza Nuova'' as part of a treatise on [[Universal rights]]. Although a full volume was originally to be sponsored by Cardinal Corsini (the future [[Pope Clement XII]]), Vico was forced to finance the publication himself after the Cardinal pleaded financial difficulty and withdrew his patronage. The first edition of the ''New Science'' (''Scienza Nuova'', rather than ''Nuova Scienza'', for which Galileo had been known) appeared in 1725, and a second, reworked version was published in 1730; neither was well received during Vico’s lifetime.

Vico himself worked on two revisited editions, that were published under new titles, the first in 1730 and the second posthumously in 1744. It was the first work by Vico to be written in Italian, while his previous ones were written in Latin.

==Approach, style and tone==
In its first section, titled "Idea of the Work" (''Idea dell'Opera''), the ''Scienza Nuova'' (1730 and 1744) explicitly presents itself as a "Science of reasoning" (''Scienza di ragionare'').  Indeed, the work (cf. most notably the section "Of the Elements") includes a dialectic between axioms (authoritative maxims or ''degnità'') and "reasonings" (''ragionamenti'') linking and clarifying the axioms.

Vico specifies that his "Scienza" reasons primarily about the function of religion in the human world ("Idea of the Work"), and in this respect the work "comes to be a civil theology reasoned from divine providence" (''vien ad essere una teologia civile ragionata della provvidenza divina'').  Reconsidering divine things (viz. "the conduct of divine providence") within a human or political context, Vico unearths the "poetic theologians" (''poeti teologi'') of pagan antiquity, exposing the poetic character of theology independently of Christianity's sacred history and thus of Biblical authority (see e.g. ''Scienza Nuova'' [1744], "Of the Elements," CXIV).  Vico's unearthing of poetic theology (anticipated already in his ''De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia'' (1710), "On the most ancient wisdom of the Italians") confirms the philosopher's ties to the Italian Renaissance and its appeals to ''[[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]]''.  With the early Renaissance, Vico shares the call for recovering a "pagan" or "vulgar" horizon for philosophy's providential agency, or for recognizing the providence of our human "metaphysical" minds/''menti'' in the world of our "political" wills/''animi'' ("Idea of the Work," par. 2). "Poetic theology" would serve as stage for an "ascent" (ibid.) to recognize the inherence or latency of rational agency in our actions, even when these are brutal (see further "Of the Method," par. 2).  This way, the particular providence of the Bible's "true God" ("Of the Elements," CXIV) would not be required for the thriving of properly human life.  All that would be needed was (A) false religions/Gods and (B) the covert work of the ''conatus'' (rational principle of constitution of experience rooted in its proper infinite form) examined at length in the ''De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia'' and evoked again in par. 2 of the "Of the Method" section of the ''Scienza Nuova'' (1730 and 1744).

==Cyclical history (''Corsi e ricorsi''?)==
Vico is often seen as espousing a cyclical philosophy of history where human history is created by man, although Vico never speaks of "history without attributes" (Paolo Cristofolini, ''Vice Pagano e Barbaro''), but of a "world of nations".  Which is more, in the 1744 ''Scienza Nuova'' (esp. the "Conclusion of the Work") Vico stresses that "the world of nations" is made by men merely with respect to their sense of certainty (''certamente''), though not fundamentally, insofar as the world is guided by the human mind "metaphysically" independent of its makings (compare opening paragraph of the ''Scienza Nuova'').  Furthermore, although Vico is often attributed the expression "''corsi e ricorsi''" (cycles and counter cycles) of "history", he never speaks in the plural of "the cycle" or of "the counter-cycle" (''ricorso'') of "human things", suggesting that political life and order, or human creations, are oriented "backward," as it were, or called back to their constitutive "metaphysical" principle.  

On present day "constructivist" readings, Vico is supposed to have promoted a vision of man and society as moving in parallel from barbarism to civilization.&lt;blockquote&gt;As societies become more developed socially, human nature also develops, and both manifest their development in changes in language, myth, folklore, economy, etc.; in short, social change produces cultural change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 0710077467|location = London|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Vico would therefore be using an original organic idea that culture is a system of socially produced and structured elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, knowledge of any society would come from the social structure of that society, explicable, therefore, only in terms of its own language. As such, one may find a dialectical relationship between language, knowledge and social structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Relying on a complex etymology, Vico argues in the ''Scienza Nuova'' that civilization develops in a recurring cycle (''ricorso'') of three ages: the divine, the heroic, and the human. Each age exhibits distinct political and social features and can be characterized by master [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] or [[figure of speech|figures of language]]. The ''[[Gigantes|giganti]]'' of the divine age rely on [[metaphor]] to compare, and thus comprehend, human and natural phenomena. In the heroic age, [[metonymy]] and [[synecdoche]] support the development of [[feudal]] or [[monarchic]] institutions embodied by idealized figures. The final age is characterized by popular [[democracy]] and reflection via [[irony]]; in this epoch, the rise of [[rationality]] leads to ''barbarie della reflessione'' or barbarism of reflection, and civilization descends once more into the poetic era. Taken together, the recurring cycle of three ages{{spaced ndash}}common to every nation{{spaced ndash}}constitutes for Vico a ''storia ideale eterna'' or ideal eternal history. Therefore, it can be said that all history is the history of the rise and fall of civilizations, for which Vico provides evidence (up until, and including the Graeco-Roman historians).

==Ideas on rhetoric applied to history==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Vico’s humanism (his returning to a pre-modern form of reasoning), his interest in classical rhetoric and [[philology]], and his response to Descartes contribute to the philosophical foundations for the second ''Scienza Nuova''. Through an elaborate Latin etymology, Vico establishes not only the distinguishing features of first humans, but also how early civilization developed out of a ''sensus communis'' or common (not collective) sense. Beginning with the first form of authority intuited by the ''giganti'' or early humans and transposed in their first "mute" or "sign" language, Vico concludes that “first, or vulgar, wisdom was poetic in nature.” This observation is not an [[aesthetic]] one, but rather points to the capacity inherent in all men to imagine meaning via comparison and to reach a communal "conscience" or "prejudice" about their surroundings.  The metaphors that define the poetic age gradually yield to the first civic discourse, finally leading to a time characterized by "full-fledged reason" (''ragione tutta spiegata''), in which reason and right are exposed to the point that they vanish into their own superficial appearance.  At this point, speech returns to its primitive condition, and with it men.  Hence the "recurring" (''ricorso'') of life to "barbarism" (''barbarie'').  It is by way of warning his age and those stemming from it of the danger of seeking truth in clear and distinct ideas blinding us to the real depths of life, that Vico calls our attention back to a classical art of moderating the course of human things, lest the liberty enjoyed in the "Republic" be supplanted by the anarchic tyranny of the senses.

Crucial to Vico's work remains a subtle criticism of all attempts to impose universality upon particularity, as if ''ex nihilo''. Instead, Vico attempts to always let "the true" emerge from "the certain" through innumerable stories and anecdotes drawn mostly from the history of [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]] and from the [[Bible]]. Here, reason does not attempt to overcome the poetic dimension of life and speech, but to moderate its impulses so as to safeguard civil life.

While the transfer from divine to heroic to human ages is, for Vico, marked by shifts in the [[tropological]] nature of language, the inventional aspect of the poetic principle remains constant. When referring to “poets”, Vico intends to evoke the original Greek sense of “creators”. In the ''Scienza Nuova'', then, the ''verum factum'' principle first put forth in ''De Italorum Sapientia'' remains central. As such, the notion of topics as the ''loci'' or places of invention (put forth by Aristotle and developed throughout classical rhetoric) serves as the foundation for "the true", and thus, as the underlying principle of ''sensus communis'' and civic discourse. The development of laws that shape the social and political character of each age is informed as much by master tropes as by those topics deemed acceptable in each era. Thus, for the rudimentary civilization of the divine age, sensory topics are employed to develop laws applicable on an individual basis. These laws expand as metonymy and synecdoche enable notions of sovereign rule in the heroic age; accordingly, acceptable topics expand to include notions of [[Social class|class]] and division. In the final, human age, the reflection that enables popular democracy requires appeals to any and all topics to achieve a common, rational law that is universally applicable. The development of civilization in Vico’s ''storia ideale eterna'', then, is rooted in the first [[Western canon|canon]] of rhetoric, as invention via ''loci'' shapes both the creation of and discourse about civil life.

==Reception and later influence==
Vico’s major work was poorly received during his own life but has since inspired a [[En cadre|cadre]] of famous thinkers and artists, including [[Karl Marx]] and [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Reiner Grundmann]], 1991. ''Marxism and Ecology''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Later his work was received more favourably as in the case of [[Lord Monboddo]] to whom he was compared in a modern treatise.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, Catherine, ''Rhetoric on the Margin of Modernity, Vico, [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Monboddo]]'', Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, Illinois (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah Berlin]] has devoted attention to Vico as a critic of the Enlightenment and a significant humanist and culture theorist.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas'', Chatto and Windus, 1976. Redwood Burn Ltd.. {{ISBN|0-7011-2512-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder'', Pimlico, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7126-6492-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scienza Nuova'' was included by [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] in his book ''[[The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written]]''.

The historical cycle provides the structure for [[James Joyce|James Joyce's]] book, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. The intertextual relationship between ''Scienza Nuova'' and ''Finnegans Wake'' was brought to light by [[Samuel Beckett]] in his essay "Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce” published in ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' (1929), where Beckett argued that Vico's conception of language also had significant influence in Joyce's work. Vico's notion of the ''lingua mentale commune'' (mental dictionary) in relation to ''universale fantastico'' reverberates in Joyce's novel, which ends in the middle of a sentence, reasserting Vico's principle of cyclical history.&lt;ref&gt;Verene, Donald Phillip. ''Vico and Joyce''. Albany: State University of New York, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language, knowledge and society are in a dialectical relationship, which means that any study or comparison of societies must consider the specific contexts of the societies. This has clearly influenced anthropology and sociology.

'''Yale-NUS College''' is a [[liberal arts college]] in [[Singapore]]. Established in 2011 as a collaboration between [[Yale University]] and the [[National University of Singapore]], it is the first liberal arts college in Singapore and one of the few in Asia. Yale-NUS is the first institution outside [[New Haven, Connecticut]], that Yale University has developed in its 300-year history, making Yale the first American [[Ivy League]] school to establish a college bearing its name in Asia.

Yale-NUS is predominantly a four-year, fully residential undergraduate institution. The first class, the class of 2017, consisted of 157 students entering in 2013. Over several years, the college intends to increase its student body to 1,000 students and its teaching faculty to about 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS Faculty|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/faculty/|website=Yale-NUS College|publisher=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-over-190-students-to-the-class-of-2019/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students select their majors (currently there are 14&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/majors/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at the end of their second year, after going through two years of the Yale-NUS Common Curriculum, which is "built from scratch by the inaugural faculty, draws on the strengths of established liberal arts traditions, while introducing our students to the diverse intellectual traditions and cultures of Asia and the world". Students graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours or a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours from Yale-NUS College, awarded by NUS.

The College's first graduating class (Class of 2017 – excluding those who are still completing their concurrent degree programmes, amongst others), comprises 119 students. 103 graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours and 16 with a Bachelor of Science with Honours. The top five majors of choice amongst the students were Arts and Humanities; Philosophy, Politics and Economics; Environmental Studies; Psychology; and Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences. As of Sept. 29 2017, over 90% of the students had secured jobs or university places to pursue graduate studies. Students who received job offers are working in sectors such science &amp; research (12%), consulting (14%), as well as the public sector (17%). Others industries include education and engineering, finance, technology and start-ups, communications, and consumer and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hua|first1=Rachel|title=Yale-NUS Graduates Secure Job and Graduate School Opportunities|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/viii-10/news/yale-nus-graduates-secure-job-graduate-school-opportunities/|accessdate=14 November 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 60% of students at Yale-NUS are Singaporeans and 40% are international students. Yale-NUS College receives more than 8,000 applications annually and the admit rate is typically 3% to 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=Yale-NUS Welcomes Class of 2021, with 7% acceptance rate|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vii-1/news/yale-nus-welcomes-class-2021-acceptance-rate/|accessdate=14 November 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]], Yale-NUS is the only other college in Singapore to follow a holistic admissions process similar to that followed by Yale and other American universities. Like both Yale and NUS, Yale-NUS follows a [[need-blind]] admission policy and offers financial aid on a full-need basis. Yale-NUS also distributes scholarships to some admitted students based on academic merit.&lt;ref name="http://yale-nus.edu.sg"&gt;http://yale-nus.edu.sg&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Under the presidency of [[Rick Levin|Richard Levin]], Yale University began developing a "internationalization" strategy that included expanding financial resources for international students and study abroad programs, founding the [[Yale World Fellows]] and the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization|Center for the Study of Globalization]], and joining the [[International Alliance of Research Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/The%20Internationalization%20of%20Yale%20-%20The%20Emerging%20Framework%20.pdf |last1=Levin |first1=Richard C. |last2=Lorimer |first2=Linda K. |title=The Internationalization of Yale: 2005-2008 |date=December 2005 |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrators at Yale began considering international campus expansion in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Daniel |title=Levin Forges New Ties in Middle East |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/09/22/levin-forges-new-ties-in-middle-east/ |date=22 September 2006 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially approached the [[United Arab Emirates]] about establishing an arts institute on Abu Dhabi's [[Saadiyat Island]], developed in collaboration with the university's arts professional schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ouroussoff |first=Nicolai |title=A Vision in the Desert |date=1 February 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/arts/design/04ouro.html |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Day Lassila |first=Kathrin |title=Worldly Ambitions |date=May 2007 |magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine |url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2007_05/q_a.html |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyd |first=Rachel |title=Arts institute plans intensify |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=13 September 2007 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2007/09/13/arts-institute-plans-intensify/ |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Yale indicated that it was not willing to offer Yale degree programs at the proposed institute, the project was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Thomas |last2=Wessel |first2=Nora |title=Yale drops plans for Abu Dhabi |date=11 April 2008 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/04/11/yale-drops-plans-for-abu-dhabi/ |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewin |first=Tamar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/12/education/12yale.html |title=Yale Moves Away From Plans for Link With Abu Dhabi |date=12 April 2008 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NUS, University Cultural Centre 3, Nov 06.JPG|thumb|right|National University of Singapore]]

Levin and National University of Singapore President [[Tan Chorh Chuan]] discussed the concept of a joint liberal arts college at the 2009 [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland,&lt;ref name="CHE2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-in-a-Name-For-Yale-in/131794/ |last=Fischer |first=Karin |title=What's in a Name?

Among the given reasons for the initiative were "develop[ing] a novel curriculum spanning Western and Asian cultures" and better preparing students for "an interconnected, interdependent global environment".&lt;ref name="YNCP"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Levin |first1=Rick |last2=Salovey |first2=Peter |title=Prospectus for a liberal arts college in Singapore |date=12 September 2010 |url=http://communications.yale.edu/sites/default/files/YNC-Prospectus-2010-09.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212093625/http://communications.yale.edu/sites/default/files/YNC-Prospectus-2010-09.pdf |archivedate=12 December 2013 |deadurl=unfit |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caplan-Bricker |first=Nora |title=Yale, Singapore plan new liberal arts college |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=13 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale-NUS College was officially launched in April 2011. In July 2012, the College held its ground-breaking ceremony;&lt;ref name="ao1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Edvantage/Story/A1Story20120706-357731.html |title=Yale-NUS College holds groundbreaking ceremony |publisher=News.asiaone.com |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; it enrolled its first class of students in 2013.&lt;ref name="milestones"&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/milestones/|website=Yale–NUS College|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale-NUS inaugurated its campus on October 12, 2015. The event was attended by Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Acting Education Minister (Higher Education) Ong Ye Kung and the presidents of Yale and the National University of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pham|first1=Le Vi|title=PM Lee: Yale-NUS Must Be More Than Carbon Copy of Yale - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/news/pm-lee-yale-nus-must-be-more-than-carbon-copy-of-yale/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College held its inaugural graduation ceremony on May 29, 2017. The certificates were presented by Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, President of the Republic of Singapore, and Richard Levin, former President of Yale and Chief Executive of Coursera, was the guest speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=Yale-NUS's Inaugural Class Graduation|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/graduation-issue-i/news/yale-nuss-inaugural-class-graduation/|accessdate=16 June 2017|work=The Octant|agency=The Octant|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guest speaker for 2018's graduation ceremony will be Professor Kishore Mahbubani, Senior Advisor (University &amp; Global Relations) and Professor in Practice of Policy at the National University of Singapore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://graduation.yale-nus.edu.sg/graduation-speaker/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=graduation.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2012, Yale-NUS published its policy on academic freedom and non-discrimination, which states that “the College upholds the principles of academic freedom and open inquiry, essential core values in higher education of the highest calibre. Faculty and students in the College will be free to conduct scholarship and research and publish the results, and to teach in the classroom and express themselves on campus, bearing in mind the need to act in accordance with accepted scholarly and professional standards and the regulations of the College.” The College is also “committed to basing judgments concerning the admission, education, and employment of individuals upon their qualifications and abilities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/policies-and-procedures/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faculty===

As of August 2016, Yale–NUS lists over 100 faculty members from leading colleges and universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-announces-new-dean-faculty-senior-faculty-appointments/ |title=Faculty |accessdate=2016-08-02 |website=Yale–NUS College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governing board===

The governing board is composed of trustees half-appointed by Yale, and half-appointed by NUS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/the-governing-board/|title= The Governing Board - Yale-NUS College |accessdate= December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board is chaired by Mdm. Kay Kuok Oon Kwong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Joyan|title=A View From Above - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iii-5/features/a-view-from-above/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissions==
Yale-NUS has a no-loan policy and provides need-blind admission to local and international students. The admission timeline is similar to that of colleges and universities in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://admissions.yale-nus.edu.sg/afford/|title=Afford - Yale-NUS College|work=Yale-NUS College|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Yale-NUS hopes to grow its class size to 250 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-over-190-students-to-the-class-of-2019/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2016|7|reason=Hopes from 2013 should have changed by now.}} &lt;!--Neither point is fully correct at the present time.

The College employs a holistic approach in evaluating applicants: while academic achievement as reflected in examinations grades is a primary consideration, interviews, recommendations, essays and extracurricular accomplishments are also given significant weight in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College welcomes inaugural class exceeding 150 students|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-inaugural-class-exceeding-150-students/|website=Yale-NUS College|publisher=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inaugural class (Class of 2017)===
In all, Yale-NUS attracted more than 11,400 applications from over 130 countries.&lt;ref name="yale-nus.edu.sg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/ |title=Yale-NUS College |publisher=Yale-nus.edu.sg |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance rate of the inaugural class was under 4%.&lt;ref name="yale-nus.edu.sg"/&gt; making the admission process comparable in selectivity to both [[Yale University]] and the most competitive faculties of [[National University of Singapore]], and making it one of the most selective colleges in the world, as compared to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (5.9%), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (5.1%) and  [[Columbia University|Columbia]] (6.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hernandezcollegeconsulting.com/ivy-league-admission-statistics-overall-2018/ |title=College Admission Statistics &amp;#124; Top Tier Admissions |publisher=Hernandezcollegeconsulting.com |date=2015-05-01 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a press-release by the Yale-NUS College Administration, the overall yield rate was 52%&lt;ref name="yale-nus.edu.sg"/&gt; comparable to top liberal arts colleges in the US such as [[Amherst College|Amherst]] (41%), [[Williams College|Williams]] (45%), and [[Bowdoin College|Bowdoin]] (48%), as well as not far off from Ivy League schools and top universities like [[Brown University|Brown]] (58%), [[Cornell University|Cornell]] (52%), [[Columbia University|Columbia]] (61%), [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (81%), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (76%) and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (65%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2015/01/21/national-universities-where-the-most-accepted-students-enroll |title=National Universities Where the Most Accepted Students Enroll |publisher=US News |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2012, the College began accepting application for the Batch of 2017 from Singapore and the rest of the world. The admissions staff began a series of international recruitment events, spanning North America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Students were allowed to apply through the [[Common Application]], Yale-NUS portal and those who chose to apply to [[Yale College]] also had the option to share their application with Yale-NUS.

===Class profiles===
Of the 157 students admitted to the class of 2017 (starting in 2013), 87 were female while 70 were male. The median SAT Score was 1440 (on the 1600 scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/06/17/yale-nus-releases-inaugural-class-figures/|title=Yale-NUS releases inaugural class figures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 75th percentile for Critical Reading (CR) is 760/800 and the 75th percentile for Math is 780/800.

26 nationalities from six continents were represented in the first batch. 62% were Singaporean, while the rest were internationals, giving Yale-NUS one of largest international student populations in terms of percentage of total students. Thirty-two of the students were from [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], while another 11 were from [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and [[South America]]. More than 10% of the student body came from [[North America]] with 13 students from the [[United States]] and 4 from [[Canada]].

The Class of 2018 comprised 177 students from 35 countries. They came from 95 schools on six different continents. By nationality, Singaporeans comprise the majority in this intake, with a percentage similar to last year's inaugural class. For international students, the next biggest groups are 10% from the [[United States]], 3% from [[India]], and 3% from [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College welcomes more than 170 new students to the Class of 2018|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-more-than-170-new-students-to-the-class-of-2018/|website=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Class of 2019 comprised 198 students from 25 countries. Singaporeans continued to make up the largest pool of students in this year's intake, similar to the previous two cohorts. The College's international students came from 25 countries, including for the first time, students from [[El Salvador]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Tunisia]]. The nationalities in the Class of 2019 that are most frequently represented are the [[United States]], [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College Welcomes Over 190 Students To The Class of 2019|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-over-190-students-to-the-class-of-2019/|website=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Class of 2020 comprised more than 200 students from 40 countries, the highest diversity of student nationalities in a single intake. In 2016, the Yale-NUS student body comprises more than 700 students from 53 countries across 6 continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College community officially welcomes new class with First Year Assembly 2016|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/5-august-2016-yale-nus-college-community-officially-welcomes-new-class-first-year-assembly-2016/|website=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed class profile for the Class of 2020 has not been released,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Su|first1=Jasmine|title=Why hasn’t Yale-NUS Released the Admissions Statistics for the Class of 2020?|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-11/news/admissions-statistics-yale-nus/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the admissions rate of 5% was eventually revealed to the Yale Daily News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srivastava|first1=Ishaan|title=Yale-NUS posts 5 percent admit rate|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/04/20/yale-nus-posts-5-percent-admit-rate/|accessdate=7 May 2017|publisher=Yale Daily News|date=20 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Class of 2021 comprised 248 students from 45 countries, its largest intake to date. Singaporeans continued to make up the largest pool of students hailing from 28 schools across Singapore. The College sees the strongest international representation from India, United States, China and South Korea. For the first time, students from Uzbekistan and Paraguay are also represented, amongst others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Acceptance rates have varied between 3 and 7% across the first six batches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=Dave|title=Yale-NUS Welcomes Class of 2021, with 7% acceptance rate|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vii-1/news/yale-nus-welcomes-class-2021-acceptance-rate/|accessdate=19 September 2017|work=The Octant|issue=Volume 7 Issue 1|publisher=The Octant|date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The founding instruction committee decided to implement a common curriculum, a set of interlinked courses for all students. Similar to the core curricula at [[Columbia University]] and [[University of Chicago]], students will a number of set courses in their first year of study. The common curriculum is reviewed every four years. Following its inaugural review, the common curriculum was reduced to 10 courses, with the removal of a science course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=Common Curriculum reduced to 10 courses, following first review - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-13/news/common-curriculum-reduced-to-10-courses-following-first-review/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yale-NUS common curriculum is a set of interconnected courses designed to provide all students with a shared, intensive exploration of themes and topics ranging across all the academic disciplines, from science to the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/singapores-first-liberal-arts-college-outlines-innovative-common-curriculum/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, titled "In Defense of a Liberal Education," Fareed Zakaria describes the Yale-NUS Curriculum Report as the 21st century version of the Yale Report of 1828, which set the agenda for the classical curriculum of the 19th century, and the Harvard Red Book of 1945, which set a similar agenda for the 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.libertyproject.com/freedom/why-american-colleges-need-global-common-curriculu/|title=Why American colleges need a global common curriculum in the 21st century|work=The Liberty Project|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majors===

Students choose their majors at the end of their second year. Currently, there are 14 major fields of study. 31% of the courses are part of the common curriculum, 34% are required by the major, and 35% are electives and prerequisites for the major.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/student-experience/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minors===

Students can declare their minors after the end of their second year. Currently there are 13 minor fields of study. The fields correspond to Yale-NUS's existing majors, with the exception of PPE and DDP Law. However, the college recently approved two new interdisciplinary minors: Global Antiquity and Chinese Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ong|first1=Justin|title=Global Antiquity and Chinese Studies Approved as Yale-NUS’s First Interdisciplinary Minors|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vi-8/news/global-antiquity-chinese-studies-approved-yale-nus-first-interdisciplinary-minor/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|issue=Volume VI Issue 8|publisher=The Octant|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 42% of the inaugural two batches have declared minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=42% of Yale-NUS Upperclass Students Declare Minor|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/news/yale-nus-students-declare-minor/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint and associated programs==
Yale-NUS and Faculty of Law, NUS jointly offer a Double Degree program in Law and Liberal Arts for those seeking a broad liberal arts education in addition to their professional training in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/double-degree-with-law/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale-NUS offers three Concurrent Degree Programs:

·       Concurrent Degree Program with Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. A five-year program designed for students who want to pursue careers in an environmental field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/concurrent-degree-with-yfes/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·       Concurrent Degree Program with Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. A five-year program designed for students who want a broad liberal arts education followed by careers in the field of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/concurrent-degree-with-lkyspp/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·       Concurrent Degree Program with Yale School of Public Health. A five-year program designed for students who want a broad liberal arts education and a career in the field of public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/concurrent-degree-with-yale-school-of-public-health/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale-NUS plans to introduce a fourth Concurrent Degree Programme with the NUS School of Computing, in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ho|first1=Dion|title=Yale-NUS Concurrent Degree Programme with NUS School of Computing - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/news/yale-nus-concurrent-degree-programme-nus-school-computing/|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Students will receive special consideration to be admitted in the Silver Scholars Program of the Yale School of Management. The program provides the unique opportunity to enter the Yale MBA program immediately after undergraduate study to move more quickly toward career goals. Duke-NUS, Singapore's first US-style graduate-entry medical school, has also expressed interest in admitting Yale-NUS graduates for their  Doctor of Medicine (MD), PhD and MD/PhD degree programs.&lt;ref name="duke-nus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/index.php/learning/md-phd-md-phd-programs-at-duke-nus-graduate-medical-school.html |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601222220/http://yale-nus.edu.sg/index.php/learning/md-phd-md-phd-programs-at-duke-nus-graduate-medical-school.html |title=MD, PhD, MD/PhD Programs at Duke-NUS Medical School| archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiential learning ==
The Yale-NUS Centre for International and Professional Experience integrates traditionally separate and often silo-ed components of experience based learning (such as study abroad, summer sessions, internships, career services, leadership and service programming, research attachments) under one roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cipe.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=cipe.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Week 7 program takes place in the seventh week of the first semester of the first year – a time when all freshers are enrolled in the same common curriculum courses. During Week 7, all first-year students participate in a faculty-generated initiative that brings student learning out into the world and connects to both faculty interests and themes of the common curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/world-insight-designing-experiential-learning-yale-nus-college|title=World insight: designing experiential learning at Yale-NUS College|date=2016-07-24|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Yale-NUS, a term-time study abroad experience is the norm. Some 75 to 80 per cent of students spend a semester elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/world-insight-building-study-abroad-programme-works|title=World insight: building a study abroad programme that works|date=2016-12-27|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus life==

===Residential colleges===
[[File:Yale-NUS 5.jpg|thumb|right|Yale-NUS College's central courtyard]]
Yale-NUS's student life is modelled on the [[residential colleges of Yale University|residential colleges of Yale]]. There are three residential colleges named Saga, Elm and Cendana, although there are plans to build a fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marie Lee|first1=Regina|title=Yale-NUS to Open a Fourth Residential College in Four Years - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-3/features/yale-nus-to-open-a-fourth-residential-college-in-four-years/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each has its own dining hall, courtyard, student suites, sky-gardens, faculty residences, study-spaces, intramural teams, and butteries, informal student-run eateries that are a Yale tradition. Students live in suites of six single rooms. These small-scale communities are arranged vertically in residential towers, which contain both student suites and faculty apartments. Floors are grouped into neighborhoods, each with its own skygarden, a landscaped outdoor space for high-rise buildings that was pioneered in Singapore.

The residential community includes a rector (equivalent to the position of a college master at Yale), a vice rector, faculty fellows, advisors, rector's aides, and distinguished visiting fellows. Students will expand their social and leadership skills while enjoying the support of "nested academic communities."

[[File:Yale-NUS 2.jpg|thumb|left|A courtyard at Yale-NUS]]

Kyle Farley, formerly Dean of Jonathan Edwards College at Yale, served as the first Dean of Students of the college. Brian McAdoo, a geologist and expert in environment studies, formerly of [[Vassar College]], served as the inaugural Rector and is currently rector of Elm college, while Eduardo Lage-Otero, formerly of Trinity College, was named inaugural Vice-Rector and later served as Vice-Rector of Saga College.

There is currently no Dean of Students.

As the first freshmen transitioned into the collegiate living experience, they were originally aided by Dean's Fellows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/21-july-2017-deans-fellows-guides-and-mentors-for-yale-nus-students/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a group of recent college graduates picked from various higher educational backgrounds, including Amherst, Carleton, Princeton, Reed, Mt. Holyoke, Yale, and NUS. As of 2017, the Dean's Fellow role has shifted, with residential functions now primarily being performed by upper-class students.

===Student organisations===

In 2017, Yale-NUS had 54 student organisations recognised by the Dean of Students Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://studentlife.yale-nus.edu.sg/student-activities/student-orgs-directory/|website=studentlife.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college has a number of student newspapers, magazines and journals. Publications include ''The Octant'', Yale-NUS's most established publication, ''The Mocktant'', its satirical counterpart, ''Tònes'', a multilingual magazine, and the Yale-NUS Society for Academic Research, which publishes academic journals. While not a recognised student organisation, ''The Fox and Hedgehog'', a current and global affairs review, was founded by Yale-NUS students.

==Campus==
[[Image:Yale-NUS 3.jpg|thumb|A view of the three residential colleges.]]
The Yale-NUS campus is adjacent to NUS University Town&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Town|url=https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/University+Town/@1.3060434,103.7707735,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1af575f7ff17:0x1056d4b4bd4641c8!8m2!3d1.306038!4d103.7729622?hl=en|website=Google Maps|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the College moved to this permanent campus in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/milestones/ |website=Yale–NUS College|accessdate=July 25, 2016 |title=Milestones}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a central campus green flanked by academic and administrative buildings. The campus was designed by architectural firms Pelli Clark Pelli and Forum Architects (a Singaporean architecture studio), who state that "its architectural style blends the collegiate traditions of Yale with the Southeast Asian cultures through its modernist style ornamented by metalwork patterns inspired by southeast Asian textiles."

The campus was designed to achieve the highest rating under the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark, Singapore's benchmark for sustainable design.

==Alumni==

Upon graduation, Yale-NUS alumni will be receive alumni membership of National University of Singapore and will be international affiliates in the Association of Yale Alumni (AYA), although not membership to the Yale Club of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xie|first1=Yihao|title=Yale-NUS Alumni to be International Affiliates in the Association of Yale Alumni - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-9/news/breaking-yale-nus-alumni-to-be-international-affiliates-in-the-association-of-yale-alumni/|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale-NUS has its own Alumni Affairs Council and is working to establish a Yale-NUS Club of Singapore.

Since graduating its first class in June 2017, Yale-NUS alumni have won several post-graduate awards, including its first Rhodes Scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/yale-nus-graduate-awarded-prestigious-rhodes-scholarship|title=Yale-NUS graduate awarded prestigious Rhodes Scholarship|last=|first=|date=|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Schwarzman Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/scholar/mollie-saltskog/|title=Schwarzman Scholars Class of 2018 Profiles|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also achieved an employment rate of 93.3%, with a median monthly salary of SGD3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/ix-6/uncategorized/graduation-statistics-first-cohort-yale-nus-graduates/|title=Graduation statistics from the first cohort of Yale-NUS graduates|last=Ho|first=Dion|date=15 March 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Mascot ==
Yale-NUS launched the College Mascot in 2017. The Yale-NUS College Mascot - 'Halcyon' -  emerged as a representation of the blue-eared kingfisher species found in rarity in Singapore. The orange-and-blue mascot, colours of Yale-NUS, found ready acceptance as it also encapsulates the core identity of a young academic institution in quick and confident ascension, ready to take on the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campaignbriefasia.com/2017/03/yale-nus-and-hakuhodo-singapor.html|title=Yale-NUS and Hakuhodo Singapore team up to create the college kingfisher mascot|work=Campaign Brief Asia|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mascot was ratified by the student body on April 7, 2016 after three rounds of voting. Since ratification, the Yale-NUS Student Government held focus group discussions to gather feedback on the mascot design and name. The name Halcyon emerged from one of these student focus group discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vi-2/news/yale-nus-unveils-official-college-mascot/|title=Yale-NUS Unveils Official College Mascot|date=2017-02-02|work=The Octant|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Observers in the [[New York Times]] and the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] see Yale's move as part of a larger movement of the globalization of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/nyregion/14yale.html | work=The New York Times | first=Lisa W. | last=Foderaro | title=Yale Plans to Create a College in Singapore | date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fischer |first=Karin |url=http://chronicle.com/article/YaleNational-U-of/132563/ |title=Yale and National U. of Singapore Hammer Out New College's Curriculum |newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=25 June 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale faced criticism for its involvement in Singapore because of the government's restrictions on freedom of assembly and ban on homosexual activity.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Karin |last=Fischer |title=With Opening Near, Yale Defends Singapore Venture |newspaper=The New York Times |date=27 August 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/world/asia/27iht-educlede27.html|quote="...few have provoked the heated criticism that Yale has regarding its decision to be involved in a country where not only is freedom of assembly and association restricted, but homosexual activity is banned."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fareed Zakaria]], a CNN host and fellow of the [[Yale Corporation]] at the time, supported the venture, saying that "Singapore has a great deal to learn from America, and NUS has a great deal to learn from Yale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/03/zakaria-a-global-education-for-a-global-age/ |last=Zakaria |first=Fareed |title=A global education for a global age |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommy Koh]], former Singaporean Ambassador to the [[United Nations]], called it a "timely and visionary initiative" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spp.nus.edu.sg/ips/docs/pub/pa_tk_ST_Yale-NUS%20a%20timely%20visionary%20initiative_150412.pdf |title=Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy |publisher=Spp.nus.edu.sg |date=15 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faculty expressed themselves in the pages of [[Yale Daily News]]. [[Seyla Benhabib]], a [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] at Yale, calling it a "naïve missionary sentiment," asked, "Do we need to go to Singapore to advance interdisciplinarity and a revival of the liberal arts?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/04/benhabib-whats-stake-yale-nus/ |last=Benhabib |first=Seyla |title=What's at stake at Yale-NUS |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817103617/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/04/benhabib-whats-stake-yale-nus/ |archivedate=17 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairs of the faculty search committee responded, "the new college will require faculty to rethink their pedagogical assumptions and to consider such innovations as integrated and interactive approaches to science; writing across the curriculum; computation, computer simulations and interpretation of large data sets; and the honing of quantitative, communication and other skills."&lt;ref name="bdl"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/feb/29/bailyn-davis-and-lewis-rethinking-liberal-arts/?print |last1=Bailyn |first1=Charles |last2=Davis |first2=Deborah |last3=Lewis |first3=Pericles |title=Rethinking liberal arts education |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Bloch]], a [[Sterling Professor|Sterling Professor of French]], said that "As a nexus between India, China and the West, Singapore’s location favors an important conceptual realignment of the humanities that will be a long time coming to the home campus in New Haven — that is, a synthesis of the ways that ideas and creative works of East and West intersect historically as well as conceptually with each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/19/bloch-why-i-yale-nus/ |last=Bloch |first=Howard |title=Why I like Yale-NUS |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=19 March 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of professors critical of the project characterize the endeavor of "globalizing" a "specious one," saying that the graduates "will have to be conformist, dissent-averse managers and executives who serve the global profit motive."&lt;ref name="bmyjr"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/21/letters-32112/ |last1=Miller |first1=Christopher |last2=Bers |first2=Victor |last3=Campbell |first3=Jill |last4=Rogers |first4=John |last5=Yiengpruksawan |first5=Mimi |title=LETTERS: 3.21.12 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=6 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210072143/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/21/letters-32112/ |archivedate=10 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvin Chun, the master of [[Berkeley College (Yale University)|Berkeley College]] and educated in South Korea, disagreed, asking "Will Yale-NUS be denied to numerous students around the world like me who lack the hyper-talent or mega-resources needed to study abroad at a place like Yale?"&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/05/chun-globalizing-the-academic-1-percent/ |last=Chun |first=Marvin |title= Globalizing the academic 1 percent |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are concerned that Yale-NUS would dilute the Yale name. For [[Michael J. Fischer|Michael Fischer]], professor of computer science, since Yale-NUS will not grant Yale degrees, the value of a Yale degree becomes diminished, and that the joint governing board does not "make Yale-NUS a part of Yale any more than does Levin's service on the board of directors for American Express make American Express a part of Yale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/23/fischer-yale-nus-is-not-yale/ |last=Fischer |first=Michael |title=Yale-NUS is not Yale |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haun Saussy]] stated says that "It’s in the spirit of the motto "Lux et veritas" — my light is not diminished when my neighbor lights his candle at mine, and a truth becomes more powerful, not less, when it is shared." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/sep/14/saussy-when-elihu-meets-confucius/ |last=Saussy |first=Haun |title=When Elihu meets Confucius |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2012, the Yale College faculty passed a resolution stating, "We urge Yale-NUS to respect, protect and further principles of non-discrimination for all, including sexual minorities and migrant workers; and to uphold civil liberty and political freedom on campus and in the broader society".&lt;ref name="YDN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/06/faculty-approve-yale-nus-resolution |last1=Gideon |first1=Gavan |last2=Woodford |first2=Antonia |title=Faculty approve Yale-NUS resolution |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, prompted by a ''Wall Street Journal'' report that students would not be allowed to stage protests or form political parties, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that it disapproved such restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303933704577530524046581142 |last=Mahtani |first=Shibani |title=Yale-Singapore Venture to Forbid Political Protest - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/19/singapore-yale-curtail-rights-new-campus |title=Singapore: Yale to Curtail Rights on New Campus &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=19 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Riady]], an Associate Professor of Law at the Pelita Harapan University in Indonesia, defended the venture, stating that "Singapore and Asia are in the middle of great transitions, and Yale has an opportunity to shape that process and put its stamp on a rising continent.

In 2015, Yale-NUS became the first higher education institution in Singapore to offer gender neutral housing to students.

The College received increased media scrutiny in response to student calls for the resignation of Chan Heng Chee, a Yale-NUS Governing Board Member and Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large. Chan defended Section 377A of the Singaporean Penal Code, a law forbidding sodomy, at the United Nations Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review in Geneva in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xu|first1=Qi|title=Yale-NUS admin speech sparks debate|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/02/05/yale-nus-admin-speech-sparks-debate/|accessdate=8 May 2017|publisher=Yale Daily News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, The Octant published an op-ed by Nik Carverhill that called on Chan to either take a stand against Section 377A or relinquish her seat on the governing board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carverhill|first1=Nik|title=On the Yale-NUS Governing Board, Tolerance is Not Enough|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/opinion/on-the-yale-nus-governing-board-tolerance-is-not-enough/|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article received coverage in the Singaporean press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heng|first1=Janice|title=Yale-NUS rejects call on envoy to quit post|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/yale-nus-rejects-call-on-envoy-to-quit-post|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Straits Times|publisher=The Straits Times|date=7 February 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Jeanette|title=Some Yale-NUS students want Ambassador-at-Large Chan Heng Chee removed from the school’s board {{!}} Mothership.SG|url=http://mothership.sg/2016/02/some-yale-nus-students-want-ambassador-at-large-chan-heng-chee-removed-from-the-schools-board/|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=mothership.sg|publisher=mothership.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Chan attended a closed door dialogue in March, hosted by the Yale-NUS Student Government and The G Spot, a gender and sexuality alliance on campus, to discuss Singapore's approach to human-rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamarudin|first1=Diyanah|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/5-july-2016-daryl-yang-class-2018-engaging-dialogue-key-diversity/|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 87% of students surveyed by The Octant said that  they did not think Chan should resign, although 62% of respondents supported the dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Spandana|title=Students Reject Call for Ambassador Chan Heng Chee’s resignation: Survey - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-15/news/students-reject-call-for-ambassador-chan-heng-chees-resignation/|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan remains a member of the Yale-NUS governing board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/the-governing-board/|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports in the [http://www.chronicle.com/article/Singapore-Meets-the-Ivy/141461/ Chronicle of Higher Education], [https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/yale-nus-college-extends-reach-liberal-arts-forbidden-fruits Times Higher Education], [http://www.barrons.com/articles/yale-goes-to-asia-1425704378?tesla=y Barron’s Magazine] and [http://harvardmagazine.com/2017/07/an-educated-core Harvard Magazine] on the new college, which started classes in August 2013, noted that lively discussions take place on campus. Barron's Magazine's article “Yale goes to Asia” highlighted how education experts such as Ben Nelson, CEO of the Minerva Project, particularly likes Yale-NUS’ emphasis on seminars and its requirement that all students in their first two years take pretty much the same core curriculum, including philosophy and political thought, literature and humanities, and modern social thought. In an article for The Atlantic, Michael Roth, President of Wesleyan University and author of ''Beyond the University: Why Liberal Education Matters'' write about how he was impressed by Yale-NUS’ decision to decline to institutionalize faculty within departments representing the academic disciplines. This has led to a re-conceptualization of majors as complements to a core curriculum, and, in turn, to the welcoming of faculty with diverse skill sets over those tethered to divisive academic specializations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/10/american-liberal-education-happens-better-in-singapore/410869/?single_page=true&amp;print|title=The Ironic Birth of Liberal-Arts Education in Asia|last=Roth|first=Michael|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
