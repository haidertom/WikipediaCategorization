      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14178">A '''behavioral cusp''' is any [[behavior]] change that brings an organism's behavior into contact with new contingencies that have far-reaching consequences.&lt;ref name="rosales97"/&gt; A behavioral cusp is a special type of behavior change because it provides the learner with opportunities to access new reinforcers, new contingencies, new environments, new related behaviors (generativeness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alessi | first1 = G. | year = 1987 | title = Generative strategies and teaching for generalization | url = | journal = The Analysis of Verbal Behavior | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 15–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and competition with archaic or problem behaviors. It affects the people around the learner, and these people agree to the behavior change and support its development after the intervention is removed.

The concept has far reaching implications for every individual, and for the field of developmental psychology, because it provides a behavioral alternative to the concept of [[Developmental psychology|maturation]] and change due to the simple passage of time, such as [[developmental milestones]]. The cusp is a behavior change that presents special features when compared to other behavior changes.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
The concept was first proposed{{when|date=August 2014}} by [[Sidney W. Bijou]], an American developmental psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, S. and Hixson, M.D. (2004). The Final Piece to a Complete Science of Behavior: Behavior Development and Behavioral Cusps. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5 (3), 244–253 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the cusp was to link behavioral principles to rapid spurts in development (see [[Behavior analysis of child development]]).

A behavioral cusp as conceptualized by Jesus Rosales-Ruiz &amp; [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]] in 1997 is an important behavior change that affects future behavior changes.&lt;ref name="rosales97"&gt;{{citation |last= Rosales-Ruiz |first=J. |last2=Baer |first2=D.M. |year=1997 |chapter=Behavioral cusps: a developmental and pragmatic concept for behavior analysis |title=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=30 |pages= 533–544 |pmc=1284066 |pmid=9316263 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1997.30-533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral cusp, like the [[reinforcer]], is apprehended by its effects. Whereas a reinforcer acts on a single response or a group of related responses, the effects of a behavioral cusp regulate a large number of responses in a more distant future.

The concept has been compared to a [[developmental milestone]], however, not all cusps are milestones. For example, learning to play soccer is not a milestone, but it was life-changing for [[Pelé]]. As a result of learning to kick grapefruits (the initial important change or cusp), Pelé accessed (1) new environments, (2) new reinforcers, (3) new soccer moves, (4) dropped competing behaviors (smoking), and (5) gained international acclaims for his skill. Soccer is not a [[developmental milestone]] because it is not a necessary skill in most environments.

==Properties==
The following properties are special features of a behavioral change that lead to more change, and an increased likelihood of social adaptation, independence, and [[cultural fitness]].

===New reinforcers===
New reinforcers are accessible and enrich the perspective of the learner. Additionally these reinforcers may lead to an increase in the variety of behaviors. If the reinforcers are promoting health and social behaviors, they will lead to an improved quality of life.

====Case example====
A child who learns to open a door may access the swing for the first time and learns to use the swing.&lt;ref name="rosales97"/&gt; Here, the new skill (swinging motion is the reinforcer) may lead to more complex and social activities such as (1) turn taking, (2) asking someone to share the swing, (3) taking turns pushing someone, which in turn (4) may provide more social opportunities to speak and (5) interact with the play partners, etc.

====Case non-example====
A child learns to open a door and walks outside. He finds some ants behind a shrubbery and watches the ants. His parents are looking for him, they get worried and are calling him. The child is unusually mesmerized by columns of ants on the ground and does not hear the calls. His parents find him shortly after, but they are frantic from their 5-minute search and accidentally scare him from going outside. In this non-example, learning to open doors that lead outside resulted in consequences that did not directly benefit the child and maybe decrease important skills related to exploration and search. In this case, no new reinforcers were contacted and learning to open the backyard door (that has a special latch) was effectively a waste of time because the child's parents don't usually approve being alone in the backyard.

===New contingencies of reinforcement===
New contingencies are responsible for the selection of novel and more [[adaptive behaviors]] while decreasing problematic or archaic behaviors. Contingencies of reinforcement (before&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Reinforcer) produce and maintain each and every learned behavior. New contingencies establish the control of new stimuli over our behaviors, and therefore make us more sensitive and aware of our surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selection by Consequences |url=http://www.bfsr.org/element1.html |publisher=Walden Fellowship, Inc. |year=1999 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716171113/http://www.bfsr.org/element1.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

===New environments===
New environments are geographical and/or virtual areas of potential change (receiving environments). New environments regulate, maintain, and set the micro-cultural boundaries for reinforcers (and punishers), and their antecedents. They include tools and stakeholders controlling the pace and content of instruction and, as a result, they regulate boundary of what the learner learns (e.g., school curriculum). New environments must contain some of the stakeholders' preferences and reinforcers to create lasting [[positive reinforcement]] practices for the learner.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

===Generativeness===
Generativeness describes the ability of the receiving environment to regulate novel responses, functions, values or response products derived from the original cusp response. For a behavior, it is the ability to recombine or merge into more complex units, or the ability to contact environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosch | first1 = S. | last2 = Fuqua | first2 = R.W. | year = 2001 | title = Behavioral cusps: a model for selecting target behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123–125 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-123| pmc = 1284293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case example====
{{NPOV|reason=Seems partisan in favor of the pro-phonics camp|date=July 2015}}
A child learns [[phonetic reading]] and can recombine the 50 or so English phonemes into 50,000 words by recombining the individual sounds he has learned to read. The generative index for this act of learning the basic English phonemes is approximately 10,000 (where one new behavior results in a potential 10,000 applications).

====Case non-example====
{{NPOV|reason=Seems partisan in favor of the pro-phonics camp|date=July 2015}}
A child learns [[Look-say|sight reading]] for 50 words. When a new word is presented, the child learns by listening to a teacher and memorizes the words rather than using what he has previously learned, thus becoming able to read only 50 words using this method. Additionally, he is now dependent on someone for learning each new vocabulary word.

===Competition with archaic behaviors===
Behavior competition is the ability of cusp behaviors to displace previously established behaviors on a continuum of intensity and rate, across repertoires, and environments. Competing archaic behaviors occur on a corresponding continuum of severity.

===Effect on stakeholders===
Effect on others comes from the learner's behavior affecting the stakeholders who control reinforcers and punishers in a specific environment. It is important to identify these stakeholders' motivations and reinforcers in selecting potential cusps. Effect refers to the changes in values and behaviors of the stakeholder resulting from a cusp in the learner. The initial and gradually more complex behaviors that constituted the entry point for an important behavior change that, once initiated, so profoundly alters, displaces, or transforms one's behavioral repertoire that it renders preexisting behavioral repertoires obsolete. A behavioral cusp is an important behavior change that alters the probability of the learner's future repertoires and interactions with stakeholders' repertoires.

===Social validity===
[[Social validity]] is an indicator of social acceptability of a behavior and its consequences for the stakeholders representing the communities which the learner is accessing or will access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = I. | last2 = Baer | first2 = D. | year = 1991 | title = Social validity Assessment: Is current practice state of the art? | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 189–204 | doi=10.1901/jaba.1991.24-189| pmc = 1279564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some seemingly insignificant changes in a stakeholder may dramatically affect the learner. All stakeholders (e.g., government officials, teachers, parents, and other interventionists) should agree to the goals, methods, and tools for the intervention and the norms from the local community suggest the boundaries of what should be learned.

==Applications==

===Life span/development guidelines===
The behavioral cusp has implications for the selection and sequencing of skills during the life span. While milestones are mainly concerned with the chronology of behaviors, the concept of behavioral cusp is concerned with the fitness of the behavior within a context or a [[receiving environment]]. As Rosales-Ruiz and Baer (1997) stated, "One child's cusp may be another child's waste of time." Thus, there is a great need for empirically-based guidelines in making decisions related to the initial selection of skills.

===Prediction and control of development over longer periods of time===
The applications of the concepts are related to the prediction, selection, and retention of successful and adaptive behaviors to the treatment of [[childhood autism]], [[Down syndrome]], and other [[developmental disabilities]] is humane and based on evidence from the field of [[behavior analysis]]. The first applications of the concept derive from a set of guidelines proposed by Bosch and Fuqua in ''The [[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]''.

===Development of new technology===
A new technology and methodology, necessary to measure the effects of a small change over time, will reveal a strong dependence on the initial conditions selected by a cusp specialist ([[butterfly effect]]).

==Future research==
Future research will elucidate the nature and parameters of the criteria and the tools used in the selection and sequencing of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bosch |first=S. |last2=Hixson |first2=M.D. |year=2004 |chapter=The final piece to a complete science of behavior: behavior development and behavioral cusps |title=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |pages=244–254 |url=http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hixson |first=M.D. |year=2004 |chapter=Behavioral cusps, basic behavioral repertoires, and cumulative-hierarchical learning |title=The Psychological Record |volume=54 |pages=387–403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{graph search algorithm}}

The '''British Museum algorithm''' is a general approach to find a solution by checking all possibilities one by one, beginning with the smallest. The term refers to a conceptual, not a practical, technique where the number of possibilities is enormous.

For instance, one may, in theory, find the smallest program that solves a particular problem in the following way: Generate all possible source codes of length one character. Check each one to see if it solves the problem. (Note: the [[halting problem]] makes this check troublesome, although this can be overcome with [[dovetailing (computer science)|dovetailing]].) If not, generate and check all programs of two characters, three characters, etc. Conceptually, this finds the smallest program, but in practice it tends to take an unacceptable amount of time (more than the lifetime of the universe, in many instances) {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.

Similar arguments can be made to show that optimizations, theorem proving, language recognition, etc. are possible or impossible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3020">A '''Cambridge change''' is a philosophical concept of change according to which an [[entity]] ''x'' has changed ''[[if and only if]]'' there is some [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] F that is true (not true) of ''x'' at a time ''t1'' but not true (true) of ''x'' at some later time ''t2''.

==History==
The term ''Cambridge change'' was coined by [[Peter Geach]] in the late 1960s,&lt;ref name="Geach"&gt;Geach, P.T. (1969). ''God and the Soul''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/change/ Change]". ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved on 2009-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[J. M. E. McTaggart|McTaggart]], philosophers active at [[Cambridge University]].

==Example==
Suppose that at ''t1'', person A is 180&amp;nbsp;cm tall and person B is 175&amp;nbsp;cm tall, while at time ''t2'' A is still 180&amp;nbsp;cm tall but B has grown to be 185&amp;nbsp;cm tall.  Since the predicate 'is taller than B' is true of A at ''t1'' but not true of A at ''t2'', A has changed according to the Cambridge change definition of "change"—he has gone from being taller than B to not being taller than B.

Intuitively, however, it is only person B, and not person A, who has changed: B has grown by 10&amp;nbsp;cm, but A has stayed the same.  This problem with Cambridge changes is usually thought to call for a distinction between [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] and [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|extrinsic]], or natural and non-natural, properties.  Given such a distinction, it is possible to define "real" change by requiring that the respective predicates express an intrinsic change in a property, such as a change in height from 175&amp;nbsp;cm to 185&amp;nbsp;cm, rather than an extrinsic change in a property, such as being now taller than B.

But this assumes that there "really" are strictly unary (non-relational) properties that, as such, are thus intrinsic. Namely, a property is intrinsic if and only if it is actually (really, analytically, fundamentally, necessarily, ontologically) unary.

But imagine that all "meter sticks" as of time "t2" have contracted at a rate such that B's height at time "t2" would be measured as having increased by 10&amp;nbsp;cm. Imagine further that A's height has actually (really) shrunk so that it would be measured with a respectively shrinking meter stick as remaining constant from time "t1" to time "t2".

Intuitively, B's height will have remained the same whereas A's height and all ways of measuring height will have changed. In this case, it is A's height and all ways of measuring height that will have changed. The problem with the notion of "Cambridge change" is its failure to acknowledge that B's or anything else's height is relational (relative to ways of measuring height). "Height" is thus not unary and thus is extrinsic, not intrinsic.

Cause and effect are an important topic in all schools of [[Vedanta]]. These concepts are discussed in ancient and medieval texts of [[Hinduism]], and other Indian religions, using synonymous terms. Cause is referred to as ''{{IAST|kāraṇa}}'' (कारण),  ''nidana'' (निदान), ''hetu'' (हेतु) or ''mulam'' (मूलम्), while effect is referred to as ''{{IAST|kārya}}'' (कार्य), ''phala'' (फल), ''parinam'' (परिणाम) or ''Shungam'' (शुङ्ग).&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+cause&amp;trans=Translate cause], [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=effect&amp;script=&amp;direction=ES&amp;link=yes effect], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|authorlink=Paul Deussen|title=The System of the Vedanta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DI7cCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA264|year=2015|publisher=Reprint: KB (Original: 1912, Oxford)|isbn=978-1-5191-1778-6|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gadjin M.

==Causality==
{{See also|Samkhya#Causality|l1=Satkāryavāda|Ajativada}}

All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of ''[[Satkaryavada|Satkāryavāda]]'',&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/bhed-ved/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Bhedābheda Vedānta'']&lt;/ref&gt; which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are different views on the causal relationship and the nature of the empirical world from the perspective of metaphysical Brahman. The ''Brahma Sutras'', the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedanta,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt; as well as Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy,&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda" /&gt; support ''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Parinamavada]]'', the idea that the world is a real transformation (''parinama'') of Brahman.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}

Scholars disagree on the whether [[Adi Shankara]] and his [[Advaita Vedanta]] explained causality through ''vivarta''.&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=25-27}} According to Andrew Nicholson, instead of ''parinama-vada'', the competing causality theory is ''[[Vivartavada]]'', which says "the world, is merely an unreal manifestation (''vivarta'') of Brahman. Vivartavada states that although Brahman appears to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are unreal manifestation, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts". The advocates of this illusive, unreal transformation based causality theory, states Nicholson, have been the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} "Although the world can be described as conventionally real", adds Nicholson, "the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman’s effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated".&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;

However, other scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker disagree.{{refn|group=note|According to Hugh Nicholson, "the definitive study on the development of the concept of ''vivarta'' in Indian philosophy, and in Advaita Vedanta in particular, remains Hacker's ''Vivarta''.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|p=266 note 20, 167-170}}}} Hacker and others state that Adi Shankara did not advocate ''Vivartavada'', and his explanations are "remote from any connotation of illusion". According to these scholars, it was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman who gave a definition to ''Vivarta'', and it is Prakasatman's theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara's position.{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=25-27}} To Shankara, the word ''maya'' has hardly any terminological weight.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|p=266 note 21}} Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the ''vivarta-vada'' isn't Shankara's theory, that Shankara's ideas appear closer to ''parinama-vada'', and the ''vivarta'' explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later.&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;

According to Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta states that from "the standpoint of Brahman-experience and Brahman itself, there is no creation" in the absolute sense, all empirically observed creation is relative and mere transformation of one state into another, all states are provisional and a cause-effect driven modification.{{Sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=40-43}}

==Nimitta kāraṇa and Upādāna kāraṇa==
Two sorts of causes are recognised:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lipner | first=Julius J. | authorlink=Julius J. Lipner|title=Ancient Banyan: an Inquiry into the Meaning of `Hinduness' | journal=Religious Studies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=32 | issue=01 | year=1996 | pages=109–126 | doi=10.1017/s0034412500024100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST|Nimitta kāraṇa}}, the [[efficient cause]].
# {{IAST|Upādāna kāraṇa}}, the [[material cause]].

=={{IAST|kārya-kāraṇa ananyatva}}==
Advaita states that effect ({{IAST|''kārya''}}) is non-different from cause ({{IAST|''kāraṇa''}}), but the cause is different from the effect:
:{{IAST|''kārya''}} is not different from {{IAST|''kāraṇa''}}; however {{IAST|''kāraṇa''}} is different from {{IAST|''kārya''}}

This principle is called {{IAST|''kārya-kāraṇa ananyatva''}}.

===Effect is not different from cause===
When the cause is destroyed, the effect will no longer exist. For example, cotton cloth is the effect of the cotton threads, which is the material cause. Without threads there will be no cotton cloth. Without cotton there will be no thread.

According to Swami Sivananda, in his comments on the {{IAST|Brahmasūtra-Bhāṣya}} 2.1.9, Adi Shankara describes this as follows:
{{quote|Despite the non-difference of cause and effect, the effect has its self in the cause but not the cause in the effect.&lt;br&gt;The effect is of the nature of the cause and not the cause the nature of the effect.&lt;br&gt;Therefore the qualities of the effect cannot touch the cause.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/bs_2/bs_2.1.03.html |title=Brahma Sutras by Swami Sivananda |publisher=Swami-krishnananda.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110612173736/http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/bs_2/bs_2.1.03.html| archivedate= 12 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|{{IAST|''ananyatve'pi kāryakāraṇayoḥ kāryasya kāraṇātmatvaṃ na tu kāraṇasya kāryātmatvaṃ''}}}}}}

'''Classification chart'''  or '''classification tree''' is a synopsis of the [[classification scheme]],&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Department of the Army. ''The Writing of American Military History.'' U.S. Government Printing Office, 1956, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; designed to illustrate the structure of any particular field.

== Overview == 
Classification is the process in which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated, and understood, and classification charts are intended to help create and eventually visualized the outcome.

According to Brinton "in a classification chart the facts, data etc. are arranged so that the place of each in relation to all others is readily seen. Quantities need not be given, although a quantitative analysis adds to the value of a classification chart."&lt;ref name="WCB 1939"&gt;[[Willard Cope Brinton]], ''Graphic presentation.'' 1939. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl G. Karsten|Karsten]] (1923) explained, that "in all chart-making, the material to be shown must be accurately compiled before it can be charted. For an understanding of the classification chart, we must delve somewhat into the mysteries of the classification and indexing. The art of classification calls into play the power of visualizing a 'whole' together with its 'parts'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karsten, Karl G.]] ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006593135 Charts and graphs: An introduction to graphic methods in the control and analysis of statistics].'' Prentice-Hall, 1923, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Early examples of classification chart are:
* The illustrations of the [[Carl Linnaeus]]' 1735 classification of [[animals]] and his [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification]] of [[plant]]s in his ''Classes Plantarum'' 1738. 
* In 1752 [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Denis Diderot]] produced a [[figurative system of human knowledge]] produced for the ''[[Encyclopédie]].''
* [[Augustin Augier]]'s "Arbre Botanique" (1801)&lt;ref name="JDA 2009"&gt;J. David Archibald (2009): [http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/archibald.html/Archibald09JHB42p561.pdf Edward Hitchcock’s Pre-Darwinian (1840) 'Tree of Life'], ''Journal of the History of Biology'' (2009) 42:561–592.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1840 [[Edward Hitchcock]] inserted a paleontological chart in his ''Elementary Geology'' (1840).&lt;ref name="JDA 2009"/&gt; It shows a branching diagram of the plant and animal kingdom against a geological background.
* The tree of life image that appeared in Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]],'' 1859
Early classification chart are often visualized in a [[tree structure]]. Modern charts can also be presented in [[Table (information)|table]] or as an [[infographic]].

The term "classification chart" came into use in the 20th century. In his 1939 ''Graphic presentation.'' (first edition 1919) [[Willard Cope Brinton]] was one of the first to devoted a whole chapter on classification charts.&lt;ref name="WCB 1939"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1634">'''Comply or explain''' is a regulatory approach used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and other countries in the field of corporate governance and financial supervision. Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the [[Financial Reporting Council]], in Germany, under the [[Aktiengesetz]]) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not. The [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], the [[German Corporate Governance Code]] (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' ([[:nl:code-Tabaksblat]]) use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their [[audit]] committees, [[remuneration]] committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.

The purpose of "comply or explain" is to "let the market decide" whether a set of standards is appropriate for individual companies. Since a company may deviate from the standard, this approach rejects the view that "one size fits all", but because of the requirement of disclosure of explanations to market investors, anticipates that if investors do not accept a company's explanations, then investors will sell their shares, hence creating a "market sanction", rather than a legal one. The concept was first introduced after the recommendations of the [[Cadbury Report]] of 1992.

'''Constructive dilemma'''&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Patrick. A Concise Introduction to Logic With Ilrn Printed Access Card. Wadsworth Pub Co, 2008. Page 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]]. It is the [[inference]] that, if ''P'' implies ''Q'' and ''R'' implies ''S'' and either ''P'' or ''R'' is true, then ''Q or S'' has to be true. In sum, if two [[material conditional|conditionals]] are true and at least one of their antecedents is, then at least one of their consequents must be too. ''Constructive dilemma'' is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] version of [[modus ponens]], whereas,
[[destructive dilemma]] is the disjunctive version of ''[[modus tollens]]''. The rule can be stated:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(P \to Q) * (R \to S), P \lor R}{\therefore Q \lor S}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that whenever instances of "&lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;", "&lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;", and "&lt;math&gt;P \lor R&lt;/math&gt;" appear on lines of a proof, "&lt;math&gt;Q \lor S&lt;/math&gt;" can be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The ''constructive dilemma'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: &lt;math&gt;(P \to Q), (R \to S), (P \lor R) \vdash (Q \lor S)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;Q \lor S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q \lor S&lt;/math&gt; in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;(((P \to Q) \land (R \to S)) \land (P \lor R)) \to (Q \lor S)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

== Natural language example ==

:If I win a million dollars, I will donate it to an orphanage.
:If my friend wins a million dollars, he will donate it to a wildlife fund.
:Either I win a million dollars or my friend wins a million dollars.
:Therefore, either an orphanage will get a million dollars, or a wildlife fund will get a million dollars.

The dilemma derives its name because of the transfer of disjunctive operator.

[[File:VHS-Video-Tape-Top-Flat.jpg|thumb|The VHS cassette in the [[Japanese horror]] film [[Ring (film)|''Ring'']] is an example of a dark medium.]]
'''Dark media''' are a type of media outlined by American philosopher [[Eugene Thacker]].

==Overview==
Discussed at length in the essay of the same name, Eugene Thacker writes that dark media are media that function too well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thacker writes that, "dark media have, as their aim, the mediation of that which is unavailable or inaccessible to the senses, and thus that which we are normally "in the dark" about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically in works of [[Horror fiction|Horror]], dark media are relatively commonplace media that show more of the world than is expected, with the dark medium showing what lies beyond the possibility of human sense. Dark media are significant in their ability to breach the, typically unbridgeable, gap between objects being mediated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; With dark media, as shown in the [[Japanese horror|J-Horror]] film [[Ring (film)|''Ring'']], dark media can create a point between the natural and the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ring'', the dark medium of the [[VHS|VHS cassette]] makes it possible for antagonist [[Sadako Yamamura]] to cross the threshold of a tv, and subsequently kill those that have viewed the videotape.

==Examples of dark media==
* Videotape from [[Ring (film)|''Ring'' (200000006)]].
* Machine from ''[[Long Distance Wireless Photography]]''.
* Webcam from [[Pulse (2001 film)|''Pulse'' (2001)]].

A '''data flow diagram''' ('''DFD''') is a graphical representation of the "flow" of data through an [[information system]], modelling its ''process'' aspects. A DFD is often used as a preliminary step to create an overview of the system without going into great detail, which can later be elaborated.&lt;ref&gt;Bruza, P. D., Van der Weide, {{fact|date=July 2017}}Th. P., "The Semantics of Data Flow Diagrams", University of Nijmegen, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; DFDs can also be used for the [[Data visualization|visualization]] of [[data processing]] (structured design).{{fact|date=July 2017}}

A DFD shows what kind of information will be input to and output from the system, how the data will advance through the system, and where the data will be stored. It does not show information about process timing or whether processes will operate in sequence or in parallel, unlike a traditional structured [[flowchart]] which focuses on control flow, or a UML activity workflow diagram, which presents both control and data flows as a unified model.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

==History==
In the 1970s, [[Larry Constantine]], the original developer of structured design, proposed data flow diagrams as a practical technique based on Martin and Estrin's "Data Flow Graph" model of computation.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stevens, G. Myers, L. Constantine, [http://domino.watson.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/d9f0a910ab8b637485256bc80066a393/a801ae3750be70ac85256bfa00685ded!OpenDocument "Structured Design"], IBM Systems Journal, 13 (2), 115-139, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Data flow diagrams (DFD) quickly became a popular way to visualize the major steps and data involved in software system processes. DFDs were usually used to show data flow in a computer system, although they could in theory be applied to [[business process modeling]]. DFDs were useful to document the major data flows or to explore a new high-level design in terms of data flow.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Larman, "Applying UML and Patterns", Pearson Education, {{ISBN|978-81-7758-979-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Data flow diagrams are also known as bubble charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orm.net/pdf/jcm13.pdf Introduced by Clive Finkelstein in Australia,  CACI in the UK, and later writers such as James Martin]&lt;/ref&gt; DFD is a designing tool used in the top-down approach to Systems Design. This context-level DFD is next "exploded", to produce a Level 1 DFD that shows some of the detail of the system being modeled. The Level 1 DFD shows how the system is divided into sub-systems (processes), each of which deals with one or more of the data flows to or from an external agent, and which together provide all of the functionality of the system as a whole. It also identifies internal data stores that must be present in order for the system to do its job, and shows the flow of data between the various parts of the system.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

Data flow diagrams are one of the three essential perspectives of the structured-systems analysis and design method [[SSADM]]. The sponsor of a project and the end users will need to be briefed and consulted throughout all stages of a system's evolution.  With a data flow diagram, users are able to visualize how the system will operate, what the system will accomplish, and how the system will be implemented.  The old system's data flow diagrams can be drawn up and compared with the new system's data flow diagrams to draw comparisons to implement a more efficient system. Data flow diagrams can be used to provide the end user with a physical idea of where the data they input ultimately has an effect upon the structure of the whole system from order to dispatch to report. How any system is developed can be determined through a data flow diagram model.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

In the course of developing a set of ''levelled'' data flow diagrams the analyst/designer is forced to address how the system may be decomposed into component sub-systems, and to identify the [[transaction data]] in the [[data model]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}

Data flow diagrams can be used in both the Analysis and Design phases of the [[Systems development life cycle|SDLC]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}

There are  different notations to draw data flow diagrams (Yourdon &amp; Coad and [[Chris Gane (computer scientist)|Gane]] &amp; [[Trish Sarson|Sarson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Gane (computer scientist)|Chris Gane]] and [[Trish Sarson]]. ''Structured Systems Analysis: Tools and Techniques.'' McDonnell Douglas Systems Integration Company, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;), defining different visual representations for processes, data stores, data flow, and external entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartdraw.com/tutorials/software/dfd/tutorial_01.htm How to draw Data Flow Diagrams]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical vs. logical DFD===

A logical DFD captures the data flows that are necessary for a system to operate. It describes the processes that are undertaken, the data required and produced by each process, and the stores needed to hold the data. On the other hand, a physical DFD shows how the system is actually implemented, either at the moment (Current Physical DFD), or how the designer intends it to be in the future (Required Physical DFD). Thus, a Physical DFD may be used to describe the set of data items that appear on each piece of paper that move around an office, and the fact that a particular set of pieces of paper are stored together in a filing cabinet. It is quite possible that a Physical DFD will include references to data that are duplicated, or redundant, and that the data stores, if implemented as a set of [[database table]]s, would constitute an un-normalised (or de-normalised) relational database. In contrast, a Logical DFD attempts to capture the data flow aspects of a system in a form that has neither redundancy nor duplication.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

'''David Stephen Forbes''' (born November 16, 1948) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] retired professional [[ice hockey]] player.

Signed as a free agent in 1973 by the [[Boston Bruins]], Forbes made an impact as a defensive-minded forward as he helped guide the Bruins to the finals in 1974 during his rookie season, and to the finals in 1977. Forbes played four seasons with Boston until he was claimed by the [[Washington Capitals]] in the Waiver Draft prior to the 1977–78 season. After playing one season with the Capitals, he was released after only playing two games during the 1978–79 season and signed to play for the [[Cincinnati Stingers]] of the [[World Hockey Association]].

==Criminal charges==
Forbes was charged with [[aggravated assault]] in Minneapolis in 1975 after butt-ending [[Henry Boucha]]'s eye socket in a game against the Minnesota North Stars. The trial received much publicity as it was highly unusual for an athlete to face criminal charges for assault during a game. The trial ended with a hung jury; the charges were not refiled.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kennedy, "A nondecision begs the question," Sports Illustrated, July 28, 1975.  https://www.si.com/vault/1975/07/28/606678/a-nondecision-begs-the-question&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional term  ''[[print matrix]]'' is the physical surface from which an image is printed, [[Woodcut|woodblock]], plate, [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[Screen-printing|screen]].&lt;ref name="Wye_2004"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Wye |author-first1=Deborah |author-last2=Figura |author-first2=Starr |author-last3=Hecker |author-first3=Judith |date=2004-04-02 |title=Artists &amp; prints: Masterworks from the Museum of Modern Art, New York |publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]], New York; [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], London |isbn=978-0-87070125-2 |id={{ISBN|0-87070125-8}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these may in themselves be produced digitally they comprise a traditional (physical) matrix.

Conceptually as there is no need for this storage to be in the physical presence of the artist then [[online]] and remote storage (including the [[Internet]]) may form as a whole or in part the digital matrix.

'''Dosing''' generally applies to feeding [[chemical]]s or [[medicine]]s when used in small quantities.

For medicines the term ''[[dose (biochemistry)|dose]]'' is generally used. In the case of inanimate objects the word dosing is typical. The term '''dose titration''', referring to stepwise [[titration|adjustment]] of doses until a desired level of effect is reached, is common in [[medicine]].

==Engineering==
The word ''dosing'' is very commonly used by [[engineer]]s in thermal [[power stations]], in water treatment, in any industry where [[steam]] is being generated, and in [[building services]] for heating and cooling water treatment. Dosing procedures are also in vogue in [[textile]] and similar industries where chemical treatment is involved.

Commercial [[Swimming pool sanitation#Systems and disinfection methods|swimming pool]]s also require chemical dosing in order to control [[pH]] balance, [[chlorine]] level, and other such water quality criteria. Modern swimming pool plant will have bulk storage of chemicals held in separate '''dosing tanks''', and will have automated controls and '''dosing pumps''' to top up the various chemicals as required to control the water quality.

In a power station treatment chemicals are injected or fed to [[boiler]] and also to feed and make up water under [[pressure]], but in small dosages or rate of [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. The feeding at all places is done by means of small capacity dosing [[pump]]s specially designed for the duty demanded.

In building services the water quality of various pumped fluid systems, including for heating, cooling, and condensate water, will be regularly checked and topped up with chemicals manually as required to suit the required water quality. Most commonly [[Corrosion inhibitor|inhibitor]]s will be added to protect the pipework and components against corrosion, or a [[biocide]] will be added to stop the growth of bacteria in lower temperature systems. The required chemicals will be added to the fluid system by use of a '''dosing pot'''; a multi-valved chamber in which the chemical can be added, and then introduced to the fluid system in a controlled manner.

In food industries, the dosing of ingredients is particularly important in order to ensure the quality of the recipe as well as its food safety where the consumers' health may be directly implicated. Dosing is done in wet processes with dosing pumps but even more importantly in dry processes, just prior to the packaging of the product. Dosing of dry materials is commonly done through Gain-in-Weight dosing or Loss-in-Weight dosing using equipments on load cells.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powderprocess.net/Dosing.html Source on dosing principles for dry ingredients&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
The feeding of chemicals in [[agriculture]] has also become common due to technology developments. However agricultural dosing is done by means of hand held pressure spray pumps.

===Aerial spraying===
Sometimes aerial spraying of chemicals by fixed quantities at intervals or dosing is also adopted for agricultural spraying or for atmospheric spraying for eliminating certain types of harmful [[insect]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21529">'''Eco-costs''' are the costs of the environmental burden of a product on the basis of prevention of that burden. They are the costs which should be made to reduce the [[environmental pollution]] and [[Resource depletion|materials depletion]] in our world to a level which is in line with the [[carrying capacity]] of our earth.

For example: for each 1000&amp;nbsp;kg [[Greenhouse effect|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission]], one should invest €116,- in [[Offshore wind power|offshore windmill park]]s (plus in the other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction systems at that price or less). When this is done consequently, the total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in the world will be reduced by 65% compared to the emissions in 2008. As a result, global warming will stabilise. In short: "the eco-costs of 1000kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are € 116,-".

[[Image:Ecocosts system (new).png|center|thumb|upright=3|Fig 1: Calculation structure of the eco-costs 2012 and 2017.]]

Similar calculations can be made on the environmental burden of [[Ocean acidification|acidification]], [[eutrophication]], [[summer smog]], [[fine dust]], [[eco-toxicity]], and the use of metals, [[Rare-earth mineral|rare earth]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s, water and [[land consumption|land]] (nature).
As such, the eco-costs are '[[external costs]]', since they are not yet integrated in the real life costs of current production chains ([[Whole-life cost|Life Cycle Costs]]). The eco-costs should be regarded as hidden [[obligation]]s.

The eco-costs of a product are the sum of all eco-costs of emissions and use of resources during the life cycle "[[Cradle to Cradle Design|from cradle to cradle]]". The widely accepted method to make such a calculation is called [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA), which is basically a mass and energy balance, defined in the ISO 14040, and the ISO 14044 (for the building industry the EN 15804).

The practical use of eco-costs is to compare the [[sustainability]] of several product types with the same functionality. 
The advantage of eco-costs is that they are expressed in a standardized [[value (economics)|monetary value]] (€) which appears to be easily understood 'by instinct'. Also the calculation is transparent and relatively easy, compared to damage based models which have the disadvantage of extremely complex calculations with subjective weighting of the various aspects contributing to the overall environmental burden.&lt;ref&gt;M.

The system of eco-costs is part of the bigger model of the [[Eco-costs value ratio|ecocosts/value ratio, EVR]].&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Vogtländer;[http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b004.htm ''EVR, LCA-based assessment of sustainability''], VSSD, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the system has been updated, and published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Vogtländer; [http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b004.htm ''EVR, LCA-based assessment of sustainability''], VSSD, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The next updates were in 2012 and 2017. It is planned to update the system every 5 years to incorporate the latest developments in science.&lt;br /&gt; 
The concept of eco-costs has been made operational with general databases of the Delft University of Technology, and is described at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com].&lt;br /&gt; The method of the eco-costs is based on the sum of the marginal prevention costs (end of pipe as well as system integrated) for toxic emissions related to human health as well as ecosystems, emissions that cause [[global warming]], and [[resource depletion]] (metals, rare earths, fossil fuels, water, and land-use). For a visual display of the system see Figure 1.

Marginal prevention costs of toxic emissions are derived from the so-called prevention curve as depicted in Figure 2. The basic idea behind such a curve is that a country (or a group of countries, such as the European Union), must take prevention measures to reduce toxic emissions (more than one measure is required to reach the target). From the point of view of the economy, the cheapest measures (in terms of euro/kg) are taken first. At a certain point at the curve, the reduction of the emissions is sufficient to bring the concentration of the pollution below the so-called no-effect-level. The no-effect-level of {{CO2}} emissions is the level that the emissions and the natural absorption of the earth are in equilibrium again at a maximum temperature rise of 2 degrees C. The no-effect-level of a toxic emission is the level where the concentration in nature is well below the toxicity threshold (most natural toxic substances have a toxicity threshold, below which they might even have a beneficial effect), or below the natural background level. For human toxicity the '[[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]' is used.
The eco-costs are the marginal prevention costs of the last measure of the prevention curve to reach the no-effect-level. See the abovementioned references 4 and 8 for a full description of the calculation method (note that in the calculation 'classes' of emissions with the same 'midpoint' are combined, as explained below).

The classical way to calculate a 'single indicator' in LCA is based on the damage of the emissions. Pollutants are grouped in 'classes', multiplied by a 'characterisation' factor to account for their relative importance within a class, and totalised to the level of their 'midpoint' effect ([[Greenhouse effect|global warming]], [[Multi-effect Protocol|acidification]], nutrification, etc.). The classical problem is then to determine the relative importance of each midpoint effect. In damage based systems this is done by 'normalisation' (= comparison with the pollution in a country or a region) and 'weighting' (= giving each midpoint a weight, to take the relative importance into account) by an expert panel.

The calculation of the eco-costs is based on classification and characterisation tables as well (combining tables from IPCC ([http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html]), the [[USEtox]] model ([http://usetox.org usetox.org]), tables of the [[ILCD]] ([http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/LCIA-CF-20-02-2013-clean.pdf]), however has a different approach to the normalisation and weighting steps. Normalisation is done by calculating the marginal prevention costs for a region (i.e. the European Union), as described above. The weighting step is not required in the eco-costs system, since the total result is the sum of  the eco-costs of all midpoints.
The advantage of such a calculation is that the marginal prevention costs are related to the cost of the most expensive [[Best Available Technology]] which is needed to meet the target, and the corresponding level of  [[Emissions trading|Tradable Emission Rights]] which is required in future. From a business point of view, the eco-costs are the costs of non-compliance with future governmental regulations. Example from the past: NOx emissions of Volkswagen diesel.

The eco-costs have been calculated for the situation in the European Union. It is expected that the situation in some states in the USA, like California and Pennsylvania, give similar results. It might be argued that the eco-costs are also an indication of the marginal prevention costs for other parts of the globe, under the condition of a [[level playing field]] for production companies.

==Eco-costs 2017==
The method of the eco-costs 2017 (version 1.3) comprises tables of over 36.000 emissions, and has been made operational by special database for SimaPro: Idematapp 2018 and Idemat2018 (based on LCIs from Ecoinvent V3.4), Agri Footprint, and a database for CES (Cambridge Engineering Selector). Over 10.000 materials and processes are covered in total. Excel look-up tables are provided at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com].

For emissions of toxic substances, the following set of multipliers (marginal prevention costs) is used in the eco-costs 2017 system:
{|
|-
!eco-costs of!!equivalent
|-
|  acidification || 8.75 €/kg SOx equivalent
|-
| eutrophication|| 4.17 €/kg phosphate equivalent
|-
| ecotoxicity|| 55.0 €/kg Cu equivalent
|-
| human toxicity || 3754 €/kg Benzo(a)pyrene equivalent
|-
| summer smog (respiratory diseases)|| 10.38 €/kg C2H4 equivalent
|-
| fine dust|| 34.0 €/kg fine dust PM2.5

|-
| global warming  (GWP 100)|| 0.116 €/kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent
|}

The characterisation ('midpoint') tables which are applied in the eco-costs 2017 system, are recommended by the ILCD:&lt;ref&gt;Characterization factors of the ILCD Recommended Life Cycle Impact Assessment methods, ILCD [http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/LCIA-CF-20-02-2013-clean.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

* UNEP/SETAC 2016,&lt;ref&gt;Global Guidance for Life Cycle Impact assessment Indicators Volume 1, United Nations Environment Programme, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;, for fine dust PM2.5 (for PM10 the default factors are used of the ILCD Midpoint+)

In addition to abovementioned eco-costs for emissions, there is a set of eco-costs to characterize the 'midpoints' of resource depletion:
* eco-costs of abiotic scarcity (metals, including rare earth, and fossil fuels)
* eco-costs of land-use change (based on [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], of vascular plants and mammals, used for eco-costs of tropical hardwood)
* eco-costs of water scarcity (based on the midpoint Water Stress Indicator - WSI - of countries &lt;ref&gt;Boulay, Bulle, Bayart, Deschênes, and Margni; Regional Characterization of Freshwater Use in LCA: Modeling Direct Impacts on Human Health; Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 2011, 45, pp 8948 - 8957&lt;/ref&gt;)
* eco-costs of landfill

The abovementioned marginal prevention costs at midpoint level can be combined to 'endpoints' in three groups, plus global warming as a separate group:
{|
|-
| eco-costs of human health       ||= the sum of carcinogens, summer smog, fine dust
|-
| eco-costs of ecosystems         || = the sum of acidification, eutrophication, ecotoxicity
|-
| eco-costs of resource scarcity || = the sum of abiotic depletion, land-use, water, and land-fill
|-
| eco-costs of global warming     || = the sum of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases (the GWP 100 table) 
|-
| total eco-costs    || = the sum of human health, ecosystems, resource scarcity and global warming
|}

Since the endpoints have the same monetary unit (e.g. euro, dollar), they are added up to the total eco-costs without applying a 'subjective' weighting system. This is an advantage of the eco-costs system (see also ISO 14044 section 4.4.3.4 and 4.4.5). 
So called 'double counting' (ISO 14044 section 4.4.2.2.3) is avoided in the eco-costs system.

The eco-costs of global warming (also called eco-costs of carbon footprint) can be used as an indicator for the [[carbon footprint]]. The eco-costs of resource depletion can be regarded as an indicator for 'circularity' in the theory of the [[circular economy]]. However, it is advised to include human toxicity and eco-toxicity, and include the eco-costs of global warming in the calculations on the circular economy as well. The eco-costs of global warming are required to reveal the difference between fossil-based products and bio-based products, since biogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not counted in LCA (biogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is part of the natural recycle loop in the biosphere).
Therefore,  total eco-costs can be regarded as a robust indicator for [[cradle-to-cradle]] calculations in LCA for products and services in the theory of the circular economy.
Since the economic viability of a business model is also an important aspect of the circular economy, the added value of a product-service system should be part of the analysis. This requires the two dimensional approach of Eco-efficient Value Creation &lt;ref&gt;Joost G. Vogtländer, A. Mestre, R. van der Helm, A. Scheepens and R. Wever; [http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b021.htm ''Eco-efficient Value creation, sustainable design and business strategies''], VSSD, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as described at the Wikipedia page on the model of the [[eco-costs value ratio|ecocosts/value ratio]], EVR.

The Delft University of Technology has developed a single indicator for S-LCA as well, the so-called s-eco-costs, to incorporate the sometimes appalling working conditions in production chains (e.g. production of garments, mining of metals). Aspects are the low [[List of minimum wages by country|minimum wages in developing countries]] (the "[[living wage|fair wage]] deficit"), the aspects of "[[child labour]]" and [[extreme poverty]]", the aspect of "excessive working hours", and the aspect of "OSH ([[Occupational Safety and Health]])". The s-eco-costs system has been published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.&lt;ref&gt;Natascha M. van der Velden and Joost G. Vogtländer; Monetisation of external socio-economic costs of industrial production: A social-LCA-based case of clothing production; Journal of Cleaner Production, 2017, 153, pp 320 - 330&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention costs versus damage costs==
Prevention measures will decrease the costs of the damage, related to environmental pollution. The damage costs are in most cases the same (or a bit higher) compared to the prevention costs. So the total effect of prevention measures on our society is that it results in a better environment at no extra costs.

==Discussion==
There are many 'single indicators' for LCA. Basically, they fall into three categories:
* single issue
* damage based
* prevention based

The best known 'single issue' indicator is the [[carbon footprint]]: the total emissions of kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''equivalent'' (taking methane and some other [[greenhouse gas]]ses into account as well). The advantage of a single issue indicator is, that its calculation is simple and transparent, without any complex assumptions. It is easy as well to communicate to the public. The disadvantage is that is ignores the problems caused by other pollutants and it is not suitable for cradle-to-cradle calculations (because materials depletion is not taken into account).&lt;br /&gt;
The most common single indicators are damage based. This stems from the period of the 1990s, when LCA was developed to make people aware of the damage of production and consumption. The advantage of damage based single indicators is, that they make people aware of the fact that they should consume less, and make companies aware that they should produce cleaner. The disadvantage is that these damage based systems are very complex, not transparent for others than who make the computer calculations, need many assumptions, and suffer from the subjective weighting procedure as last step at the end. Communication of the result is not easy, since the result is expressed in 'points' (attempts to express the results in money were never very successful, because of methodological flaws and uncertainties). The most recent endpoint indicators avoid the last step to a single indicator: UseTOX 2 and ReCiPe 2016, resulting in 2 respectively 3 endpoints (human health, ecosystems and resources separately).&lt;br /&gt;
Prevention based indicators, like the system of the eco-costs, are relatively new. The advantage, in comparison to the damage based systems, is that the calculations are relatively easy and transparent, and that the  results can be explained in terms of money and in measures to be taken. The system is focused on the decision taking processes of architects, business people, designers and engineers. The advantage is that it provides 1 single endpoint in euro's. The disadvantage is that the system is not focused on the fact that people should consume less.

The eco-costs are calculated for the situation of the European Union, but are applicable worldwide under the assumption of a level playing field for business, and under the precautionary principle. There are two other prevention based systems, developed after the introduction of the eco-costs, which are based on the local circumstances of a specific country:
* In the Netherlands, 'shadow prices' have been developed in 2004 by TNO/MEP on basis of a local prevention curve: it are the costs of the most expensive prevention measure required by the Dutch government for each midpoint.  It is obvious that such costs are relevant for the local companies, but such a shadow price system doesn't have any meaning outside the Netherlands, since it is not based on the no-effect-level
* In Japan, a group of universities have developed a set of data for maximum abatement costs (MAC, similar to the midpoint multipliers of the eco-costs as given in the previous section), for the Japanese conditions. The development of the MAC method started in 2002 and has been published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Tosihiro Oka, Masanobu Ishikawa, Yoshifumi Fujii, Gjalt Huppes; Calculating Cost-effectiveness for Activities with Multiple Environmental Effects Using the Maximum Abatement Cost Method; Journal of Industrial Ecology, Volume 9, Issue 4, pages 97–103, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called avoidable abatement cost (AAC) in this method is comparable to the eco-costs.

[[File:Emmert experiment.jpg|thumb|Emmert's perceptual experiment]]
The '''Emmert experiment''' is a perceptual experiment by psychologist [[Emil Emmert]] (1844–1911). The experiment is based on the size constancy.

==Principles==
Besides localization and recognition, there is another function of our sensory system: the size of the objects remain constant in spite of the changes of the image perceived our retina. Thanks to evolution we experience the objects as they really are and not as our eyes perceives them. We usually perceive object as being relatively constant, irrespective of the light conditions, our point of view or the distance between the object and us.

Our cars do not seem to be bigger even if we are approaching them, their form do not become more distorted, their colour does not change even if we apply artificial lighting. This phenomenon is called perceptual constancy.

The most studied constancy is the size constancy, or the phenomenon as when we perceive the constant size of the objects independently to their distance. As an object moves farther away, their perceived size usually does not decrease as we are looking at them.

==Example==
Hold a coin in front of you, 30 centimeters away from you and then move it at arm’s length. Does the coin seem smaller? Obviously not, but the size of the retinal image of the coin is two times bigger than the retinal image of the coin when it was 30 centimeters  away.

In the Emmert experiment, we keep a book in front of us within normal reading distance, with good light conditions. Fixate our look into the middle of the object for 1 minute and look to a wall further away. We can see the post-images of the two circles that seem to be bigger than the stimulus. Now let’s look at a paper close to our eyes. The post-image is smaller than the stimulus. If the post-image disappears it can be restored by blinking.

When a [[test particle|test electric charge]] is placed in this electric field, the particle accelerates due to a force. Physicists have found the notion of a field to be of such practical utility for the analysis of forces that they have come to think of a force as due to a field.&lt;ref name=Feynman102&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard P. Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman| year=1970 |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern framework of the [[quantum theory of fields]], even without referring to a test particle, a field occupies space, contains energy, and its presence precludes a classical "true vacuum".&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;{{cite book |author=John Archibald Wheeler|title=Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics.|publisher=Norton|location=London|year=1998|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This led physicists to consider [[electromagnetic field]]s to be a physical entity, making the field concept a supporting [[paradigm]] of the edifice of modern physics. "The fact that the electromagnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes it very real ... a particle makes a field, and a field acts on another particle, and the field has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum, just as particles can have."&lt;ref name=Feynman110&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard P. Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman| year=1970 |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the strength of most fields has been found to diminish with distance to the point of being undetectable. For instance the strength of many relevant classical fields, such as the gravitational field in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's theory of gravity]] or the [[electrostatic field]] in classical electromagnetism, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (i.e., they follow [[Gauss's law]]). One consequence is that the Earth's gravitational field quickly becomes undetectable on cosmic scales.

A field can be classified as a [[scalar field]], a [[vector field]], a [[spinor|spinor field]] or a [[tensor field]] according to whether the represented physical quantity is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], a [[spinor]], or a [[tensor]], respectively. A field has a unique tensorial character in every point where it is defined: i.e. a field cannot be a scalar field somewhere and a vector field somewhere else. For example, the [[Newtonian gravity|Newtonian]] [[gravitational field]] is a vector field: specifying its value at a point in spacetime requires three numbers, the components of the gravitational field vector at that point. Moreover, within each category (scalar, vector, tensor), a field can be either a ''classical field'' or a ''quantum field'', depending on whether it is characterized by numbers or [[operator (physics)|quantum operators]] respectively. In fact in this theory an equivalent representation of field is a [[field particle]], namely a [[boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steven Weinberg |journal=New York Review of Books |date=November 7, 2013 |title=Physics: What We Do and Don’t Know |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/nov/07/physics-what-we-do-and-dont-know/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
To [[Isaac Newton]], his [[law of universal gravitation]] simply expressed the gravitational [[force]] that acted between any pair of massive objects. When looking at the motion of many bodies all interacting with each other, such as the planets in the [[Solar System]], dealing with the force between each pair of bodies separately rapidly becomes computationally inconvenient. In the eighteenth century, a new quantity was devised to simplify the bookkeeping of all these gravitational forces. This quantity, the [[gravitational field]], gave at each point in space the total gravitational acceleration which would be felt by a small object at that point. This did not change the physics in any way: it did not matter if all the gravitational forces on an object were calculated individually and then added together, or if all the contributions were first added together as a gravitational field and then applied to an object.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977&gt;{{cite journal
|title=The Search for Unity: Notes for a History of Quantum Field Theory

|jstor=20024506
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the independent concept of a field truly began in the nineteenth century with the development of the theory of [[electromagnetism]]. In the early stages, [[André-Marie Ampère]] and [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] could manage with Newton-style laws that expressed the forces between pairs of [[electric charge]]s or [[electric current]]s. However, it became much more natural to take the field approach and express these laws in terms of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s; in 1849 [[Michael Faraday]] became the first to coin the term "field".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977/&gt;

The independent nature of the field became more apparent with [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s discovery that [[electromagnetic wave|waves in these fields]] propagated at a finite speed. Consequently, the forces on charges and currents no longer just depended on the positions and velocities of other charges and currents at the same time, but also on their positions and velocities in the past.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977/&gt;

Maxwell, at first, did not adopt the modern concept of a field as a fundamental quantity that could independently exist. Instead, he supposed that the [[electromagnetic field]] expressed the deformation of some underlying medium—the [[luminiferous aether]]—much like the tension in a rubber membrane. If that were the case, the observed velocity of the electromagnetic waves should depend upon the velocity of the observer with respect to the aether. Despite much effort, no experimental evidence of such an effect was ever found; the situation was resolved by the introduction of the [[special theory of relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905. This theory changed the way the viewpoints of moving observers were related to each other.  They became related to each other in such a way that velocity of electromagnetic waves in Maxwell's theory would be the same for all observers. By doing away with the need for a background medium, this development opened the way for physicists to start thinking about fields as truly independent entities.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977/&gt;

In the late 1920s, the new rules of [[quantum mechanics]] were first applied to the electromagnetic fields. In 1927, [[Paul Dirac]] used [[quantum field]]s to successfully explain how the decay of an [[atom]] to a lower [[quantum state]] lead to the [[spontaneous emission]] of a [[photon]], the quantum of the electromagnetic field. This was soon followed by the realization (following the work of [[Pascual Jordan]], [[Eugene Wigner]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and [[Wolfgang Pauli]]) that all particles, including [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s, could be understood as the quanta of some quantum field, elevating fields to the status of the most fundamental objects in nature.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977/&gt; That said, [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] and [[Richard Feynman]] seriously considered Newton's pre-field concept of [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]] (although they set it aside because of the ongoing utility of the field concept for research in [[general relativity]] and [[quantum electrodynamics]]).

==Classical fields==
{{Main|Classical field theory}}
There are several examples of [[Classical field theory|classical fields]]. Classical field theories remain useful wherever quantum properties do not arise, and can be active areas of research. [[Elasticity (physics)|Elasticity]] of materials, [[fluid dynamics]] and [[Maxwell's equations]] are cases in point.

Some of the simplest physical fields are vector force fields. Historically, the first time that fields were taken seriously was with [[Michael Faraday|Faraday's]] [[lines of force]] when describing the [[electric field]]. The [[gravitational field]] was then similarly described.

===Newtonian gravitation===
[[File:Newtonian gravity field (physics).svg|thumb|upright|In [[classical gravitation]], mass is the source of an attractive [[gravitational field]] '''g'''.]]
A classical field theory describing gravity is [[gravitation|Newtonian gravitation]], which describes the gravitational force as a mutual interaction between two [[mass]]es.

Any body with mass ''M'' is associated with a [[gravitational field]] '''g''' which describes its influence on other bodies with mass. The gravitational field of ''M'' at a point '''r''' in space corresponds to the ratio between force '''F''' that ''M'' exerts on a small or negligible [[test mass]] ''m'' located at '''r''' and the test mass itself:&lt;ref name="kleppner85"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|first1=Daniel|last2=Kolenkow|first2=Robert|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
Stipulating that ''m'' is much smaller than ''M'' ensures that the presence of ''m'' has a negligible influence on the behavior of ''M''.

According to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], '''F'''('''r''') is given by&lt;ref name="kleppner85" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{G M m}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unit vector]] lying along the line joining ''M'' and ''m'' and pointing from ''m'' to ''M''. Therefore, the gravitational field of '''M''' is&lt;ref name="kleppner85" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})}{m} = -\frac{G M}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal [[equivalence principle#Tests of the weak equivalence principle|to an unprecedented level of accuracy]] leads to the identity that gravitational field strength is identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the [[equivalence principle]], which leads to [[general relativity]].

Because the gravitational force '''F''' is [[conservative field|conservative]], the gravitational field '''g''' can be rewritten in terms of the [[gradient]] of a scalar function, the [[gravitational potential]] Φ('''r'''):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = -\nabla \Phi(\mathbf{r}).&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetism===
{{Main|Electromagnetism}}
[[Michael Faraday]] first realized the importance of a field as a physical quantity, during his investigations into [[magnetism]]. He realized that [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields are not only fields of force which dictate the motion of particles, but also have an independent physical reality because they carry energy.

These ideas eventually led to the creation, by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], of the first unified field theory in physics with the introduction of equations for the [[electromagnetic field]]. The modern version of these equations is called [[Maxwell's equations]].

====Electrostatics====
{{Main|Electrostatics}}

A [[test charge|charged test particle]] with charge ''q'' experiences a force '''F''' based solely on its charge. We can similarly describe the [[electric field]] '''E''' so that {{nowrap|'''F''' {{=}} ''q'''''E'''}}. Using this and [[Coulomb's law]] tells us that the electric field due to a single charged particle is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The electric field is [[conservative field|conservative]], and hence can be described by a scalar potential, ''V''('''r'''):
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = -\nabla V(\mathbf{r}).&lt;/math&gt;

====Magnetostatics====
{{Main|Magnetostatics}}

A steady current ''I'' flowing along a path ''ℓ'' will exert a force on nearby moving charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. The force exerted by ''I'' on a nearby charge ''q'' with velocity '''v''' is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = q\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}),&lt;/math&gt;
where '''B'''('''r''') is the [[magnetic field]], which is determined from ''I'' by the [[Biot–Savart law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int \frac{d\boldsymbol{\ell} \times d\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. However, it can be written in terms of a [[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]], '''A'''('''r'''):
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;

'''Bottom right:''' '''B''' field due to a pure [[magnetic dipole moment]] '''m''' found in ordinary matter (''not'' from monopoles).]]

====Electrodynamics====
{{Main|Electrodynamics}}

In general, in the presence of both a charge density ρ('''r''', ''t'') and current density '''J'''('''r''', ''t''), there will be both an electric and a magnetic field, and both will vary in time. They are determined by [[Maxwell's equations]], a set of differential equations which directly relate '''E''' and '''B''' to ρ and '''J'''.&lt;ref name="griffiths326"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, one can describe the system in terms of its scalar and vector potentials ''V'' and '''A'''. A set of integral equations known as ''[[retarded potential]]s'' allow one to calculate ''V'' and '''A''' from ρ and '''J''',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is contingent on the correct choice of [[gauge fixing|gauge]]. ''V'' and '''A''' are not completely determined by ρ and '''J'''; rather, they are only determined up to some scalar function ''f''('''r''', ''t'') known as the gauge. The retarded potential formalism requires one to choose the [[Lorenz gauge]].&lt;/ref&gt; and from there the electric and magnetic fields are determined via the relations&lt;ref name="wangsness469"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wangsness|first=Roald|title=Electromagnetic Fields|edition=2nd|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = -\boldsymbol{\nabla} V - \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the [[electromagnetic field]] was understood as a collection of two vector fields in space. Nowadays, one recognizes this as a single antisymmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in spacetime.

[[File:em monopoles.svg|size=250|thumb|right| The [[electric field|'''E''' fields]] and [[magnetic field|'''B''' fields]] due to [[electric charge]]s (black/white) and [[magnet|magnetic poles]] (red/blue).&lt;ref name="Mc Graw Hill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Mansfield, C. O’Sullivan 2011"/&gt; '''E''' fields due to stationary electric charges and '''B''' fields due to stationary [[magnetic monopole|magnetic charges]] (note in nature N and S monopoles do not exist). In motion ([[velocity]] '''v'''), an ''electric'' charge induces a '''B''' field while a ''magnetic'' charge (not found in nature) would induce an '''E''' field. [[Conventional current]] is used.]]

===Gravitation in general relativity===
[[File:Relativistic gravity field (physics).svg|350px|left|thumb|In [[general relativity]], mass-energy warps space time ([[Einstein tensor]] '''G'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gravitation|author1=J.A.

Ciufolini |author2=J.A. Wheeler |publisher=Princeton Physics Series|year=1995|isbn=0-691-03323-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Einstein's theory of gravity, called [[general relativity]], is another example of a field theory. Here the principal field is the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], a symmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in [[spacetime]]. This replaces [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

===Waves as fields===
[[Wave]]s can be constructed as physical fields, due to their [[speed of light|finite propagation speed]] and [[causality|causal nature]] when a simplified [[physical model]] of an [[Physical system#The concept of closed systems in physics|isolated closed system]] is set {{clarify|date=March 2013}}. They are also subject to the [[inverse-square law]].

For electromagnetic waves, there are [[optical field]]s, and terms such as [[Near and far field|near- and far-field]] limits for diffraction. In practice though, the field theories of optics are superseded by the electromagnetic field theory of Maxwell.

==Quantum fields==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Kip Thorne]] --&gt;
{{main|Quantum field theory}}
It is now believed that [[quantum mechanics]] should underlie all physical phenomena, so that a classical field theory should, at least in principle, permit a recasting in quantum mechanical terms; success yields the corresponding [[quantum field theory]]. For example, [[Quantization (physics)|quantizing]] [[classical electrodynamics]] gives [[quantum electrodynamics]]. Quantum electrodynamics is arguably the most successful scientific theory; [[experiment]]al [[data]] confirm its predictions to a higher [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] (to more [[significant digit]]s) than any other theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Peskin |first1=Michael E. |last2=Schroeder |first2=Daniel V. |title=An Introduction to Quantum Fields |page=198 |year=1995 |publisher= Westview Press |isbn=0-201-50397-2|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}. Also see [[precision tests of QED]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The two other fundamental quantum field theories are [[quantum chromodynamics]] and the [[electroweak theory]].

[[File:Qcd fields field (physics).svg|400px|right|thumb|Fields due to [[color charge]]s, like in [[quark]]s ('''G''' is the [[gluon field strength tensor]]). These are "colorless" combinations. '''Top:''' Color charge has "ternary neutral states" as well as binary neutrality (analogous to [[electric charge]]). '''Bottom:''' The quark/antiquark combinations.&lt;ref name="Mc Graw Hill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Mansfield, C. O’Sullivan 2011"/&gt;]]

In quantum chromodynamics, the color field lines are coupled at short distances by [[gluon]]s, which are polarized by the field and line up with it. This effect increases within a short distance (around 1 [[femtometre|fm]] from the vicinity of the quarks) making the color force increase within a short distance, [[Color confinement|confining the quarks]] within [[hadron]]s. As the field lines are pulled together tightly by gluons, they do not "bow" outwards as much as an electric field between electric charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles|edition=2nd|author1=R. Resnick |author2=R. Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1985|page=684|isbn=978-0-471-87373-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These three quantum field theories can all be derived as special cases of the so-called [[standard model]] of [[particle physics]]. [[General relativity]], the Einsteinian field theory of gravity, has yet to be successfully quantized. However an extension, [[thermal field theory]], deals with quantum field theory at ''finite temperatures'', something seldom considered in quantum field theory.

In [[BRST formalism|BRST theory]] one deals with odd fields, e.g. [[Faddeev–Popov ghost]]s. There are different descriptions of odd classical fields both on [[graded manifold]]s and [[supermanifold]]s.

As above with classical fields, it is possible to approach their quantum counterparts from a purely mathematical view using similar techniques as before. The equations governing the quantum fields are in fact PDEs (specifically, [[relativistic wave equations]] (RWEs)). Thus one can speak of [[Yang–Mills field|Yang–Mills]], [[Dirac field|Dirac]], [[Klein–Gordon field|Klein–Gordon]] and [[Schrödinger field]]s as being solutions to their respective equations. A possible problem is that these RWEs can deal with complicated [[mathematical objects]] with exotic algebraic properties (e.g. [[spinors]] are not [[tensors]], so may need calculus over [[spinor field]]s), but these in theory can still be subjected to analytical methods given appropriate [[Generalization (mathematics)|mathematical generalization]].

==Field theory==
Field theory usually refers to a construction of the dynamics of a field, i.e. a specification of how a field changes with time or with respect to other independent physical variables on which the field depends.  Usually this is done by writing a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] or a [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the field, and treating it as a [[classical mechanics|classical]] or [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] system with an infinite number of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. The resulting field theories are referred to as classical or quantum field theories.

The dynamics of a classical field are usually specified by the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] in terms of the field components; the dynamics can be obtained by using the [[Action (physics)|action principle]].

It is possible to construct simple fields without any prior knowledge of physics using only mathematics from [[multivariable calculus|several variable calculus]], [[potential theory]] and [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs). For example, scalar PDEs might consider quantities such as amplitude, density and pressure fields for the wave equation and [[fluid dynamics]]; temperature/concentration fields  for the [[heat equation|heat]]/[[diffusion equation]]s. Outside of physics proper (e.g., radiometry and computer graphics), there are even [[light fields]]. All these previous examples are [[scalar fields]]. Similarly for vectors, there are vector PDEs for displacement, velocity and vorticity fields in (applied mathematical) fluid dynamics, but vector calculus may now be needed in addition, being calculus over [[vector fields]] (as are these three quantities, and those for vector PDEs in general). More generally problems in [[continuum mechanics]] may involve for example, directional [[elasticity tensor|elasticity]] (from which comes the term ''tensor'', derived from the [[Latin]] word for stretch), [[complex fluid]] flows or [[anisotropic diffusion]], which are framed as matrix-tensor PDEs, and then require matrices or tensor fields, hence [[matrix calculus|matrix]] or [[tensor calculus]]. It should be noted that the scalars (and hence the vectors, matrices and tensors) can be real or complex as both are [[field (algebra)|fields]] in the abstract-algebraic/[[ring theory|ring-theoretic]] sense.

In a general setting, classical fields are described by sections of [[fiber bundle]]s and their dynamics is formulated in the terms of [[jet bundle|jet manifolds]] ([[covariant classical field theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Giachetta, G., Mangiarotti, L., [[Gennadi Sardanashvily|Sardanashvily, G.]] (2009) ''Advanced Classical Field Theory''. Singapore: World Scientific, {{ISBN|978-981-283-895-7}} ([http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0811.0331 arXiv: 0811.0331v2])&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[modern physics]], the most often studied fields are those that model the four [[fundamental forces]] which one day may lead to the [[Unified Field Theory]].

===Symmetries of fields=== &lt;!-- the article [[Standard Model (mathematical formulation)]] links here --&gt;
A convenient way of classifying a field (classical or quantum) is by the [[Symmetry in physics|symmetries]] it possesses. Physical symmetries are usually of two types:

====Spacetime symmetries====
{{main|Global symmetry|Spacetime symmetries}}

Fields are often classified by their behaviour under transformations of [[spacetime]]. The terms used in this classification are:
* [[scalar field]]s (such as [[temperature]]) whose values are given by a single variable at each point of space. This value does not change under transformations of space.
* [[vector field]]s (such as the magnitude and direction of the [[force (physics)|force]] at each point in a [[magnetic field]]) which are specified by attaching a vector to each point of space. The components of this vector transform between themselves [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariantly]] under rotations in space. Similarly, a dual (or co-) vector field attaches a dual vector to each point of space, and the components of each dual vector transform covariantly.
* [[tensor field]]s, (such as the [[Stress (physics)|stress tensor]] of a crystal) specified by a tensor at each point of space. Under rotations in space, the components of the tensor transform in a more general way which depends on the number of covariant indices and contravariant indices.
* [[spinor field]]s (such as the [[Dirac spinor]]) arise in [[quantum field theory]] to describe particles with [[spin (physics)|spin]] which transform like vectors except for the one of their component; in other words, when one rotates a vector field 360 degrees around a specific axis, the vector field turns to itself; however, spinors would turn to their negatives in the same case.

====Internal symmetries====
{{main|Internal symmetry}}
Fields may have internal symmetries in addition to spacetime symmetries. In many situations, one needs fields which are a list of space-time scalars: (φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... φ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;). For example, in weather prediction these may be temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. In [[particle physics]], the [[color charge|color]] symmetry of the interaction of [[quark]]s is an example of an internal symmetry, that of the [[strong interaction]]. Other examples are [[isospin]], [[weak isospin]], [[strangeness]] and any other [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] symmetry.

If there is a symmetry of the problem, not involving spacetime, under which these components transform into each other, then this set of symmetries is called an ''internal symmetry''. One may also make a classification of the charges of the fields under internal symmetries.

===Statistical field theory===
{{main|Statistical field theory}}

Statistical field theory attempts to extend the field-theoretic [[paradigm]] toward many-body  systems and [[statistical mechanics]]. As above, it can be approached by the usual infinite number of degrees of freedom argument.

Much like statistical mechanics has some overlap between quantum and classical mechanics, statistical field theory has links to both quantum and classical field theories, especially the former with which it shares many methods. One important example is [[mean field theory]].

===Continuous random fields===
Classical fields as above, such as the [[electromagnetic field]], are usually infinitely differentiable functions, but they are in any case almost always twice differentiable. In contrast, [[generalized functions]] are not continuous. When dealing carefully with classical fields at finite temperature, the mathematical methods of continuous random fields are used, because [[Thermal fluctuations|thermally fluctuating]] classical fields are [[nowhere differentiable]]. [[Random field]]s are indexed sets of [[random variable]]s; a continuous random field is a random field that has a set of functions as its index set. In particular, it is often mathematically convenient to take a continuous random field to have a [[Schwartz space]] of functions as its index set, in which case the continuous random field is a [[Distribution (mathematics)|tempered distribution]].

We can think about a continuous random field, in a (very) rough way, as an ordinary function that is &lt;math&gt;\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere, but such that when we take a [[weighted average]] of all the [[infinity|infinities]] over any finite region, we get a finite result. The infinities are not well-defined; but the finite values can be associated with the functions used as the weight functions to get the finite values, and that can be well-defined. We can define a continuous random field well enough as a [[linear map]] from a space of functions into the [[real number]]s.

'''Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada''' ('''FINTRAC''') gathers, analyzes, assesses, and discloses [[financial intelligence]].  Originally created in July 2000 to counter suspected [[money laundering]], FINTRAC's mandate was expanded in December 2001 to provide the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS) with information on [[terrorist financing]] that threaten the security of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fintrac.gc.ca/fintrac-canafe/1_e.asp|title=FINTRAC - Who We Are|accessdate=2006-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FINTRAC was established under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, which was amended in December, 2001 to become the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA). FINTRAC's mandate was further amended in 2006 under Bill C-25&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/39-1/C-25/?page=4|title=Bill C-25 (Historical) {{!}} openparliament.ca|website=openparliament.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enhance the client identification, record-keeping and reporting measures, established a registration regime for money services businesses and foreign exchange dealers, and created new offences for not registering.

The Director of FINTRAC reports to the Minister of Finance.

FINTRAC receives information from regulated entities on:

* Suspicious transactions

In 2009, FINTRAC estimated that  the amount of money laundered on an annual basis is somewhere between $5 and  $15 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-005-x/2011001/article/11454-eng.htm#a1|title=Money laundering in Canada, 2009|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Suspicious transactions are financial transactions that there are reasonable grounds to suspect are related to the commission of a money laundering offence. Since June 12, 2002, suspicious transactions also include financial transactions that there are reasonable grounds to suspect are related to the commission of a terrorist activity financing offence. Suspicious transactions must be reported by financial entities (banks and financial dealers),  money services businesses, life insurance companies and agents, certain government agencies that take deposits (such as Canada Post), accountants or accounting firms,  real estate agents and brokers, and casinos.

In the mathematical discipline of [[category theory]], the '''Freyd cover''' or '''scone category''' is a construction that yields a set-like construction out of a given category.  The only requirement is that the original category has a terminal object.  The scone category inherits almost any categorical construct the original category has.  Scones can be used to generally describe proofs that use [[logical relations]].

==Definition==
Formally, the scone of a category ''C'' with a terminal object 1 is the [[comma category]] &lt;math&gt;1_\text{Set} \downarrow \operatorname{Hom}_C(1,-)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=Freyd+cover|title=Freyd cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Heart of Darkness''''' (1899) is a [[novella]] by Polish-English novelist [[Joseph Conrad]] about a narrated voyage up the [[Congo River]] into the [[Congo Free State]] in the so-called ''heart of Africa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/topic/Heart-of-Darkness Heart of Darkness Novella by Conrad] – ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 2 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Marlow]], the narrator, tells his story to friends aboard a boat anchored on the [[River Thames]]. This setting provides the [[frame story|frame]] for Marlow's story of his obsession with the ivory trader [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]], which enables Conrad to create a parallel between what Conrad calls "the greatest town on earth", [[London]], and Africa as places of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Chinua Achebe "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''" in ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol. 2 (7th edition) (2000), p. 2036.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Conrad's work is the idea that there is little difference between so-called civilised people and those described as savages; ''Heart of Darkness'' raises questions about [[imperialism]] and racism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology'', 7th edition, (2000), p. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally issued as a three-part serial story in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' to celebrate the thousandth edition of the magazine,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Scotland: Blackwoods magazine exhibition.  In Blackwood's, the story is titled "The Heart of Darkness" but when published as a separate book the "The" was dropped from the title.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heart of Darkness'' has been widely re-published and translated into many languages. In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Heart of Darkness'' 67th on their list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best novels]] in English of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html 100 Best] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207224252/http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html |date=7 February 2010 }}, Modern Library's website.

==Composition and publication==
In 1890, at the age of 32, Conrad was appointed by a Belgian trading company to serve on one of its [[Steamboat|steamers]]. While sailing up the [[Congo River]] from one station to another, the captain became ill and Conrad assumed command. He guided the ship up the [[tributary]] [[Lualaba River]] to the trading company's innermost station, [[Kindu]], in [[Maniema|Eastern Kongo]]. The story's main narrator, Charles Marlow, has similar experiences to the author himself.&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Conrad.PNG|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Conrad]] based ''Heart of Darkness'' on his own experiences in the [[Congo Basin|Congo]].]]
When Conrad began to write the novella, eight years after returning from Africa, he drew inspiration from his travel journals.&lt;ref name="Bloom"/&gt; He described ''Heart of Darkness'' as "a wild story" of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the (African) interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of savages. Thus described, the subject seems comic, but isn't.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale was first published as a three-part serial, February, March and April 1899, in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' (February 1899 was the magazine's 1000th issue: special edition). Then later, in 1902, ''Heart of Darkness'' was included in the book ''[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories|Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories]]'' (published on 13 November 1902, by [[William Blackwood]]).

The volume consisted of ''[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth: a Narrative]]'', ''Heart of Darkness'' and ''The End of the Tether'' in that order. For future editions of the book, in 1917 Conrad wrote an "[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories/Author's Note|Author's Note]]" where he, after denying any "unity of artistic purpose" underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories, and makes light commentary on the character Marlow—the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He also mentions how ''Youth'' marks the first appearance of Marlow.

On 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of Heart of Darkness where the interview of the man and the girl locks in—as it were—the whole 30000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. [[Georges-Antoine Klein]], an agent who became ill and later died aboard Conrad's steamer, has been identified by scholars and literary critics as one basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous "rear column" of the [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition]] have also been identified as likely sources, including column leader [[Edmund Musgrave Barttelot]], slave trader [[Tippu Tip]] and the expedition's overall leader, Welsh explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ho"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1998 |isbn=0-395-75924-2 |pages=98, 145 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYo-DO4tr-gC&amp;pg=PA98 |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Hochschild]], in ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'', believes that the Belgian soldier [[Léon Rom]] is the most important influence on the character.&lt;ref&gt;Ankomah, Baffour (October 1999).

==Plot summary==
Aboard the ''Nellie'', anchored in the [[River Thames]] near [[Gravesend]], England, Charles Marlow tells his fellow sailors about the events that led to his appointment as captain of a river steamboat for an [[Ivory trade|ivory trading]] company. As a child, Marlow had been fascinated by "the blank spaces" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into "a place of darkness" (Conrad 10). Yet there remained a big river, "resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land" (Conrad 10). The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow "as a snake would a bird" (Conrad 10). Feeling as though "instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior (Conrad 18). After more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of the government near the mouth of the big river. Marlow, with still some two hundred miles to go, now takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede. He departs some thirty miles up the river where his Company's station is. Work on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives. Marlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in "the gloomy circle of some Inferno": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now await their deaths, their sickened bodies already as thin as air (Conrad 24–25). Marlow witnesses the scene "horror-struck" (Conrad 26).

Marlow has to wait for ten days in the Company's Outer Station, where he sleeps in a hut. At this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the Company's impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]], who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a "'very remarkable person'" who "'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together'" (Conrad 28). The agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: "'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above—the Council in Europe, you know—mean him to be'" (Conrad 29).

[[File:VingtAnnees 289.jpg|thumb|Belgian river station on the Congo River, 1889]]

Marlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot some two hundred miles into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based. On the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees, and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat had been wrecked in a mysterious accident two days earlier. He meets the general manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved, and rumours had one important station in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional Mr. Kurtz, was ill. "Hang Kurtz", Marlow thinks, irritated (Conrad 34). He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives. While one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station's brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks. Marlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him, and is curious to know what kind of information he is after. Hanging on the wall is "a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch" (Conrad 39). Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that Mr. Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago. The brick-maker calls Kurtz "'a prodigy'" and "'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress'", and feels Kurtz represents the "'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose'" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with (Conrad 39). The man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: "'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you'" (Conrad 39–40).

Marlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the necessary repairs, made all the slower by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station. During this time, he learns that Kurtz is far from admired, but more or less resented (mostly by the manager).

Once underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months to the day. The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.

[[File:VingtAnnees 286.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''Roi des Belges'' ("King of the Belgians"—French), the Belgian riverboat Conrad commanded on the upper Congo, 1889]]
The journey pauses for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station. In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour. A few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim (Marlow's word for the European hangers-on in the steamer) watch the helmsman die. In a flash forward, Marlow notes that the [[International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs]] had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads "Exterminate all the brutes!" (Conrad 83).

At Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The man from the bank boards the steamboat, and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp. He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life, and justice, and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind, and seems to admire him even for his power—and for his willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.

From the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher, and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer. When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the Company's business in the region, that his methods are "unsound". Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the Company wants to remove him from the station and kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.

[[File:LeonRom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Léon Rom]], photographed {{circa}} 1880, who some have argued served as the inspiration for Kurtz]]
After midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.

Kurtz's health worsens on the return trip, and Marlow himself becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and, while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper: "The horror! The horror!" (Conrad 116). A short while later, the "manager's boy" announces to the rest of the crew, in a scathing tone, "Mistah Kurtz—he dead" (Conrad 117). The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury "something" in a muddy hole (Conrad 117). He falls very ill, himself near death.

Upon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the "civilised" world. Many callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He then gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fiancée, whom Kurtz referred to as "My Intended" (Conrad 79). When Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Uncomfortable, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.

==Reception==
Literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] wrote that ''Heart of Darkness'' had been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's "unique propensity for ambiguity". However, it was not a big success during Conrad's life.&lt;ref name="Bloom2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two more novellas, "Youth" and "The End of the Tether", it received the least commentary from critics.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; [[F. R. Leavis]] referred to ''Heart of Darkness'' as a "minor work" and criticised its "adjectival insistence upon inexpressible and incomprehensible mystery".&lt;ref name="Moore5"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad himself did not consider it to be particularly notable.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; By the 1960s, though, it was a standard assignment in many college and high school English courses.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for the whole sentence.|date=April 2018}}

In ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'' (1998), [[Adam Hochschild]] wrote that literary scholars have made too much of the psychological aspects of ''Heart of Darkness'', while paying scant attention to Conrad's accurate recounting of the horror arising from the methods and effects of colonialism in the Congo Free State. "''Heart of Darkness'' is experience ... pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the actual facts of the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hochschild|1999|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critiques include Hugh Curtler's ''Achebe on Conrad: Racism and Greatness in Heart of Darkness'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Curtler, Hugh|title=Achebe on Conrad: Racism and Greatness in Heart of Darkness|journal=Conradiana|volume=29|issue= 1|date=March 1997|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving beyond ideology critique, French philosopher Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe called ''Heart of Darkness'' "one of the greatest texts of Western literature" and used Conrad's tale for a reflection on "The Horror of the West".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/conrads-heart-of-darkness-and-contemporary-thought-9781441101006/|title=The Horror of the West|last=Lacoue-Labarthe|first=Philippe|website=|publisher=Bloomsbury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinua Achebe - Buffalo 25Sep2008 crop.jpg|thumb|Chinua Achebe's 1975 lecture on the book sparked decades of debate.]]

He argued that the book promoted and continues to promote a prejudiced image of Africa that "depersonalises a portion of the human race", and concluded that it should not be considered a great work of art.&lt;ref name=Achebe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Achebe|first=Chinua|title=An Image of Africa|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3818468|work=Research in African Literatures|year=1978|accessdate=13 December 2013|doi=10.2307/3818468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Zimbabwean scholar Rino Zhuwarara broadly agreed with Achebe, though considered it important to be "sensitised to how peoples of other nations perceive Africa".&lt;ref name="Moore6"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Botswanan scholar Peter Mwikisa concluded the book was "the great lost opportunity to depict dialogue between Africa and Europe."&lt;ref&gt;Mwikisa, Peter. "Conrad's Image of Africa: Recovering African Voices in ''Heart of Darkness''. ''Mots Pluriels'' 13 (April 2000): 20–28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, British academic [[Cedric Watts]] criticized Achebe's apparent assertion that only black people may accurately analyse and assess the novella. Stan Galloway writes, in a comparison of ''Heart of Darkness'' with '' Jungle Tales of Tarzan'', "The inhabitants [of both works], whether antagonists or compatriots, were clearly imaginary and meant to represent a particular fictive cipher and not a particular African people."&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Stan. ''The Teenage Tarzan: A Literary Analysis of Edgar Rice Burroughs'', ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[Caryl Phillips]] stated in 2003 that: "Achebe is right; to the African reader the price of Conrad's eloquent denunciation of colonisation is the recycling of racist notions of the 'dark' continent and her people. Those of us who are not from Africa may be prepared to pay this price, but this price is far too high for Achebe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Caryl|title=Out of Africa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/classics.chinuaachebe|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent critics have stressed that the "continuities" between Conrad and Achebe are profound and that a form of "postcolonial mimesis" ties the two authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nidesh |last=Lawtoo |title=A Picture of Africa: Frenzy, Counternarrative, Mimesis |journal=Modern Fiction Studies |volume=59 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=26–52 |doi=10.1353/mfs.2013.0000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and influences==

===Radio and stage plays===
[[Orson Welles]] adapted and starred in ''Heart of Darkness'' in a [[CBS Radio]] broadcast on 6 November 1938 as part of his series, ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''. In 1939 Welles adapted the story for his first film for [[RKO Pictures]], writing a screenplay with [[John Houseman]]. It was intended to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow's eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It has been reported as lost to history. The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak of war. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio series ''[[This Is My Best]]''. Welles scholar [[Bret Wood]] called the broadcast of 13 March 1945, "the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story's visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast."&lt;ref name="Bret Wood"&gt;[[Bret Wood|Wood, Bret]], ''Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1990 {{ISBN|0-313-26538-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|95, 153–156,136–137|date=March 2014}}

In 1991, Australian author and playwright [[Larry Buttrose]] wrote and staged a theatrical production of ''Kurtz'' (based on ''Heart of Darkness'') with the Crossroads Theatre Company, Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsB/buttrose-larry.html|title=Larry Buttrose|publisher=doollee.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was announced to be broadcast as a radio play to Australian radio audiences in August 2011 by the [[Vision Australia Radio]] Network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionaustralia.org/info.aspx?page=749|title=Vision Australia|publisher=Visionaustralia.org|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801191453/http://www.visionaustralia.org/info.aspx?page=749|archivedate=1 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the RPH – [[Radio Print Handicapped Network]] across Australia.

In 2011, an [[Heart of Darkness (opera)|operatic adaptation]] by composer [[Tarik O'Regan]] and librettist [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]] was premiered at the [[Linbury Studio Theatre|Linbury Theatre]] of the [[Royal Opera House]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/whatson/production.aspx?pid=17248 Royal Opera House Page for ''Heart of Darkness''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020223221/http://www.roh.org.uk/whatson/production.aspx?pid=17248 |date=20 October 2011 }} by [[Tarik O'Regan]] and [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]]&lt;/ref&gt; A suite for orchestra and narrator was subsequently extrapolated from it.&lt;ref name=RPO&gt;{{Citation|title=''Suite from Heart of Darkness'' first London performance|publisher=Cadogan Hall|url=http://www.cadoganhall.com/event/royal-philharmonic-orchestra-130423/|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an adaption of Orson Welles' screenplay by Jamie Lloyd and Laurence Bowen was aired on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Orson Welles' Heart of Darkness, Unmade Movies, Drama – BBC Radio 4|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06k9bz9|publisher = BBC|accessdate = 3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production starred [[James McAvoy]] as Marlow.

===Film and television===
The [[CBS]] television anthology ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' aired a 90-minute loose adaptation in 1958. This version, written by [[Stewart Stern]], uses the encounter between Marlow ([[Roddy McDowall]]) and Kurtz ([[Boris Karloff]]) as its final act, and adds a backstory in which Marlow had been Kurtz's adopted son. The cast includes [[Inga Swenson]] and [[Eartha Kitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cast and credits are available at [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0675574/ "The Internet Movie Database"]. Retrieved 2 December 2010. A full recording of the show can be viewed onsite by members of the public upon request at [[The Paley Center for Media]] (formerly the Museum of Television &amp; Radio) in New York City and Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous adaptation is [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1979 motion picture ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' based on the screenplay by [[John Milius]], which moves the story from the Congo to [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=29 September 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/03/movies/critic-s-notebook-aching-heart-of-darkness.html |title= Aching Heart of Darkness  |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 August 2001 |author=Scott, A. O. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Apocalypse Now'', [[Martin Sheen]] plays Captain Benjamin L. Willard, a [[United States Army|US Army]] Captain assigned to "terminate the command" of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. [[Marlon Brando]] played Kurtz, in one of his most famous roles. A production documentary of the film, titled ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'', exposed some of the major difficulties which director Coppola faced in seeing the movie through to completion. The difficulties that Coppola and his crew faced mirrored some of the themes of the book.

On 13 March 1993 [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] aired [[Heart of Darkness (1993 film)|a new version of the story]] directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], starring [[Tim Roth]] as Marlow and [[John Malkovich]] as Kurtz.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Ken.

===Video games===
The video game ''[[Far Cry 2]],'' released on 21 October 2008, is a loose modernised adaptation of ''Heart of Darkness''. The player assumes the role of a mercenary operating in Africa whose task it is to kill an arms dealer, the elusive "Jackal". The last area of the game is called 'The Heart of Darkness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/feature-far-cry-2s-heart-darkness/|title=The Darkness|author=Mikel Reparaz|date=30 July 2007|work=GamesRadar+}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infovore.org/archives/2008/12/22/africa-wins-again/ |title=Africa Wins Again: Far Cry 2’s literary approach to narrative |publisher=Infovore.org |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/content/far-cry-2-jorge-albor|title=Far Cry 2 – Jorge Albor – ETC Press|work=Cmu.edu|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]],'' released on 26 June 2012, is a direct modernised adaptation of ''Heart of Darkness''. The player assumes the role of special-ops agent Martin Walker as he and his team search [[Dubai]] for survivors in the aftermath of catastrophic sandstorms that left the city without contact to the outside world. The character John Konrad, who replaces the character Kurtz, is a reference to the author of the novella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/886896-spec-ops-the-line-preview-heart-of-darkness|title=Spec Ops: The Line preview – heart of darkness|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Victoria II]]'', a grand strategy game produced by [[Paradox Interactive]], launched an expansion pack titled "Heart of Darkness" on 16 April 2013, which  revamped the game's colonial system, and naval warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paradoxplaza.com/victoria-2-heart-of-darkness|title=Victoria 2: Heart of Darkness – Paradox Interactive|publisher=Paradoxplaza.com|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
The novel ''Hearts of Darkness'', by Paul Lawrence, moves the events of the novel to England in 1666. Marlow's journey into the jungle is reimagined as the journey of the narrator, Harry Lytle, and his friend Davy Dowling out of London and towards Shyam, a plague-stricken town that has descended into cruelty and barbarism loosely modelled on real-life [[Eyam]]. While Marlow must return to civilisation with Kurtz, Lytle and Dowling are searching for the spy James Josselin. Like Kurtz, Josselin's reputation is immense, and the protagonists are well-acquainted with his accomplishments by the time they finally meet him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisonandbusby.com/book/heart-of-darkness-hardback|title=Hearts of Darkness|publisher=Allisonandbusby.com|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet Yedda Morrison's 2012 book ''Darkness'' erases Conrad's novella, "whiting out" his text so that only images of the natural world remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yeddamorrison.com/words/darkness/2/|title=Yedda Morrison|first=Yedda|last=Morrison|publisher=Yeddamorrison.com|accessdate=17 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518070748/http://yeddamorrison.com/words/darkness/2/|archive-date=18 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Reich's ''Mistah Kurtz! A Prelude to Heart of Darkness'' presents the early life of Kurtz, his appointment to his station in the Congo, and his messianic disintegration in a novel that dovetails with the conclusion of Conrad's novella. Reich's novel is premised upon the papers Kurtz leaves to Marlow at the end of ''Heart of Darkness.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fictionadvocate.com/2016/03/14/qa-with-james-reich-author-of-mistah-kurtz/|title=Q&amp;A with James Reich, Author of Mistah Kurtz|last=Hurley|first=Brian|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Josef Škvorecký]]'s novel ''[[The Engineer of Human Souls]]'' Kurtz is seen as the epitome of exterminatory colonialism, and here and elsewhere Škvorecký emphasises the importance of Conrad's concern with Russian imperialism in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Škvorecký, Josef (1984).  [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/crossc/ANW0935.1984.001/269:21?rgn=author;view=image;q1=Skvorecky%2C+Josef "Why the Harlequin?  On Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''."]  ''Cross Currents:  A Yearbook of Central European Culture'', vol. 3, pp. 259-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]] wrote "Mistah Kurtz—he dead" at the beginning of the poem ''[[The Hollow Men]]'', quoting the "manager's boy" when he announced the death of Kurtz to the crew.

[[File:Montre mysterieuse-IMG 4639.jpg|thumb|The transparent dial in this "[[mystery watch]]" may create the illusion in the viewer that the hands work without any movement.]]
An '''illusion''' is a distortion of the [[sense]]s, which can reveal how the [[human brain]] normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation. Though illusions distort our perception of reality, they are generally shared by most people.&lt;ref&gt;Solso, R. L. (2001). Cognitive psychology (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. {{ISBN|0-205-30937-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions ([[optical illusion]]s) are the best-known and understood. The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because [[visual perception|vision]] often dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a [[ventriloquist]] will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGurk | first1 = Hj. | last2 = MacDonald | first2 = J. | year = 1976 | title = Hearing lips and seeing voices | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 264 | issue = | pages = 746–748 | doi=10.1038/264746a0 | pmid=1012311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during [[perception]]. These assumptions are made using organizational principles (e.g., [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] theory), an individual's capacity for [[depth perception]] and motion perception, and [[subjective constancy|perceptual constancy]]. Other illusions occur because of biological sensory structures within the [[human body]] or conditions outside the body within one's physical environment.

The term ''illusion'' refers to a specific form of sensory distortion. Unlike a [[hallucination]], which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus, an illusion describes a misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water (or other auditory source) would be an illusion.

==Optical==
[[File:Grey square optical illusion.svg|250px|thumb|right|An optical illusion. Square A is exactly the same shade of grey as Square B. (See [[Checker shadow illusion]].)]]
{{main|Optical illusion}}
An optical illusion is characterised by [[visual perception|visually perceived]] images that are deceptive or misleading. Therefore, the information gathered by the eye is processed by the brain to give, on the face of it, a [[percept]] that does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source. A conventional assumption is that there are physiological illusions that occur naturally and cognitive illusions that can be demonstrated by specific visual tricks that say something more basic about how human perceptual systems work.
The human brain constructs a world inside our head based on what it samples from the surrounding environment. However, sometimes it tries to organise this information it thinks best while other times it fills in the gaps.&lt;ref&gt;
Yoon Mo Jung and Jackie (Jianhong) Shen (2008), J. Visual Comm. Image Representation, '''19'''(1):42-55, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1326364.1326487&amp;coll=&amp;dl=&amp;CFID=11849883&amp;CFTOKEN=72040242 ''First-order modeling and stability analysis of illusory contours''].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Yoon Mo Jung and Jackie (Jianhong) Shen (2014), arXiv:1406.1265, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1265 ''Illusory shapes via phase transition''].
&lt;/ref&gt; This way in which our brain works is the basis of an illusion.

==Auditory==
{{main|Auditory illusion}}
An auditory illusion is an illusion of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], the auditory equivalent of an optical illusion: the listener hears either sounds which are not present in the stimulus, or "impossible" sounds. In short, audio illusions highlight areas where the human ear and brain, as organic, makeshift tools, differ from perfect audio receptors (for better or for worse). One example of an auditory illusion is a [[Shepard tone]].

==Tactile==
{{main|Tactile illusion}}
Examples of tactile illusions include [[phantom limb]], the [[thermal grill illusion]], the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]] and a curious illusion that occurs when the crossed index and middle fingers are run along the bridge of the nose with one finger on each side, resulting in the perception of two separate noses. The brain areas activated during illusory tactile perception are similar to those activated during actual tactile stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, L 2006 THIS REFERENCE IS INCOMPLETE&lt;/ref&gt; Tactile illusions can also be elicited through haptic technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-VH-Nature2001.pdf Robles-De-La-Torre &amp; Hayward 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; These "illusory" tactile objects can be used to create "virtual objects".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17363&amp;ch=biotech&amp;sc=&amp;pg=1 The Cutting Edge of Haptics] (MIT [[Technology Review]] article)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal==
{{Main|Time_perception#Types_of_temporal_illusions|l1=Time perception § Types of temporal illusions}}
A [[Time perception#Types of temporal illusions|temporal illusion]] is a distortion in the perception of time, which occurs when the time interval between two or more events is very narrow (typically less than a second). In such cases, a person may momentarily perceive time as slowing down, stopping, speeding up, or running backwards.

==Other senses==
Illusions can occur with the other senses including those involved in food perception. Both sound&lt;ref&gt;Zampini M &amp; Spence C (2004) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-459x.2004.080403.x/abstract "The role of auditory cues in modulating the perceived crispness and staleness of potato chips"]. ''Journal of Sensory Studies'' 19, 347-363.&lt;/ref&gt; and touch&lt;ref&gt;Barnett-Cowan M (2010) [http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6784 "An illusion you can sink your teeth into: Haptic cues modulate the perceived freshness and crispness of pretzels"]. ''Perception'' 39, 1684-1686.&lt;/ref&gt; have been shown to modulate the perceived staleness and crispness of food products. It was also discovered that even if some portion of the taste receptor on the tongue became damaged that illusory taste could be produced by tactile stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Todrank, J &amp; Bartoshuk, L.M., 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[olfactory]] (smell) illusions occurred when positive or negative verbal labels were given prior to olfactory stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Herz R. S. &amp; Von Clef J., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McGurk effect]] shows that what we hear is influenced by what we see as we hear the person speaking. An illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. This is a multisensory, auditory-visual illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nath |first1=A. R. |last2=Beauchamp |first2=M.

==Disorders==
Some illusions occur as result of an illness or a disorder. While these types of illusions are not shared with everyone, they are typical of each condition. For example, migraine sufferers often report [[fortification illusions]].

==Neuroscience==
[[Perception]] is linked to specific brain activity and so can be elicited by brain stimulation. The (illusory) percepts that can be evoked range from simple [[phosphene]]s (detections of lights in the [[visual field]]) to high-level percepts. In a single-case study on a patient undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy treatment, electrical stimulation at the left temporo-parietal junction evoked the percept of a nearby (illusory) person who "closely 'shadowed' changes in the patient's body position and posture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arzy | first1 = S | last2 = Seeck | first2 = M | last3 = Ortigue | first3 = S | last4 = Spinelli | first4 = L | last5 = Blanke | first5 = O | year = 2006 | title = Induction of an illusory shadow person | url = https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/154874/files/2006_Arzy_N_induction%20of%20an%20illusory%20shadow%20person.pdf| journal = Nature | volume = 443 | issue = | page = 287 | doi=10.1038/443287a | pmid=16988702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopkin"&gt;{{citation|last=Hopkin|first=Michael|title=Brain Electrodes Conjure up Ghostly Visions|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/news060918-4|date=20 September 2006|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060918/full/news060918-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thermodynamics|expanded=Potentials}}

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''internal energy''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is the [[energy]] contained within the system, excluding the [[kinetic energy]] of motion, of the system as a whole and the potential energy of the system as a whole due to external force fields. It keeps account of the gains and losses of energy of the system that are due to changes in its internal state.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, F. H. (1963), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal energy of a system can be changed by transfers of [[matter]] or [[heat transfer|heat]] or by doing [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]].&lt;ref name="Born 146"&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), Appendix 8, [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–149].&lt;/ref&gt; When matter transfer is prevented by impermeable containing walls, the system is said to be [[Closed system|closed]]. Then the [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that the increase in internal energy is equal to the total heat added plus the work done on the system by its surroundings. If the containing walls pass neither matter nor energy, the system is said to be isolated and its internal energy cannot change. The first law of thermodynamics may be regarded as establishing the existence of the internal energy.

The internal energy is one of the two cardinal [[state function]]s of the state variables of a [[thermodynamic system]].

==Introduction==

The internal energy of a given state of a system cannot be directly measured. It is determined through some convenient chain of [[thermodynamic operation]]s and [[thermodynamic process]]es by which the given state can be prepared, starting with a reference state which is customarily assigned a reference value for its internal energy. Such a chain, or path, can be theoretically described by certain [[Thermodynamics#States and processes|extensive]] state variables of the system, namely, its [[entropy]], {{math|''S''}}, its volume, {{math|''V''}}, and its mole numbers, {{math|{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}. The internal energy, {{math|''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, is a function of those. Sometimes, to that list are appended other extensive state variables, for example [[electric dipole moment]]. For practical considerations in thermodynamics and engineering it is rarely necessary or convenient to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a system, such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass. Customarily, thermodynamic descriptions include only items relevant to the processes under study. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned only with ''changes'' in the internal energy, not with its absolute value.

The internal energy is a state function of a system, because its value depends only on the current state of the system and not on the path taken or processes undergone to prepare it. It is an [[extensive quantity]]. It is the one and only ''cardinal'' [[thermodynamic potential]].&lt;ref name ="Tschoegl 17"/&gt; Through it, by use of [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transforms]], are mathematically constructed the other thermodynamic potentials. These are functions of variable lists in which some extensive variables are replaced by their [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] [[Thermodynamics#States and processes|intensive variables]]. Legendre transformation is necessary because mere substitutive replacement of extensive variables by intensive variables does not lead to thermodynamic potentials. Mere substitution leads to a less informative formula, an equation of state.

Though it is a [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] quantity, internal energy can be explained in microscopic terms by two theoretical virtual components. One is the microscopic kinetic energy due to the microscopic motion of the system's particles ([[translation (physics)|translations]], [[rotation]]s, [[oscillation|vibrations]]). The other is the potential energy associated with the microscopic forces, including the [[chemical bonds]], between the particles; this is for ordinary physics and chemistry. If thermonuclear reactions are specified as a topic of concern, then the static [[mass-energy equivalence|rest mass energy]] of the constituents of matter is also counted. There is no simple universal relation between these quantities of microscopic energy and the quantities of energy gained or lost by the system in work, heat, or matter transfer.

The [[SI]] unit of [[energy]] is the [[joule]] (J). Sometimes it is convenient to use a corresponding density called ''specific internal energy'' which is internal energy per unit of mass ([[kilogram]]) of the system in question. The SI unit of specific internal energy is J/kg.  If the specific internal energy is expressed relative to units of [[amount of substance]] ([[Mole (unit)|mol]]), then it is referred to as ''molar internal energy'' and the unit is J/mol.

From the standpoint of [[statistical mechanics]], the internal energy is equal to the [[ensemble average]] of the sum of the microscopic kinetic and potential energies of the system.

===Cardinal functions===

The internal energy, {{math|''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, expresses the thermodynamics of a system in the ''energy-language'', or in the ''energy representation''. Its arguments are exclusively extensive variables of state. Alongside the internal energy, the other cardinal function of state of a thermodynamic system is its entropy, as a function, {{math|''S''(''U'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, of the same list of extensive variables of state, except that the entropy, {{math|''S''}}, is replaced in the list by the internal energy, {{math|''U''}}. It expresses the ''entropy representation''.&lt;ref name ="Tschoegl 17"&gt;Tschoegl, N.W. (2000), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Callen Ch 5"&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each cardinal function is a monotonic function of each of its ''natural'' or ''canonical'' variables. Each provides its ''characteristic'' or ''fundamental'' equation, for example {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, that by itself contains all thermodynamic information about the system. The fundamental equations for the two cardinal functions can in principle be interconverted by solving, for example, {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}} for {{math|''S''}}, to get {{math|''S'' {{=}} ''S''(''U'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}.

In contrast, Legendre transforms are necessary to derive fundamental equations for other thermodynamic potentials and [[Massieu function]]s. The entropy as a function only of extensive state variables is the one and only ''cardinal function'' of state for the generation of Massieu functions. It is not itself customarily designated a 'Massieu function', though rationally it might be thought of as such, corresponding to the term 'thermodynamic potential', which includes the internal energy.&lt;ref name="Callen Ch 5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 206–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

For real and practical systems, explicit expressions of the fundamental equations are almost always unavailable, but the functional relations exist in principle. Formal, in principle, manipulations of them are valuable for the understanding of thermodynamics.

==Description and definition==
The internal energy {{math|''U''}} of a given state of the system is determined relative to that of a standard state of the system, by adding up the macroscopic transfers of energy that accompany a change of state from the reference state to the given state:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = \sum_i  E_i\,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|Δ''U''}} denotes the difference between the internal energy of the given state and that of the reference state,
and the {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the various energies transferred to the system in the steps from the reference state to the given state.
It is the energy needed to create the given state of the system from the reference state.

From a non-relativistic microscopic point of view, it may be divided into microscopic potential energy, {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;micro pot&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and microscopic kinetic energy, {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;micro kin&lt;/sub&gt;}}, components:
:&lt;math&gt;U = U_{\mathrm{micro\,pot}} + U_{\mathrm{micro\,kin}}&lt;/math&gt;

The microscopic kinetic energy of a system arises as the sum of the motions of all the system's particles with respect to the center-of-mass frame, whether it be the motion of atoms, molecules, atomic nuclei, electrons, or other particles. The microscopic potential energy algebraic summative components are those of the [[Chemical energy|chemical]] and [[Nuclear potential energy|nuclear]] particle bonds, and the physical force fields within the system, such as due to internal [[electrostatic induction|induced]] electric or [[magnetism|magnetic]] [[dipole]] [[moment (physics)|moment]], as well as the energy of [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of solids ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-[[strain (materials science)|strain]]). Usually, the split into microscopic kinetic and potential energies is outside the scope of macroscopic thermodynamics.

Internal energy does not include the energy due to motion or location of a system as a whole. That is to say, it excludes any kinetic or potential energy the body may have because of its motion or location in external [[gravitation]]al, [[electrostatics|electrostatic]], or [[electromagnetics|electromagnetic]] [[field (physics)|field]]s. It does, however, include the contribution of such a field to the energy due to the coupling of the internal degrees of freedom of the object with the field. In such a case, the field is included in the thermodynamic description of the object in the form of an additional external parameter.

For practical considerations in thermodynamics or engineering, it is rarely necessary, convenient, nor even possible, to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a sample system, such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass. Typically, descriptions only include components relevant to the system under study.  Indeed, in most systems under consideration, especially through thermodynamics, it is impossible to calculate the total internal energy.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;I. Klotz, R. Rosenberg, ''Chemical Thermodynamics - Basic Concepts and Methods'', 7th ed., Wiley (2008), p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a convenient null reference point may be chosen for the internal energy.

The internal energy is an [[extensive variable|extensive property]]: it depends on the size of the system, or on the [[amount of substance]] it contains.

At any temperature greater than [[absolute zero]], microscopic potential energy and kinetic energy are constantly converted into one another, but the sum remains constant in an [[isolated system]] (cf. table). In the classical picture of thermodynamics, kinetic energy vanishes at zero temperature and the internal energy is purely potential energy. However, quantum mechanics has demonstrated that even at zero temperature particles maintain a residual energy of motion, the [[zero point energy]]. A system at absolute zero is merely in its quantum-mechanical ground state, the lowest energy state available. At absolute zero a system of given composition has attained its minimum attainable [[entropy]].

The microscopic kinetic energy portion of the internal energy gives rise to the temperature of the system. [[Statistical mechanics]] relates the pseudo-random kinetic energy of individual particles to the mean kinetic energy of the entire ensemble of particles comprising a system. Furthermore, it relates the mean microscopic kinetic energy to the macroscopically observed empirical property that is expressed as temperature of the system. This energy is often referred to as the ''thermal energy'' of a system,&lt;ref name=hyperphysics&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/eqpar.html#c2 Thermal energy] – Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt; relating this energy, like the temperature, to the human experience of hot and cold.

Statistical mechanics considers any system to be statistically distributed across an ensemble of ''N'' [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. Each microstate has an energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and is associated with a probability ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The internal energy is the [[mean]] value of the system's total energy, i.e., the sum of all microstate energies, each weighted by their probability of occurrence:
:&lt;math&gt;U = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i \,E_i\ .&lt;/math&gt;
This is the statistical expression of the [[first law of thermodynamics]].

===Internal energy changes===
{| align="right" border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0
|-
|{{table of thermodynamic systems}}
|}
Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned only with the changes, {{math|Δ''U''}}, in internal energy.

For a closed system, with matter transfer excluded, the changes in internal energy are due to heat transfer {{math|''Q''}} and due to work. The latter can be split into two kinds, pressure-volume work {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;pressure-volume&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and frictional and other kinds, such as [[electrical polarization]], which do not alter the volume of the system, and are called isochoric, {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;isochoric&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Accordingly, the internal energy change {{math|Δ''U''}} for a process may be written&lt;ref name="Born 146"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta U = Q + W_{\mathrm{pressure-volume}} + W_{\mathrm{isochoric}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm{(closed\,\,system,\,\,no\,\,transfer\,\,of\,\,matter)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=signconvention group=note&gt;In this article we choose the sign convention of the mechanical work as typically defined in chemistry, which is different from the convention used in physics. In chemistry, work performed by the system against the environment, e.g., a system expansion, is negative, while in physics this is taken to be positive.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a closed system receives energy as heat, this energy increases the internal energy. It is distributed between microscopic kinetic and microscopic potential energies. In general, thermodynamics does not trace this distribution.  In an ideal gas all of the extra energy results in a temperature increase, as it is stored solely as microscopic kinetic energy; such heating is said to be ''[[Sensible heat|sensible]]''.

A second mechanism of change of internal energy of a closed system is the doing of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] on the system, either in mechanical form by changing pressure or volume, or by other perturbations, such as directing an electric current through the system.

If the system is not closed, the third mechanism that can increase the internal energy is transfer of matter into the system. This increase, {{math|Δ''U''&lt;sub&gt;matter&lt;/sub&gt;}} cannot be split into heat and work components. If the system is so set up physically that heat and work can be done on it by pathways separate from and independent of matter transfer, then the transfers of energy add to change the internal energy:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta U = Q + W_{\mathrm{pressure-volume}} + W_{\mathrm{isochoric}} + \Delta U_{\mathrm{matter}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(separate\,\,pathway\,\,for\,\,matter\,\,transfer\,\,from\,\,heat\,\,and\,\,work\,\,transfer\,\,pathways)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If a system undergoes certain phase transformations while being heated, such as melting and vaporization, it may be observed that the temperature of the system does not change until the entire sample has completed the transformation. The energy introduced into the system while the temperature did not change is called a ''latent energy'', or [[latent heat]], in contrast to sensible heat, which is associated with temperature change.

==Internal energy of the ideal gas==
Thermodynamics often uses the concept of the [[ideal gas]] for teaching purposes, and as an approximation for working systems. The ideal gas is a gas of particles considered as point objects that interact only by elastic collisions and fill a volume such that their free mean path between collisions is much larger than their diameter. Such systems are approximated by the [[monatomic]] gases, [[helium]] and the other [[noble gas]]es. Here the kinetic energy consists only of the [[translation (physics)|translational]] energy of the individual atoms. Monatomic particles do not rotate or vibrate, and are not [[energy level|electronically excited]] to higher energies except at very high [[temperature]]s.

Therefore, internal energy changes in an ideal gas may be described solely by changes in its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is simply the internal energy of the perfect gas and depends entirely on its [[pressure]], [[volume]] and [[thermodynamic temperature]].

The internal energy of an ideal gas is proportional to its mass (number of moles) ''n'' and to its temperature ''T''
: &lt;math&gt; U = c n T, &lt;/math&gt;

where  ''c'' is the heat capacity (at constant volume) of the gas. The internal energy may be written as a function of the three extensive properties ''S'', ''V'', ''n'' (entropy, volume, mass) in the following way &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Gool |first1=W. |last2=Bruggink |first2=J.J.C. (Eds) |url= |title=Energy and time in the economic and physical sciences |publisher=North-Holland |year=1985 |pages=41–56 |quote= |isbn=0444877487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grubbström | first1 = Robert W. | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2007.01.003 | title = An Attempt to Introduce Dynamics Into Generalised Exergy Considerations| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 84| pages = 701–718 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U(S,V,n) = \mathrm{const}  \cdot  e^\frac{S}{cn}    V^\frac{-R}{c}  n^\frac{R+c}{c},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''const'' is an arbitrary positive constant and where ''R'' is the [[Gas constant|universal gas constant]]. It is easily seen that ''U'' is a linearly [[homogeneous function]] of the three variables (that is, it is ''extensive'' in these variables), and that it is weakly [[convex function|convex]]. Knowing temperature and pressure to be the derivatives 
&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;p = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial V},&lt;/math&gt; the [[ideal gas law]] &lt;math&gt;PV = nRT&lt;/math&gt; immediately follows.

==Internal energy of a closed thermodynamic system==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
This above summation of all components of change in internal energy assume that a positive energy denotes heat added to the system or work done on the system, while a negative energy denotes work of the system on the environment.

Typically this relationship is expressed in [[infinitesimal]] terms using the differentials of each term. Only the internal energy is an [[exact differential]]. For a system undergoing only thermodynamics processes, i.e. a closed system that can exchange only heat and work, the change in the internal energy is
:&lt;math&gt; d U = \delta Q + \delta W \, &lt;/math&gt;
which constitutes the [[first law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=signconvention group=note/&gt; It may be expressed in terms of other thermodynamic parameters. Each term is composed of an [[intensive variable]] (a generalized force) and its [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] infinitesimal [[extensive variable]] (a generalized displacement).

For example, for a non-viscous fluid, the mechanical work done on the system may be related to the [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] ''V''. The pressure is the intensive generalized force, while the volume is the extensive generalized displacement:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = - p \mathrm{d}V\,&lt;/math&gt;.
This defines the direction of work, ''W'', to be energy flow from the working system to the surroundings, indicated by a negative term.&lt;ref name=signconvention group=note/&gt; Taking the direction of heat transfer ''Q'' to be into the working fluid and assuming a [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]], the heat is
:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T \mathrm{d}S\,&lt;/math&gt;.
::&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[temperature]]
::&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is [[entropy]]

and the change in internal energy becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\mathrm{d}S-p\mathrm{d}V \!&lt;/math&gt;

===Changes due to temperature and volume===
The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is
:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - p\right]dV\,\,\text{   (1)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful if the [[equation of state]] is known.

In case of an ideal gas, we can derive that &lt;math&gt;dU = C_V dT&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the internal energy of an ideal gas can be written as a function that depends only on the temperature.

{{hidden begin|border=1px solid lightgray; width: 60%;|title=Proof of pressure independence for an ideal gas}}

The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is

:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - p\right]dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of state is the ideal gas law

:&lt;math&gt;p V = n R T.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for pressure:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{n R T}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute in to internal energy expression:

:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - \frac{n R T}{V}\right]dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Take the derivative of pressure with respect to temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial T} \right)_{V} = \frac{n R}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

Replace:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = C_{V}dT + \left[ \frac{n R T}{V}  - \frac{n R T}{V} \right] dV.&lt;/math&gt;

And simplify:

:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT.\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;dS = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}dT + \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T}dV \,&lt;/math&gt;

is substituted in the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]]

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T dS - p dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} - p\right]dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The term &lt;math&gt;T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Specific heat capacity#Heat capacity of compressible bodies|heat capacity at constant volume]] &lt;math&gt;C_{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

The partial derivative of ''S'' with respect to ''V'' can be evaluated if the equation of state is known.  From the fundamental thermodynamic relation, it follows that the differential of the [[Helmholtz free energy]] A is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;dA = -S dT - p dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[symmetry of second derivatives]] of ''A'' with respect to ''T'' and ''V'' yields the [[Maxwell relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} = \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the expression above.

===Changes due to temperature and pressure===
When dealing with fluids or solids, an expression in terms of the temperature and pressure is usually more useful:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \left(C_{p}-\alpha p V\right)dT +\left(\beta_{T}p-\alpha T\right)Vdp\,&lt;/math&gt;

where it is assumed that the heat capacity at constant pressure is [[Relations between specific heats|related]] to the heat capacity at constant volume according to:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{p} = C_{V} + V T\frac{\alpha^{2}}{\beta_{T}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden begin|border=1px solid lightgray; width: 60%;|title=Derivation of dU in terms of dT and dP}}
The partial derivative of the pressure with respect to temperature at constant volume can be expressed in terms of the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \equiv \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the isothermal [[compressibility]]

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{T} \equiv -\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}\,&lt;/math&gt;

by writing:

:&lt;math&gt;dV = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}dp + \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p} dT = V\left(\alpha dT-\beta_{T}dp \right)\,\,\text{  (2)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

and equating dV to zero and solving for the ratio dp/dT. This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}= -\frac{\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}}{\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}}= \frac{\alpha}{\beta_{T}}\,\,\text{   (3)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting (2) and (3) in (1) gives the above expression.
{{hidden end}}

===Changes due to volume at constant temperature===
The [[internal pressure]] is defined as a [[partial derivative]] of the internal energy with respect to the volume at constant temperature:
:&lt;math&gt; \pi _T  = \left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T  &lt;/math&gt;

==Internal energy of multi-component systems==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In addition to including the entropy ''S'' and volume ''V'' terms in the internal energy, a system is often described also in terms of the number of particles or chemical species it contains:

:&lt;math&gt;U = U(S,V,N_1,\ldots,N_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; are the molar amounts of constituents of type ''j'' in the system. The internal energy is an [[extensive variable|extensive]] function of the extensive variables ''S'', ''V'', and the amounts ''N''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, the internal energy may be written as a linearly [[homogeneous function]] of first degree:
: &lt;math&gt;U(\alpha S,\alpha V,\alpha N_{1},\alpha N_{2},\ldots )
 = \alpha U(S,V,N_{1},N_{2},\ldots)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;alpha; is a factor describing the growth of the system. The differential internal energy may be written as
: 
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} U = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}  \mathrm{d} S  + \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \mathrm{d} V + \sum_i\ \frac{\partial U}{\partial N_i} \mathrm{d} N_i\ = T \,\mathrm{d} S - p \,\mathrm{d} V + \sum_i\mu_i \mathrm{d} N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;

which shows (or defines) temperature ''T'' to be the partial derivative of ''U'' with respect to entropy ''S'' and pressure ''p'' to be the negative of the similar derivative with respect to volume ''V''
:
&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S},&lt;/math&gt;
:
&lt;math&gt;p = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial V},&lt;/math&gt;

and where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[chemical potential]]s for the components of type i in the system. The chemical potentials are defined as the partial derivatives of the energy with respect to the variations in composition:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_i = \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial N_i} \right)_{S,V, N_{j \ne i}}&lt;/math&gt;
As conjugate variables to the composition &lt;math&gt;\lbrace N_{j} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, the chemical potentials are [[intensive and extensive properties|intensive properties]], intrinsically characteristic of the qualitative nature of the system, and not proportional to its extent. Under conditions of constant ''T'' and ''p'', because of the extensive nature of U and its independent variables, using [[Homogeneous function|Euler's homogeneous function theorem]], the differential d''U'' may be integrated and yields an expression for the internal energy:
:&lt;math&gt;U = T S - p V + \sum_i \mu_i N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum over the composition of the system is the [[Gibbs free energy]]:
:&lt;math&gt;G = \sum_i \mu_i N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;
that arises from changing the composition of the system at constant temperature and pressure. For a single component system, the chemical potential equals the Gibbs energy per amount of substance, i.e. particles or moles according to the original definition of the unit for &lt;math&gt;\lbrace N_{j} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;.

==Internal energy in an elastic medium==
For an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] medium the mechanical energy term of the internal energy must be replaced by the more general expression involving the [[Stress (physics)|stress]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and strain &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal statement is:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=T\mathrm{d}S+V\sigma_{ij}\mathrm{d}\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Einstein notation]] has been used for the tensors, in which there is a summation over all repeated indices in the product term. 
The Euler theorem yields for the internal energy:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U=TS+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

For a linearly elastic material, the stress is related to the strain by:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}=C_{ijkl} \varepsilon_{kl}&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''C''&lt;sub&gt;ijkl&lt;/sub&gt; are the components of the 4th-rank elastic constant tensor of the medium.

==History==
[[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]] studied the relationship between heat, work, and temperature. He observed that if he did mechanical work on a fluid, such as water, by agitating the fluid, its temperature increased. He proposed that the mechanical work he was doing on the system was converted to ''[[thermal energy]]''. Specifically, he found that 4185.5 joules of energy were needed to raise the temperature of a kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joule|first=J.P.|authorlink=James Prescott Joule|title=On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat| journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] | publisher=[[Royal Society]]|year=1850| volume=140|pages=61–82| url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/140/61 |accessdate=4 June 2016| doi=10.1098/rstl.1850.0004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5654">In [[psychoanalysis]], '''introjection''' ({{lang-de|Introjektion}}) generally is regarded as the process where the subject replicates in himself behaviors, attributes or other fragments of the surrounding world, especially of other subjects. Cognate concepts are [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], incorporation,&lt;ref&gt;A form of taking the outside world into the inner world, being focused on bodily sensation.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[internalization]]. To use a simple example, a person who picks up traits from his friends (e.g., a person who begins frequently exclaiming ''"Ridiculous!"'' as a result of hearing a friend of theirs repeatedly doing the same) is introjecting.

[[Psychological projection|Projection]] has been described as an early phase of introjection.&lt;ref name="pmid15577283"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malancharuvil JM |title=Projection, introjection, and projective identification: a reformulation |journal=Am J Psychoanal |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=375–82 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15577283 |doi=10.1007/s11231-004-4325-y |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0002-9548&amp;volume=64&amp;page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Torok and Ferenczi==
However, this meaning has been challenged by [[Maria Torok]] as she favours using the term as it is employed by [[Sándor Ferenczi]] in his essay "The Meaning of Introjection" (1912). In this context, introjection is an extension of autoerotic interests that broadens the ego by a lifting of repression so that it includes external objects in its make-up. Torok defends this meaning in her 1968 essay "The Illness of Mourning and the Fantasy of the Exquisite Corpse", where she argues that [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Melanie Klein]] confuse introjection with incorporation and that Ferenczi's definition remains crucial to analysis. She emphasized that in failed [[mourning]] 'the impotence of the process of introjection (gradual, slow, laborious, mediated, effective)' means that 'incorporation is the only choice: fantasmatic, unmediated, instantaneous, magical, sometimes hallucinatory...''crypt'' effects (of incorporation)'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Foreword", Nicolas Abraham/Maria Torok, ''The Wolf Man's Secret Word'' (1986) p. xvii and p. 119n&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Freud, the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and the [[superego]] are constructed by introjecting external behavioral patterns into the subject's own person.

==Relational mechanisms==
In Freudian terms, introjection is the aspect of the ego's system of [[relational mechanisms]] which handles checks and balances from a perspective external to what one normally considers 'oneself', infolding these inputs into the internal world of the self-definitions, where they can be weighed and balanced against one's various senses of externality. For example:
* "When a child envelops representational images of his absent parents into himself, simultaneously fusing them with his own personality." In popular culture, a classic example of this pattern is found on the television show ''[[South Park]]''. The character [[Butters Stotch]] seems to have completely internalized his father's frequent use of grounding as a punishment.
* "Individuals with weak ego [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] are more prone to use introjection as a defense mechanism."
According to [[D. W. Winnicott]], "projection and introjection mechanisms... let the other person be the manager sometimes, and to hand over [[omnipotence]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Winnicott, D.W. ''Home is Where We Start From: Essays by a Psychoanalyst''. New York, London: W.W.
Norton &amp; Company, 1986. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gestalt therapy==
In [[Gestalt therapy]], the concept of "introjection" is not identical with the psychoanalytical concept. Central to [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]]' modifications was the concept of "dental or oral aggression", when the infant develops teeth and is able to chew. They set "introjection" against "assimilation". In ''Ego, Hunger and Aggression'',&lt;ref&gt;Perls, F., ''Ego, Hunger and Aggression'' (1942, 1947) {{ISBN|0-939266-18-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz and Laura Perls suggested that when the infant develops teeth, he or she has the capacity to chew, to break apart food, and assimilate it, in contrast to swallowing before; and by analogy to experience, to taste, accept, reject or assimilate.
Laura Perls explains: "I think Freud said that development takes place through introjection, but if it remains introjection and goes no further, then it becomes a block; it becomes identification. Introjection is to a great extent unawares."&lt;ref&gt;Wysong, J./Rosenfeld, E.(eds.): ''An oral history of Gestalt therapy. Interviews with Laura Perls, Isadore From, Erving Polster, Miriam Polster'', Highland, N.Y. 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Fritz and Laura Perls made "assimilation", as opposed to "introjection", a focal theme in Gestalt therapy and in their work, and the prime means by which growth occurs in therapy. In contrast to the psychoanalytic stance, in which the "patient" introjects the (presumably more healthy) interpretations of the analyst, in Gestalt therapy the client must "taste" with awareness his or her experience, and either accept or reject it, but not introject or "swallow whole". Hence, the emphasis is on avoiding interpretation, and instead encouraging discovery. This is the key point in the divergence of Gestalt therapy from traditional psychoanalysis: growth occurs through gradual assimilation of experience in a natural way, rather than by accepting the interpretations of the analyst.

The phenomenon was identified through thought suppression studies in [[experimental psychology]]. Social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]] first studied ironic process theory in a laboratory setting in 1987. Ironic mental processes have been shown in a variety of situations, where they are usually created or worsened by [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. In extreme cases, ironic mental processes result in [[intrusive thoughts]] about doing something immoral or out of character, which can be troubling to the individual. These findings have since guided clinical practice. For example, they show why it would be unproductive to try to suppress anxiety-producing or depressing thoughts.&lt;ref name=wegnerbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wegner|first1=Daniel M.|title=White Bears and Other Unwanted Thoughts: Suppression, Obsession, and the Psychology of Mental Control|date=1989|publisher=Viking Adult|isbn=978-0670825226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Memorization and mnemonics===
Although in certain domains, such as [[memorization]], it appears that ironic effects of attempting to remember vary with the level of mental control over [[mnemonic]] processing and may simply be due to ineffective mental strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Griffith |first=J. D. |last2=Hart |first2=C. L. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Randell |first3=J.

In certain scenarios, things and stuff are strongly interrelated.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Griffith |first=J. D. |last2=Hart |first2=C. L. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Randell |first3=J.

"Intentional memory processes and their associated mnemonic strategies can be viewed as one form of mental control",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John F. Kihlstrom|author2= Terrence M.

===Experience sampling===
The [[experience sampling method|experience sampling]] or daily diary method is one way that psychologists attempt to scientifically measure thoughts. This involves "interrupting people as they go about their daily lives and asking them to record the thoughts they are having right at that moment, in that place", often by using "[[audience response|clickers]]".&lt;ref name=sex/&gt;

One research team at [[Ohio State University]] tried to figure out how often people think about [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] by using so-called "[[audience response|clickers]]", asking the 283 college students to click each time they thought about sex, food, or sleep (there were three groups of students). The study found that on average men had 19 thoughts about sex per day (the highest being 388 times per day) whereas women thought about sex ten times per day.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Terri D. Fisher|author2=Zachary T. Moore|author3=Mary-Jo Pittenger|title=Sex on the Brain?: An Examination of Frequency of Sexual Cognitions as a Function of Gender, Erotophilia, and Social Desirability|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=2012|volume=49|issue=1|pages=69–77|doi=10.1080/00224499.2011.565429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the study's flaws were that the researchers had not taken ironic process theory into their experimental design—students "were given a clicker by the researchers and asked to record when they thought about sex (or food or sleep). Imagine them walking away from the psychology department, holding the clicker in their hand, trying hard not to think about sex all the time, yet also trying hard to remember to press the clicker every time they did think about it."&lt;ref name=sex/&gt;

==Mechanisms==
Ironic process theory proposed two opposing mechanisms (a [[dual process theory]]). First, ''monitoring processes'' unconsciously and automatically monitor for occurrences of the unwanted thought, calling upon the second—''conscious operating processes''—if the thought occurs. This theory explains the effects of increased [[cognitive load]] by emphasizing that where there is cognitive effort, the monitoring process may supplant the conscious process, also suggesting that in order for thought suppression to be effective, a balance between the two processes must exist, with the cognitive demand not being so great as to let the monitoring process interrupt the conscious processes.&lt;ref name="wegner1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wegner |first=Daniel M. |last2=Schneider |first2=David J. |last3=Carter |first3=Samuel R.|lastauthoramp=yes |last4=White |first4=Teri L. |title=Paradoxical effects of thought suppression |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |year=1987 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=5–13 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.1.5 |pmid=3612492}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 study found that individual differences may be able to account for differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Geraerts |first=E. |last2=Merckelbach |first2=H. |last3=Jelicic |first3=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Smeets |first4=E. |year=2006 |title=Long term consequences of suppression of intrusive anxious thoughts and repressive coping |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=1451–1460 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2005.11.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=October 2014}}

Cognitive overload inhibits successful activation of operating processes. Such overload has been shown to occur experimentally, when individuals attempt to aggressively suppress intrusive thoughts by [[Distraction|distracting]] themselves—either by focusing on different environmental objects, or thinking of anything but the thought in question. (Overload is also believed to occur in daily life as a result of mental pressures, anxieties, stresses, and so forth). The monitoring process, serving to alert the individual to an unwanted thought about to become salient and intrude on his or her consciousness, continues to find instances of the unwanted thought creating a state of hyper-accessibility unchecked by controlled cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Aronson |first=Elliot |last2=Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin M. |year=2007 |title=Social Psychology |edition=6th |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=0-13-233487-9 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that individuals do have a capacity to successfully suppress thoughts by focusing on specifically prepared distractions or objects—a process in [[thought suppression]] experiments sometimes referred to as "focused distraction".&lt;ref name="wegner1987" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Similar ideas appear throughout popular culture and sayings, often with variations on animal and color, such as "It's as hard as trying not to think of a pink rhinoceros."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watoday.com.au/opinion/a-fascination-with-fire-is-elementary-20090309-8t91.html |title=A Fascination with Fire Is Elementary |last=Sutton |first=Jill |date=9 March 2009 |work=[[WAtoday]] |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironic process theory is also the basis for the mind game known as "[[The Game (mind game)|The Game]]", which constitutes trying not to think about the Game.

At the end of the 1984 movie ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', the characters are asked to think of a form for the coming of [[Gozer]]. They instruct each other not to think of anything, which sees one of the team, Ray, thinking of what he considers to be an innocuous thought of the [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]], who then terrorizes them.

In an episode of ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'', Mira uses Ironic Process Theory to outsmart the Emperor Zerg, who has stolen her mind reading powers.

The idea figures heavily into the episode "[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]" of British television series ''[[Black Mirror]]''.

'''Kindness''' is a behavior marked by [[ethics|ethical]] characteristics, a pleasant [[disposition]], and concern and consideration for others. It is considered a [[virtue]], and is recognized as a [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] in many cultures and religions (see [[ethics in religion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Khazan |first=Olga |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/it-pays-to-be-nice/396512/ |title=It Pays to Be Nice |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=Jun 23, 2015 |accessdate=August 16, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Book II of "[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]", Aristotle defines kindness as "helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the person helped".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~honeyl/Rhetoric/rhet2-7.html |title=Kindness |author=Aristotle (translated by Lee Honeycutt) |work=Rhetoric, book 2, chapter 7 |accessdate=2005-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213221951/http://www.public.iastate.edu/~honeyl/Rhetoric/rhet2-7.html |archivedate=December 13, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] considered kindness and love to be the "most curative herbs and agents in human intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm.

==In society==
In human [[mating choice]], studies suggest that both men and women value kindness and intelligence in their prospective mates, along with physical appearance, attractiveness, social status, and age.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M., et al. "Sex differences in jealousy: Evolution, physiology, and psychology." Psychological science 3.4 (1992): 251-255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology|first1= Henry |last1= Gleitman|first2=James |last2= Gross|first3=Daniel |last3= Reisberg|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nice guy===
{{main|Nice guy}}
A "nice guy" is an informal and usually stereotypical term for an (often young) adult male who portrays himself as gentle, compassionate, sensitive, and/or vulnerable.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McDaniel |first=A. K. |year=2005 |title=Young Women's Dating Behavior: Why/Why Not Date a Nice Guy? |journal=Sex Roles |volume=53 |issue=5–6 |pages=347–359 |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-6758-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used both positively and negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divalion.livejournal.com/163615.html |title=No More Mr. Nice Guy |first= |last=divalion |date=12 July 2005 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117015253/http://divalion.livejournal.com/163615.html |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used positively, and particularly when used as a preference or description by someone else, it is intended to imply a male who puts the needs of others before his own, avoids confrontations, does favors, gives emotional support, tries to stay out of trouble, and generally acts nicely towards others.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Dr. Robert, http://nomoremrniceguy.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of a relationship, it may also refer to traits of honesty, loyalty, romanticism, courtesy and respect. When used negatively, a nice guy implies a male who is unassertive, does not express his true feelings and, in the context of dating (in which the term is often used&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt;), uses acts of [[Wiktionary:ostensible#English|ostensible]] friendship with the unstated aim of progressing to a romantic or sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/opinion/2014/4/2/when-nice-guys-are-sexist-with-a-smile | title=When nice guys are sexist with a smile | publisher=Berkeley Beacon | date=2 April 2014 | accessdate=9 December 2014 | author=Blomquist, Daniel | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320074725/http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/opinion/2014/4/2/when-nice-guys-are-sexist-with-a-smile | archivedate=20 March 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maneater"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Rivu|title=The Friend Zone is Sexist|url=http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2014/2/13/friend-zone-sexist/|website=The Maneater|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==
Based on experiments at Yale University using games with babies, some studies concluded that kindness is inherent to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/video/magazine/1247467772000/can-babies-tell-right-from-wrong-.html Can Babies Tell Right From Wrong?, Babies at Yale University's Infant Cognition Center respond to "naughty" and "nice" puppets., May 5, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar studies about the root of empathy in babies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/28/science/researchers-trace-empathy-s-roots-to-infancy.html?pagewanted=all Researchers Trace Empathy's Roots to Infancy, Daniel Goleman, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
* The ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' an ancient [[Indian literature|Indian work]] on [[ethics]] and [[morality]], dedicates a separate chapter on kindness (Chapter 8, verses 71–80), furthering the value in other chapters, such as [[hospitality]] (verses 81–90), uttering pleasant words (verses 91–100), [[compassion]] (verses 241–250), [[vegetarianism]] (verses 251–260), [[non-violence]] (verses 311–320), [[non-killing]] (verses 321–330), and [[benignity]] (verses 571–580), among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} verses 71-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf |title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary |publisher=W.H.

* [[Mark Twain]] from a [[compassion]] point of view considered "Kindness [as a] language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorette M. Enochs|title=Seeds of Recovery: A Journal of 101 Mental Health Reflections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFafDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76|date=21 November 2016|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-5246-5181-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been suggested that 'most of [[Shakespeare]]'s opus could be considered a study of human kindness'.&lt;ref&gt;Lagrette Tallent Lenker, ''Fathers and Daughters in Shakespeare and Shaw'' (2001) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] considered that 'the essence of love is kindness; and indeed it may best be defined as passionate kindness: kindness, so to speak, run mad and become importunate and violent'.&lt;ref&gt;robert Louis Stevenson, ''Virginibus Puerisque'' (London 1909) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Christian apostle Paul lists kindness as one of the nine traits considered to be the "[[fruit of the Spirit]]" &lt;ref&gt;Galatians 5:22, New International Version&lt;/ref&gt; in Galatians 5:22. In [[1_Corinthians_13#English_translation|1 Corinthians 13:4]] he states, "Love is patient, love is kind."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 13:4, New International Version&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
Based on the [[Pay It Forward (novel)|novel of the same name]] written in 1999 by author [[Catherine Ryan Hyde]], the motion picture [[Pay It Forward (film)|''Pay it Forward'']], which starred [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Helen Hunt]], [[Haley Joel Osment]] and [[Jon Bon Jovi]], illustrates the power one person can have to impact a chain reaction of kind deeds. The philosophy of Pay It Forward is that through acts of kindness among strangers, we all foster a more caring society. In the book and film, Reuben St. Clair, a [[social studies]] teacher in [[Atascadero, California]], challenges his students to "change the world". One of his students, Trevor, takes the challenge to heart. He starts by showing kindness to a stranger which ripples further than he could have ever imagined.

In October 2011, [[Life Vest Inside]] posted a video called "Kindness Boomerang".&lt;ref name="Kindness Boomerang"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwAYpLVyeFU|title=Kindness Boomerang|publisher=[[YouTube]]/Life Vest Inside|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;It shows how one [[Random kindness|act of kindness]] passes seamlessly from one person to the next and boomerangs back to the person who set it into motion. Orly Wahba, Life Vest Inside Founder and Director of Kindness Boomerang explains that each scene was based on real life experiences she personally went through; moments of kindness that left a lasting impression on her life. Within several months after its release, Kindness Boomerang went viral; reaching over 20 million people globally and eventually landing Wahba spot on the TED2013&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn9VxUPlC5g "TED Talk - Kindness - Orly Wahba"], ''YouTube/TED Conferences''. Retrieved January 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; stage to speak about the power of kindness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7581">'''Language nest'''s, an [[language immersion|immersion]]-based approach to [[language revitalization]], originated in [[New Zealand]] in 1982 as a part of the [[Māori language revival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/livingthelanguage/2012/04/2012416141630195978.html|title = New Zealand: The Maori|date = July 17, 2014|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = Al Jazeera|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "language nest" is a translation of the Māori phrase [[Māori language revival#K.C5.8Dhanga reo|''kōhanga reo'']].

In a language nest, older speakers of the language take part in [[early childhood education|early-childhood education]] with a view to improving intergenerational language transference.

== In New Zealand ==
The first ''kōhanga reo'' was founded in [[Wainuiomata]] in 1982, and was followed by the establishment of primary schools and secondary schools ([[Kura Kaupapa Māori]]) where [[Māori language|Māori]] is the primary language of instruction.

According to Al Jazeera, the percentage of Maori people speaking the language has increased by a few percentage points from the early 1980s to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/livingthelanguage/2012/04/2012416141630195978.html|title = New Zealand: The Maori|date = July 17, 2014|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = Al Jazeera|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Christopher Moseley says that this statistic is "quite encouraging" because "compared to how quickly a language can disappear, in just one generation in extreme cases, the figures are good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/livingthelanguage/2012/04/2012416141630195978.html|title = New Zealand: The Maori|date = July 17, 2014|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = Al Jazeera|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with UMD's College of Education and Human Services Professionals and Eni-gikendaasoyang, the Center for Indigenous Knowledge and [[Language revitalization|Language Revitalization]], the program targets 4-5 year olds in a half day session in the [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://d.umn.edu/external-affairs/homepage/10/languagenest.html|title=Enweyang Ojibwe Language Nest|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Minnesota Duluth|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[North Dakota]], Lakȟól’yapi Wahóȟpi, the Lakota Language Immersion Nest, opened on September 12, 2012. Full day schooling aimed at 3-year olds, with parents also receiving training to encourage at home efforts is key to this program. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lastrealindians.com/lakota-language-immersion-nest/|title=Lakota Language Immersion Nest|date=2012-09-10|work=Last Real Indians|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, the [[Australian government]] pledged to pilot language nests as part of its National Indigenous Languages Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov.au/indigenous/languages_policy|title=Indigenous Languages Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of five Aboriginal language and culture nests in [[New South Wales]] launched in 2013, although these are government service delivery centres and not immersion pre-schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theconversation.com/language-nests-a-way-to-revive-indigenous-languages-at-risk-19824|title = Language Nests: a way to revive Indigenous languages at risk|date = November 12, 2013|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = The Conversation|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aboriginal Language and Culture Nests - Aboriginal Affairs|url = http://www.aboriginalaffairs.nsw.gov.au/aboriginal-language-and-culture-nests/|accessdate = 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Miriwoong]] Language Nest has been running in [[Kununurra]] since early 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://soundcloud.com/abcwa/theyre-just-so-proud-to-see-their-grandchildren-learning-their-language|title = They're just so proud to see their grandchildren learning their language|date = |accessdate = March 30, 2015|website = |publisher = ABC Kimberley|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 300 children attending per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mirima.org.au/language-nest.html|title = Language Nest|date = |accessdate = March 30, 2015|website = |publisher = Mirima Dawang Woorlab-gerring Language and Culture Centre|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Canada ==
A study in 2004 reported on two language nests in British Columbia: a ''Cseyseten'' ("language nest") at [[Adam’s Lake]] in the [[Secwepemc]] language, and a ''Clao7alcw'' ("Raven’s nest") at [[Lil’wat Nation]] in the [[Lillooet language|Lil’wat]] language written about by [[Onowa McIvor]] for her Master's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fpcc.ca/files/PDF/language-nest-programs_in_BC.pdf|title = Language Nest programs in BC (MA Thesis)|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = McIvor|first = Onowa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Peoples' Cultural Council]] in Canada provides grants to [[First Nations]] communities in [[British Columbia]] as part of the Pre-School Language Nest Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fpcc.ca/language/Programs/Language-nest.aspx|title = Pre-School Language Nest Program|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = First People's Cultural Council|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Northwest Territories]], there are language nests for each of the official Aboriginal languages, with more than 20 language nests in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ece.gov.nt.ca/early-childhood-and-school-services/early-childhood/language-nests|title = Language Nests|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = Northwest Territories: Education, Culture, and Employment|publisher = Government of the Northwest Territories|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Estonia==

There is only one language nest for [[Võro language|Võro]] working three days a week in [[Haanja]] and several initiatives, so called "language nest days" (''keelepesäpäiv'') that are working one day in week in 18 different kindergartens of Võro area. Võro language nest initiatives are organised by [[Võro Institute]].

==In Finland==

There are language nests for [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sámi]], [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], and the Karelian languages in Finland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12724">The '''Law of Demeter''' ('''LoD''') or '''principle of least knowledge''' is a design guideline for developing [[software]], particularly [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented programs]]. In its general form, the LoD is a specific case of [[loose coupling]]. The guideline was proposed by Ian Holland at [[Northeastern University]] towards the end of 1987, and can be succinctly summarized in each of the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
* Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
* Only talk to your immediate friends.

The fundamental notion is that a given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of anything else (including its subcomponents), in accordance with the principle of "[[information hiding]]". It may be viewed as a corollary to the [[principle of least privilege]], which dictates that a module possess only the information and resources necessary for its legitimate purpose.

It is so named for its origin in the [[Demeter Project]], an [[adaptive programming]] and [[aspect-oriented programming]] effort. The project was named in honor of [[Demeter]], “distribution-mother” and the Greek [[goddess]] of [[agriculture]], to signify a bottom-up philosophy of programming which is also embodied in the law itself.{{Citation needed|reason=No source given for naming the Law of Demeter after the Demeter Project, or for naming the project after the Greek goddess|date=May 2018}}

==In object-oriented programming==
When applied to [[object-oriented]] programs, the Law of Demeter can be more precisely called the “Law of Demeter for Functions/Methods” (LoD-F). In this case, an object &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; can request a service (call a method) of an object instance &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, but object &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; should not "reach through" object &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; to access yet another object, &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;, to request its services. Doing so would mean that object &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; implicitly requires greater knowledge of object &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;'s internal structure.
Instead, &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;'s interface should be modified if necessary so it can directly serve object &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;'s request, propagating it to any relevant subcomponents. Alternatively, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; might have a direct reference to object &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; and make the request directly to that. If the law is followed, only object &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; knows its own internal structure.

More formally, the Law of Demeter for functions requires that a method &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; of an object &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; may only invoke the methods of the following kinds of objects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title      = The Paperboy, The Wallet, and The Law Of Demeter

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; itself
# &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;'s parameters
# Any objects created/instantiated within &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;'s direct component objects
# A global variable, accessible by &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;, in the scope of &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;

In particular, an object should avoid invoking methods of a member object returned by another method. For many modern object oriented languages that use a dot as field identifier, the law can be stated simply as "use only one dot". That is, the code &lt;code&gt;a.b.Method()&lt;/code&gt; breaks the law where &lt;code&gt;a.Method()&lt;/code&gt; does not. As an [[analogy]], when one wants a dog to walk, one does not command the dog's legs to walk directly; instead one commands the dog which then commands its own legs.

==Advantages==
The advantage of following the Law of Demeter is that the resulting software tends to be more [[maintainability|maintainable]] and [[Adaptive reuse|adaptable]]. Since objects are less dependent on the internal structure of other objects, object containers can be changed without reworking their callers.

Following the Law of Demeter can result in a lower RFC. However, the results also suggest that an increase in ''Weighted Methods per Class''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maisqual.squoring.com/wiki/index.php/Weighted_Methods_per_Class|title=Weighted Methods per Class - Maisqual Wiki|website=maisqual.squoring.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (WMC, the number of methods defined in each class) can increase the probability of software bugs. Following the Law of Demeter can also result in a higher WMC; see [[#Disadvantages|Disadvantages]].

A [[multilayered architecture]] can be considered to be a systematic mechanism for implementing the Law of Demeter in a software system.
In a layered architecture, code within each [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layer]] can only make calls to code within the layer and code within the next layer down.
"Layer skipping" would violate the layered architecture.

==Disadvantages==
Although the LoD increases the adaptiveness of a software system, it may (but not necessarily will) result in having to write many wrapper methods to propagate calls to components; in some cases, this can add noticeable time and space overhead.&lt;ref name=Basili/&gt;&lt;ref name=BradApp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradapp.com/docs/demeter-intro.html |title=Introducing Demeter and its Laws | last=Appleton | first=Brad |accessdate=6 July 2013 |quote=A side-effect of this is that if you conform to LoD, while it may quite increase the maintainability and "adaptiveness" of your software system, you also end up having to write lots of little wrapper methods to propagate methods calls to its components (which can add noticeable time and space overhead).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pragmatic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask |title=Tell, Don't Ask |publisher=The Pragmatic Programmers, LLC |accessdate=6 July 2013 |quote=The disadvantage, of course, is that you end up writing many small wrapper methods that do very little but delegate container traversal and such. The cost tradeoff is between that inefficiency and higher class coupling.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the method level, the LoD leads to narrow interfaces, giving access to only as much information as it needs to do its job, as each method needs to know about a small set of methods of closely related objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where the behavior of the method is specified as an aspect at a high level of abstraction. This is done by having an adaptive method that encapsulates the behaviour of an operation into a place, with which the scattering problem is solved. It also abstracts over the class structure that results in avoiding the tangling problem. The wide interfaces are managed through a language that specifies implementations. Both the traversal strategy and the adaptive visitor use only a minimal set of classes that participate in the operation, and the information about the connections between these classes is abstracted out.

Since the LoD exemplifies a specific type of coupling, and does not specify a method of addressing this type of coupling, it is more suited as a metric for [[code smell]] as opposed to a methodology for building loosely coupled systems.

[[File:Majestic Liberty Large.jpg|thumb|right|''Liberty Enlightening the World'', known as the [[Statue of Liberty]], was donated to the US by France and is an artistic personification of liberty.]]
Broadly speaking, '''liberty''' ([[Latin]]: ''Libertas'') is the ability to do as one pleases.&lt;ref&gt;The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 2005, Merriam-Webster, Inc, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-636-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In politics, liberty consists of the social, political, and economic freedoms to which all community members are entitled.&lt;ref&gt;"Each of those social and political freedoms which are considered to be the entitlement of all members of a community; a civil liberty." ''Oxford English Dictionary''.[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107898?rskey=Fm0VI1&amp;result=1#eid]&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy, liberty involves [[free will]] as contrasted with, [[determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The fact of not being controlled by or subject to fate; freedom of will." ''Oxford English Dictionary''.[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107898?rskey=Fm0VI1&amp;result=1#eid]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[theology]], liberty is freedom from the effects of "sin, spiritual servitude, [or] worldly ties."&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom from the bondage or dominating influence of sin, spiritual servitude, worldly ties." ''Oxford English Dictionary''.[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107898?rskey=Fm0VI1&amp;result=1#eid]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word "freedom" primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word "liberty" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others.&lt;ref name=mill1&gt;Mill, J.S. (1869)., "Chapter I: Introductory", ''On Liberty''. http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus liberty entails the [[duty|responsible]] use of freedom under the [[rule of law]] without depriving anyone else of their freedom. Freedom is more broad in that it represents a total lack of restraint or the unrestrained ability to fulfill one's desires. For example, a person can have the freedom to murder, but not have the liberty to murder, as the latter example deprives others of their right not to be harmed.  Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts.

The word "liberty" is often used in slogans, such as "[[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]"&lt;ref&gt;The Declaration of Independence, ''The World Almanac'', 2016, {{ISBN|978-1-60057-201-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://franceintheus.org/spip.php?article620&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Free will}}
Philosophers from earliest times have considered the question of liberty. Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (121–180 AD) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"a polity in which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, "Meditations", Book I, Wordsworth Classics of World Literature, {{ISBN|1853264865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679):&lt;blockquote&gt;"a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', Part 2, Ch. XXI).&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[John Locke]] (1632–1704) rejected that definition of liberty. While not specifically mentioning Hobbes, he attacks Sir Robert Filmer who had the same definition. According to Locke:

:"In the state of nature, liberty consists of being free from any superior power on Earth. People are not under the will or lawmaking authority of others but have only the law of nature for their rule. In political society, liberty consists of being under no other lawmaking power except that established by consent in the commonwealth. People are free from the dominion of any will or legal restraint apart from that enacted by their own constituted lawmaking power according to the trust put in it. Thus, freedom is not as Sir Robert Filmer defines it: 'A liberty for everyone to do what he likes, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.' Freedom is constrained by laws in both the state of nature and political society. Freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. Freedom of people under government is to be under no restraint apart from standing rules to live by that are common to everyone in the society and made by the lawmaking power established in it. Persons have a right or liberty to (1) follow their own will in all things that the law has not prohibited and (2) not be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, and arbitrary wills of others."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Two Treatises on Government]]: A Translation into Modern English'', ISR, 2009, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|right|[[John Stuart Mill]].]]

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873), in his work, ''[[On Liberty]]'', was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;Westbrooks, Logan Hart (2008) "Personal Freedom" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4gxaa371USUC&amp;pg=PA134 p. 134] ''In'' Owens, William (compiler) (2008) ''Freedom: Keys to Freedom from Twenty-one National Leaders'' Main Street Publications, Memphis, Tennessee, p3–38, {{ISBN|978-0-9801152-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]'', [[Isaiah Berlin]] formally framed the differences between these two perspectives as the distinction between two opposite concepts of liberty: [[positive liberty]] and [[negative liberty]]. The latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from [[tyranny]] and the [[arbitrary]] exercise of [[authority]], while the former refers to the liberty that comes from self-mastery, the freedom from inner compulsions such as weakness and fear.

{{main|Political freedom}}
[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Magna Carta]] (originally known as the Charter of Liberties) of 1215, written in iron gall ink on parchment in medieval Latin, using standard abbreviations of the period.

=== History ===
[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 226 - John Signs the Great Charter.jpg|thumb|A romanticised 19th-century recreation of King John signing the [[Magna Carta]]]]

The modern concept of political liberty has its origins in the Greek concepts of freedom and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Junius P. (2007) ''The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery: A–K'' ; Vol. II, L–Z,&lt;/ref&gt; To be free, to the Greeks, was not to have a master, to be independent from a master (to live as one likes).&lt;ref&gt;Mogens Herman Hansen, 2010, Democratic Freedom and the Concept of Freedom in Plato and Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt; That was the original Greek concept of freedom. It is closely linked with the concept of democracy, as Aristotle put it:

:"This, then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This, they say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

This applied only to free men. In Athens, for instance, women could not vote or hold office and were legally and socially dependent on a male relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mikalson|first=Jon|title=Ancient Greek Religion|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405181778|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8o6xxlwbldcC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=ancient+Greece+++rights+women&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20Greece%20%20%20rights%20women|edition=2nd|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] enjoyed some degree of freedom. Citizens of all [[religion]]s and [[ethnic group]]s were given the same rights and had the same [[freedom of religion]], women had the same rights as men, and [[slavery]] was abolished (550 BC). All the palaces of the kings of Persia were built by paid workers in an era when slaves typically did such work.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Henry Robertson, John Graham Merrills (1996).

In the Buddhist [[Maurya Empire]] of [[History of India|ancient India]], citizens of all religions and ethnic groups had some rights to [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], and [[equality before the law|equality]]. The need for tolerance on an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] basis can be found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts]] of [[Ashoka the Great]], which emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] also appears to have been condemned by Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amartya Sen]] (1997). ''Human Rights and Asian Values''. {{ISBN|0-87641-151-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery also appears to have been non-existent in the Maurya Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Indica (Arrian)|Indica]]'':
&lt;br&gt;{{quote|"This also is remarkable in [[History of India|India]], that all Indians are free, and no Indian at all is a slave. In this the Indians agree with the [[Lacedaemonian]]s. Yet the Lacedaemonians have [[Helot]]s for slaves, who perform the duties of slaves; but the Indians have no slaves at all, much less is any Indian a slave."}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, "Ashoka's orders seem to have been resisted right from the beginning."&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund (2004).

[[Roman law]] also embraced certain limited forms of liberty, even under the rule of the Roman Emperors. However, these liberties were accorded only to [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]].  Many of the liberties enjoyed under Roman law endured through the Middle Ages, but were enjoyed solely by the [[nobility]], rarely by the common man.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The idea of inalienable and universal liberties had to wait until the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

=== Social contract ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|Right|[[Eugène Delacroix]] – ''[[Liberty Leading the People|Liberty Leading the People (La liberté guidant le people)]]'' (1830)]]
[[File:French-Liberty-British-Slavery-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''French Liberty. British Slavery'' (1792), [[James Gillray]] caricatured French "liberty" as the opportunity to starve and British "slavery" as bloated complaints about taxation.]]
The [[social contract]] theory, most influentially formulated by [[Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Rousseau]] (though first suggested by Plato in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''), was among the first to provide a political classification of [[rights]], in particular through the notion of [[sovereignty]] and of [[natural rights]]. The thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[logic|reasoned]] that [[law]] governed both heavenly and human affairs, and that law gave the [[monarch|king]] his power, rather than the king's power giving force to law. This conception of law would find its culmination in the ideas of [[Montesquieu]]. The conception of law as a relationship between individuals, rather than families, came to the fore, and with it the increasing focus on [[individualism|individual liberty]] as a fundamental reality, given by "[[Nature]] and [[God|Nature's God]]," which, in the [[utopia|ideal state]], would be as universal as possible.

In ''[[On Liberty]]'', [[John Stuart Mill]] sought to define the "...nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual," and as such, he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus, the prevailing question becomes "how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control".&lt;ref name=mill1 /&gt;

==Origins of political freedom==

=== England and Great Britain ===
England and following the [[Act of Union 1707]] Great Britain, laid down the cornerstones to the concept of individual liberty.

In 1166 [[Henry II of England]] transformed English law by passing the [[Assize of Clarendon]] act.

In 1215 the [[Magna Carta]] was drawn up, it became the cornerstone of liberty in first England, Great Britain and later, the world.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=278}}{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}}

In 1689 the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] grants 'freedom of speech in Parliament', which lays out some of the earliest [[civil rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of Rights|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/510billofrights.html|publisher=British Library|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859 an essay by the philosopher John Stuart Mill, entitled ''[[On Liberty]]'' argues for toleration and individuality. ''If any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |year=1859 |title= On Liberty |publisher=John W.Parker &amp; Son |place=London |edition= 2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AjpGAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AHMraC_Owoi8C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |year=1864 |title= On Liberty |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman Roberts &amp; Green |place=London |edition= 3 |url= https://archive.org/details/onliberty00inmill |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 ''[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]'', by [[Isaiah Berlin]], determines 'negative liberty' as an obstacle, as evident from 'positive liberty' which promotes self-mastery and the concepts of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Ian|title=''Positive and Negative Liberty''|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/|date=5 March 2012|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 British representatives attempt to and are prevented from adding a legal framework to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. (It was not until 1976 that the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

=== United States ===

According to the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]], all men have a natural right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". But this declaration of liberty was troubled from the outset by the presence of slavery.  Slave owners argued that their liberty was paramount, since it involved property, their slaves, and that Blacks had no rights that any White man was obliged to recognize.  The Supreme Court, in the [[Dred Scott]] decision, upheld this principle.  It was not until 1866, following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], that the US Constitution was amended to extend these rights to persons of color, and not until 1920 that these rights were extended to women.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of the United States of America, ''The World Almanac and book of facts'' (2012), pp. 485–86, Amendment XIV "Citizenship Rights not to be abridged.", Amendment XV "Race no bar to voting rights.", Amendment XIX, "Giving nationwide suffrage to women.". World Almanac Books, {{ISBN|978-1-60057-147-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the later half of the 20th century, liberty was expanded further to prohibit government interference with personal choices.  In the United States Supreme Court decision ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', Justice [[William O. Douglas]] argued that liberties relating to personal relationships, such as marriage, have a unique primacy of place in the hierarchy of freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;''Griswold v. Connecticut''. 381 U.S. 479 (1965) Decided June 7, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob M. Appel has summarized this principle:
{{quote|I am grateful that I have rights in the proverbial public square – but, as a practical matter, my most cherished rights are those that I possess in my bedroom and hospital room and death chamber. Most people are far more concerned that they can control their own bodies than they are about petitioning Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/a-culture-of-liberty_b_242402.html|title=A Culture of Liberty|date=21 July 2009|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In modern America, various competing ideologies have divergent views about how best to promote liberty.  [[Liberalism|Liberals]] in the original sense of the word see equality as a necessary component of freedom.  [[Progressive Era|Progressives]] stress freedom from business monopoly as essential.  [[Libertarian]]s disagree, and see economic freedom as best.  The [[Tea Party movement]] sees big government as the enemy of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Capitol Reader|title=Summary of Give Us Liberty: A Tea Party Manifesto – Dick Armey and Matt Kibbe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGuxEfI9GwcC&amp;pg=PP9|date=21 June 2013|publisher=Primento|isbn=978-2-511-00084-7|pages=9–10}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |last=Haidt |first=Jonathan |date=16 October 2010 |title=What the Tea Partiers Really Want |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703673604575550243700895762 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc |access-date=17 March 2015 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald P.

=== France ===
France supported the Americans in their revolt against English rule and, in 1789, [[French Revolution|overthrew]] their own monarchy, with the cry of "Liberté, égalité, fraternité".  The bloodbath that followed, known as the [[reign of terror]], soured many people on the idea of liberty. Edmund Burke, considered one of the fathers of [[conservatism]], wrote "The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. C. D., ''Edmund Burke: Reflections on the Revolution in France: a Critical Edition'', 2001, Stanford. pp. 66–67, {{ISBN|0-8047-3923-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies==

=== Liberalism ===
{{Main|Liberalism}}
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
According to the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', liberalism is "the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize [[freedom of choice]]".  But they point out that there is considerable discussion about how to achieve those goals.  Every discussion of freedom depends on three key components: who is free, what they are free to do, and what forces restrict their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  John Gray argues that the core belief of liberalism is toleration.  Liberals allow others freedom to do what they want, in exchange for having the same freedom in return.  This idea of freedom is personal rather than political.&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Two Faces of Liberalism'', The New Press, 1990, {{ISBN|1-56584-589-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  William Safire points out that liberalism is attacked by both the Right and the Left: by the Right for defending such practices as abortion, homosexuality, and atheism, and by the Left for defending free enterprise and the rights of the individual over the collective.&lt;ref&gt;William Safire, ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', "Liberalism takes criticism from both the right and the left,...", p. 388, Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19534334-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libertarianism ===
{{Main|Libertarianism|Minarchism|Libertarian Socialism|Anarcho-capitalism}}
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [[Libertarians]] hold liberty as their primary political value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libertarianism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339321/libertarianism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2014-05-20|quote=libertarianism, political philosophy that takes individual liberty to be the primary political value}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach to implementing liberty involves opposing any governmental coercion, aside from that which is necessary to prevent individuals from coercing each other.&lt;ref&gt;David Kelley, "Life, liberty, and property." ''Social Philosophy and Policy'' (1984) 1#2 pp. 108–18.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Republican liberty ===
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
According to republican theorists of freedom, like the historian [[Quentin Skinner]]&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Skinner, contributor and co-editor, ''Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Volume I: Republicanism and Constitutionalism in Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-521-67235-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quentil Skinner, contributor and co-editor, ''Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Volume II:  The Values of Republicanism in Early Modern Europe'' Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-521-67234-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the philosopher [[Philip Pettit]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Pettit, ''Republicanism: a theory of freedom and government'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; one's liberty should not be viewed as the absence of interference in one's actions, but as non-domination. According to this view, which originates in the Roman [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]], to be a ''liber homo'', a free man, means not being subject to another's arbitrary will, that is to say, dominated by another. They also cite [[Machiavelli]] who asserted that you must be a member of a free self-governing civil association, a republic, if you are to enjoy individual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Machiavelli, ''Discourses on Livy'', Harvey C. Mansfield &amp; Nathan Tarcov, translators, University of Chicago Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-226-50036-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominance of this view of liberty among parliamentarians during the [[English Civil War]] resulted in the creation of the liberal concept of freedom as non-interference in Thomas Hobbes' [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Socialism ===
{{Main|Socialism}}
{{Socialism sidebar}}
Socialists view freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to a purely abstract ideal. Freedom is a state of being where individuals have [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] to pursue their creative interests unhindered by coercive social relationships, specifically those they are forced to engage in as a requisite for survival under a given social system. Freedom thus requires both the material economic conditions that make freedom possible alongside social relationships and institutions conducive to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bhargava|first= Rajeev |title= Political Theory: An Introduction |publisher= Pearson Education India|date=2008|isbn=|page = 255|quote=Genuine freedom as Marx described it, would become possible only when life activity was no longer constrained by the requirements of production or by the limitations of material scarcity…Thus, in the socialist view, freedom is not an abstract ideal but a concrete situation that ensues only when certain conditions of interaction between man and nature (material conditions), and man and other men (social relations) are fulfilled.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist conception of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of creativity and individuality. Influenced by [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of alienated labor, socialists understand freedom to be the ability for an individual to engage in creative work in the absence of alienation, where "alienated labor" refers to work people are forced to perform and un-alienated work refers to individuals pursuing their own creative interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodwin|first= Barbara |title= Using Political Ideas |publisher= Wiley|date=2007|isbn=978-0470025529|pages = 107–09|quote=Socialists consider the pleasures of creation equal, if not superior, to those of acquisition and consumption, hence the importance of work in socialist society.  Whereas the capitalist/Calvinist work ethic applauds the moral virtue of hard work, idealistic socialists emphasize the joy. This vision of 'creative man', Homo Faber, has consequences for their view of freedom...Socialist freedom is the freedom to unfold and develop one's potential, especially through unalienated work.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marxism ====
{{Main|Marxism}}
For Karl Marx, meaningful freedom is only attainable in a [[communist society]] characterized by superabundance and free access. Such a social arrangement would eliminate the need for alienated labor and enable individuals to pursue their own creative interests, leaving them to develop and maximize their full potentialities. This goes alongside Marx's emphasis on the ability of socialism and communism progressively reducing the average length of the workday to expand the "realm of freedom", or discretionary free time, for each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wood|first= John Cunningham |title= Karl Marx's Economics: Critical Assessments I |publisher= Routledge|date=1996|isbn=978-0415087148|pages = 248–49|quote=Affluence and increased provision of free goods would reduce alienation in the work process and, in combination with (1), the alienation of man's 'species-life'. Greater leisure would create opportunities for creative and artistic activity outside of work.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Peffer|first= Rodney G. |title= Marxism, Morality, and Social Justice |publisher= Princeton University Press|date=2014|isbn= 9780691608884|page = 73|quote= Marx believed the reduction of necessary labor time to be, evaluatively speaking, an absolute necessity. He claims that real wealth is the developed productive force of all individuals. It is no longer the labor time but the disposable time that is the measure of wealth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's notion of communist society and human freedom is thus radically individualistic.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx on Equality"&gt;''Karl Marx on Equality'', by Woods, Allen. http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf: "A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed. It would instead be a society in which individuals freely act as the truly human individuals they are. Marx's radical communism was, in this way, also radically individualistic."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural prerequisites==
Some authors have suggested that a virtuous culture must exist as a prerequisite for liberty. Benjamin Franklin stated that "only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters."&lt;ref&gt;The Writings of Benjamin Franklin 569 (Albert H. Smyth ed., 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Madison likewise declared: "To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea."&lt;ref&gt;The Writings of James Madison 223 (Gaillard Hunt ed., 1904).&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams acknowledged: "Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is  wholly inadequate to the government of any other."&lt;ref&gt;John R. Howe, Jr., The Changing Political Thought of John Adams 165 (1966) (quoting from John Adams' "Reply to the Massachusetts Militia," Oct. 11, 1789).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9741">The term ''metafunction'' originates in [[systemic functional linguistics]] and is considered to be a property of all languages. [[Systemic functional linguistics]] is functional and semantic rather than formal and syntactic in its orientation. As a functional linguistic theory, it claims that both the emergence of grammar and the particular forms that grammars take should be explained “in terms of the functions that language evolved to serve”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1994. "Systemic Theory". In R.E. Asher (ed) ''Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', Vol 8. Pergamon Press. Reprinted in full in Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. ''On Language and Linguistics: Volume 3 in the ''Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; While languages vary in how and what they do, and what humans do with them in the contexts of human cultural practice, all languages are considered to be shaped and organised in relation to three functions, or metafunctions. [[Michael Halliday]], the founder of systemic functional linguistics, calls these three functions the ''ideational'', ''interpersonal'', and ''textual''. The ideational function is further divided into the ''experiential'' and ''logical''.

Metafunctions are ''systemic clusters''; that is, they are groups of semantic systems that make meanings of a related kind. The three metafunctions are mapped onto the structure of the clause. For this reason, systemic linguists analyse a clause from three perspectives. Halliday argues that the concept of metafunction is one of a small set of principles that are necessary to explain how language works; this concept of function in language is necessary to explain the organisation of the semantic system of language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Function is considered to be "a fundamental property of language itself".&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ruqaiya Hasan]], the metafunctions in SFL "are not hierarchised; they have equal status, and each is manifested in every act of language use: in fact, an important task for grammatics is to describe how the three metafunctions are woven together into the same linguistic unit".&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan argues that this is one way in which Halliday's account of the functions of language is different from that of [[Karl Bühler]], for example, for whom functions of language are hierarchically ordered, with the referential function the most important of all. For Buhler, the functions were considered to operate one at a time. In SFL, the metafunctions operate simultaneously, and any utterance is a harmony of choices across all three functions.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideational function==
The ideational function is language concerned with building and maintaining a theory of experience. It includes&lt;!--comprises? Or is there something aside from the exper. and logical?--&gt; the experiential function and the logical function.

=== Experiential function ===
The experiential function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to make meanings about the world around us and inside us:

:"Most obviously, perhaps, when we watch small children interacting with the objects around them we can see that they are using language to construe a theoretical model of their experience. This is language in the experiential function; the patterns of meaning are installed in the brain and continue to expand on a vast scale as each child, in cahoots with all those around, builds up, renovates and keeps in good repair the semiotic “reality” that provides the framework of day-to-day existency and is manifested in every moment of discourse, spoken or listened to. We should stress, I think, that the grammar is not merely annotating experience; it is construing experience."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliday argues that it was through this process of humans making meaning from experience that language evolved. Thus, the human species had to “make sense of the complex world in which it evolved: to classify, or group into categories, the objects and events within its awareness”. These categories are not given to us through our senses; they have to be “construed”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1999. Grammar and the construction of educational knowledge. In The Language of Early Childhood. Volume 4 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;  In taking this position on the active role of grammar in construing “reality”, Halliday was influenced by [[Benjamin Lee Whorf|Whorf]].

===Logical function===
Halliday describes the logical function as those systems “which set up logical–semantic relationships between one clausal unit and another”&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The systems which come under the logical function are {{Sc|taxis}} and {{Smallcaps|logico-semantic relations}}. When two clauses are combined, a speaker chooses whether to give both clauses equal status, or to make one dependent on the other. In addition, a speaker choose some meaning relation in the process of joining or binding clauses together. Halliday argues that the meanings we make in such processes are most closely related to the experiential function. For this reason, he puts the experiential and logical functions together into the ideational function.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal function==
The interpersonal function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to enact their complex and diverse interpersonal relations. This tenet of [[systemic functional linguistics]] is based on the claim that a speaker not only talks about something, but is always talking to and with others. Language not only construes experience, but simultaneously acts out “the interpersonal encounters that are essential to our survival”.&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that these encounters:

:"range all the way from the rapidly changing microencounters of daily life – most centrally, semiotic encounters where we set up and maintain complex patterns of dialogue – to the more permanent institutionalized relationships that collectively constitute the social bond."&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"/&gt;

The grammatical systems that relate to the interpersonal function include &lt;!--Can these be not all-caps?--&gt;Mood, Modality, and Polarity.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]. London: Arnold.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual function==
Halliday argues that both experiential and interpersonal functions are intricately organized, but that between the two “there is comparatively very little constraint”. This means that “by and large, you can put any interactional ‘spin’ on any representational content”.&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"/&gt; What allows meanings from these two modes to freely combine is the intercession of a third, distinct mode of meaning that Halliday refers to as the textual function. The term encompasses all of the grammatical systems responsible for managing the flow of discourse. These systems “create coherent text – text that coheres within itself and with the context of situation” &lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"/&gt; They are both structural (involving choices relating to the ordering of elements in the clause), and non-structural (involving choices that create cohesive ties between units that have no structural bond). The relevant grammatical systems include Theme, Given and New,&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. Matthiessen. 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]. Arnold&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the systems of cohesion, such as Reference, Substitution, and Ellipsis.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Hasan, R. 1976. Cohesion in English. London: Longman&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that the textual function is distinct from both the experiential and interpersonal because its object is language itself. Through the textual function, language “creates a semiotic world of its own: a parallel universe, or ‘virtual reality’ in modern terms”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M. A. K. (2003 [2001]). Is the grammar neutral? Is the grammarian neutral? In J.J. Webster (Ed.), On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday.

In [[mathematics]], '''parity''' is the property of an [[integer]]'s inclusion in one of two categories: '''even''' or '''odd'''. An integer is even if it is evenly [[divisible]] by two and odd if it is not even.&lt;ref name="rod"&gt;{{citation|title=Figuring Out Mathematics|last1=Vijaya|first1=A.V.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Dora |publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9788131703571|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZN9LuHb0tQC&amp;pg=PA20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 6 is even because there is no [[remainder]] when dividing it by 2. By contrast, 3, 5, 7, 21 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Examples of even numbers include −4, 0, 82 and 178. In particular, [[Parity of zero|zero is an even number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory|first=Miklós|last=Bóna|publisher=World Scientific|year=2011|isbn=9789814335232|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&amp;pg=PA178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of odd numbers are −5, 3, 29, and 73. 

A formal definition of an even number is that it is an integer of the form ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''k'', where ''k'' is an integer;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers|first=Tom|last=Bassarear|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=9780840054630|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RitXafH4_8EC&amp;pg=PA198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it can then be shown that an odd number is an integer of the form ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  It is important to realize that the above definition of parity applies only to integer numbers, hence it cannot be applied to numbers like 1/2, 4.201. See the section "Higher mathematics" below for some extensions of the notion of parity to a larger class of "numbers" or in other more general settings.

The [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of even and odd numbers can be defined as following:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The A to Z of Mathematics: A Basic Guide|first=Thomas H.|last=Sidebotham|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2003|isbn=9780471461630|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsAZa5PWLz8C&amp;pg=PA181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Even'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=\{ 2k: k \in \mathbb{Z} \}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Odd'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=\{ 2k+1: k \in \mathbb{Z} \}&lt;/math&gt;

A number (i.e., integer) expressed in the [[decimal]] [[numeral system]] is even or odd according to whether its last digit is even or odd.
That is, if the last digit is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, then it is odd; otherwise it is even. The same idea will work using any even base.
In particular, a number expressed in the [[binary numeral system]] is odd if its last digit is 1 and even if its last digit is 0.
In an odd base, the number is even according to the sum of its digits &amp;ndash; it is even if and only if the sum of its digits is even.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Divisibility in bases|first=Ruth L.|last=Owen|url=http://www.pentagon.kappamuepsilon.org/pentagon/Vol_51_Num_2_Spring_1992.pdf|pages=17–20|journal=The Pentagon: A Mathematics Magazine for Students|volume=51|issue=2|year=1992|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317173427/http://www.pentagon.kappamuepsilon.org/pentagon/Vol_51_Num_2_Spring_1992.pdf|archivedate=2015-03-17|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arithmetic on even and odd numbers ==
The following laws can be verified using the properties of [[divisibility]].  They are a special case of rules in [[modular arithmetic]], and are commonly used to check if an equality is likely to be correct by testing the parity of each side. As with ordinary arithmetic, multiplication and addition are commutative and associative in modulo 2 arithmetic, and multiplication is distributive over addition. However, subtraction in modulo 2 is identical to addition, so subtraction also possesses these properties, which is not true for normal integer arithmetic.

=== Addition and subtraction ===
* even ± even = even;&lt;ref name="rod"/&gt;
* even ± odd = odd;&lt;ref name="rod"/&gt;
* odd ± odd = even;&lt;ref name="rod"/&gt;

===Multiplication===
* even × even = even;&lt;ref name="rod"/&gt;
* even × odd = even;&lt;ref name="rod"/&gt;
* odd × odd = odd;&lt;ref name="rod"/&gt;

The structure ({even, odd}, +, ×) is in fact a [[GF(2)|field with just two elements]].

=== Division ===
The division of two whole numbers does not necessarily result in a whole number.  
For example, 1 divided by 4 equals 1/4, which is neither even ''nor'' odd, since the concepts even and odd apply only to integers.
But when the [[quotient]] is an integer, it will be even [[if and only if]] the [[division (mathematics)|dividend]] has more [[integer factorization|factors of two]] than the divisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Notes on Introductory Combinatorics|first1=George|last1=Pólya|author1-link=George Pólya|first2=Robert E.|last2=Tarjan|author2-link=Robert Tarjan|first3=Donald R.|last3=Woods|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9780817649524|pages=21–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6KmsI0Icp0C&amp;pg=PA21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ancient Greeks considered 1, the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]], to be neither fully odd nor fully even.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ancient Greek Philosophy: Thales to Gorgias|author=Tankha|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2006|isbn=9788177589399|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88PFcpKjupAC&amp;pg=PT136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this sentiment survived into the 19th century: [[Friedrich Fröbel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]]'s 1826 ''The Education of Man'' instructs the teacher to drill students with the claim that 1 is neither even nor odd, to which Fröbel attaches the philosophical afterthought,
{{blockquote|It is well to direct the pupil's attention here at once to a great far-reaching law of nature and of thought. It is this, that between two relatively different things or ideas there stands always a third, in a sort of balance, seeming to unite the two. Thus, there is here between odd and even numbers one number (one) which is neither of the two. Similarly, in form, the right angle stands between the acute and obtuse angles; and in language, the semi-vowels or aspirants between the mutes and vowels. A thoughtful teacher and a pupil taught to think for himself can scarcely help noticing this and other important laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Froebel|first=Friedrich|title=The Education of Man|year=1885|publisher=A Lovell &amp; Company|location=New York|pages=240|url=https://archive.org/details/educationofman00froe|author2=Translator Josephine Jarvis}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Integer coordinates of points in [[Euclidean space]]s of two or more dimensions also have a parity, usually defined as the parity of the sum of the coordinates. For instance, the [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic lattice]] and its higher-dimensional generalizations, the ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' [[Lattice (group)|lattices]], consist of all of the integer points whose sum of coordinates is even.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[Even and odd ordinals|parity of an ordinal number]] may be defined to be even if the number is a limit ordinal, or a limit ordinal plus a finite even number, and odd otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Real Analysis |last1=Bruckner|first1= Andrew M.|first2=Judith B.|last2=Bruckner|first3= Brian S.|last3=Thomson |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-13-458886-5 |page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WY6u0C_jEsC&amp;pg=PA37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''R'' be a [[commutative ring]] and let ''I'' be an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''R'' whose [[Index of a subgroup|index]] is 2. Elements of the [[coset]] &lt;math&gt;0+I&lt;/math&gt; may be called '''even''', while elements of the coset &lt;math&gt;1+I&lt;/math&gt; may be called '''odd'''.
As an example, let {{nowrap|1=''R'' = '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;(2)&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the [[Localization of a ring|localization]] of '''Z''' at the [[prime ideal]] (2). Then an element of ''R'' is even or odd if and only if its numerator is so in '''Z'''.

===Number theory===
The even numbers form an [[ring ideal|ideal]] in the [[ring (algebra)|ring]] of integers,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Elements of Number Theory|first=John|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=9780387955872|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiAlZO2ntKAC&amp;pg=PA199}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the odd numbers do not &amp;mdash; this is clear from the fact that the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] element for addition, zero, is an element of the even numbers only. An integer is even if it is congruent to 0 [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] this ideal, in other words if it is congruent to 0 modulo 2, and odd if it is congruent to 1 modulo 2.

All [[prime number]]s are odd, with one exception: the prime number 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Basic College Mathematics|first1=Margaret L.|last1=Lial|first2=Stanley A.|last2=Salzman|first3=Diana|last3=Hestwood|edition=7th|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=2005|isbn=9780321257802|page=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All known [[perfect number]]s are even; it is unknown whether any odd perfect numbers exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mathematical Cranks|series=MAA Spectrum|first=Underwood|last=Dudley|authorlink=Underwood Dudley|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|contribution=Perfect numbers|pages=242–244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqeoWPsIH6EC&amp;pg=PA242|isbn=9780883855072}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goldbach's conjecture]] states that every even integer greater than 2 can be represented as a sum of two prime numbers.
Modern [[computer]] calculations have shown this conjecture to be true for integers up to at least 4 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;, but still no general [[mathematical proof|proof]] has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Empirical verification of the even Goldbach conjecture, and computation of prime gaps, up to 4&amp;middot;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;|url=http://www.ams.org/editflow/editorial/uploads/mcom/accepted/120521-Silva/120521-Silva-v2.pdf|first1=Tomás|last1=Oliveira e Silva|first2=Siegfried|last2=Herzog|first3=Silvio|last3=Pardi|journal=Mathematics of Computation|volume=83|issue=288|pages=2033–2060|year=2013|doi=10.1090/s0025-5718-2013-02787-1}}.

[[File:Rubiks revenge solved.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rubik's Revenge]] in solved state]]
The [[parity of a permutation]] (as defined in [[abstract algebra]]) is the parity of the number of [[Transposition (mathematics)|transposition]]s into which the permutation can be decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Permutation Groups|volume=45|series=London Mathematical Society Student Texts|first=Peter J.|last=Cameron|authorlink=Peter Cameron (mathematician)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780521653787|pages=26–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bNj8K1omGAC&amp;pg=PA26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example (ABC) to (BCA) is even because it can be done by swapping A and B then C and A (two transpositions). It can be shown that no permutation can be decomposed both in an even and in an odd number of transpositions. Hence the above is a suitable definition. In [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Megaminx]], and other twisting puzzles, the moves of the puzzle allow only even permutations of the puzzle pieces, so parity is important in understanding the [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of these puzzles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Adventures in Group Theory: Rubik's Cube, Merlin's Machine, and Other Mathematical Toys|first=David|last=Joyner|publisher=JHU Press|year=2008|isbn=9780801897269|contribution=13.1.2 Parity conditions|pages=252–253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iM0fco-_Ri8C&amp;pg=PA252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Feit&amp;ndash;Thompson theorem]] states that a [[finite group]] is always solvable if its order is an odd number.  This is an example of odd numbers playing a role in an advanced mathematical theorem where the method of application of the simple hypothesis of "odd order" is far from obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Analysis===
The [[Even and odd functions|parity of a function]] describes how its values change when its arguments are exchanged with their negations. An even function, such as an even power of a variable, gives the same result for any argument as for its negation. An odd function, such as an odd power of a variable, gives for any argument the negation of its result when given the negation of that argument. It is possible for a function to be neither odd nor even, and for the case ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, to be both odd and even.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=College Algebra|edition=11th|first1=Roy David|last1=Gustafson|first2=Jeffrey D.|last2=Hughes|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781111990909|page=315|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxZpddk1fTIC&amp;pg=PA315}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taylor series]] of an even function contains only terms whose exponent is an even number, and the Taylor series of an odd function contains only terms whose exponent is an odd number.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Advanced Engineering Mathematics|first1=R.

===Combinatorial game theory===
In [[combinatorial game theory]], an ''evil number'' is a number that has an even number of 1's in its [[binary representation]], and an ''odious number'' is a number that has an odd number of 1's in its binary representation; these numbers play an important role in the strategy for the game [[Kayles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

See in particular [https://books.google.com/books?id=cYB-ra2T8i4C&amp;pg=PA68 p.&amp;nbsp;68].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[parity function]] maps a number to the number of 1's in its binary representation, [[modular arithmetic|modulo 2]], so its value is zero for evil numbers and one for odious numbers.  The [[Thue–Morse sequence]], an infinite sequence of 0's and 1's, has a 0 in position ''i'' when ''i'' is evil, and a 1 in that position when ''i'' is odious.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Evil twins alternate with odious twins|first=Chris|last=Bernhardt|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=82|issue=1|year=2009|pages=57–62|jstor=27643161|doi=10.4169/193009809x469084}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional applications==
In [[information theory]], a [[parity bit]] appended to a binary number provides the simplest form of [[error detecting code]]. If a single bit in the resulting value is changed, then it will no longer have the correct parity: changing a bit in the original number gives it a different parity than the recorded one, and changing the parity bit while not changing the number it was derived from again produces an incorrect result. In this way, all single-bit transmission errors may be reliably detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Student's Guide to Coding and Information Theory|first1=Stefan M.|last1=Moser|first2=Po-Ning|last2=Chen|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=9781107015838|pages=19–20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFhJXsGXNj8C&amp;pg=PA19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some more sophisticated error detecting codes are also based on the use of multiple parity bits for subsets of the bits of the original encoded value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Codes and turbo codes|first=Claude|last=Berrou|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9782817800394|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLPWNq8JN9QC&amp;pg=PA4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[wind instrument]]s with a cylindrical bore and in effect closed at one end, such as the [[clarinet]] at the mouthpiece, the [[harmonic]]s produced are odd multiples of the [[fundamental frequency]].  (With cylindrical pipes open at both ends, used for example in some [[organ stop]]s such as the [[Flue pipe#Diapasons|open diapason]], the harmonics are even multiples of the same frequency for the given bore length, but this has the effect of the fundamental frequency being doubled and all multiples of this fundamental frequency being produced.)

'''Personality psychology''' is a branch of [[psychology]] that studies [[personality]] and its variation among [[individual]]s. It is a scientific study which aims to show how people are individually different due to psychological forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Classic theories and modern research|last=Friedman|first=Howard|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam|publisher=USA: Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0-205-99793-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its areas of focus include:

* construction of a coherent picture of the [[person|individual]] and their major psychological processes
* investigation of individual psychological differences
* investigation of [[human nature]] and psychological similarities between individuals

"Personality" is a dynamic{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely{{clarify|date=October 2016}} influences their environment, [[cognition]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[motivation]]s, and [[Behavioural sciences|behaviors]] in various situations. The word ''personality'' originates from the [[Latin]] ''persona'', which means "[[mask]]".

Personality also refers to the pattern of [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, [[Adjustment (psychology)|social adjustments]], and [[behavior]]s consistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one's expectations, [[Self-concept|self-perceptions]], [[Value (ethics)|value]]s, and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s.

University Press of America, Lanham, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] (1937) described two major ways to study personality: the nomothetic and the [[Idiographic image|idiographic]]. ''Nomothetic psychology'' seeks general laws that can be applied to many different people, such as the principle of [[self-actualization]] or the trait of [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]. ''Idiographic psychology'' is an attempt to understand the unique aspects of a particular individual.

The study of [[personality]] has a broad and varied history in psychology with an abundance of theoretical trad. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviorist, evolutionary, and social learning perspective. However, many researchers and psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with a certain perspective and instead take an eclectic approach. Research in this area is empirically driven, such as dimensional models, based on [[multivariate statistics]], such as [[factor analysis]], or emphasizes theory development, such as that of the [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] theory. There is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of personality testing. In psychological education and training, the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite to courses in [[abnormal psychology]] or [[clinical psychology]].

==Philosophical assumptions==
Many of the ideas developed by historical and modern [[personality]] theorists stem from the basic philosophical assumptions they hold. The study of personality is not a purely empirical discipline, as it brings in elements of [[art]], [[science]], and [[philosophy]] to draw general conclusions. The following five categories are some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions on which theorists disagree:&lt;ref name=Engler&gt;{{cite book|last=Engler|first=Barbara|title=Personality theories : an introduction|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780547148342|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Freedom versus determinism''' – This is the question whether humans have control over their own behavior and understand the motives behind it or if their behavior is causally determined by forces beyond their control. Behavior is categorized as being either unconscious, environmental or biological by various theories.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Heredity versus environment''' – Personality is thought to be determined largely either by [[genetics]] and [[biology]], or by environment and experiences. Contemporary research suggests that most personality traits are based on the joint influence of genetics and environment. One of the forerunners in this arena is [[C. Robert Cloninger]], who pioneered the Temperament and Character model.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Uniqueness versus universality''' – This question discusses the extent of each human's individuality ([[uniqueness]]) or similarity in nature ([[Universality (philosophy)|universality]]). [[Gordon Allport]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Carl Rogers]] were all advocates of the uniqueness of individuals. Behaviorists and cognitive theorists, in contrast, emphasize the importance of universal principles, such as reinforcement and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Active versus reactive''' – This question explores whether humans primarily act through individual initiative (active) or through outside [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. Traditional behavioral theorists typically believed that humans are passively shaped by their environments, whereas humanistic and cognitive theorists believe that humans are more active in their role.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt; Most modern theorists agree that both are important, with aggregate behavior being primarily determined by traits and situational factors being the primary predictor of behavior in the short term.&lt;ref name = person_situation&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleeson | first1 = W. | year = 2004 | title = Moving personality beyond the person-situation debate: The challenge and the opportunity of within-person variability | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 83–87 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00280.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zayas|first=V|author2=Shoda Y|title=Three decades after the personality paradox: Understanding situations|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year=2009|volume=43|pages=280–281|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2009.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapu|first=C.S.|title=Hypostatic personality: psychopathology of doing and being made|year=2001|publisher=Premier|isbn=9738030595|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality theories ==

=== Type theories ===
[[Personality type]] refers to the psychological classification of different types of people. Personality types are distinguished from [[trait theory|personality traits]], which come in different degrees. There are many types of theories regarding personality, but each theory contains several and sometimes many sub theories. A "theory of personality" constructed by any given psychologist will contain multiple relating theories or sub theories often expanding as more psychologists explore the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cartwright |first1=Desmond |title=Theories and Models of Personality |date=1979 |publisher=Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers |location=Debuque, Iowa |isbn=0-697-06624-X |page=178 |edition=I |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to type theories, there are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. According to trait theories, introversion and extroversion are part of a continuous dimension with many people in the middle. The idea of psychological types originated in the theoretical work of [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=Daryl |title= Personality types: Jung's model of typology |year=1987 |publisher=Inner City Books |location= Toronto, Canada |isbn= 0919123309|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in his 1921 book ''Psychologische Typen'' (''[[Psychological Types]]'')  and [[William Moulton Marston|William Marston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradberry|first=T|title=Self-Awareness|year=2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=1101148675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the writings and observations of Jung during World War II, [[Isabel Briggs Myers]] and her mother, Katharine C. Briggs, delineated personality types by constructing the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]].&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |author=Myers, Isabel Briggs with Peter B. Myers|title=Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type |publisher=Davies-Black Publishing |location=Mountain View, California |origyear=1980|year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-89106-074-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model was later used by [[David Keirsey]] with a different understanding from Jung, Briggs and Myers.&lt;ref name=K123123123123123&gt;{{cite book |date= May 1, 1998 |title=Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence |publisher=Prometheus Nemesis Book Co|edition=1st |isbn=1-885705-02-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former Soviet Union, [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] [[Aušra Augustinavičiūtė]] independently derived a model of personality type from Jung's called [[socionics]].

Theories could also be considered an "approach" to personality or psychology and is generally referred to as a model.  The model is an older and more theoretical approach to personality, accepting extroversion and introversion as basic psychological orientations in connection with two pairs of psychological functions:

* ''Perceiving functions:'' sensing and intuition (trust in concrete, sensory-oriented facts vs. trust in abstract concepts and imagined possibilities)
* ''Judging functions:'' thinking and feeling (basing decisions primarily on logic vs. deciding based on emotion).

Briggs and Myers also added another personality dimension to their type indicator to measure whether a person prefers to use a judging or perceiving function when interacting with the external world.  Therefore, they included questions designed to indicate whether someone wishes to come to conclusions (judgment) or to keep options open (perception).&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;

This personality typology has some aspects of a trait theory: it explains people's behavior in terms of opposite fixed characteristics.  In these more traditional models, the sensing/intuition preference is considered the most basic, dividing people into "N" (intuitive) or "S" (sensing) personality types. An "N" is further assumed to be guided either by thinking or feeling and divided into the "NT" (scientist, engineer) or "NF" (author, humanitarian) temperament. An "S", in contrast, is assumed to be guided more by the judgment/perception axis and thus divided into the "SJ" (guardian, traditionalist) or "SP" (performer, artisan) temperament.&lt;!-- remark out undefined &lt;ref name=Keirsey/&gt; --&gt; These four are considered basic, with the other two factors in each case (including always extraversion/introversion) less important. Critics of this traditional view have observed that the types can be quite strongly stereotyped by professions (although neither Myers nor Keirsey engaged in such stereotyping in their type descriptions),&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;&lt;!-- remark out undefined ref &lt;ref name=Keirsey/&gt; --&gt; and thus may arise more from the need to categorize people for purposes of guiding their career choice.&lt;ref name=Pittenger&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pittenger | first = David J. | title = Measuring the MBTI. . .And Coming Up Short | journal = Journal of Career Planning and Employment | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–52 |date=November 1993 | url = http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/HRMWebsite/hrm/articles/develop/mbti.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This among other objections led to the emergence of the five-factor view, which is less concerned with behavior under work conditions and more concerned with behavior in personal and emotional circumstances.  (It should be noted, however, that the MBTI is not designed to measure the "work self", but rather what Myers and McCaulley called the "shoes-off self."&lt;ref name=manual_2&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Isabel Briggs|author2=Mary H.

[[Type A and Type B personality theory]]:  During the 1950s, [[Meyer Friedman]] and his co-workers defined what they called Type A and Type B behavior patterns. They theorized that intense, hard-driving Type A personalities had a higher risk of coronary disease because they are "stress junkies." Type B people, on the other hand, tended to be relaxed, less competitive, and lower in risk. There was also a Type AB mixed profile.

[[John L. Holland]]'s ''RIASEC'' vocational model, commonly referred to as the ''[[Holland Codes]]'', stipulates that six personality types lead people to choose their career paths. In this circumplex model, the six types are represented as a hexagon, with adjacent types more closely related than those more distant. The model is widely used in vocational counseling.

[[Eduard Spranger]]'s personality-model, consisting of six (or, by some revisions, 6 +1) basic types of ''value attitudes'', described in his book ''Types of Men'' (''Lebensformen''; Halle (Saale): Niemeyer, 1914; English translation by P. J. W. Pigors - New York: G. E. Stechert Company, 1928).

The [[Enneagram of Personality]], a model of human personality which is principally used as a typology of nine interconnected personality types. It has been criticized as being subject to interpretation, making it difficult to test or validate scientifically.

Perhaps the most ancient attempt at personality psychology is the [[Buddhist personality types|personality typology]] outlined by the Indian [[Buddhist]] [[Abhidharma]] schools. This typology mostly focuses on negative personal traits (greed, hatred, and delusion) and the corresponding positive [[meditation]] practices used to counter those traits.

=== Psychoanalytic theories ===

[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] theories explain human behavior in terms of the interaction of various components of personality. [[Sigmund Freud]] was the founder of this school of thought. Freud drew on the physics of his day (thermodynamics) to coin the term [[psychodynamics]]. Based on the idea of converting heat into mechanical energy, he proposed psychic energy could be converted into behavior. Freud's theory places central importance on dynamic, unconscious psychological conflicts.&lt;ref name=Kahn&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahn|first=Michael|title=Basic Freud : psychoanalytic thought for the twenty first century|year=2002|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465037162|edition=1. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud divides human personality into three significant components: the [[id, ego and super-ego]].  The '''id''' acts according to the ''pleasure principle'', demanding immediate gratification of its needs regardless of external environment; the '''ego''' then must emerge in order to realistically meet the wishes and demands of the id in accordance with the outside world, adhering to the ''reality principle''. Finally, the '''superego''' (conscience) inculcates moral judgment and societal rules upon the ego, thus forcing the demands of the id to be met not only realistically but morally. The superego is the last function of the personality to develop, and is the embodiment of parental/social ideals established during childhood. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of these three components.&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;Carver, C., &amp; Scheier, M. (2004). ''Perspectives on Personality'' (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The channeling and release of sexual (libidal) and aggressive energies, which ensues from the "Eros" (sex; instinctual self-preservation) and "Thanatos" (death; instinctual self-annihilation) drives respectively, are major components of his theory.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;  It is important to note that Freud's broad understanding of sexuality included all kinds of pleasurable feelings experienced by the human body.

Freud proposed five psychosexual stages of personality development. He believed adult personality is dependent upon early childhood experiences and largely determined by age five.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;  Fixations that develop during the infantile stage contribute to adult personality and behavior.

One of Sigmund Freud's earlier associates, [[Alfred Adler]], did agree with Freud that early childhood experiences are important to development and believed birth order may influence personality development. Adler believed that the oldest child was the individual who would set high achievement goals in order to gain attention lost when the younger siblings were born. He believed the middle children were competitive and ambitious.  He reasoned that this behavior was motivated by the idea of surpassing the firstborn's achievements.   He added, however, that the middle children were often not as concerned about the glory attributed with their behavior. He also believed the youngest would be more dependent and sociable. Adler finished by surmising that an only child loves being the center of attention and matures quickly but in the end fails to become independent.

[[Heinz Kohut]] thought similarly to Freud's idea of transference. He used [[narcissism]] as a model of how people develop their sense of self. Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of one self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one's low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut had a significant impact on the field by extending Freud's theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally "sink into" and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. They also need to have their self-worth mirrored by these people. These experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self.

Another important figure in the world of personality theory is [[Karen Horney]]. She is credited with the development of the "[[True self and false self|real self]]" and the "ideal self". She believes all people have these two views of their own self. The "real self" is how humans act with regard to personality, values, and morals; but the "ideal self" is a construct individuals implement in order to conform to social and personal norms.

=== Behaviorist theories ===

[[Behaviorism|Behaviorists]] explain personality in terms of the effects external stimuli have on behavior.  The approaches used to analyze the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation.  This school of thought was developed by [[B. F. Skinner]] who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or "the organism" with its environment.  Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention.  These are the ''response'', and ''consequences''.  The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as [[operant conditioning]].  Skinner put forward a "three term contingency model" which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the "Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model" in which the critical question is: "Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?"&lt;ref name=Cheney&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheney|first=W. David Pierce, Carl D.|title=Behavior analysis and learning|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780805862607|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Herrnstein]] extended this theory by accounting for attitudes and traits.  An attitude develops as the response strength (the tendency to respond) in the presences of a group of stimuli become stable.  Rather than describing conditionable traits in non-behavioral language, response strength in a given situation accounts for the environmental portion.  Herrstein also saw traits as having a large genetic or biological component, as do most modern behaviorists.&lt;ref name=Cheney /&gt;

[[Ivan Pavlov]] is another notable influence. He is well known for his [[classical conditioning]] experiments involving dogs, which led him to discover the foundation of behaviorism.&lt;ref name=Cheney /&gt;

=== Social cognitive theories ===

In cognitive theory, behavior is explained as guided by cognitions (e.g. expectations) about the world, especially those about other people. Cognitive theories are theories of personality that emphasize cognitive processes, such as thinking and judging.

[[Albert Bandura]], a [[social learning theory|social learning theorist]] suggested the forces of [[memory]] and [[emotion]]s worked in conjunction with environmental influences. Bandura was known mostly for his "[[Bobo doll experiment]]". During these experiments, Bandura video taped a college student kicking and verbally abusing a bobo doll. He then showed this video to a class of kindergarten children who were getting ready to go out to play. When they entered the play room, they saw bobo dolls, and some hammers. The people observing these children at play saw a group of children beating the doll. He called this study and his findings observational learning, or modeling.

Early examples of approaches to cognitive style are listed by Baron (1982).&lt;ref&gt;Baron, J. (1982). "Intelligence and Personality." In R. Sternberg (Ed.). ''Handbook of Intelligence''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These include Witkin's (1965) work on field dependency, Gardner's (1953) discovering people had consistent preference for the number of categories they used to categorise heterogeneous objects, and Block and Petersen's (1955) work on confidence in line discrimination judgments. Baron relates early development of cognitive approaches of personality to [[ego psychology]]. More central to this field have been:

* [[Explanatory style|Attributional style theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abramson |first1=Lyn Y. |last2=Seligman |first2=Martin E. P. |last3=Teasdale |first3=John D. |date=1978 |title=Learned helplessness in humans: Critique and reformulation |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=49–74 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49 |pmid=649856 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with different ways in which people explain events in their lives. This approach builds upon locus of control, but extends it by stating we also need to consider whether people attribute to stable causes or variable causes, and to global causes or specific causes.

Various scales have been developed to assess both attributional style and locus of control. Locus of control scales include those used by Rotter and later by Duttweiler, the Nowicki and Strickland (1973) Locus of Control Scale for Children and various locus of control scales specifically in the health domain, most famously that of Kenneth Wallston and his colleagues, The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale.&lt;ref&gt;Wallston et al., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Attributional style has been assessed by the Attributional Style Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson et al., 1982&lt;/ref&gt; the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Villanova, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; the Attributions Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Gong-guy &amp; Hammen,  1990&lt;/ref&gt; the Real Events Attributional Style Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;Norman &amp; Antaki, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and the Attributional Style Assessment Test.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

* Achievement style theory focuses upon identification of an individual's Locus of Control tendency, such as by Rotter's evaluations, and was found by Cassandra Bolyard Whyte to provide valuable information for improving academic performance of students.&lt;ref name="Whyte1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whyte |first=Cassandra Bolyard |year=1978 |title=Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen |journal=Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=198–200 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with internal control tendencies are likely to persist to better academic performance levels, presenting an achievement personality, according to [[Cassandra B. Whyte]].&lt;ref name="Whyte1978" /&gt;

Recognition that the tendency to believe that hard work and persistence often results in attainment of life and academic goals has influenced formal educational and counseling efforts with students of various ages and in various settings since the 1970s research about achievement.&lt;ref name="LauridsenKurt"&gt;Lauridsen Kurt (ed) and Whyte, Cassandra B. (1985) An Integrated Counseling and Learning Assistance Center-Chapter for New Directions Sourcebook. Jossey-Bass, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling aimed toward encouraging individuals to design ambitious goals and work toward them, with recognition that there are external factors that may impact, often results in the incorporation of a more positive achievement style by students and employees, whatever the setting, to include higher education, workplace, or justice programming.&lt;ref name="LauridsenKurt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = Cassandra | last2 = Whyte | first2 = William R. | year = 1982 | title = Accelerated Programs Behind Prison Walls | url = | journal = College Student Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 70–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Mischel]] (1999) has also defended a cognitive approach to personality. His work refers to "Cognitive Affective Units", and considers factors such as encoding of stimuli, affect, goal-setting, and self-regulatory beliefs. The term "Cognitive Affective Units" shows how his approach considers affect as well as cognition.

[[Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory]] (CEST) is another cognitive personality theory.  Developed by Seymour Epstein, CEST argues that humans operate by way of two independent information processing systems: experiential system and rational system.  The experiential system is fast and emotion-driven.  The rational system is slow and logic-driven.  These two systems interact to determine our goals, thoughts, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Seymour; In: Handbook of psychology: Personality and social psychology, Vol. 5. Millon, Theodore (Ed.); Lerner, Melvin J. (Ed.); Hoboken, NJ, US: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 2003. pp. 159-184. [Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal construct theory|Personal construct psychology]] (PCP) is a theory of personality developed by the American psychologist [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] in the 1950s. Kelly's fundamental view of personality was that people are like naive scientists who see the world through a particular lens, based on their uniquely organized systems of construction, which they use to anticipate events. But because people are naive scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing the world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation. A system of construction that chronically fails to characterize and/or predict events, and is not appropriately revised to comprehend and predict one's changing social world, is considered to underlie psychopathology (or mental illness.){{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
From the theory, Kelly derived a [[psychotherapy]] approach and also a technique called ''The Repertory Grid Interview'' that helped his patients to uncover their own "constructs"  with minimal intervention or interpretation by the therapist. The [[repertory grid]] was later adapted for various uses within organizations, including decision-making and interpretation of other people's world-views.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=George A.|title=Theory of Personality : the psychology of personal constructs.|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0393001520|edition=1. publ. in ... pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humanistic theories ===
[[Humanistic psychology]] emphasizes that people have [[free will]] and that this plays an active role in determining how they behave. Accordingly, humanistic psychology focuses on subjective experiences of persons as opposed to forced, definitive factors that determine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).  Charleston SC, USA: CreateSpace.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]] were proponents of this view, which is based on the "phenomenal field" theory of Combs and Snygg (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Combs, Arthur W., and Snygg, Donald. '' : A New Frame of Reference for Psychology''. New York, Harper and Brothers. [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg&amp;combs.html Article on Snygg and Combs' Phenomenological Field Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers and Maslow were among a group of psychologists that worked together for a decade to produce the ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology''. This journal was primarily focused on viewing individuals as a whole, rather than focusing solely on separate traits and processes within the individual.

[[Robert W. White (psychologist)|Robert W. White]] wrote the book ''The Abnormal Personality'' that became a standard text on [[abnormal psychology]]. He also investigated the human need to strive for positive goals like competence and influence, to counterbalance the emphasis of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] on the pathological elements of personality development.&lt;ref name=Watt&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=Robert W. White ; Norman F.|title=The abnormal personality|year=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-04599-1|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow spent much of his time studying what he called "self-actualizing persons", those who are "fulfilling themselves and doing the best they are capable of doing". Maslow believes all who are interested in growth move towards self-actualizing (growth, happiness, satisfaction) views. Many of these people demonstrate a trend in dimensions of their personalities. Characteristics of self-actualizers according to Maslow include the four key dimensions:&lt;ref name=Maslow&gt;{{cite book|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|title=Toward a Psychology of Being|year=1999|publisher=Wiley|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-471-29309-1|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Awareness''' – maintaining constant enjoyment and awe of life. These individuals often experienced a "peak experience". He defined a peak experience as an "intensification of any experience to the degree there is a loss or transcendence of self". A peak experience is one in which an individual perceives an expansion of themselves, and detects a unity and meaningfulness in life. Intense concentration on an activity one is involved in, such as running a marathon, may invoke a peak experience.
# '''Reality and problem centered''' – having a tendency to be concerned with "problems" in surroundings.
# '''Acceptance/Spontaneity''' – accepting surroundings and what cannot be changed.
# '''Unhostile sense of humor/democratic''' – do not take kindly to  joking about others, which can be viewed as offensive. They have friends of all backgrounds and religions and hold very close friendships.

Maslow and Rogers emphasized a view of the person as an active, creative, experiencing human being who lives in the present and subjectively responds to current perceptions, relationships, and encounters. They disagree with the dark, pessimistic outlook of those in the Freudian psychoanalysis ranks, but rather view humanistic theories as positive and optimistic proposals which stress the tendency of the human personality toward growth and self-actualization. This progressing self will remain the center of its constantly changing world; a world that will help mold the self but not necessarily confine it. Rather, the self has opportunity for maturation based on its encounters with this world. This understanding attempts to reduce the acceptance of hopeless redundancy. Humanistic therapy typically relies on the client for information of the past and its effect on the present, therefore the client dictates the type of guidance the therapist may initiate. This allows for an individualized approach to therapy. Rogers found patients differ in how they respond to other people. Rogers tried to model a particular approach to therapy- he stressed the reflective or empathetic response. This response type takes the client's viewpoint and reflects back their feeling and the context for it. An example of a reflective response would be, "It seems you are feeling anxious about your upcoming marriage". This response type seeks to clarify the therapist's understanding while also encouraging the client to think more deeply and seek to fully understand the feelings they have expressed.

Biology plays a very important role in the development of personality. The study of the biological level in personality psychology focuses primarily on identifying the role of genetic determinants and how they mold individual personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Plomin, R., DeFries, J.C., McClearn, G.E., &amp; Rutter, M. (1997). ''Behavioral genetics'' (3rd Ed.). New York: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest thinking about possible biological bases of personality grew out of the case of [[Phineas Gage]]. In an 1848 accident, a large iron rod was driven through Gage's head, and his personality apparently changed as a result, although descriptions&lt;ref name="return_of_phineas"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Damasio H. |author2=Grabowski T |author3=.

In general, patients with brain damage have been difficult to find and study. In the 1990s, researchers began to use [[electroencephalography]] (EEG),  [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), and more recently [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), which is now the most widely used imaging technique to help localize personality traits in the brain.

====Genetic basis of personality====
Ever since the [[Human Genome Project]] allowed for a much more in depth understanding of genetics, there has been an ongoing controversy involving heritability, personality traits, and environmental vs. genetic influence on personality. The human genome is known to play a role in the development of personality.&lt;br /&gt;
Previously, genetic personality studies focused on specific genes correlating to specific personality traits. Today's view of the gene-personality relationship focuses primarily on the activation and expression of genes related to personality and forms part of what is referred to as [[behavioural genetics]]. Genes provide numerous options for varying cells to be expressed; however, the environment determines which of these are activated. Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways in which our bodies can develop, but the interaction between genes and the shaping of our minds and personality is also relevant to this biological relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, M.S., &amp; Heatherton, T.F. (2006). ''Psychological science: Mind, brain, and behavior'' (2nd ed.). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
DNA-environment interactions are important in the development of personality because this relationship determines what part of the DNA code is actually made into proteins that will become part of an individual. It has been noted that while different choices are made available by the genome, in the end, the environment is the ultimate determinant of what becomes activated. Small changes in DNA in individuals are what lead to the uniqueness of every person as well as differences in looks, abilities, brain functioning, and all the factors that culminate to develop a cohesive personality.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, G. (2004). ''The birth of the mind.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattell and Eysenck have proposed that genetics have a strong influence on personality. A large part of the evidence collected linking genetics and the environment to personality have come from [[Twin study|twin studies]]. This "twin method" compares levels of similarity in personality using genetically identical [[twin]]s. One of the first of these twin studies measured 800 pairs of twins, studied numerous personality traits, and determined that identical twins are most similar in their general abilities. Personality similarities were found to be less related for self-concepts, goals, and interests.&lt;ref name="Loehlin"&gt;Loehlin, J.C., &amp; Nichols, R.C. (1976). ''Hereditary, environment, and personality: A study of 850 sets of twins.'' Austin: University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Twin studies have also been important in the creation of the [[Big Five personality traits|five factor personality model]]: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Neuroticism and extraversion are the two most widely studied traits. A person that may fall into the extravert category can display characteristics such as impulsiveness, sociability, and activeness. A person falling into the neuroticism category may be more likely to be moody, anxious, or irritable. Identical twins, however, have higher correlations in personality traits than fraternal twins. One study measuring genetic influence on twins in five different countries found that the correlations for identical twins were .50, while for fraternal they were about .20.&lt;ref name="Loehlin" /&gt; It is suggested that heredity and environment interact to determine one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldberg | first1 = L.R. | year = 1990 | title = An alternative "description of personality": The Big-Five factor structure | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1216–1229 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.6.1216 | pmid=2283588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeronimus, B.F.|author2= Riese, H.|author3= Sanderman, R.|author4= Ormel, J.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037009|doi=10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary theory===

[[Charles Darwin]] is the founder of the [[Darwinism|theory of the evolution of the species]]. The evolutionary approach to personality psychology is based on this theory.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.M. | year = 1991 | title = Evolutionary personality psychology | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 459–491 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.42.1.459}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory examines how individual personality differences are based on [[natural selection]]. Through natural selection organisms change over time through adaptation and selection. Traits are developed and certain genes come into expression based on an organism's environment and how these traits aid in an organism's survival and reproduction.

[[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]], such as gender and blood type, are forms of diversity which evolve to benefit a species as a whole.&lt;ref name="Ford unk."&gt;[[E.B. Ford|Ford E.B.]] 1965. ''Genetic polymorphism''. Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of evolution has wide-ranging implications on personality psychology. Personality viewed through the lens of evolutionary psychology places a great deal of emphasis on specific traits that are most likely to aid in survival and reproduction, such as conscientiousness, sociability, emotional stability, and dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.T. | last2 = Sadalla | first2 = E.K. | last3 = Groth | first3 = G. | last4 = Trost | first4 = M.R. | year = 1990 | title = Evolution, traits, and the stages of human courtship: Qualifying the parental investment model | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 97–116 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00909.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social aspects of personality can be seen through an evolutionary perspective. Specific character traits develop and are selected for because they play an important and complex role in the social hierarchy of organisms. Such characteristics of this social hierarchy include the sharing of important resources, family and mating interactions, and the harm or help organisms can bestow upon one another.&lt;ref name="Buss" /&gt;


=== Drive theories===

In the 1930s, [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal Elgar Miller]] met at [[Yale University]], and began an attempt to integrate drives (see [[Drive theory]]), into a theory of personality, basing themselves on the work of [[Clark Hull]]. They began with the premise that personality could be equated with the habitual responses exhibited by an individual – their habits. From there, they determined that these habitual responses were built on secondary, or acquired drives. 

Secondary drives are internal needs directing the behaviour of an individual that results from learning.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dollard|first1=John|last2=Miller|first2=Neil|title=Social Learning and Imitation|date=1941|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, London|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acquired drives are learned, by and large in the manner described by [[classical conditioning]]. When we are in a certain environment and experience a strong response to a stimulus, we internalize cues from the said environment.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; When we find ourselves in an environment with similar cues, we begin to act in anticipation of a similar stimulus.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Thus, we are likely to experience anxiety in an environment with cues similar to one where we have experienced pain or fear – such as the dentist's office.  

Secondary drives are built on primary drives, which are biologically driven, and motivate us to act with no prior learning process – such as hunger, thirst or the need for sexual activity. However, secondary drives are thought to represent more specific elaborations of primary drives, behind which the functions of the original primary drive continue to exist.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Thus, the primary drives of fear and pain exist behind the acquired drive of anxiety. Secondary drives can be based on multiple primary drives and even in other secondary drives. This is said to give them strength and persistence.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Examples include the need for money, which was conceptualized as arising from multiple primary drives such as the drive for food and warmth, as well as from secondary drives such as imitativeness (the drive to do as others do) and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;

Secondary drives vary based on the social conditions under which they were learned – such as culture. Dollard and Miller used the example of food, stating that the primary drive of hunger manifested itself behind the learned secondary drive of an appetite for a specific type of food, which was dependent on the culture of the individual.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;

Secondary drives are also explicitly social, representing a manner in which we convey our primary drives to others.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Howard.S.|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam.W.|title=Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0205997930|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many primary drives are actively repressed by society (such as the sexual drive).&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Dollard and Miller believed that the acquisition of secondary drives was essential to childhood development.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; As children develop, they learn not to act on their primary drives, such as hunger but acquire secondary drives through reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Friedman and Schustack describe an example of such developmental changes, stating that if an infant engaging in an active orientation towards others brings about the fulfillment of primary drives, such as being fed or having their diaper changed, they will develop a secondary drive to pursue similar interactions with others – perhaps leading to an individual being more gregarious.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; Dollard and Miller's belief in the importance of acquired drives led them to reconceive [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of psychosexual development.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; They found themselves to be in agreement with the timing Freud used but believed that these periods corresponded to the successful learning of certain secondary drives.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt;

Dollard and Miller gave many examples of how secondary drives impact our habitual responses – and by extension our personalities, including anger, social conformity, imitativeness or anxiety, to name a few. In the case of anxiety, Dollard and Miller note that people who generalize the situation in which they experience the anxiety drive will experience anxiety far more than they should.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; These people are often anxious all the time, and anxiety becomes part of their personality.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; This example shows how drive theory can have ties with other theories of personality – many of them look at the trait of neuroticism or emotional stability in people, which is strongly linked to anxiety.

==Personality tests==

There are two major types of personality tests, projective and objective.

''Projective tests'' assume personality is primarily unconscious and assess individuals by how they respond to an ambiguous stimulus, such as an ink blot. Projective tests have been in use for about 60 years and continue to be used today. Examples of such tests include the [[Rorschach test]] and the [[Thematic Apperception Test]].

The Rorschach Test involves showing an individual a series of note cards with ambiguous ink blots on them. The individual being tested is asked to provide interpretations of the blots on the cards by stating everything that the ink blot may resemble based on their personal interpretation. The therapist then analyzes their responses. Rules for scoring the test have been covered in manuals that cover a wide variety of characteristics such as content, originality of response, location of "perceived images" and several other factors. Using these specific scoring methods, the therapist will then attempt to relate test responses to attributes of the individual's personality and their unique characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Exner, J.E. (1993). ''The Rorschach: A comprehensive system, Vol. 1: Basic foundations'' (3rd ed.). New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that unconscious needs will come out in the person's response, e.g. an aggressive person may see images of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;
The Thematic Apperception Test (also known as the TAT) involves presenting individuals with vague pictures/scenes and asking them to tell a story based on what they see. Common examples of these "scenes" include images that may suggest family relationships or specific situations, such as a father and son or a man and a woman in a bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bellak, L., &amp; Abrams, D.M. (1997). ''The Thematic Apperception Test, the Children's Apperception Test, and the Senior Apperception Technique in clinical use'' (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Responses are analyzed for common themes. Responses unique to an individual are theoretically meant to indicate underlying thoughts, processes, and potentially conflicts present within the individual. Responses are believed to be directly linked to unconscious motives. There is very little empirical evidence available to support these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watkins | first1 = C.E. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = V.L. | last3 = Nieberding | first3 = R. | last4 = Hallmark | first4 = R. | year = 1995 | title = Contemporary practice of psychological assessment by clinical psychologists | url = | journal = [[Professional Psychology, Research and Practice]] | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 54–60 | doi=10.1037/0735-7028.26.1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Objective tests'' assume personality is consciously accessible and that it can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the [[Forer effect]] to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because there is no way to tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.

The [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator|Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] (also known as the MBTI) is self-reporting questionnaire based on [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Type theory]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1|title=The Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation  - MBTI® Basics|website=www.myersbriggs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inner experience==
Psychology has traditionally defined personality through its behavioral patterns, and more recently with neuroscientific studies of the brain.  In recent years, some psychologists have turned to the study of inner experiences for insight into personality as well as individuality. Inner experiences are the thoughts and feelings to an immediate phenomenon. Another term used to define inner experiences is [[qualia]]. Being able to understand inner experiences assists in understanding how humans behave, act, and respond. Defining personality using inner experiences has been expanding due to the fact that solely relying on behavioral principles to explain one's character may seem incomplete. Behavioral methods allow the subject to be observed by an observer, whereas with inner experiences the subject is its own observer.&lt;ref name=Price&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Donald D.|title=Inner experience and neuroscience : merging both perspectives|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262017657|author2=Barrell, James J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mihelic&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihelic|first=Janell|title=Exploring the phenomena of inner experience with descriptive experience sampling|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1862&amp;context=thesesdissertations|work=UNLV Theses/Dissertations/Professional Papers/Capstones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods measuring inner experience===
'''Descriptive experience sampling (DES)''', developed by psychologist Russel Hurlburt. This is an [[idiographic]] method that is used to help examine inner experiences. This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual's inner experiences and characteristics to be described and measured. A beep notifies the subject to record their experience at that exact moment and 24 hours later an interview is given based on all the experiences recorded. DES has been used in subjects that have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. It has also been crucial to studying the inner experiences of those who have been diagnosed with common psychiatric diseases.&lt;ref name="Mihelic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22prof.html|title=Taking Mental Snapshots to Plumb Our Inner Selves|author=Hoffman, Jascha|date= December 21, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurlburt|first=Russell|title=Iteratively Apprehending Pristine Experience|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=156–188|url=http://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/hurlburt-2009c.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Articulated thoughts in stimulated situations (ATSS)''': ATSS is a [[paradigm]] which was created as an alternative to the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, they are asked to articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.&lt;ref name=Mihelic /&gt;

'''Experimental method''': This method is an experimental paradigm used to study human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help understand the meaning behind the experience to see if it can be generalized.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

The '''Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/871/contents/made The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 (as originally made).]&lt;/ref&gt; which originally came into effect at the end of August 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/648/contents/made The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Great Britain]] and in 1999 in [[Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/1999/115/contents/made The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first ''producer responsibility'' legislation in the UK.

The [[Packaging Waste]] Regulations work on the principle of ''Collective Producer Responsibility'' - enforcing producers of packaging to take responsibility for their environmental impact. The Regulations require obligated producers to pay a proportion of the cost of the recovery and recycling of their packaging.

==Proportions==

Companies must show that they have paid for their obligation for recovery and recycling of the packaging. This is achieved through the [[Packaging Recovery Note]] (PRN) System.

Under the Packaging Waste Regulations the so-called 'packaging chain' is divided into four activities, each with a different percentage responsibility:
* '''raw material manufacturer: 6%'''  Manufacturing of packaging raw material, e.g. manufacturer of steel for baked beans cans.
* '''converter: 9%'''  Manufacturing of a recognised packaging item, e.g. manufacturer of the steel can for the baked beans.
* '''packer/filler: 37%'''  Putting a product into packaging or applying packaging to a product, e.g. the company which fills the can with baked beans.
* '''seller: 48%'''  Supplying the packaging to the end user of that packaging, e.g. the supermarket which sells the baked bean can to the consumer. '''OR''' The wholesaler who sells boxed cans of beans would have the selling obligation on the boxes removed by the supermarket.

Companies who directly import packaging, packaged goods or packaging materials are also obligated. The level of their obligation depends on the stage of the chain at which the packaging is brought into the UK but, in every case, they pick up the rolled-up obligations for all stages carried out before the packaging or packaging materials reach the UK.

==The PRN System==

The legislation stipulates that companies who are obligated under the Regulations must prove they have paid for the requisite amount of tonnes to be recovered each year. Reprocessors are licensed to issue a [[Packaging Recovery Note]] (PRN), or PERNs for exported packaging, for each tonne of specific material they have recovered. Regulated companies must buy the appropriate quantity of PRNs for the appropriate materials as proof they have fulfilled their obligations.  For a percentage of each tonne of packaging waste generated, a PRN is required as proof that a tonne of that material ([[wood]], [[paper]], [[glass]], [[plastic]], [[aluminium]] or [[steel]]) has been recycled. The price of PRNs is set by the reprocessors according to the availability of material being recycled. Thus PRNs have joined the [[commodities]] marketplace.

A company falls under the legislation if they: have a turnover of more than £2 million ''and'' handled more than 50 tonnes of packaging in the previous calendar year.

PRNs are certificates issued by accredited reprocessors when packaging waste is recycled or recovered. These PRNs are put onto the open market to be purchased by obligated companies as evidence that they have met their calculated obligation. This can be done directly or through a compliance scheme, of which there are several.

{{refimprove|date=March 2016}}
A '''pulse per second''' ('''PPS''' or '''1PPS''') is an [[electrical signal]] that has a width of less than one second and a sharply rising or abruptly falling edge that [[Accuracy and precision|accurately]] repeats once per [[second]]. PPS signals are output by radio beacons, [[frequency standard]]s, other types of precision [[oscillator]]s and some [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eftf.org/proceedings/proceedingsEFTF2012.pdf] M. Siccardi, ''About time measurements'', EFTF 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Precision clocks are sometimes manufactured by interfacing a PPS signal generator to processing equipment that aligns the PPS signal to the [[UTC]] second and converts it to a useful display. [[Atomic clock]]s usually have an external PPS output, although internally they may operate at 9,192,631,770&amp;nbsp;Hz. PPS signals have an accuracy ranging from a 12 picoseconds to a few microseconds per second, or 2.0 nanoseconds to a few milliseconds per day based on the resolution and accuracy of the device generating the signal.

== Physical representation ==
PPS signals are usually generated as a TTL signal capable of driving a 1 kilohm load. Some sources use line drivers in order to be capable of driving 50 ohm transmission lines. Because of the broad frequency contents, a long transmission line can have significant impact on the shape of the PPS signal due to dispersion and after delivery effects of the dielectric of the transmission line. It is common to set t0 at the voltage level of the steepest slope of a PPS signal. PPS signals are therefore notoriously unreliable when time transfer accuracies better than a ns are needed, although the stability of a PPS signal can reach into the ps regime depending on the generating device.

== Uses ==
PPS signals are used for precise timekeeping and time measurement.  One increasingly common use is in computer timekeeping, including the [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] protocol.  Because GPS is considered a [[Network_Time_Protocol#Clock_strata|stratum]]-0 source, a common use for the PPS signal is to connect it to a PC using a low-latency, low-[[jitter]] wire [[Electrical connection|connection]] and allow a program to synchronize to it. This makes the PC a stratum-1 time source.  Note that because the PPS signal does not specify the time, but merely the start of a second, one must combine the PPS functionality with another time source that provides the full date and time in order to ascertain the time both accurately and precisely.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Modelframework.JPG|thumb|420px|Illustration of the SEQUAL framework]] --&gt;
The '''SEQUAL framework''' is [[systems modelling]] [[reference model]] for evaluating the quality of models. The SEQUAL framework, which stands for "semiotic quality framework" is developed by [[John Krogstie]] and others since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Kro06"&gt;[[John Krogstie]] et al. (2006). [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ejis/journal/v15/n1/pdf/3000598a.pdf "Process models representing knowledge for action: a revised quality framework"]. In: ''European Journal of Information Systems'' (2006) 15, pp.91–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEQUAL framework is a so-called "top-down quality framework", which is based on [[semiotics|semiotic]] theory, such as the works of [[Charles W. Morris]]. Building on these theory it "defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, a body of knowledge, a domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling".&lt;ref name="Men06"&gt;Jan Mendling et al. (2006) [http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV83Mendling.pdf "On the Correlation between Process Model Metrics and Errors"] Conference paper.&lt;/ref&gt; Its usefulness, according to Mendling et al. (2006), was confirmed in a 2002 experiment by Moody et al.&lt;ref&gt;D.L. Moody, et al. (2002). "Evaluating the quality of process models: Empirical testing of a quality framework". In: Stefano Spaccapietra et al. (ed.) ''Conceptual Modeling - ER 2002, Proceedings, LNCS 2503'', pp. 380-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The basic idea behind the SEQUAL framework is, that "[[conceptual model]]s can be considered as sets of
statements in a [[language]], and therefore can be evaluated in semiotic/linguistic terms". A first semiotic
framework for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed by Lindland et al. in the 1994 article "Understanding quality in conceptual modeling".&lt;ref&gt;O.I. Lindland, G. Sindre and [[Arne Sølvberg]] (1994) "Understanding quality in conceptual modeling". In: ''IEEE Software'' 11(2), 42–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In its initial version, it considered three quality levels: 
* syntactic,
* semantic, and
* pragmatic quality

The framework was later extended, and called the SEQUAL framework by Krogstie et al. in the 1995 article "Defining quality aspects for conceptual models".&lt;ref&gt;KROGSTIE J, LINDLAND OI and SINDRE G (1995) "Defining quality aspects for conceptual models". In:  ''Proceedings of the IFIP8.1 Working Conference on Information Systems Concepts (ISCO3): Towards a Consolidation of Views, 28–30 March, Marburg, Germany'' (FALKENBERG E, HESS W and OLIVE E, Eds), Chapman &amp; Hall: London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2002 article "Quality of interactive models"&lt;ref&gt;KROGSTIE J and JøRGENSEN HD (2002) "Quality of interactive models". In: ''First International Workshop on Conceptual Modelling Quality (IWCMQ’02), 11 October 2002''. (OLIVE A, YOSHIKAWA M and YU E, Eds), Springer Verlag: Berlin, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Krogstie &amp; Jørgensen extended the initial framework adding
more levels of Stamper’s semiotic ladder.&lt;ref&gt;STAMPER R (1996) "Signs, norms, and information systems". In: ''Signs at Work''. B. Holmqvist et al. (Eds). Walter de Gruyter: Berlin, Germany. pp 349–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

== SEQUAL framework topics ==
[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] is an integral part of many technical fields, including [[engineering]], [[economics]], and [[software]] engineering. In this context, a model is a formal representation of an organizational system, such as a [[business model]] or a formal description of software in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]].

=== Model activation ===
Model activation, according to [[John Krogstie]] (2006),&lt;ref name="Kro06"/&gt; is the process by which a model affects [[reality]]. Model activation involves actors interpreting the model and to some extent adjusting their behaviour accordingly. This process can be:
* ''automated'', where a software component interprets the model,
* ''manual'', where the model guides the actions of human actors, or
* ''interactive'', where prescribed aspects of the model are automatically interpreted and ambiguous parts are left to the users to resolve.

=== Sets in the Quality Framework ===
The Quality Framework works with a set of eight items:
* A: Actors that develop or have to relate to (parts of) the model. Can be persons or tools.
* L: What can be expressed in the modeling language
* M: What is expressed in the model
* D: What can be expressed about the domain (area of interest)
* K: The explicit knowledge of the participating persons
* I: What the persons in the audience interpret the model to say
* T: What relevant tools interpret the model to say
* G: The goals of the modeling

=== Physical quality ===
The three main aspects of physical quality are: 
* ''Externalization'' or the question "Is it possible to externalize knowledge by using the model language?",
* ''Internalizability'' about model persistence and availability, and
* ''Basically'' or the question "Is the model language able to express the model domain?"

''Externalization'' is presenting the modeller's concept in some model form for others to make sense of it. Other people can have look on it and can discuss. How other people perceives the model is a matter of internalization. After perceiving the model in their own way they can discuss and change their mind accordingly. To make sense others, it is better to have some model  language in common. Physical quality refers to the possibility of externalizing models by using model language that should be available and of course in persistence manner to be  internalized by audiences.

''How available is the model to audience?'' Availability depends on distributability, especially when members of the audience are geographically dispersed. Then, a model which is an electronically distributable format will be more easily distributed than one which must be printed on paper and sent by ordinary mail or fax. It may also matter exactly what is distributed, e.g. the model in an editable form or merely in an output format.

How persistent is the model, how protected is it against loss or damage? This also includes previous versions of the model, if these are relevant. E.g. for a model on disk, the physical quality will be higher if there is a backup copy, or even higher if this backup is on another disk whose failure is independent of the originals. Similarly, for models on paper, the amount and security of backup copies will be essential.

===Empirical quality===
To evaluate empirical quality, the model should be well externalized. Main aspects are: 
* Ergonomics,
* readability,
* layout, and
* information theory.

Basically empirical quality is about the question "Is the model easily readable?". Empirical quality deals with the variety of elements distinguished, error frequencies when being written or read, coding (shapes of boxes) and ergonomics for Computer-Human Interaction for documentation and modeling-tools. Ergonomics is the study of workplace design and the physical and psychological impact it has on workers. This quality is related to readability and layout. There are different factors that have an important impact on visual emphasis  like size, solidity, foreground/background differences, colour (red attracts the eye more than other colours),change(blinking or moving symbols attract attention), position and so on.

For graph aesthetics there may be different consideration(Battista, 1994, [[Roberto Tamassia|Tamassia]], 1988) like angles between edges not be too small, minimize the number of bends along edges, minimize the number of crossings between edges, place nodes with high degree in the centre of the drawing, have symmetry of sons in hierarchies, have uniform density of nodes in the drawing, have verticality of hierarchical structures and so on.

===Syntactical quality===
Syntactic quality is the correspondence between the model M and the language extension L of the language in which the model is written. Three aspects here are:
* ''Error detection'': During a modeling session, some syntactical errors--- syntactic incompleteness --- should be allowed on a temporary basis. For instance, although the DFD language requires that all processes are linked to a flow, it is difficult to draw a process and a flow simultaneously. Syntactical completeness has to be checked upon user's request. So, in contrast to implicit checks where the tool is ``forcing'' the user to follow the language syntax, explicit check can only detect and report on existing errors. The user has to make the corrections.
* ''Error correction'': to replace a detected error with a correct statement

===Semantic quality===
What is expressed in the model?
The semantic goals of this framework are: 
* Validity; if all the statements in the model are correct and related to the problem. M\D = Ø
* Completeness; if the model contains all relevant and correct statements to solve this problem. D\M = Ø

===Perceived semantic quality===
Perceived semantic quality is the relation between an actor's interpretation of a model and his/her knowledge of the domain.
* Perceived validity I\K = Ø
* Perceived completeness K\I = Ø

===Pragmatic quality===
Pragmatic quality is the correspondence between the model and people's interpretation of it. Comprehension is the only pragmatic goal in the framework. It is very important that people that read the model, understand it. No solution is good if no-one understands it. Pragmatic quality relates to the effect the model have on the participants and the world. Four aspects is treated specifically, that: 
* the human interpretation of the model is correct relative to what is meant.
* the tool interpretation is correct relative to what is meant to be expressed in the model.
* the participants learn based on the model.
* the domain is changed (preferably in a positive direction relative to the goal of modeling).

=== Social quality ===
The goal for the social quality is agreement. Agreement about knowledge, interpretation and model. Agreement is achieved if perceived semantic quality and comprehension are achieved. There is relative agreement and absolute agreement. For the three agreement parts (knowledge, interpretation and model) we can define:
* Relative agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are consistent.
* Absolute agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are equal.

=== Knowledge quality ===
Degree of internalization of existing organizational reality.
* Knowledge in domain is "complete": D\K = Ø.
* Knowledge in domain is "valid": K\D = Ø.

Activities for improvement:
* Stakeholder identification
* Knowledge source identification
* Research and investigation
* Participant selection
* Participant training
* Problem definition

===Language quality===
To receive good language quality it is important that:
* The language is appropriate to the domain.
* The language is appropriate to the participants' knowledge of modeling languages
* The language appropriate to express the knowledge of the participants

If the language quality is good, it will improve the participants' interpretation and other technical actors' interpretation.  
For additional detail, see [[the quality of modelling languages]]

===Organizational quality===
The organizational quality of the model relates to:
* That all statements in the model contribute to fulfilling the goals of modeling, or ''Organizational goal validity''.
* That all the goals of modeling are addressed through the model, or ''Organizational goal completeness''.

== Alternative quality framework ==
An alternative quality framework is the ''Guidelines of Modeling'' (GoM) based on general [[accounting]] principles. The framework "include the six principles of correctness, clarity, relevance, comparability, economic efficiency, and systematic design".&lt;ref name="Men06"/&gt; It was operationalized for [[Event-driven Process Chains]] and also tested in experiments &lt;ref&gt;J. Becker, M. Rosemann, and C. von Uthmann. (2000). "Guidelines of Business Process Modeling". In: [[W.M.P. van der Aalst]] et al. editors, ''Business Process Management. Models, Techniques, and Empirical Studies'', Springer, Berlin et al. Pp. 30-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

An other alternative modelling process quality framework actually based on SEQUAL is the "Quality of Modelling" framework (QoMo). QoMo is still a "preliminary modelling process oriented, based on knowledge state transitions, cost of the activities bringing such transitions about, and a goal structure for activities-for-modelling. Such goals are directly linked to concepts of SEQUAL".&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick van Bommel]] et al. (2007).

Customs and regulations for '''shopping hours for sunday''' (times that [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shops]] are open) vary from countries to cities.

==Shopping days and impact of holidays==
Some countries, particularly those with predominantly Christian populations or histories do not allow [[Sunday shopping]]. In Islamic countries some shops are closed on Fridays for noontime prayers. In [[Israel]] many shops are sometimes closed on Friday evening and Saturday during the daytime for [[Shabbat]] (the Jewish [[Sabbath]]).

Each state in [[Australia]] sets its own standard trading hours, but in most of the country the shops are open seven days a week for at least part of the day.

For some shops and other businesses in culturally Christian countries, [[Christmas Day]] is the only day in the year that they are closed.

In the United States and Canada, nearly all retail stores are open every day of the year except for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], Christmas Day, and [[Easter]] Sunday. Some suburban and smaller communities often close on Sundays. For example, [[Bergen County]], [[New Jersey]], next to New York City, completely bans Sunday shopping. However, nearly all stores in the United States have restricted hours on Sundays (most often 11 am or noon to 5 - 7 pm), and stores close early on important holidays, such as Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, New Year's Day, and Independence Day. Banks, post offices and other government offices either are closed on weekends, or close early on Saturdays. Many other non-retail establishments remain closed on weekends.

In Islamic countries shops may have special opening hours during [[Ramadan]].

In Israel, many shops may be closed on religious holidays other than [[Shabbat]], especially on Yom Kippur when nearly all businesses are closed.

==Australia==
Shop trading hours in Australia are regulated by individual states and territories.

The '''[[Australian Capital Territory]]''',&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/113775/13-retail-industry-chapter10.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317004825/http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/113775/13-retail-industry-chapter10.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''[[Northern Territory]]'''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and the states of '''[[New South Wales]]''', '''[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]''' and '''[[Tasmania]]''',  totally or almost totally deregulate shopping hours. All retail businesses in the two territories, regardless of size or product offer are able to stipulate their trading hours to suit their individual customer demand. Non-essential shops in the three states are required to remain closed on Christmas Day and Good Friday, ANZAC Day (until 1pm), and in Tasmania and NSW on Easter Sunday, and in NSW on Boxing Day (outside the Sydney special trading precinct). Shops in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory&lt;ref name="workplaceinfo.com.au"&gt;http://www.workplaceinfo.com.au/resources/employment-topics-a-z/shop-trading-hours&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.retail.org.au/index.php/articles/Federal_Govt_must_nationalise_Easter_trading_hours_-_ARA_calls_for_archaic_burden_to_be_lifted_from_retailers&lt;/ref&gt; can remain open on any public holiday. The two main supermarket operators, [[Woolworths Limited|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]], generally trade between 6 am and midnight every day, although some inner-city shops in Sydney and Melbourne operate twenty-four hours. In Canberra, Woolworths, Kmart and a few more shops open 24/7.

Melbourne generally has the most relaxed rules. Almost all shopping centres in Melbourne now trade until 9pm on Thursdays and Fridays as well as being open longer hours on Sundays. Interstate late night trading only occurs on either Thursday or Friday rather than both.

Melbourne is also famous for beginning the trend of 36-hour overnight trades in the lead-up to Christmas. Some of the larger shopping centres will open from 8 am December 23 until 6 pm on Christmas Eve. Centres often open to 10pm or midnight on most other nights in the fortnight before Christmas, and the first few days of the annual Boxing Day Sales.

Trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory have been deregulated since the repeal of the Trading Hours Act 1996 [ACT] on 29 May 1997.&lt;ref name="workplaceinfo.com.au"/&gt;

Shopping hours in '''[[South Australia]]''' are still regulated but the state government has passed numerous changes to relax the laws. Despite these changes retailers still face complicated and confusing trading laws, which stipulate trading hours based on size and product offer. Supermarkets that trade with fewer than 7 workers and with a trading floor less than 500&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are exempt from the laws. Larger supermarkets are required by law to close at Monday to Friday at 9pm, Saturdays at 5pm and are permitted to trade on Sundays and public holidays only from 11am to 5pm except ANZAC day which is 12 noon to 5pm; Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Christmas Day are the days that they must not open on.

In all areas of '''[[Queensland]]''', trading hours with major supermarkets are Monday to Saturday from 7am to 9pm  and Sundays and public holidays from 9am to 6pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/southeast-queensland-trading-hours-extended-20161014-gs2gxr.html|title=South-east Queensland trading hours extended|date=14 October 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most major shopping centres close at 5pm every day, with the exception of one night a week with what is so named 'late night shopping.' If a supermarket is in a major shopping centre, it must still cease trading at 9pm, with special access for just the supermarket.

In rural areas of '''[[Western Australia]]''' below the 27th parallel, local governments nominate shop closing hours to the State government, which, if accepted, are implemented by ministerial order. Shopping hours in the state's capital, Perth, are regulated by laws similar to South Australia's. Trading hours are stipulated in law, and are based on size and product offer. As in South Australia, smaller, independently operated supermarket retailers are exempted. Chain supermarkets are required to close Monday to Friday at 9pm, Saturdays at 5pm, and are permitted to trade on Sundays and public holidays only from 11am to 5pm.

==Austria==
[[Image:Das ist okay.JPG|thumb|220px|A [[convenience store]] at a [[Vienna]] train station selling ''Reiseproviant'' (travel provisions), the usual code for expanded opening hours]]
The situation in [[Austria]] is very similar to that in [[#Germany|Germany]], with most public holidays being based on Catholic holidays as the country is predominantly. Until the 1990s, all shops closed around noon on Saturday and did not reopen until Monday morning. Entrepreneurs such as [[Richard Lugner]] lobbied for an expansion of shopping hours, and laws are gradually being changed, with more and more exceptions granted. Meanwhile, as in Germany, [[gas station]]s and train stations in big cities have taken on the role of ''Nahversorger'' (supplying the local population with [[groceries]]) outside regular shopping hours.

Until very recently, shopping hours remained very restrictive. In 2008 Austria modified its 2003 ''Öffnungszeitengesetz'' ("opening times law"), with the new regulations allowing stores to be open from 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. until 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on weekdays, and on Saturday until 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. but are restricted to a total of 72 open hours per week. Bakeries can open 30 minutes earlier at 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Shops are closed on Sunday, but there are exceptions for tourist locations, train stations, airports, and the Christmas season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.german-way.com/travel-and-tourism/germany-for-tourists/shopping-in-germany/shopping-hours-in-germany/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
Store hours in Canada are regulated by each province or territory and, in some provinces, individual municipalities as well.

As a general rule, there is little regulation of shopping hours across the country. In the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, as well as all three territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut), there are no restrictions at all and stores can open 24/7 every day. As well, Nova Scotia permits any store to open every day of the year except Remembrance Day (November 11).

The remaining provinces (Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador) require stores to close on most major holidays. Furthermore, three provinces have further restrictions on Sunday openings. In Manitoba, stores may open on Sundays only with municipal approval and only between 9am - 6 pm (although exceptions for essential services apply). New Brunswick allows Sunday opening all year only with both municipal and provincial approval; otherwise it is permitted only from August until the New Year. Some communities in New Brunswick (such as [[Woodstock, New Brunswick|Woodstock]], [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]], [[Sussex, New Brunswick|Sussex]]) restrict Sunday hours of operation to 12pm - 5pm.

The province of Quebec is the only province in Canada that regulates shopping hours outside of Sundays and holidays. As a general rule, stores are permitted to open only between 8am and 9pm weekdays and 8am - 5pm weekends, excluding holidays. However, there are several exceptions, notably with several supermarkets in Montreal, which are open later hours or twenty-four hours.

In practice, few stores in Canada (outside of a small number of grocery stores) remain open twenty-four hours. Most shopping centres open from 10am-9pm Monday to Friday, 9:30am - 6pm (or in some cases 9pm) on Saturday and 12pm - 5pm or 6pm on Sunday. Many larger stores, such as [[Walmart Canada]] and most major grocery stores remain open 8am - 10pm Monday to Saturday and 10am - 6pm (in some provinces 8 am-10 pm) on Sunday, except in provinces where further restrictions apply. The [[Sobeys]] chain stays open from 7am - 11pm on weekdays and Saturdays, though some locations are open twenty-four hours. Many [[Loblaws]] brand stores such as [[Zehrs Markets]] and [[Real Canadian Superstore]] are open from 7am-11pm, 7 days of the week.

==China==
Trading hours in China, including Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions, are commercial decisions and are not regulated. Most shops are open on public holidays. Some convenience stores are open twenty-four hours and every day of the year, but only a few large supermarkets are open twenty-four hours a day.

During the Chinese New Year, many shops in China close for a few days, from Chinese New Year's Eve to the first day of the Chinese New Year. Or more often, to the third day of the Chinese New Year. Some shops in Hong Kong and Macau operate on Chinese New Year holidays, especially supermarket chains.

==Croatia==
Shopping hours in Croatia are currently unregulated after the Constitutional Court struck down a ban on Sunday shopping, which had been in effect from mid-2008 until mid-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ustavni-sud-ponistio-odluku-o-zabrani-rada-nedjeljom.html |title=Ustavni sud poništio zabranu rada nedjeljom |publisher=Dnevnik.hr |date=June 19, 2009|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most large out-of-town supermarkets are open between 07:30/08:00-21:00/22:00, Monday to Sunday. Shopping malls usually open at 09:00 and also close at 22:00, every day. Smaller supermarkets close earlier on Sundays, typically at 13:00. Other shops in urban areas are generally closed on Sundays.

Bakeries and newspaper kiosks often open very early in the morning, at 05:30 or 06:00, and open every day but not twenty-four hours. Gas stations and convenience stores along major roads as well as some pharmacies (at least one in each major city, five in Zagreb&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gljz.hr/templates/radnaHrv.asp?sifraStranica=362  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123083255/http://www.gljz.hr/templates/radnaHrv.asp?sifraStranica=362 |date=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) operate twenty-four hours.

==Denmark==
Standard operating hours for most businesses are generally 8:00/8:30 - 17:30. Since 1 October 2012, Danish shops have been allowed to be open every day around the clock, except on public holidays and after 3 pm on Christmas Eve's Day and New Year Eve's Day. However, shops with a turnover of less than DKK 32.2 million (2012 figure, indexed) are allowed to be open every day of the year. Still in many small towns shops are usually closed on Saturday after 2 pm and on Sunday. Some small shops are closed on Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politiken.dk/oekonomi/privatoekonomi/ECE1757519/ny-lukkelov-her-er-butikkernes-nye-aabningstider/ |title=Ny lukkelov: Her er butikkernes nye åbningstider |publisher=Politiken |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==

[[Sunday shopping]] was first introduced in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1994/19940446 |title=Laki vähittäiskaupan ja eräiden työliikkeiden liikeajasta annetun lain muuttamisesta |publisher=Finlex|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2015, the Finnish parliament voted for removing all opening hour restrictions for all retailers. The law came into effect on January 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/29122015/a1451287829878 |title=Kauppojen aukioloajat vapautuvat tällä viikolla – muutos näkyy selvimmin lauantai-illoissa |publisher=Helsingin Sanomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
In [[Germany]], shopping days and opening hours were previously regulated by a federal law called the "[[Ladenschlussgesetz|Shop Closing Law]]" (''[[Ladenschlussgesetz]]''), first enacted in 1956 and last revised on 13 March 2003. However, on 7 July 2006, the federal government handed over the authority to regulate shopping hours to the sixteen states. Since then, states have been allowed to pass their own laws regulating opening hours. The federal Ladenschlussgesetz continues to be valid in states that have not passed their own laws.

Under the old Ladenschlussgesetz, which currently applies only in the states of Bavaria and Saarland, shops may not open prior to 6 a.m. and may not stay open later than 8 p.m. from Monday to Saturday. Shops also have to stay closed on Sundays and public holidays (both federal and state), and special rules apply concerning [[Christmas Eve]] (December 24) should that day fall on a weekday.

There are several exceptions, including petrol stations and shops located in railway stations and airports, which may stay open past the normal hours. Most petrol stations in larger cities, and all situated on [[Autobahn]]s, are open twenty-four hours. Shops in so-called "tourist zones" may also open outside the normal hours, but they are restricted to selling souvenirs, handcrafted articles and similar tourist items. In connection with fairs and public market days, communities are allowed four days per year (normally Sundays) on which shops may open outside the normal restrictions; however, such shop openings may not take place during primary church services and they must close by 6 pm. Bakeries may open for business at 5.30 a.m. and may also open for a limited time on Sundays. Restaurants, bars, theatres, and cultural establishments are generally unaffected by the shop opening time restrictions. As most public holidays in Germany are religiously based, and since the religious holidays ([[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]]) are not uniform across Germany, shops may be closed due to a public holiday in one state, and open in a neighbouring state. Bavaria even differentiates between cities with Protestant or Catholic majorities.

The Ladenschlussgesetz has been the subject of controversy, as larger stores (and many of their customers) would prefer to have fewer restrictions on shopping hours, while trade unions, small shop owners and the church are opposed to a further loosening of the rules. On June 9, 2004, the German supreme court (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') rejected a claim by the German department store chain [[Kaufhof|''Kaufhof AG'']] that the shop-closing law was unconstitutional. Among other things, the court cited Article 140 of the German constitution ''([[Grundgesetz]])'' (which in turn invokes Article 139 of the 1919 [[Weimar Constitution]]) protecting Sundays and public holidays as days of rest and recuperation. However, the court in effect invited the federal parliament ''([[Bundestag]])'' to reconsider whether the states (''Länder'') should regulate hours instead of the federal government.

So far, no state has passed regulation that allows for general store opening on Sundays.

States with no restrictions from Monday to Saturday and varying regulations for Sunday:
*[[Baden-Württemberg]]
*[[Berlin]]
*[[Brandenburg]]
*[[Bremen]]
*[[Hamburg]]
*[[Hesse]]
*[[Lower Saxony]]
*[[Schleswig-Holstein]]

States with no restrictions from Monday to Friday and varying regulations for Saturday and Sunday:
*[[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]]
*[[North Rhine-Westphalia]]
*[[Saxony-Anhalt]]
*[[Thuringia]]

States where shops can open between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. from Monday to Saturday and regulations for Sunday vary:
*[[Rhineland-Palatinate]]
*[[Saxony]]

States with no liberalisation of opening hours exceeding the federal Ladenschlussgesetz:
*[[Bavaria]]
*[[Saarland]]

==Ireland==
Shops in Ireland may, with few exceptions (such as those involved in the sale of alcohol), open whenever they want, including Sundays and public holidays.

Here are typical hours:

''Monday - Wednesday, Friday, Saturday'':
*8:00/9:00/10:00 - 17:00/18:00/19:00

''Thursday'':
*8:00/9:00/10:00 - 20:00/21:00/22:00

''Sunday'':
*9:00/10:00/11:00 - 17:00/18:00/19:00

Many supermarkets are open twenty-four hours or have longer opening hours (like 8:00 - 22:00) everyday.

Large shopping centres and out-of-town (suburban) centres are typically open longer hours everyday (e.g. 09:00 - 21:00/22:00 weekdays, 09:00 - 19:00 Saturdays, 10:00 - 19:00 Sundays).

In the two weeks running up to Christmas, it is common for many shops to have extended opening hours; some may operate twenty-four hours until midnight on Christmas Eve.

Most shops (other than petrol stations or convenience stores) in smaller towns and villages don't open at all on Sundays. Almost all shops (again, petrol stations, convenience stores, etc. excepted) are closed on Christmas Day, though most are open on all other holidays.

Convenience stores, petrol stations and some chemists (drugstores) are normally open from early morning (05:00/06:00/07:00) to the late night (22:00/23:00/00:00), or often twenty-four hours, and New Year's Day is also Sunday hours.

In rural areas or in traditional trades, Wednesdays may be a half-day for businesses, closing at 12:30, but this practice has long passed in urban areas.

Alcohol is allowed to be sold only between 10:30 and 22:00 from Monday to Saturday and 12:30 to 22:00 on Sundays, but this does not affect opening hours (supermarkets will often block access to alcoholic products outside of these times). Alcohol cannot be sold at all on Good Friday.

==Japan==
In [[Japan]], most shops open at 10:00, and close at 20:00 (8 PM).&lt;ref name="jnto.go.jp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/essential/businesshours_holidays.html |title=Japan National Tourism Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks are open from 09:00-15:00 on weekdays, and closed on weekends; post offices are open from 09:00-17:00 on weekdays, and closed on weekends.&lt;ref name="jnto.go.jp"/&gt;

==Netherlands==
Regular opening hours: Monday 11:00 - 18:00; Tuesday-Friday: 09:30 - 18:00; Saturday: 09:30 - 17:00; Sunday (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Almere, Leiden and smaller tourist towns): 12 noon - 18:00. In many other towns shops are open every first Sunday of the month (koopzondag).

Shops are allowed to stay open until 22:00 from Monday to Saturday, however most close at 18:00 on weekdays, and 17:00 on Saturdays. Many supermarkets (including outlets from the market leader [[Albert Heijn]], several DIY-stores and [[IKEA]]) stay open until 20:00, 21:00 or 22:00. Most towns have their weekly shopping evening (koopavond), when shops stay open until 21:00, on Thursday or Friday. In touristic towns (like Amsterdam's city centre) supermarkets are allowed to be open on Sundays between 07:00 and 22:00. Many towns have one or more supermarkets (avondwinkels) that are open until later in the evening, occasionally all night. [[Convenience store]]s also have longer shopping hours; they are at many larger railway stations ("[[Albert Heijn]] to go") and some busy streets.

A regular size supermarket that is open until midnight seven days a week is the regular Albert Heijn at [[Schiphol Airport]] near [[Amsterdam]] (in the area of the airport before [[Airline ticket|ticket]] checks, not only for air travelers).

Shops that close on Sundays are usually also closed on public holidays, and other shops tend to have opening hours then like on Sundays. However, on Christmas Day and New Year's Eve almost all shops are closed.

For specific opening hours ("openingstijden") in the Netherlands there are several websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openingstijden.nl |title=openingstijden.nl|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opentot.nl |title=opentot.nl|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serbia==
Shopping hours in Serbia are unregulated. Large supermarkets are usually open from 07:00/07:30/08:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Sunday. Shopping malls open at 09:00 or 10:00 and also stay open until 22:00. Smaller supermarkets close earlier on Sundays, at 15:00 or 16:00.

Unlike neighbouring Croatia, many fast food outlets, bakeries, kiosks and convenience stores in urban areas operate twenty-four hours. Even some hypermarkets, like Tempo and Metro, are open twenty-four hours.

==Singapore==
Shopping hours for shopping malls are usually from 10:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Sunday. Automotive shops like tire outlets are usually from 09.30 to 19:00. Some supermarkets are open twenty-four hours. Most stores do not open on the first day of Chinese New Year because of low demand patronage.

==Sweden==
In Sweden there is no longer any law regarding shopping hours except for the nationally owned [[Systembolaget]] alcohol shops, which close at 20:00 at the latest on weekdays and 15:00 on Saturdays. On Sundays no alcohol is sold at all, although it is served in restaurants. Shopping centres and food shops are generally open every day; grocery stores often until 22:00 all days of the week and shopping centers usually until 20:00 on weekdays and 18:00 on weekends. Usually shopping centers are closed on New Year's Day, Midsummer's Day and Christmas Day, but grocery stores are open even those days albeit fewer hours than usual. Although there aren't any law that regulate business hours in general, labour laws do not allow work between midnight and 5 am in many professions including grocery stores and most shops.

==Switzerland==
Shopping hours are governed by [[Swiss cantons|cantonal law]] and vary accordingly, the only confederally mandated store holiday being August 1 (the national holiday), as per article 110 III of the Swiss Constitution. Most often, stores will be open from 8 or 9 am to 7 or 8 pm, 9 pm one day a week (usually a Thursday or a Friday) depending on the region. On Saturday and the day before public holidays, most stores close at around 4 or 5 pm. Stores are also generally closed on Sundays; see [[Sunday shopping#Switzerland|Sunday shopping in Switzerland]].

==United Kingdom==
In Great Britain, many retail stores are open every day. Some large supermarkets are open for twenty-four hours, (except on Sundays in England and Wales). Most stores do not open on Easter Sunday, New Year's Day or Christmas Day and have reduced hours on other public and bank holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theopeningtimes.co.uk |title=Opening Times - for UK Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical shopping hours===
'''Mondays''' - '''Saturdays:''' 9:00 am to 5:30pm, or 10:00 am to 8:00 pm/10:00 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchesterarndale.com/opening_times.htm |title=Opening Times |publisher=Manchester Arndale |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715145845/http://www.manchesterarndale.com/opening_times.htm |archivedate=2009-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sundays:''' - 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, or 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, or 12 noon to 6:00 pm.

Sunday shopping has become more popular, and most but not all shops in towns and cities are open for business. Shops 280&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and larger in England and Wales are allowed to trade for only six hours on Sundays; shops in Northern Ireland may open from 1:00&amp;nbsp;pm to 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm. In Scotland, in theory, Sunday is considered the same as any other day, and there are no restrictions. However, in practice, some shops do not open on Sunday or open for only four hours in smaller towns. In some [[Free Church of Scotland (post-1900)|Free Church]] dominated areas, for example [[Stornoway]] on the [[Isle of Lewis]], Sunday is considered a day of rest and consequently very few if any shops open at all.

==United States==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Manhattan CVS pharmacy.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A [[CVS/pharmacy]] in [[New York City]] that is open [[24/7]], but remains closed on Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day]]
In the [[United States|U.S.]], the various levels of government generally do not regulate the hours of the vast majority of retailers (though there are exceptions, such as the [[blue law]]), and with the main exception being shops licensed to sell spirits and other alcoholic beverages (for shopping hours, see [[Alcohol laws of the United States by state#List by state|alcohol sale hours by state]]) and car dealerships. Shopping hours vary widely based on management considerations and customer needs. Key variables are the size of the metropolitan area, the type of store, and the size of the store.

[[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] is the notable exception to all the traditions just described. Las Vegas is world-famous for its 24-hour local culture since it is an area with large gaming and tourism industries that operate 24/7. Since many of the employees in the city's primary industries work overnight shifts &amp;mdash; and because Nevada has few laws in regard to operating hours for any type of commercial activity &amp;mdash; many businesses cater to such workers. Thus, Las Vegas is home to many 24-hour [[car dealership]]s, [[dental clinic]]s, [[auto mechanic]]s, [[computer shop]]s, and even some smaller clothing stores.

'''Typical store shopping hours:'''

* Monday - Saturday 9 - 10 a.m. to 8 - 10 p.m. (9:00 - 10:00 to 20:00 - 22:00)
* Sunday 11 - 12 noon to 5 - 7 p.m. (11:00 - 12:00 to 17:00 - 19:00)

Supermarkets usually open at earlier hours, between 6 or 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (7:00 - 22:00) every day.  Boutiques and smaller shops often close early at 5 or 6 p.m. (17:00 or 18:00), and usually close once or twice a week, most often on Sunday.

Nearly all stores are closed on [[Easter]], [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] and [[Christmas Day]]. However, in recent years, several department stores and discount stores have started opening during the evening on Thanksgiving Day; see [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] for more details.  Early closing (half days) occur on [[Christmas Eve]] and [[New Year's Eve]]. Some stores might have reduced hours on other major holidays.

All malls and department stores, as well as most other stores remain open longer hours between Thanksgiving weekend and Christmas Eve for Christmas and holiday shopping. Many are open until 11 p.m. (23:00), and a few even longer.

Few stores remain open twenty-four hours; the main exceptions to this rule are most Walmarts throughout the country (especially Supercenters, which combine a discount store and full supermarket); many convenience stores, especially those that also sell motor fuel; and some drug stores like CVS, especially in larger cities like New York City and Las Vegas.

Some stores, especially in suburban and rural areas, might remain closed on Sundays for any reason (such as most retail in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], [[New Jersey]] due to the [[blue law]], which is next to New York City, and home to four major malls and has the largest retail in the nation).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3300">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[category (mathematics)|categories]], a '''sketch''' is a category ''D'', together with a set of [[cone (category theory)|cone]]s intended to be limits and a set of cocones intended to be colimits.  A '''model''' of the sketch in a category ''C'' is a [[functor]]
:&lt;math&gt;M:D\rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; 
that takes each specified cone to a limit cone in ''C'' and each specified cocone to a colimit cocone in ''C''.  Morphisms of models are [[natural transformation]]s.  Sketches are a general way of specifying structures on the objects of a category, forming a category-theoretic analog to the logical concept of a [[Theory_(mathematical_logic)|theory]] and its [[Model_theory|models]]. They allow multisorted models and models in any category.

Sketches were invented in 1968 by [[Charles Ehresmann]], using a different but equivalent definition.  There are still other definitions in the research literature.

A document issued by the organizers states: "we will march to demand an end to all forms of [[violence against women]], the figure of [[femicide]] as [[Aggravation (legal concept)|aggravation]] incorporated into the [[penal code]], budget for the implementation of the [[Domestic Violence]] Act and the processing and approval of the [[Abortion rights|law for voluntary interruption of pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=mendoz&gt;{{cite news|title=La 'Marcha de las Putas' llega a Mendoza para oponerse a la violencia de género|url=http://www.diariouno.com.ar/mendoza/La-Marcha-de-las-Putas-llega-a-Mendoza-para-oponerse-a-la-violencia-de-genero-20111124-0071.html|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Diario Uno|date=November 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061824/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/mendoza/La-Marcha-de-las-Putas-llega-a-Mendoza-para-oponerse-a-la-violencia-de-genero-20111124-0071.html|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Marchas de las Putas were held in Buenos Aires, [[Córdoba (city, Argentina)|Córdoba]], [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]] and Mar del Plata on November 3, 2012. The main theme for the protest were [[Gender role#Gender stereotypes|sexual stereotypes]]. The march began with an exposition of photographs from the previous rally. There were also workshops and debate spaces regarding intimate and social respect, non-sexist education and [[Media violence research|media violence]], while several music bands performed on stage. Organizer Verónica Lemi explained: "marching is not enough. We need to raise awareness and create spaces for reflection and debate so we can take our slogans to our daily lives. We need society to stop justifying, tolerating or minimizing sexual abuses, and to stop victim-blaming." She also pointed at the need to promote that "sexual abuse survivors speak of their experiences without being judged for it, and get the help they need to heal." The objective of the protest was to re-signify the word "[[Spanish profanity#Puta|puta]]" (equivalent for "slut", but also for "prostitute"), to take its violent power away so it cannot be used to cause harm, to favor the construction of a society where everyone is respected regardless of gender, sexual orientation or chosen lifestyle.&lt;ref name=telam&gt;{{cite news|title=La 'Marcha de las Putas' dijo "No a los abusos sexuales"|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/nota/42978/|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Télam|date=November 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212104428/http://www.telam.com.ar/nota/42978/|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2013, another Marcha de las Putas took place in Buenos Aires. It began with an open space for sharing experiences of abuse, most of which had happened to the speakers during childhood or as teenagers, and kept silenced during years. "It took me twelve years to tell my family I was abused when I was 10. I only was able to do it after I joined this movement and found other people went through similar situations" explained Deborah, one of the organizers. Rita González, other of the organizers, explained the march is framed in a wider range of "actions done during the whole year, to give legal assistance, emotional support and company to people who have been through difficult situations, which they begin to overcome in healing encounters where they can verbalize their pain." The selected slogan for the protest was: "''Desnudando la cultura de la violación'' (Disclosing [[rape culture]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodríguez|first=Carlos|title=Una tarde de decir y escuchar verdades|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-230662-2013-10-06.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Pagina12|date=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities known to host Slutwalks were [[Posadas, Argentina|Posadas]], [[La Plata]] and [[Formosa, Argentina|Formosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gimena Franchini Díaz|first=Constanza Pastor|title=TU MAMÁ TAMBIÉN: APROPIACIONES DE LA MARCHA DE LAS PUTAS EN ARGENTINA|publisher=Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|isbn=978-950-33-0980-3|url=http://publicaciones.ffyh.unc.edu.ar/index.php/2congresogeneroysociedad/article/view/878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

María José Lubertino, once again participant of the march, said: "in the 21st century, we cannot allow women to be judged for how we dress. A few weeks ago our [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|President Cristina]] was discredited for wearing [[leggings]], a clear example of what we see in a daily basis in different spheres.

On November 19, 2013, La Marcha de las Putas participated among several other organizations in a wider protest to raise awareness on [[child sexual abuse]]. It included activities related to the importance of detection and prevention of child molestation, legal processes, and healing. The protest advocated for better laws, and for the effective application of the existing laws. The day was closed with speeches from the organizations, and artistic activities for the participants.&lt;ref name=elsol&gt;{{cite news|title=Una marcha a Casa Rosada para luchar contra el abuso infantil|url=http://elsolonline.com/noticias/ver/1311/188673/una-marcha-a-casa-rosada-para-luchar-contra-el-abuso-infantil|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=El Sol|date=November 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212200415/http://elsolonline.com/noticias/ver/1311/188673/una-marcha-a-casa-rosada-para-luchar-contra-el-abuso-infantil|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marcha das Vadias Brasília2011.JPG|thumbnail|left|Marcha das Vadias at [[Brasilia]], on June 18, 2011. The sign reads: "Changing the world through [[Feminisms]]" ]]
The first SlutWalk took place in [[Sao Paulo]] under the name "Marcha das Vadias" (also "Marcha de las Vagabundas") on June 4, 2011. Around 300 people gathered, marching in daily outfits. Only a 23 years old student participated in underwear. The organizers of the event, writer Solange De-Ré and publicist Madô Lopez explained: "We do not want [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]]. We want people to dress normally, as they like to wear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toledo Piza|first=Paulo|title=Mulheres com pouca roupa fazem a 'Marcha das Vadias' em SP|url=http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2011/06/mulheres-com-pouca-roupa-fazem-marcha-das-vadias-em-sp.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, 2011 a new Marcha das Vadias gathered one thousand people at [[Brasilia]]. Despite the name, the SlutWalk brought together women, men and families, sometimes including babies. Participants chanted slogans against sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cerca de mil pessoas participam da 'Marcha das Vadias' em Brasília|url=http://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/2011/06/cerca-de-mil-pessoas-participam-da-marcha-das-vadias-em-brasilia.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2011, hundreds of people attended Marcha das Vadias at [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]], in the South Zone of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Participants advocated for the improvement in hospitals and police stations for women victims of sexual abuse, access to abortion with no paperwork when pregnancy is the result of rape, and the effective implementation of the [[Lei Maria da Penha]], in cases of battered women. During 2011, new Marchas das Vadias were organized at [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Florianópolis]], [[Juiz de Fora]], [[Recife]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]].&lt;ref name=brazil1&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha das Vadias reúne mulheres no Rio contra a violência sexual|url=http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2011/07/marcha-das-vadias-reune-mulheres-no-rio-contra-violencia-sexual.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2012, Marcha das Vadias took place simultaneously in [[Brasilia]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Belo Horizonte, Sao Paulo and Vitoria, among others. During the march in Brasilia, a man participating in the protest began to speak offensive phrases to women and homosexuals, and then dropped his pants to show his penis. He was quickly arrested and taken to a nearby police station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scantily-clad women protest in mass Slut Walk in Brazil|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/scantily-clad-women-protest-in-mass-slut-walk-in-brazil/story-e6frf00i-1226369033307|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Homem é detido por ato obsceno em Marcha das Vadias no DF|url=http://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/2012/05/homem-e-detido-por-atentado-ao-pudor-em-marcha-das-vadias-no-df.html|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, 2013, Marcha das Vadias was held in Recife and Sao Paulo, gathering over  2000 and 1000 people respectively. Késia Salgado, organizer at Recife stated: "The march is to show that women will no longer be silent, that impunity will not happen; we live a social epidemic and have to reeducate ourselves. Marcha das Vadias does not end when the protest is over, we keep working so that daily violence is not forgotten." In this city, the protest included various artistic interventions of groups supporting the cause. Towards the end of the march at Praça da Independência, the group opened space for testimonials. With megaphones, women victims of sexual assault shared their experiences with the rest of the participants.&lt;ref name=ne10uol&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha das Vadias no Recife exige o fim da violência contra a mulher|url=http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cotidiano/grande-recife/noticia/2013/05/25/marcha-das-vadias-no-recife-exige-o-fim-da-violencia-contra-a-mulher-421384.php|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Uol|date=May 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211214350/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cotidiano/grande-recife/noticia/2013/05/25/marcha-das-vadias-no-recife-exige-o-fim-da-violencia-contra-a-mulher-421384.php|archivedate=December 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sao Paulo, the march walked past rue Augusta, a street known for being a gathering point for prostitutes, as a gesture of support. "It's in Augusta where we find the women that society likes to call sluts, or rapeable" explained a member of the collective."Our intention is to create visibility on the fight against violence towards women. We want to encourage women who are suffering violence to break the silence and make men aware of the daily acts of violence they practice." Protesters also handed over to pedestrians a "security card" to be kept in wallets, containing the phone number of services which  help abused women.&lt;ref name=folhauol&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha das Vadias reúne cerca de mil pessoas na av.

There was a new Marcha das Vadias organised at Brasilia on June 22, 2013, gathering around 3000 people. Protesters spoke against the State intervention on women's bodies, and against religious leaders occupying seats in State institutions. A new episode was reported of a man who, in apparent state of drunkenness, insulted the manifestants and dropped his pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Calgaro|first=Fernanda|title=Marcha das Vadias no DF reúne 3.000, diz PM; manifestante admite "cansaço" por atos|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2013/06/22/marcha-das-vadias-no-df-reune-3000-diz-pm.htm|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Uol|date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, Marcha das Vadias was planned to match a visit from [[Pope Francis]] to the city, on June 22, 2013, in the context of the [[World Youth Day]], and the protest was renamed "Jornada Mundial das Vadias (World Slut Day)". Organizer Rogéria Peixinho explained "performing the act during the Pope's visit is also a way to put another youth on the street, establishing a political counterpoint. We want to show that there is another youth and another way of thinking about the world, and the chosen date also has to do with it." There were several participants in costumes representing religious characters such as [[nun]]s and the [[Pope]], and signs with puns and slogans rejecting religious views on women and sexuality. A group called Católicas Pelo Direito de Decidir (Catholic Women for the Right to Choose) in favor of abortion, women priests and married priests, participated in the protest.

Peixinho asserted the importance of the Pope's visit regarding the objectives of Marcha das Vadias: "The presence of the Pope and the public resources allocated for the visit of a spiritual leader calls into question the secular State. (...) This matter falls within the axes of our movement, as well as the right to the body, the complaints about the rape cases that are increasing especially in Rio, and the formulation of public policies to protect women." The participants, during the march, encountered a group of about 50 pilgrims from [[France]], [[Chile]] and [[Italy]], participating in the World Youth Day, who were offended by the act and started insulting the participants. A pilgrim spat in the face of a protester. However, most pilgrims peacefully observed the demonstration and some foreigners, without realizing it, mingled among the protesters.&lt;ref name=brazil2&gt;{{cite news|last=Bertolotto|first=Rosrigo|title=Peregrino cospe no rosto de manifestante da Marcha das Vadias|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2013/07/27/peregrino-cospe-no-rosto-de-manifestante-da-marcha-das-vadias.htm|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Uol|date=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the protest, some of the participants smashed statues of saints. Peixinho assured the action was not planned nor encouraged by the organizers, but after the incident several of them suffered death threats via phone calls, text messages and messages on social networks, and several pages were created on Facebook exposing their phone numbers and addresses. The movement denounced the case to the [[Human Rights Commission]] of Alerj and sought support of [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barros|first=Jorge Antonio|title=Líderes da Marcha das Vadias são ameaçadas de morte|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/ancelmo/posts/2013/08/02/lideres-da-marcha-das-vadias-sao-ameacadas-de-morte-505554.asp|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=O Globo|date=August 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212124712/http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/ancelmo/posts/2013/08/02/lideres-da-marcha-das-vadias-sao-ameacadas-de-morte-505554.asp|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the demonstrations women chanted things such as "Claudie Ferreria resists", referring and standing in solidarity to the black woman who was murdered  and then dragged on the street attached to a Military Police Van in Rio de Janeiro. In addition to the chants, phrases such as "This is not an invitation", were written on the bodies of the demonstrators to protest sexual abuse and sexism against black women.

The protest proceeded to divide into two locations, at a Women's Police Station and Cidade Baixa. At the Women's Police Station, the focus was violence against women perpetuated by the police. Open letters with demands, such as better service conditions at the station, increased vacancies in shelters for female victims of violence and violence prevention programs. Protesters as well laid in the street to symbolically depict the systemic violence against black women in Brazil. The sector of the protest that continued to Cidade Baixa, marked the pavement with graffiti at places where sexist, racist and homophobic events occurred. One of the demonstration stops were at Pingium bar in which protestors booed the bar, kissed,and burned the entrance carpet along with their bras.&lt;ref name="blackwomenofbrazil.co"/&gt;}}

==Chile==

On September 19, 2011 the first Slutwalk took place in the city of [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] with the name La Marcha de las Putas y las Maracas, and was appointed to walk from Plaza del Corregidor  to [[Estación Mapocho]]. The protest was organized by collective Rita Lazo, which explained: "this is an answer to the violence still present in many areas of our lives. When we appropriate and re-signify the word "puta", we take down its offensive meaning and fight against the dominance over our bodies. We abort fear: when a woman says NO it means NO. Nothing justifies a rapist's actions. Let us break the [[Stereotype threat|rules on how to "be a woman"]]. This struggle is not only one of women, but of society as a whole.

On January 13, 2012, over 400 people, mostly female students, marched in the city of Ñuñoa under the name "La Marcha de las Putas" to protest against the city mayor Pedro Sabat for his saying regarding the occupation of the Female National Boarding School. In a debate with the president of the [[Student Federation of the University of Chile|Student Federation]], [[Camila Vallejo]], Sabat described the Boarding School as "a [[harlotry]]", and accused the students of engaging in [[sex trade]] within the institution. Previous to the protest, the students presented legal charges for [[defamation]] against the mayor.

Io Guiria, spokeswoman of the students ensured that they were "ready to carry out the protest to the very end". "We believe the Justice system must take action after such serious declarations" she stated, and also added they expect an [[indemnity]] as well as a public apology "and, if possible, [[jail time]]." The protest ended when Special [[Carabiniers of Chile|Carabiniers]] Forces acted to prevent the crowd from cutting street traffic on Irarrázaval street, and faced protesters with [[tear gas|tear gas bombs]] and [[water cannons]]. Student Natalia Torres was hit by a stone in the head and was left unattended for 40 minutes until she got help from a doctor who walked by. Six people were arrested by the time the protest was over.&lt;ref name=chile&gt;{{cite news|title=Manifestantes realizan 'Marcha de las prostitutas' en rechazo a alcalde Sabat|url=http://cnnchile.com/noticia/2012/01/13/manifestantes-realizan-marcha-de-las-prostitutas-en-rechazo-a-alcalde-sabat|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=CNN Chile|date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fotos: La "Marcha de las Putas" contra el alcalde Sabat en Ñuñoa|url=http://www.elmostrador.cl/pais/2012/01/14/fotos-la-marcha-de-las-putas-contra-el-alcalde-sabat-en-nunoa/|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=El Mostrador|date=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colombia==

On February 25, 2012, the first Slutwalk  was held with the name "La Marcha de las Putas" in the cities of [[Armenia, Colombia|Armenia]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Barranquilla]], [[Manizales]], [[Medellín]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], the island of [[San Andrés (island)|San Andrés]], [[Villavicencio, Colombia|Villavicencio]], [[Tunja]], and [[Bogotá]], gathering up to 2000 people in the country's capital, at [[Bolívar Square]]. The participants included men, women, the LGBT community, intellectuals, college students and [[Catholic Church]] representatives. Some men assisted in naked torsos and wearing red lipstick. There were also many topless women, one of which explained: "I came naked today because it must be clear than my body is mine alone, and even walking in bare breasts only I decide who gets to touch me." Mar Candela, one of the organizers, was in charge of the opening speech: "We suffer to be called sluts for living our sexuality freely. When we are victims of violence, there are those who dare say we "asked for it". We are victims of harassment in buses, in streets, in public spaces. This society need to understand that when a woman says no, it's no." In Colombia, a woman is victim of abuse every 6 hours, and an average 245 women are victims of some kind of violence every day. Mar Candela stated La Marcha de las Putas proved that all sections of society are committed to ending it. "We'll do it. We'll make possible that no woman is made victim of violence under the complicity of society's silence." &lt;ref name=colombia2&gt;{{cite news|last=Alsema|first=Adriaan|title=Colombia SlutWalk draws thousands|url=http://colombiareports.co/colombia-slutwalk-draws-thousands/|accessdate=November 26, 2013|newspaper=Colombia Reports|date=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=semana&gt;{{cite news|title=Este sábado se realizará la 'marcha de las putas' en Colombia|url=http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/este-sabado-realizara-marcha-putas-colombia/253920-3|accessdate=November 26, 2013|newspaper=Semana|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest was closed by a speech from a group of [[sex workers]] who demanded the government and society to [[Sex workers rights|recognize their rights]]. Darly, one of them, expressed: "We want to be respected. We work with our bodies, like everyone else. The shoemaker uses his hands to make shoes, the football player uses his feet to score goals.

On April 6, 2013, La Marcha de las Putas was held simultaneously in Bogotá, where over 1000 people attended, Barranquilla, [[Cali, Colombia|Cali]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], Manizales and Medellín. Mar Candela, organiser at Bogotá and coordinator of the protest on the national level, decided to use the word "PUTAS" as an acronym for "''Por Una Transformación Auténtica y Social'' (For An Authentic Social Transformation)", which had been used in [[Peru]] during the protests. She adds: "The word "puta" shouldn't even be used as an offense, and doing so reveals great ignorance. Whatever a woman does with her vagina, she is a human being with full [[individual rights]]. It is commonly said that being a prostitute means losing [[constitutional rights]] and State protection, but [[Legal prostitution#Prostitution legal and regulated|prostitution is legal in Colombia]]. And even if it was illegal, they are still in complete possession of their rights, because [[human rights]] apply even for criminals."

According to Mar Candela, all fractions of society were represented in the march including [[Catholics]], [[protestants]], [[LGBT]], [[atheists]], artists, [[agnostics]] and [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|krishnas]], which allowed to treat the subject outside of the traditional feminist context. She also spoke regarding activities from La Marcha de las Putas apart from the street protests: "we've been collaborating with schools and communities in different neighborhoods, and now we're magnifying those processes. Today, our feminist movement and the urban pedagogy of Slutwalk counts on the presence of [[Sexology|sexual psychologist]] Alejandra Quintero, who's strongly supporting the matter of female body [[empowerment]]."&lt;ref name=colombia&gt;{{cite news|title=Habla la líder de la 'Marcha de las Putas|url=http://www.sercolombiano.com/2013/03/11/habla-la-lider-de-la-marcha-de-las-putas/|accessdate=November 27, 2013|newspaper=Ser Colombiano|date=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcha de las Putas / March of the Whores, 06-04-2013|url=http://vizzorimage.photoshelter.com/gallery/-/G0000VHdlayx1PRc/|accessdate=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as fighting conservative attitudes, women and women's organizations on the march were concerned about the sexual violence that has been an integral part of the [[Colombian armed conflict|armed conflict]].

Rubiela Valderrama, organiser at Cartagena, stated that many organizations, collectives and foundations were invited to join the protest. She also explained the objective of La Marcha de las Putas is "to create interest among the Cartagena community, to promote its participation in [[affirmative action]] focused on the transformation of individual and collective conscience to break the oppression, injustice and any rule or norm which naturalizes violence against women in the city." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Álvarez|first=Rubén Darío|title=El sábado habrá Marcha de las putas en Getsemaní|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.co/cartagena/local/el-sabado-habra-marcha-de-las-putas-en-getsemani-114528|accessdate=November 27, 2013|newspaper=El Universal|date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2013, La Marcha de las Putas organised a protest in front of a famous restaurant in Bogotá called Andrés Carne de Res. An accusation had been made on November 2, of a 19-year-old woman who was raped by a lawyer in the restaurant's parking lot and Andrés Jaramillo, owner of the restaurant, pointed at the victim's clothes as an explanation. The initiative was spread mainly through social networks. After the events, Jaramillo apologized and denied to have a sexist attitude, and the accused rapist presented himself at the [[public prosecutor]]'s office for questioning, but was not arrested.&lt;ref name=uypress&gt;{{cite news|title=Colombia: Marcha de las Putas denuncia violación en restaurante|url=http://www.uypress.net/uc_46331_1.html|accessdate=November 27, 2013|newspaper=UY Press|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costa Rica==

[[File:Marcha de las putas en Costa Rica, 2011 -2.jpg|thumb|right|Marcha de las putas in [[Costa Rica]], August 14, 2011. The sign reads: "Bishop, what about violent men? Won't you say anything to them?"]]
On August 14, 2011, the first Slutwalk of Costa Rica was held in the city of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]] with the name "La Marcha de las Putas" and the invitation was spread mainly through social networks. Organizer Montserrat Sagot, [[university professor]] and feminist leader, is the author of several books including "When Violence Against Women Kills: [[Femicide]] in Costa Rica." The protest was directed against remarks made on August 2 by senior Catholic [[clerics]] during a ceremony in [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] honouring Costa Rica's [[patron saint]], the [[Virgen de los Angeles]].

At the event, [[Bishop (Catholicism)|Bishop]] José Francisco Ulloa called on women to dress "modestly" to not be "[[dehumanized]]" and "[[Objectification|objectified]]." "The sexual gift that God gave women is wrapped in love and fidelity for its ultimate purpose: fertilization," Ulloa said. Mexican [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Francisco Robles, representing [[Pope Benedict XVI]], said at the ceremony that a woman's mission "does not consist in emulating men, but rather in creating a more humane world by exercising creativity in the household." Robles urged women to enter public life "without imitating men," and to strengthen their role at home as mothers and family members. "The mandate from the (Catholic) church for women to act with modesty and decency is the same conservative message that intends to blame women for the abuses of which they are victims," Sagot said.&lt;ref name=costarica&gt;{{cite news|title="Slut Walk" In Costa Rica Today|url=http://www.insidecostarica.com/dailynews/2011/august/14/costarica11081401.htm|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Inside Costa Rica|date=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of organizers issued a communication in defense of the right of women to dress as they wish, with no Church or institution imposing limitations. "Our claim is the most basic of [[feminism]]: we decide over our own lives, no one else has to tell us how to dress, what to think or what we should do. On the contrary, it is necessary to teach men not to rape, assault and abuse" says the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Costa Rica tendrá su propia 'Marcha de las putas' el próximo domingo|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/08/11/noticias/1313069543.html|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=El Mundo|date=August 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also demanded the enforcement of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), ratified by Costa Rica in 1986 and the Convention of Belém do Pará ([[Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women|Inter-American Convention]] on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women) ratified by Costa Rica in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solórzano-Alfaro|first=Gustavo|title="Marcha de las Putas", Costa Rica|url=http://www.gustavosolorzanoalfaro.com/2011/08/marcha-de-las-putas-costa-rica.html|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=La Casa de Asterión|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the protest, Sagot wrote: "The march proved that in this country exists a new generation, who is not willing to answer with "good manners" to institutions which, like the Catholic hierarchy, disrespect their rights, blame women for the violence they suffer and which, from a position of power ( ... ) attempt to impose norms and lifestyles to people who do not agree with them." She also linked the protests to the "evident commitments" of [[Laura Chinchilla|President Laura Chinchilla]] to the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sagot|first=Montserrat|title=La marcha de las putas y la Costa Rica que ya no es|url=http://www.nacion.com/foros/marcha-putas-Costa-Rica_0_1217478266.html|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=La Nacion|date=September 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230516/http://www.nacion.com/foros/marcha-putas-Costa-Rica_0_1217478266.html|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 2013, a second Marcha de las Putas was organised at San José with the slogan "''No es no. La violencia nunca es consentida'' (No means no: violence is never consented)". The choice of the slogan denounced sayings from former deputy [[Óscar López (politician)|Oscar Lopez]], who declared there is "a thin line between consent and rape". Organizers claim such statements minimize the problem of sexual violence against women, justify the actions of rapists, and reinforce misogynistic speech. Their aim was that Lopez retracts his comments and recognises that sexual assault as a serious form of violence against women. They also called for Lopez's political party, [[Accessibility without Exclusion|Partido de Accessibilidad Sin Exclusión]], to commit on taking action, and for all other political parties to pronounce on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Álvarez|first=William|title=Marcha de las Putas buscará que Óscar López se retracte de sus comentarios|url=http://www.teletica.com/Noticias/33222-Marcha-de-las-Putas-buscara-que-Oscar-Lopez-se-retracte-de-sus-comentarios.note.aspx|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Teletica|date=November 21, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125010819/http://www.teletica.com/Noticias/33222-Marcha-de-las-Putas-buscara-que-Oscar-Lopez-se-retracte-de-sus-comentarios.note.aspx|archivedate=November 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meza|first=Iván|title="Marcha de las putas" llama la atención acerca de la violencia|url=http://www.teletica.com/Noticias/33430-Marcha-de-las-putas-llama-la-atencion-acerca-de-la-violencia-.note.aspx|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Teletica|date=November 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002709/http://www.teletica.com/Noticias/33430-Marcha-de-las-putas-llama-la-atencion-acerca-de-la-violencia-.note.aspx|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecuador==

On March 11, 2012, the first Slutwalk took place in [[Quito]], with the name "La Marcha de las Putas". [[Sex workers]] and [[transgender]] people attended the event, and the meeting of the organizer previous to the protest was at Casa Transgénero (Transgender House). [[Social movement]] Ruptura also supported the march, stating: "This protest advocates for the right of women to express their reality in their [[clothes]], poses and [[make up]], and this can't be turned into an excuse for [[harassment]] and [[abuse]]."&lt;ref name=universo&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha de las putas se realiza este sábado para protestar contra la violencia|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2012/03/09/1/1355/marcha-putas-realiza-sabado-protestar-contra-violencia.html|accessdate=November 30, 2013|newspaper=El Universal|date=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2013, another Marcha de las Putas was organized in Quito by [[feminist]] and [[LGBT activism|LGBT collectives]], gathering nearly 3000 people. Organizer Ana Almeida explained: "We want to establish a precedent of this message of no violence against women, because women's bodies must be respected; we can't allow women to be [[stigmatized]] for their clothes. Nothing can justify violence. We make a constant political work to redefine the word "puta" and what it means to both women and men."

At the march, there was an increased number of male participants, as well as people with naked torsos, a fake [[Catholic priest]] in pink robe, many signs with rhymes and slogans, [[live music]]ians and [[stilts|stiltwalkers]]. Halfway through the protest, rain began to pour down, but the protest continued while many chanted: "''¡Que llueva, que llueva, las putas no se ahuevan!'' (Let it rain, let it rain, sluts don't give up!)" &lt;ref name=ecuador&gt;{{cite news|title=La Marcha de las Putas cuenta con más apoyo de los hombres|url=http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/sociedad/item/la-marcha-de-las-putas-cuenta-con-mas-apoyo-de-los-hombres.html|accessdate=November 30, 2013|newspaper=El Telégrafo|date=April 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203130728/http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/sociedad/item/la-marcha-de-las-putas-cuenta-con-mas-apoyo-de-los-hombres.html|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honduras==

On August 6, 2011, Andrea Nuila co-organized the event with her group Atrévete, the [[Tegucigalpa]] chapter of [[Hollaback!]], an international women-led movement to end [[street harassment]]. For Nuila, the march is also about confronting the dangerous combination of [[Patriarchy|male dominance]] and [[impunity]] that puts Honduran women at risk, as seen in the high occurrence of [[femicide]]. "They're increasing every day. We believe that women are not only victims of sexual harassment, they're also victims of domestic violence. And we have a big level of impunity from the state institutions" she said.

Francisco Murillo López, head of the Dirección Nacional de Investigación Criminal (National Direction of Criminal Investigation), was asked to explain the [[Gender inequality in Honduras|rise in the killing of women]]. He said "the most significant factor is [[gender equality]]. Women are participating in roles that were previously carried out by men. Today we see women driving taxis, driving a truck. This shows how much Honduran society is changing, and therefore it is normal to see women dying. Gender equality is the principal reason that women are now involved in violent affairs linked to [[gangs|organized gangs]] and [[common crime]]."

However, according to the research of Ana Carcedo, the region's foremost expert on femicide, 12% of female homicides in Honduras can be linked to organized crime, while in 40% of the cases, the killer is either a current or former lover, while more than 9% of the killings result from sexual attacks, and almost 8% of the women are being killed by their family members. All in all, according to Carcedo, in roughly three-quarters of the cases, the women were killed in one way or another for being women. This is the opposite of the conclusion of the Honduran police chief that they are being killed for taking on male roles.

Sandra Maribel, director of the [[radio station]] Radio Gualcho, was present at the event. According to her analysis: "The use of language to discriminate based on the way we dress is related to the broader [[Women in Honduras|women's struggle in Honduras]]. There's lots of violence inside the home, and we want to change that. Maybe a good place to start is by changing the language used to refer to us women." She also referred to the recent ban on the [[morning-after pill]] approved by the [[Congress of Honduras]]: "The women's struggle isn't isolated from the larger struggle of the Honduran people. It's a liberation struggle, not only in the political sense, but in every sense. And the Honduran women have been active participants in the resistance against the [[Honduras coup d'etat]]. But we're not doing it just to make the crowd bigger. We want the order of things to change in this country."

Maria Victoria, a participant who works as an HIV/AIDS prevention worker, urged people to consider how the word slut is used to discriminate against the trans community as well: "Women and trans people who choose to dress sexy shouldn't be called sluts." Fernando Reyes, of [[National Popular Resistance Front|Honduras' diversity and resistance movement]] considered the march as a response to all forms of intolerance: "Today is the best example, seeing all the youth of the [[sexual diversity]] and various [[Cultural diversity|cultural collectives]] demonstrating and realizing that even as youths they have a right to be who they want to be."

As a closing activity, participants took turns writing messages on the side of the city's main [[Cathedral|Catholic cathedral]]. Nuila explained: "The church is one of the institutions that has oppressed women's rights the most, especially in a [[Catholic country]] like ours. [[Abortion by country#National laws|Abortion is illegal in Honduras]], not only for the women, because it's criminalized from three to six years in jail, but he doctor is also penalized, and their license restricted." &lt;ref name=honduras&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeston|first=Jesse|title=SlutWalk Lands in Tegucigalpa|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=6933|accessdate=December 1, 2013|newspaper=The Real News|date=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2012, hundreds of people participated in the second Marcha de las Putas at Tegucigalpa. Many women assisted with their male partners, and the protest counted on the participation of [[LGBT activism|LGBT organizations]]. "We're marching to protest against the sexual harassment us women suffer for the way we choose to dress" explained Karla Martínez, coordinator of the protest, "we're tired of our clothing being an excuse for men to feel they have the right to [[rape]] us or [[grope]] us, that's why we're here today, demanding an end to violence against women."

Mildred Tejada, from the [[United Nations System]], was present at Marcha de las Putas. "The word "puta" causes aversion, it's an insult to all women regardless of the profession they exercise" she said. Sergio Ulloa, one of the male protesters, commented on the march: "We live in a [[machista]] country, and it's about time men stop harassing and sexually abusing women. Women must have their rights respected, and men must respect and value women."&lt;ref name=pdigital&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha de las Putas en Honduras pide frenar violencia vs mujeres|url=http://periodicodigital.com.mx/notas/marcha_de_las_putas_en_honduras_pide_frenar_violencia_vs_mujeres#.UptBKtLuI7p|accessdate=December 1, 2013|newspaper=Periódico Digital|date=December 8, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203085055/http://periodicodigital.com.mx/notas/marcha_de_las_putas_en_honduras_pide_frenar_violencia_vs_mujeres#.UptBKtLuI7p|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==

[[File:Marcha de las putas en Costa Rica, 2011 -10.jpg|thumb|left|Sign from La Marcha de las Putas saying: "I don't want your [[catcalling]], I want your respect"]]
On June 12, 2011 Slutwalk took place in [[Mexico City]], with the name Marcha de las Putas. Women, men and children, mostly in [[casual wear]] but some in heels and [[Schoolgirl uniform|schoolgirl]] miniskirts, marched with signs saying "No means No" and "prostitutes are [[sacred]]." One self-described grandmother in a low-cut blouse advised women to dress as they pleased. "This is a problem of all society" said Edith López, spokeswoman of the protest, "we need to re-educate ourselves, because victims of [[sexual violence]] are not the ones responsible." &lt;ref name=mexico&gt;{{cite news|title=La 'Marcha de las putas' reclama respeto para las mujeres en Ciudad de  México|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/06/12/mexico/1307914626.html|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=El Mundo|date=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar walks were held in [[Cancún]],  [[Guadalajara]], [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] and [[Sinaloa]].

According to different [[non-government organizations]], [[violence against women]] has raised by 30%, and an average 1200 women each year receive medical assistance for [[Domestic violence|domestic]] or [[workplace violence]].

On June 27, 2011, Marcha de las Putas was organized at [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], with the participation of [[activists]], [[students]], [[housewives]], [[academics]], [[professionals]], [[mothers]] and a few female [[politicians]], whose presence was questioned by some participants who considered they were not so interested in [[gender equality]] as they were in being seen among the crowd. About a dozen women were dressed as [[prostitutes]], and at least one was in a [[nun]] [[costume]]. They explained their goal was to show that in either of those outfits, they must be equally respected. There was also a runway with different types of shoe wear, including high heels, sandals, boots and sport shoes, with colorful signs about their pretended owners: "one who kisses whoever she wants", "one who works". They were beneath a bigger sign stating: "Putas somos todas, o ninguna (Either all of us or none of us is a slut)." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernández Alcántara|first=Martín|title=Efectúan una réplica de La marcha de las putas en Puebla|url=http://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/2011/06/27/puebla/jus208.php|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=La Jornada de Oriente|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, 2011, Marcha de las Putas was held in [[Uruapan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Marcha de las Putas llega a Uruapan|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-635986|website=CNN iReport|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2012, a new Marcha de las Putas was held at Puebla. Natali Hernández participated with her [[non-profit organization]], Red por los Derechos Sexuales y Reproductivos (Network for [[Reproductive Rights|Sexual and Reproductive Rights]]), which denounced in the [[Puebla|State of Puebla]] there's an accusation of sexual violence against a woman every 12 hours, making that state the fifth in sexual violence occurrence, in a country where the average of denounces is one every 17 hours. The protest finished in front of Puebla's City Hall, where the protesters pronounciated against sexual violence. They stressed that in the previous six years, [[femicide|murders of women]] raised up to three times. Figures show 341 femicides in 2005 against 619 in 2011, marking an 81% increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Espinoza|first=Maribel|title=Celebran la Marcha de las Putas|url=http://www.ultra.com.mx/noticias/puebla/Local/58552-celebran-la-marcha-de-las-putas.html|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=Ultra Noticias|date=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2012, a new Marcha de las Putas was organized in [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]] to match the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]]. Martha Figuero Mier participated in the protest with her  [[NGO]] Colectivo de Mujeres (Colem), and as an activist is representing several cases of [[women's rights]] violations in [[Chiapas]] at the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]]. Previous to the march, her organization had denounced 67 [[femicide]]s of [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous women]] during 2012. She explained the number was based only in the cases covered by the media, since the Attorney General's Office of Chiapas did not respond to their requests for information about number and status of the processes of femicides.

"When a woman is [[assault]]ed or [[murder]]ed, the authorities qualify it as a [[crime of passion]], disregarding the [[Patriarchy|larger social structure]] which minimizes and violates the rights of women. We demand [[public policies]] to eliminate all forms of violence against women" added the participants of the protest. Alejandra Peralta, head of the Secretaría para el Desarrollo y Empoderamiento de las Mujeres (Secretary for the Development and Empowerment of Women) at the State Government, also participated in La Marcha de las Putas. She admitted there are high records of violence against women, but the numbers and statistics on femicides and accusations for assault must be administered by the Attorney General's Office.&lt;ref name=cnnmex&gt;{{cite news|last=Mariscal|first=Angeles|title=Mujeres marchan en Chiapas contra el aumento de los feminicidios|url=http://blogs.cnnmexico.com/ultimas-noticias/2012/11/26/mujeres-marchan-en-chiapas-contra-el-aumento-de-los-feminicidios/|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=CNN Mexico|date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicaragua==

On June 11, 2011, the first Slutwalk was held in [[Matagalpa]] under the name "Marcha de las Putas", with the objective of bringing an end to the naturalization of [[violence against women]] and [[Victim blaming|blaming of victims]] based on their appearance. According to the Network of Women Against Violence, 89 women in Nicaragua were murdered by their partner or another individual known to them on 2012. Edume Larracochea, Spanish leader of Red de Mujeres de Matagalpa (Matagalpa Women Network) and organizer of the event, said dozens of women assisted, wearing jeans or skirts, high heels or flats, as they chose. "The march was a great success, we feel people were interested and we want everyone to reflect on [[sexual violence]]" she added.

At the end of the protest, Red de Mujeres de Matagalpa read a document denouncing society for "using the word "puta" to [[stigmatize]] and [[discredit]] those women who are courageous enough to decide over our bodies and our lives." It also states the protersters "are tired of hearing us women provoke, and therefore are guilty" of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mujeres exigen respeto en 'Marcha de las putas' en Nicaragua|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/internacional/2011/299163/6/mujeres-exigen-respeto-en-marcha-de-las-putas-en-nicaragua.htm|accessdate=December 2, 2013|newspaper=Informador|date=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nicaragua&gt;{{cite news|title=Women's groups will hold a SlutWalk protest in Nicaragua|url=http://latinamericacurrentevents.com/women%E2%80%99s-groups-hold-slutwalk-protest-nicaragua/8160/|accessdate=December 2, 2013|newspaper=Latin America Current Events &amp; News|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 500 men and women who joined the protest on a rainy day, there were a few [[prostitutes]] who, despite [[Prostitution in Panama|prostitution being legal in Panamá]], expressed their complaints regarding their situation.&lt;ref name=panama&gt;{{cite news|title=Panama's Slut Walk|url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_17/issue_11/news_03.html|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=The Panama News|date=October 26, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508164953/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_17/issue_11/news_03.html|archivedate=May 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The march began outside the headquarters of the Attorney General's Office. The participants said they were demanding respect and an end to [[domestic violence]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Marcha de las putas" held to protest domestic violence|url=http://www.prensa.com/uhora/en-la-marcha-de-las-putas-exigen-alto-la-violencia-en-panama/35092?en|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=La Prensa|date=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[:es:Tu cara me suena (Panamá)#Concursantes|Janelle Davidson]] explained she supported the cause, even though she was not able to attend the protest. She narrated a visit to her doctor at the age of 17 wearing [[jeans]] and a [[Low-cut dress|low-cut]] [[blouse]], in which she got told: "Look at yourself! Then you'll complain when you get [[raped]]". "It doesn't matter whether you dress sexy or not, respect is fundamental" she added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peñalba|first=Shanyda|title=Ni putas ni santas, somos mujeres|url=http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/notas/1109578-%E2%80%9Cni-putas-ni-santas,-somos-mujeres%E2%80%9D|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=Panamá América|date=October 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212223034/http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/notas/1109578-%E2%80%9Cni-putas-ni-santas,-somos-mujeres%E2%80%9D|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombian journalist Carolina Ángel Idrobo was also present at the protest to cover the story for Panamanian newspaper [[La Prensa (Panama City)|La Prensa]]. On the day following the march, she was given a verbal warning from her [[editor]] for being seen dancing and singing among the protesters, arguing [[activism]] was incompatible with [[journalism]] at La Prensa. Idrobo apologized to the editor, but on November 2 she was called by the director, who informed her she was fired. The FELCOPER (''Federación Colombiana de Periodistas'' - Colombian Federation of Journalists) pronounced in favor of Idrobo, expressing their worry around [[censorship]] and [[discrimination]] inside [[independent media]], as well as unfair layoffs based on [[ideology]]. "[[Freedom of speech]] cannot be a right to be claimed only from the media to society, it must also be guaranteed by the media to its workers" explained Adriana Hurtado, president of FELCOPER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Despedida periodista colombiana en Panamá tras participar en "Marcha de las Putas"|url=http://www.cartagonoticias.com/noticias.php/2011112501/inicio/nacional/despedida-periodista-colombiana-en-panama-tras-participar-en-marcha-de-las-putas/|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=Cartago Noticias|date=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perú==

On November 12, 2011, a Slutwalk was held in [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] with the name "La Marcha de las Putas". Over 100 women in short skirts and [[lingerie]] joined the protest and handed panflets to bystanders. "People are surprised to see women dressed like this, it always catches the eye" explained Fiorella Farje, one of the organizers and member of P.U.T.A.S., ''Por Una Transformación Auténtica y Social'' (For An Authentic Social Transformation). "We were a bit scared for the name of the protest, that we might have problems or the message could be distorted, but the reaction was very positive" she added.&lt;ref name=peru&gt;{{cite news|title=La marcha de las putas recorrió las calles de Lima|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2011-11-12-la-marcha-de-las-putas-recorrio-las-calles-de-lima-foto_421761_5.html|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=RPP Noticias|date=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2012, a new Marcha de las Putas took place in Lima, gathering around 150 people. Ana Lucía Álvarez, spokeswoman of the organization, explained to the local media it was not a march of [[prostitutes]], but rather one of young people against [[violence towards women]] and [[street harassment]]. "We also recognize prostitutes have dignity, deserve respect from all society and we reject the mistreatment they suffer from the police."&lt;ref name=terra&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcha contra violencia machista en Perú se solidariza con prostitutas|url=http://noticias.terra.com.pe/nacional/marcha-contra-violencia-machista-en-peru-se-solidariza-con-prostitutas,4949b32de7aea310VgnCLD2000000ec6eb0aRCRD.html|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=Terra|date=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uruguay==

On December 9, 2012, the first Slutwalk was held with the name "La Marcha de las Putas", inviting men, women, [[transgender people]] and children alike. "Each one of us participates with as much or as little clothing as they wish" explained the organizers, "Our demand is that society stops [[Tolerate|tolerating]] and minimizing [[sexual abuse]]s, and instead of [[blaming the victim]], have the perpetrator severely judged."

The protest was also directed to a comment made by [[José Mujica|President José Mujica]] to those who were asking for the resignation of Fernando Calloia, head of the [[Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay|Banco de la República]]. Mujica answered publicly in [[Brasilia]] saying "they had better control their wives." During their speech at the protest, the organizers answered: "We don't want to be controlled, men believe they are owners of any woman. [[Patriarchy]] tells them they are [[Incontinence (philosophy)|incontinent]] and therefore can't stop themselves nor respect us. But we look for partners, not owners."

[[Sociologist]] Teresa Herrera also addressed the remark: "Mr. President, the ideology of men exercising power over women is the eldest in the world, even previous to the [[Social classes|richness-poverty]] relation, and its [[Sexism|ideological justification]] is, unfortunately, supported in all cultures. Because of this, we have deep-rooted behaviors we must "unlearn" and new ways of relating and knowing each other we must apprehend. Us women don't need to be controlled, in fact, control is the first step of violence against us."&lt;ref name=Alerta&gt;{{cite news|title=Alerta que camina la marcha de las putas por América Latina|url=http://www.republica.com.uy/alerta-que-camina-la-marcha-de-las-putas-por-america-latina/|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=República|date=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social constructionism]], a branch of [[sociology]], queries commonly held views on the nature of reality, touching on themes of normality and abnormality within the context of power and oppression in societal structures.
The concept of a '''social construction of schizophrenia''', within a social construction of health and illness notary form, denotes that the label of 'schizophrenia' is one that has been socially constructed through ideological systems, none of which are truly [[empirical]] especially as currently there is no definitive evidence as to the cause(s) of [[schizophrenia]].

==Introduction==
In 1966, Berger and Luckman coined the term ''social constructionism'' in their work ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''. In summary it examines the basis of fact and truth / knowledge within culture. Whilst some 'truths' such as 'fire is hot' are universally agreed as objective, many others considered 'fact' are the result of a common subjective experience and the subsequent validation of that.

Walker has argued that psychiatric diagnoses are nothing but linguistic abstractions. He has criticized the [[DSM-IV]]'s poor reliability and postulated that terms like 'schizophrenia' and 'mental illness' only exist by consensus and persist by convention. Further he argues that the pathologizing language which persists in the [[medical model of disability]] is unuseful in working towards a recovery model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Walker MT |year=2006 |title=The Social Construction of Mental Illness and its Implications for the Recovery Model |journal=International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=71–87 |url=http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_10/Social_Construction_of_MI_and_Implications_for_Recovery_Walker.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable practitioners and authors within the humanistic tradition that have viewed schizophrenia as a social construction include psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] (1920–2012), [[Joseph Berke]], [[R.D. Laing]], [[Erich Fromm]] and [[Mary Barnes]]. Szasz viewed the diagnoses as a fabrication that is borderline abusive in terms of treatment. Szasz has protested against the taxonomic classifications of mental illness and [[reification (fallacy)|reification]] of these as 'science' and has long argued against institutionalisation as a fundamental deprivation of liberty. In Berke's and Barnes's book ''two accounts of a journey through madness'', Berke explores themes of psychosis as an enriching experience. Berke argues that the invalidation of schizophrenic experiences labelled 'sick or mad' is a uniquely western standpoint insofar as dream states and altered perception are not considered valid modes of interpolation of the truth within westernised culture.&lt;ref name="BarnesBerke2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Barnes|author2=Joseph H. Berke|title=Mary Barnes: two accounts of a journey through madness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0BnPPdBKG4C|accessdate=23 October 2010|date=17 March 2002|publisher=Other Press, LLC|isbn=978-1-59051-016-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laing (1964) commented “the mad things done and said by the schizophrenic will remain essentially a closed book if one does not understand their existential context”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Roberts GA |year=2000 |title=Narrative and severe mental illness:what place do stories have in an evidence-based world? |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=6 |pages=432–441 |url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/6/6/432 |doi=10.1192/apt.6.6.432 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noll (1983) has explored the links between [[shamanism]] and schizophrenia, testing the research evidence on shamanism against the [[DSM-III]] diagnostic criterion. Though he draws comparisons between the two states of mind in terms of the phenomenon experienced, he draws out important differences between shamanic and schizophrenic states, notably that many people on the schizophrenic spectrum do not voluntarily enter an altered state of consciousness whereas research into shamanism unilaterally shows that shamanic states are induced and controlled voluntarily by the shaman, who ultimately maintains a healthy world view between a base line level of consciousness and an altered state of consciousness. He concludes that differences between schizophrenic and shamanic states such as 'volition', mean that the DSM-III cannot be used to define shamanism as the same state as schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Noll, Richard |year=1983 |title=Shamanism and Schizophrenia.A State-Specific approach to the 'Schizophrenia Metaphor of shamanic states' |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=443–459 |doi=10.1525/ae.1983.10.3.02a00030 |jstor=644263}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Sapolsky]] has theorized that shamanism is practiced by [[schizotypal]] individuals rather than schizophrenics.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Robert Sapolsky's lecture about Biological Underpinnings of Religiosity" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwAQqWUkpI]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Philosophy===
Themes in social constructionism draw on various philosophies centred around the differences between objective reality or that which is known or absolute and subjective reality or that which is observed by the knower . In ''Schizophrenia: A scientific delusion'', Mary Boyle explores 'schizophrenia and its assumptions as truths or knowledges which are socially produced and managed'.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, M., 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5iRH0v093OgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=schizophrenia+a+scientific+delusion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tsadFgfZij&amp;sig=soBofdIPnjVWsQevC8Cb-A8juvA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5Vz-S9XMH6qg4QbJ-KiHDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Schizophrenia:A Scientific Delusion"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
Michael Walker examines the social construction of mental illness and its implications for the recovery model. He is critical of the user becoming defined by the definer, such as if you go for behavioural therapy you come out with a perspective of rewards and punishments etc.:

"Psychology, like psychiatry, has found ways of linguistically contorting, convoluting, and confusing lived experience with essential “truths” of its own. Bill O'Hanlon, a preeminent postmodern consultant and author, uses his holiday cookie making experience to
communicate what happens in the therapy room (O'Hanlon and Wiener-Davis, 1989). A client's problem that s/he brings to therapy is like cookie dough. The experience of it is vague and malleable. Once the "blob" of cookie dough is forced through the cookie press (a tube, funnel, and mold pressed against a baking pan) it becomes a Christmas tree, star, or Santa Claus. Similarly, when a client exposes his or her problem to a therapist it gets "molded" or interpreted in the language of the therapist. So a client attending a psychodynamic therapy session would leave having unresolved childhood conflicts. The same client leaving a behaviorist's office would walk away with problem behavior shaped by reward and punishment. An interaction with a Jungian therapist would result in the need to deal with the various archetypes that apply to him or her. Talking with a diagnostically (and thereby pathologically) minded clinician will leave one with the idea that they “have” “bipolar disorder”, “depression”, “obsessive compulsive disorder”, a “mental illness” – along with all the stories that go with them (“chemical imbalances”, lifelong duration, the need to “comply” with a treatment regimen, etc.). Like cookies, continued exposure to the "heat" of the theoretical lens causes these interpretations to "harden" or "reify" (to make real)." O'Hanlon concludes that if our languaging creates “the problem” then why not leverage the use of language and create a problem that is easiest to solve.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walker, Michael |year=2006 |title=The social construction of mental illness and it's implications for the recovery model |journal=Internanational journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=71–87 |url=http://www.recoverydevon.co.uk/download/The_Social_Construction_of_Mental_Illness.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213044735/http://www.recoverydevon.co.uk/download/The_Social_Construction_of_Mental_Illness.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is critical of a deficit based vocabulary:

"From the perspective of linguistics we see that the reified categories (e.g. mental illness, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) are abstractions defined by clusters of what we call “symptoms.” Schizophrenia is defined as the presence of audio hallucinations (or other “thought disorders”) in the absence of a “mood disorder.” You can even throw in other correlates like “negative symptoms”, PET scans, response to medications, etc. The issue of the DSM's poor reliability and validity aside (Caplan, 1995; Sparks, Duncan, &amp; Miller, 2005), the term “schizophrenia” is a word used to communicate the presence of these “symptoms.” The various human manifestations of thought, feeling, and behavior (aka “symptoms”) exist like the chair you are sitting on as you read this exists. But the next level of abstraction, the word “schizophrenia”, and the next, “mental illness”, only exist through consensus and only persist by convention. Even if the correlations of defining symptoms was perfect (which it is far from), in light of the linguistic paradigm we have to ask ourselves whether using a pathologizing, deficit-based vocabulary is useful in helping people improve the quality of their lives."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Power and control===

Post Structuralist [[Jürgen Habermas]] examines questions of identity in the concept of societal integration and discusses how change occurs when there is a legitimation crisis. 
It assists the understanding of the social construction of schizophrenia and other illness in also understanding forces that shape power imbalances in aetiologies. Phil Brown in ''Naming and Framing : The social construction of diagnosis and illness'' points out how professionals were very slow and unwilling to accept the diagnosis of '[[Tardive dyskinesia]]', despite many research indicated warnings on it, as it was iatrogenic  (caused by) prescription drugs that had been plaudited to be successful in treatment of the associated condition of psychoses. Market forces in pharmacology and/or cultural embarrassment can shape the rate at which society adapts to include new frameworks such as those demonstrated in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown, Phil |year=1995 |title=Naming and Framing : The Social construction of Diagnosis and Illness |journal=Journal of health and social behaviour |volume=35 |issue=extra issue |pages=34–52 |url=http://instituty.fsv.cuni.cz/~kabele/archiv/Mirek/SC_illness.pdf |doi=10.2307/2626956 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718170606/http://instituty.fsv.cuni.cz/~kabele/archiv/Mirek/SC_illness.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conrad writes on medicalization and social control. He looks at the process of science and medicalization . Science is heralded as the new religion in terms of ideological power and Conrad describes how medicalization can be used to police morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conrad, Peter |year=1992 |title=Medicalization and social control |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=18|pages=209–232 |url=http://people.uncw.edu/ricej/deviance/Medicalization%20of%20Deviance,%20by%20Conrad%20and%20Schneider.pdf |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.18.1.209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The social construction of illness, key insights and policy implications", Conrad and Barker trace the history of the construction of illness from symbolic interactionists and medical sociologists and examine how society reacts in situations to the distinctions such as the construction of gender from sex and the construction of illness from disease :

"Framing anger in women as evidence of the disease PMS, to be treated with antidepressants, trivializes the impact of gender inequality on women’s daily lives. And when difficulties in children’s attention and behavior get defined as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), school policies increasingly encourage the use of medication and special accommodations for learning disabled students; yet these responses fail to address the social and nonmedical causes of children’s classroom inattention or agitation, such as increasing class size or the termination of physical education programs (Conrad 1975).
In each case, and many others, the process by which human problems become medicalized in the first place is largely ignored in creating policy toward these issues. A social constructionist approach provides a means of understanding how such problems come to be defined in medical terms and how this translates into public policy (see Gusfield 1981). As the above examples attest, medicalized constructions can also be strongly evaluative (i.e., they suggest how people ought to behave) and result in policies that authorize social control." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conrad, P. |author2=Kristen, K.. |year=2010 |title=The social construction of illness, key insights and policy implications |journal=Journal of health and social behaviour |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=S67-S69 |url=http://hsb.sagepub.com/content/51/1_suppl/S67.full.pdf+html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031100543/http://hsb.sagepub.com/content/51/1_suppl/S67.full.pdf+html |archivedate=31 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They conclude that in an information age . new social groupings emerging may challenge the social constructions of illness and force policy changes.

Foucault examines power systems that incur on the operation of institutions and professionals:

“The first task of the doctor is ... political: the struggle against disease must begin with a war against bad government." Man will be totally and definitively cured only if he is first liberated...” &lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M., 1973, The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception, Tavistock publications limited, available at http://monoskop.org/images/9/92/Foucault_Michel_The_Birth_of_the_Clinic_1976.pdf [accessed 14 November 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK parliament in a key issues statement for 2015 references a 1957 statement by the royal commission but queries its impact some 60 years later:

“Most people are coming to regard mental illness and disability in much the same way as physical illness and disability”
(Report of the Royal Commission on the law relating to mental illness and mental deficiency, 1957)

"Anti-stigma campaigns and the growing profile of mental health issues in recent years appear to have gone some way to changing views and dispelling misconceptions about mental illness. But with nine in ten people with mental health problems still experiencing stigma and discrimination, nearly sixty years after the Royal Commission’s optimistic assessment, there may still be some way to go in changing public attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=UK Parliament |year=2015 |title=Tackling social stigma on mental health: Key issues for the 2015 Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-parliament-2015/social-change/mental-health-stigma/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain oppressions in the UK were removed by the [[Mental Health (Discrimination) Act 2013]]

===The self and identity===
Research directions here are on the importance of experiential narrative within psychiatric dialogue. Some research is critical of modern psychiatric adoption of an 'empiricist-behavioural approach' within the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]. Nelson, Yung, Bechdolf and McGorry examine this in context of a phenomonological approach to the understanding of ultra high risk psychiatric disorders. They criticize psychiatric research that addresses subjectivity:

"When attempts have been made to address subjectivity, the psychiatric researcher is left without the requisite conceptual tools. Instead, this form of research has tended to live out Abraham Maslow’s statement ‘‘If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to treat everything as if it were a nail.’’ That is, the subjective has been approached in operational terms..."
&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Yung, Bechdolf, McGorry.,2008, [http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/34/2/381.pdf "The Phenomenological Critique and Self-disturbance: Implications for Ultra-High Risk ‘Prodrome’ Research"], Schizophrenia Bulletin ,34(2) pp381-392&lt;/ref&gt;

'Mad Studies' is an emerging field of study wherein the user movement seeks to reclaim words such as mad and loony and redefine how psychiatry envisages the concept of madness, refuting where user experiences have been co-opted into psychiatric definitions . Mad Studies provides a construct whereby people with 'negative' mental health seek to be identified as part of the neuro-diversity of the human race. 
“We write at a time when activist concepts such as recovery, inclusion, access and hope have been co-opted, appropriated and politically neutralised by policy-makers, service-providers and government (Costa 2009; McWade 2014; Morgan 2013). User-led services and organisations continue to be most severely affected by spending cuts (Morris 2011), whilst anti-stigma campaigns endorsed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists continue to be pumped with millions of pounds to sell a sanitised version of ‘mental health’ to the masses (Armstrong 2014). Personalisation has been implemented through a free market ideology that has seen the dispossession and even some deaths of disabled people. It is ‘time to talk’, and not in the way the establishment wants us to, with individualised and neatly packaged tales of recovery. Instead, let us build upon the rich histories of activism and bring our shared experiences of oppression and marginalisation together” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mcwade |author2=Milton |author3=Beresford |year=2015 |title=Mad studies and neurodiversity: a dialogue |journal=Disability &amp; Society|volume=30 | issue = 2 |pages=71–87 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2014.1000512 |doi=10.1080/09687599.2014.1000512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple way of looking at it is a slogan adopted by self-advocates 'nothing about us, without us', encouraging educators to co-teach with people who have lived experience of mental illness or distress.
A key concept in this ontolology is the idea of san[e]ism – a sixth structural oppression to go alongside those associated with race, gender, disability, age and class. It is also defined as [[Mentalism (discrimination)]] :
“From where we stand, san[e]ism is a devestating [sic?] form of oppression, often leading to negative stereotyping, discrimination, or arguments that Mad individuals are not fit for professional practice or, indeed, for life (Poole et al., 2012). According to Kalinowski and Risser (2005), sane[e]ism also allows for a binary that separates people into a power-up group and a power-down group. The power-up group is assumed to be normal, healthy and capable. The power-down group is assumed to be sick, disabled, unreliable, and, possibly violent. This factional splitting ensures a lower standard of service for the power-down group and allows the power-up group to judge, reframe and belittle the power-down group in pathological terms”.&lt;ref&gt;LeFrançois, B., Menzies, R. 2013, "Mad Matters: A Critical Reader in Canadian Mad Studies, “Breaking open the bone", pp 96-97, Canadian Scholars press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement to reconstruct schizophrenia==
{{Main|Hearing Voices Movement}}

''Alternative Perception'' is one of several names suggested by the [[schizophrenic]] user movement to replace the term [[schizophrenia]] which is on a [[spectrum]] of psychotic disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ahmed, Iqbal |author2=Fujii, Daryl |title=The spectrum of psychotic disorders: neurobiology, etiology, and pathogenesis |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-521-85056-8}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered to be outmoded by many consumers of services. Several academic authorities, notably Professor [[Marius Romme]] founder and principal theorist for the Hearing Voices Movement provide a rationale for the abandonment of this label. A symposium of some of the leading notions in this field from consumers of services and academics concluded:{{Quote|We are calling for the label of schizophrenia to be abolished as a concept because it is unscientific, stigmatising, and does not address the root causes of serious mental distress. The CASL campaign is driven by two central factors. The concept of schizophrenia is unscientific and has outlived any usefulness it may once have claimed. The label schizophrenia is extremely damaging to those to whom it is applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caslcampaign.com/|title=caslcampaign.com|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical construction of schizophrenia==
{{Further|History of schizophrenia}}

The terms ''[[schizophrenia]]'' and ''[[autism]]'' originated from the works of [[Eugen Bleuler]] (1857–1939) as different aspects of the same diagnostic condition. Bleuler was a contemporary of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]]. Prior to Bleuler's interventions schizophrenia was referred to as [[dementia praecox]] (early insanity) and perceived as a single disorder. Schizophrenia is sometimes also referred to as [[hebephrenia]], stemming in etymology from the Greek god [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] who was associated with adolescence and as it was thought the onset of schizophrenia came at adolescence. It is generally acknowledged that schizophrenia can have early onset and late onset.

"He first advanced the term schizophrenia in 1908 in a paper based on a study of 647 Burghölzli patients. He then expanded on his paper of 1908 in Dementia Praecox oder Gruppe der Schizophrenie…Bleuler is credited with the introduction of two concepts fundamental to the analysis of schizophrenia: autism, denoting the loss of contact with reality, frequently through indulgence in bizarre fantasy; and ambivalence, denoting the coexistence of mutually exclusive contradictions within the psyche." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69329/Eugen-Bleuler|title=Eugen Bleuler - Swiss psychiatrist|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schizophrenia in America is a medical diagnostic category, which in the 1970s was primarily termed differentiated and undifferentiated schizophrenia; international leaders such as R.D. Laing in Europe offered professional expertise in serving this population group. In the context of community mental health services, the broad term mental health also referred to individuals who may have this diagnosis, which may or may not be considered to be valid or relevant. The word schizophrenia is often associated with a "major mental breakdown" in common parlance which may result in the need for psychotherapy, mental health counseling, person-centered therapy,&lt;ref&gt;Moon, K.A., Witty, M., Grant, B., &amp; Rice, B.

==Charities committed to changing public perception==
Charities that disagree with the notion of the schizophrenia label in the U.K. include [[Mind (charity)]] and [[Rethink Mental Illness|Rethink]]. Mind state on their website "Because of differences of opinion about schizophrenia, it's not easy to identify what might cause it." Mind have previously published an explanatory leaflet, prefaced by [[Michael Palin]] that gives a definition of schizophrenia as people 'who think outside the normal range of human experience'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind.org.uk/help/diagnoses_and_conditions/schizophrenia/|title=Schizophrenia - Mind, the mental health charity - help for mental health problems|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Alliance on Mental Illness says:

"By changing the name, consumers with the symptoms of what actually may be a [[spectrum]] of disorders would have a more accurate and descriptive name attached to their diagnosis. Ideally, they would also experience less stigma, as they left behind a name with Greek origins that roughly translates to “shattered mind” and which is often used in popular culture to mean "multiple personality disorder" or "split personality.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=Schizophrenia&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=40298|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061117071330/http://www.nami.org/TextTemplate.cfm?Section%3DSchizophrenia%26template%3D/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm%26ContentID%3D40298|dead-url=yes|title=NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness - NAMI: The National Alliance on Mental Illness|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science of schizophrenia and comorbid conditions==
{{Main|Causes of schizophrenia}}
Whilst the definitive cause(s) of schizophrenia remain unknown, research has indicated strong links between genetic make-up, social predisposing factors or stressors and environmental conditions in relation to the development and onset of schizophrenia and other conditions. International geneticists are working towards identifying a gene for Schizophrenia, combined efforts are at the [[SzGene]] database. In the course of this research geneticists have identified specific [[genes]] or [[copy number variants]] or [[alleles]] that may explain the [[comorbidity]] of various conditions.

===Genetic links between comorbid conditions===
[[File:Chromosome 16.svg|thumb|alt=Chromosome 16 |Ideogram of human chromosome 16]]
Links between [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]] have been studied. From clinical observation, both conditions cause a disruption in normative social functioning which may be mild or severe depending on the individual's position within the spectrum. Social cognition is under-developed in autism and highly developed in psychoses. Four genetic loci are diametrically opposed in terms of diagnoses of autism and schizophrenia, with corresponding deletions for one condition or duplications for the other. Researchers examining [[chromosome 16]] (16p11.2) identified a heredity area on the short arm of human chromosome 16 (16p11.2) which contains microduplication and microdeletion of genome variation. Microduplication of hereditary factors in this heredity area increased the individual's risk of schizophrenia more than 8–14-fold and of autism over 20-fold. A corresponding microdeletion instead of microduplication in the area affected the risk of autism only, but not of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Crespi | first1 = B. | last2 = Badcock | first2 = C. | title = Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–261; discussion 261–320 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X08004214 | pmid=18578904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news178822577.html "Research backs theory on autism, schizophrenia": accessed 9 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=McCarthy SE, Makarov V, Kirov G, etal |title=Microduplications of 16p11.2 are associated with schizophrenia |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=41 |issue=11 |pages=1223–7 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19855392|pmc=2951180 |doi=10.1038/ng.474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kumar RA, KaraMohamed S, Sudi J, etal |title=Recurrent 16p11.2 microdeletions in autism |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=628–38 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18156158 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm376}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of ''de novo'' mutations, ''ie'' new mutations in people with both autism and schizophrenia spectrum conditions, concluded that schizophrenia and autism are due to "errors" during early [[organogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Awadalla | first1 = P. | last2 = Gauthier | first2 = J. | last3 = Myers | first3 = R.

The National Institute of Mental Health reported on 8 December 2009 that in spring 2010, major databases on autism research would be joined up to facilitate further research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2009/major-databases-link-up-to-advance-autism-research.shtml Major Databases Link Up to Advance Autism Research. Accessed 12 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic allelles===
Other genetic analysis examines the role of alleles. One study ascribes links between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by studying a total group of 6909 Europeans, both diagnosed and undiagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Purcell SM, Wray NR, Stone JL |title=Common polygenic variation contributes to risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder |journal=Nature |volume=460 |issue=7256 |pages=748–52 |year=2009 |pmid=19571811 |doi=10.1038/nature08185|display-authors=etal|pmc=3912837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study suggests that Genetic markers may be very dissimilar among different lineages of DNA in people of different cultures, making an international commonality in genetics as a precipitating factor in schizophrenia difficult to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McClellan JM, Susser E, King MC |title=Schizophrenia: a common disease caused by multiple rare alleles |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=190 |issue= |pages=194–9 |date=2007 |pmid=17329737 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.025585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

===Social factors===
A study published in ''The Guardian'', reported on 9 December 2009, ascribes the onset of the condition to social factors. The authors of the study, which compared 500 patients with mental health problems with other ethnic groups and a control group of 350 people, claim there is an epidemic of schizophrenia amongst the Afro-Caribbean community . They refute the argument that racism may contribute to more diagnoses from psychiatrists of schizophrenia amongst members of the Afro Caribbean community and ascribe more value to deprivation and social isolation as triggering factors in those with a propensity towards schizotype personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/dec/09/african-caribbean-schizophrenia-policy|title=Schizophrenia 'epidemic' among African Caribbeans spurs prevention policy change|first=Matthew|last=Lewin|date=8 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical and environmental factors===

Various studies have indicated chemical precipitating factors in the development of autism or schizophrenia and also suggested that environmental factors such as toxins in the air may have precipitated a rise in the number of children born with autism. Ploeger discovered that pre-natal prescribed softenon in the 1960s and '70s led to an increase of children born with autism by 4% as opposed to a usual figure of 0.1%. Sodium valproate, a drug used as an anti-epileptic and as a mood stabilizer, increased the chance of children being born with autism sevenfold. The active component of cannabis (THC) is thought by some to increase the chances of onset of schizophrenia by 2.6 times in its skunk preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-12/aaon-edm112508.php|title=Epilepsy drug may increase risk of autism in children|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-12/nofs-aas121708.php|title=Autism and schizophrenia share common origin|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-01/uoc--ssc010709.php|title=Study shows California's autism increase not due to better counting, diagnosis|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/dec/01/skunk-users-psychosis-risk-research|title=Skunk users face greater risk of psychosis, researchers warn|first1=Sarah|last1=Boseley|first2=health|last2=editor|date=30 November 2009|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/03/david-nutt-drugs-policy|title=David Nutt: my views on drugs classification|first=David|last=Nutt|date=2 November 2009|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time{{When|date=September 2016}} there is no publicly available research on commonalities between these chemicals that may trigger the on/off switches in neuro-receptors linked to genes responsible for conditions on the autistic or schizophrenic spectrum.

===Criticism of genetics===

Critique in terms of current genetic research is that there are many candidates for [[copy number variants]] that may predispose a likelihood of developing schizophrenia but current research is flawed by both the sample sizes available for analysis by condition population and by an incomplete understanding of 'double whammies' where one [[allele]] affects another.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1575 "CNV 'Double Whammies' May Account for Variable Neuropsychiatric Phenotypes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129221028/http://schizophreniaforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1575 |date=29 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been referred to as genetic 'dark matter' with the notion that many rare mutations have not yet been discovered.

===Evolution===

Links between [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]] have been studied (as above). The implications are both conditions are part of the same spectrum. From clinical observation, both conditions cause a disruption in normative social functioning which may be mild or severe depending on the individual's position within the spectrum. Simon Fraser University researcher Crespi has examined how social cognition is under developed in autism and highly developed in Psychoses and outlines how the relationship between autism and schizophrenic spectrum is not one that has been explored in detail in the latter part of the 20th century. His research hypothesises that the genetic marker for both conditions may lie in the same location. His team have identified four loci that are diametrically opposed in terms of diagnoses of autism and schizophrenia with corresponding deletions for one condition or duplications for the other:
{{Quote|text="Crespi says the work supports the hypothesis that risks of autism and schizophrenia “have evolved in conjunction with the evolution and elaboration of the human social brain.”"|sign=|source=}}

Professor Timothy Crow, from the University Department of Psychiatry at Oxford University, has long argued that schizophrenia as a condition came about as a result of [[natural selection]]. He has argued that schizophrenia is a by-product of the development of language, resulting from an evolutionary change approximately 150,000 years ago, that persisted due to sexual selection. However, conversely to study in [[polygene]]s or multiple allele combinations, he maintains that the answer lies in:
{{Quote|text="the evolutionary history of the Protocadherin11XY gene pair that characterizes the hominin lineage including the 'sapiens' event that represents the transition to modern Homo sapiens."|sign=|source=}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/researchintelligence/issue14/language.html Clues to the origin of language?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925151039/http://www.liv.ac.uk/researchintelligence/issue14/language.html |date=25 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120225162511/http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/pap/readmore.asp?commentID%3D%7BA01C1B66%2D4388%2D4904%2D82E6%2D7DA9B552814A%7D Schizophrenia Research Forum Comment on Published Paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The use of the RH semantic system may constitute a selective evolutionary advantage allowing the genes predisposing to schizophrenia to proliferate despite the obvious disadvantages of this devastating disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.lww.com/cogbehavneurol/abstract/1998/10000/creative,_paranormal,_and_delusional_thought__a.1.aspx|title=Creative, Paranormal, and Delusional Thought: A Consequence... : Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Immunology and schizophrenia===
A strand of research into schizophrenia is to investigate the links between viruses that attack the immune system such as herpes and the onset of schizophrenia. Researchers in this field are hopeful that this connection may provide a cure for schizophrenia within the next 20 years.
{{Quote|text="On the basis of the findings, perspectives for future research are outlined aiming at a precise and consequent strategy to elucidate a potential involvement of immune mechanisms in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia."|sign=|source=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rothermund, M. |author2=Volker, A. |author3=Bayer, T. | title=Review of Immunological and Immunopathological Findings in Schizophrenia|journal=Brain, Behaviour and immunity |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=319–339 |year=2001 |pmid= |doi=10.1006/brbi.2001.0648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller proposes that the vulnerability-stress model of analysis of schizophrenia should become the vulnerability-stress-inflammation model:
{{Quote|text="The vulnerability-stress-inflammation model is important as stress may increase proinflammatory cytokines and even contribute to a lasting proinflammatory state. The immune system itself is considered an important further piece in the puzzle, as in autoimmune disorders in general, which are always linked to three factors: genes, the environment and the immune system. Alterations of dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission have been shown with low-level neuroinflammation and may directly be involved in the generation of schizophrenic symptoms"|sign=|source=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Muller, N.|title=Immunology of Schizophrenia|journal=Neuroimmunomodulation|volume=21 |pages=109–116 |date=2014|doi=10.1159/000356538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that viral infections of the immune system can dramatically increase the frequency of the onset of schizophrenia.

“ a large scale Danish nationwide study on 39,076 persons with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders showed that the history of hospitalisation with infection increased the risk of schizophrenia by 60%” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norbert Muller |author2=Aye-Mu Myint |author3=Markus J. Schwarz |title=immunology and psychiatry : from basic research to therapeutic interventions|journal=current topics in Neurotoxicity |volume=8 |issue= |pages=194–9 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global moves to change the construction of 'schizophrenia' ==

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands alternative proposals for the name ''schizophrenia'' include ''dysfunctional perception syndrome'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://astridvanwoerkom.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/schizophrenia-now-called-dysfunctional-perception-syndrome/|title=Schizophrenia Now Called "Dysfunctional Perception Syndrome"|author=|date=9 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Salience Syndrome :

"The concept of 'salience' has the potential to make the public recognize psychosis as relating to an aspect of human mentation and experience that is universal. It is proposed to introduce, analogous to the functional-descriptive term 'Metabolic syndrome', the diagnosis of 'Salience syndrome' to replace all current diagnostic categories of psychotic disorders. Within Salience syndrome, three subcategories may be identified, based on scientific evidence of relatively valid and specific contrasts, named Salience syndrome with affective expression, Salience syndrome with developmental expression and Salience syndrome not otherwise specified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Os J |title='Salience syndrome' replaces 'schizophrenia' in DSM-V and ICD-11: psychiatry's evidence-based entry into the 21st century? |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=363–72 |date=2009 |pmid=19807717 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01456.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[social model of disability]] perspective, this interlinks:

{{Quote|The human mind has the ability to turn its attention to something that is salient, something that jumps out at you. We then focus on it. In some people this function is disturbed, and everything gets an enormous significance. They think, for example, that a television programme is about them, or that people who are just walking along the street are out to harm them. Research shows that this can happen to everybody under the influence of drugs, also to healthy people. The word syndrome indicates that it is about a cluster of symptoms. And not about a clearly defined illness.&lt;ref&gt;Mol., S., 2009, ‘Dysfunctional Perception Syndrome’: The new name for schizophrenia? {{cite web |url=http://www.intervoiceonline.org/assets/2010/2/5/Dysfunctional_Perception_Syndrome.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830051101/http://www.intervoiceonline.org/assets/2010/2/5/Dysfunctional_Perception_Syndrome.pdf |archivedate=30 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Japan===
In Japan "In order to contribute to reduce the stigma related to schizophrenia and to improve clinical practice in the management of the disorder, the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology changed in 2002 the old term for the disorder, ''Seishin Bunretsu Byo'' ("mind-split-disease"), into the new term of ''Togo Shitcho Sho'' ("integration disorder")…Eighty-six percent of psychiatrists in the Miyagi prefecture found the new term more suitable to inform patients of the diagnosis as well as to explain the modern concept of the disorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sato M |title=Renaming schizophrenia: a Japanese perspective |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=53–55 |year=2006|pmid=16757998 |pmc=1472254}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Japanese society of psychiatry and neurology report:
"This change is making psychoeducation much easier and is being useful to reduce misunderstandings about the illness and to decrease the stigma related to schizophrenia. The new term has been officially accepted by the Japanese medicine and media and is being adopted in the legislation in 2005."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1414727 |title=The Yokohama Declaration: an update | pages=60–61 | volume=4 |issue=1 |journal=World Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In South Korea, schizophrenia has been renamed to 'Attunement Disorder'

"a new term, “Johyeonbyung (attunement disorder)”, was coined in South Korea. This term literally refers to tuning a string instrument, and metaphorically it describes schizophrenia as a disorder caused by mistuning of the brain's neural network." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee, Y.S. |author2=et al. |title=Johyeonbyung (attunement disorder): Renaming mind splitting disorder as a way to reduce stigma of patients with schizophrenia in Korea |journal=Asian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=8 |pages=118–120 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.ajp.2014.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Socialist law''' or '''Soviet law''' denotes a general type of [[legal system]] which has been used in [[communist state|socialist and formerly socialist states]]. It is based on the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, with major modifications and additions from [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. There is controversy as to whether socialist law ever constituted a separate legal system or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=840224|pages=781–808|last1=Quigley|first1=J.|title=Socialist Law and the Civil Law Tradition|volume=37|issue=4|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|year=1989|doi=10.2307/840224}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, prior to the end of the [[Cold War]], ''socialist law'' would be ranked among the major legal systems of the world.

While civil law systems have traditionally put great pains in defining the notion of [[private property]], how it may be acquired, transferred, or lost, socialist law systems provide for most property to be owned by the [[State (polity)|state]] or by agricultural co-operatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Soviet-law|title=Soviet law|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars argue that socialist law was not a separate legal classification.&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112849|title=The Death of Socialist Law?|journal = Annual Review of Law and Social Science |volume = 3|issue = |pages = 233–253|last = Markovits |first = I.|date=December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[command economy]] approach of the communist states meant that most types of property could not be owned, the [[Soviet Union]] always had a civil code, courts that interpreted this civil code, and a civil law approach to legal reasoning (thus, both legal process and legal reasoning were largely analogous to the [[France|French]] or [[Germany|German]] civil code system). Legal systems in all socialist states preserved formal criteria of the Romano-Germanic civil law; for this reason, law theorists in post-socialist states usually consider the socialist law as a particular case of the Romano-Germanic civil law. Cases of development of [[common law]] into socialist law are unknown because of incompatibility of basic principles of these two systems (common law presumes influential rule-making role of courts while courts in socialist states play a dependent role).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Soviet-law|title=Soviet law|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet legal theory==
Soviet law displayed many special characteristics that derived from the socialist nature of the Soviet state and reflected [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the Marxist conception of the law and the state as instruments of coercion in the hands of the bourgeoisie and postulated the creation of popular, informal tribunals to administer revolutionary justice. One of the main theoreticians of Soviet socialist legality in this early phase was [[Pēteris Stučka]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Alongside this [[utopian]] trend was one more critical of the concept of "[[proletarian]] justice", represented by [[Evgeny Pashukanis]]. A dictatorial trend developed that advocated the use of law and legal institutions to suppress all opposition to the regime. This trend reached its zenith under [[Joseph Stalin]] with the ascendancy of [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], when the administration of justice was carried out mainly by the security police in [[NKVD troika|special tribunals]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

During the [[de-Stalinization]] of the [[Nikita Khrushchev]] era, a new trend developed, based on socialist legality, that stressed the need to protect the procedural and statutory rights of citizens, while still calling for obedience to the state. New legal codes, introduced in 1960, were part of the effort to establish legal norms in administering laws. Although socialist legality remained in force after 1960, the dictatorial and utopian trends continued to influence the legal process. Persecution of political and religious dissenters continued, but at the same time there was a tendency to [[decriminalization|decriminalize]] lesser offenses by handing them over to people's courts and administrative agencies and dealing with them by education rather than by incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elie |first=Marc |editor-last1=Kozlov |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last2=Gilburd |editor-first2=Eleonory  |date=2013 |title=The Thaw: Soviet Society and Culture during the 1950s and 1960s |publisher=Toronto University Press |pages=109{{hyphen}}142 |chapter=Khrushchev's Gulag: the Soviet Penitentiary System after Stalin's death, 1953-1964 |section-url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00859338/ |access-date=October 30, 2017 |isbn=978-1442644601 |id=HAL 00859338}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By late 1986, the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era was stressing anew the importance of [[individual rights]] in relation to the state and criticizing those who violated [[procedural law]] in implementing Soviet justice. This signaled a resurgence of socialist legality as the dominant trend. Socialist legality itself still lacked features associated with Western jurisprudence.

== Characteristic traits ==
Socialist law is similar to [[common law]] or [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] but with a greatly increased [[public law]] sector and decreased [[private law]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=H. Patrick|title=Legal Traditions of the World: Sustainable Diversity in Law|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eERrPWIQn2kC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=%22Socialist+law%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rQY-TPrODY6UjAf49cX5Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Socialist%20law%22&amp;f=false|edition= 4th |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-19-958080-4 |oclc=650838256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* extensive social warrants of the state (the rights to a job, free education, free healthcare, retirement at 60 for men and 55 for women, maternity leave, free disability benefits and sick leave compensation, subsidies to multichildren families, ...) in return for a high degree of social mobilization.
* the judicial process lacks [[adversarial system|adversary]] character; public prosecution is considered as "provider of justice."
* partial or total expulsion of the former [[ruling classes]] from the public life at early stages of existence of each socialist state; however, in all socialist states this policy gradually changed into the policy of "one socialist nation without classes"
* diversity of political views directly discouraged.
* the ruling Communist party was eventually subject to prosecution through party committees in first place.
* abolition of [[Private property#Socialist perspectives|private property]] considered as a primary goal of socialism, if not its defining characteristic, thus near total collectivization and nationalization of the means of production;
* subordination of the judiciary to the Communist Party
* low respect for [[privacy]], extensive control of the party over private life;
* low respect for [[intellectual property]] as knowledge and culture was considered a right for human kind, and not a privilege as in the free market economies.

A specific institution characteristic to Socialist law was the so-called [[burlaw court]] (or, verbally, "court of comrades", Russian товарищеский суд) which decided on minor offences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Chinese Socialist law==
Among the remaining communist governments, some (most notably the [[People's Republic of China]]) have added extensive modifications to their legal systems. In general, this is a result of their [[free market|market-oriented]] economic changes. However, some communist influence can still be seen. For example, in Chinese [[real estate]] law there is no unified concept of [[real property]]; the state owns all land but often not the structures that sit on that land. A rather complex ''[[ad hoc]]'' system of [[use (law)|use rights]] to land property has developed, and these use rights are the things being officially traded (rather than the property itself). In some cases (for example in the case of [[city|urban]] residential property), the system results in something that resembles real property transactions in other legal systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In other cases, the Chinese system results in something quite different. For example, it is a common misconception that reforms under [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in the [[privatization]] of agricultural land and a creation of a [[land tenure]] system similar to those found in [[Western world|Western]] countries. In actuality, the village committee owns the land and [[contract]]s the right to use this land to individual farmers who may use the land to make money from agriculture. Hence the rights that are normally unified in Western economies are split up between the individual farmer and the village committee.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

This has a number of consequences. One of them is that, because the farmer does not have an absolute right to transfer the land, he cannot borrow against his use rights. On the other hand, there is some insurance against risk in the system, in that the farmer can return his land to the village committee if he wants to stop farming and start some other sort of business. Then, if this business does not work, he can get a new contract with the village committee and return to farming. The fact that the land is redistributable by the village committee also ensures that no one is left landless; this creates a form of [[social welfare]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There have been a number of proposals to reform this system and they have tended to be in the direction of fully privatizing rural land for the alleged purpose of increasing efficiency. These proposals have usually not received any significant support, largely because of the popularity of the current system among the farmers themselves. There is little risk that the village committee will attempt to impose a bad contract on the farmers, since this would reduce the amount of money the village committee receives. At the same time, the farmer has some flexibility to decide to leave farming for other ventures and to return at a later time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

{{technical|date=October 2018}}
'''Standpoint theory''' is a theory for analyzing [[inter-subjective]] [[discourse]]s. This body of work concerns the ways that authority is rooted in individuals' knowledge (their [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s), and the power that such authority exerts.

Standpoint theory's most important concept is that an individual's own perspectives are shaped by his or her social and political experiences. Standpoints are multifaceted rather than essentializing: while  Hispanic women may generally share some perspectives, particularly with regard to ethnicity or sex, they are not defined solely by their participation in these categories. The amalgamation of a person's many experienced dimensions form a standpoint—a [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]—through which that individual sees and understands the world.

Standpoint theorists emphasize the utility of a naturalistic''',''' or everyday experiential, concept of knowing (i.e., [[epistemology]]).  One's standpoint (whether reflexively considered or not)  shapes which concepts are intelligible, which claims are heard and understood by whom, which features of the world are perceptually salient, which reasons are understood to be relevant and forceful, and which conclusions credible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sprague|first=Joey|title=The standpoint of art/criticism|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=13&amp;sid=e26ca1ca-8c19-4976-ad8a-7d7af38f55a0%40sessionmgr15&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=66905263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standpoint theory supports what feminist theorist [[Sandra Harding]] calls [[strong objectivity]], or the notion that the perspectives of [[marginalized]] and/or oppressed individuals can help to create more objective accounts of the world. Through the outsider-within phenomenon, these individuals are placed in a unique position to point to patterns of behavior that those immersed in the dominant group culture are unable to recognize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Brenda J.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory: a Black Woman's Review of Organizational Socialization|journal=Communication Studies|year=1996|volume=47|issue=4|pages=257–271|doi=10.1080/10510979609368482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory gives voice to the marginalized groups by allowing them to challenge the status quo as the outsider within. The status quo representing the dominant white male position of privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buzzanell|first=Patrice M.|title=A Feminist Standpoint Analysis of Maternity and Maternity Leave for Women with Disabilities|journal=Women and Language|year=2003|volume=26|issue=2|pages=53–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant culture in which all groups exist is not experienced in the same way by all persons or groups. The views of those who belong to groups with more social power are validated more than those in marginalized groups. Those in marginalized groups must learn to be [[bicultural]], or to "pass" in the [[dominant culture]] to survive, even though that perspective is not their own.&lt;ref name="DeFranciscoVictoria"&gt;DeFrancisco, Victoria P. ''Communicating Gender Diversity: A Critical Approach''. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, INC., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original inspirations for standpoint theory can be seen in the works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], a [[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher, who studied the different standpoints between slaves and masters in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J.T. (2008). Critical feminist theories. In L.A. Baxter &amp; D.O. Braithwaite (Eds.), Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (pp. 323-334). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the master-slave relationship is about people's belonging positions, and the groups affect how people receive knowledge and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Em|title=A First Look at COMMUNICATION THEORY: Standpoint Theory|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|pages=441–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] also discussed how the position of a worker shapes his or her knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} From these two scholars' studies, Nancy Hartsock examined standpoint theory by using relations between men and women. She published "The Feminist Standpoint: Developing Ground for a Specifically Feminist Historical Materialism" in 1983. Hartsock used Hegel's ideas of masters and slaves and Marx's ideas of class and [[capitalism]] as an inspiration to look into matters of sex and gender.

Contemporary standpoint theory often focuses on the social positions such as gender, [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], class, [[culture]], and economic status.&lt;ref&gt;Wallance, R. A., and A. Wolf (1995). ''Contemporary Sociological Theory: Continuing the classical tradition''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory seeks to develop a particular [[feminist epistemology]], that values the experiences of women and minorities as a source for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;McCann and Kim, ''Feminist Theory Reader: Local and global perspectives'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Prominent standpoint theorists include [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]], [[Nancy Hartsock]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Sandra Harding]], [[Alison Wylie]], Lynette Hunter and [[Patricia Hill Collins]].

==Key concepts==
Generally, standpoint theory gives insight into specific circumstances only available to the members of a certain collective standpoint. According to Michael Ryan, "the idea of a collective standpoint does not imply an essential overarching characteristic but rather a sense of belonging to a group bounded by a shared experience."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Social Theory'', 789.&lt;/ref&gt;. Kristina Rolin states that "the assumption of essentialism is that all women share the same socially grounded perspective in virtue of being women, the assumption of automatic epistemic privilege is that epistemic advantage accrues to the subordinate automatically, just in virtue of their occupying a particular social position."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rolin|first=Kristina|date=2009|title=Standpoint Theory as a Methodology for the Study of Power Relations|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20618192|journal=Hypatia|volume=24|issue=4|pages=218–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to this approach:
* A standpoint is a place from which [[human beings]] view the [[world]].
* A standpoint influences how the people adopting it [[social construct|socially construct]] the world.
* A standpoint is a mental position from which things are viewed.
* A standpoint is a position from which objects or principles are viewed and according to which they are compared and judged.
* The inequalities of different social groups create differences in their standpoints.
* All standpoints are partial; so (for example) [[Standpoint feminism]] coexists with other standpoints.

==Applications==

Since standpoint theory focuses on marginalized populations, it is often applied within fields that focus on these populations. Standpoint has been referenced as a concept that should be acknowledged and understood in the [[Social Work]] field, especially when approaching and assisting clients.&lt;ref&gt;Swigonski, M. E. (1993). "Feminist Standpoint Theory and the Questions of Social Work Research". ''Affilia'', 8(2), 171–183.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many marginalized populations rely on the welfare system to survive.  Unfortunately, those who structure the welfare system typically have never needed to utilize its services before.  Standpoint theory has been presented as a method to improving the [[welfare]] system by recognizing suggestions made by those within the welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edmonds-Cady | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = Getting to the grassroots: Feminist standpoints within the welfare movement | url = | journal = Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 11–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Africa, standpoint theory has catalyzed a social movement where women are introduced to the radio in order to promote awareness of their experiences and hardships and to help these women heal and find closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gatua | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Patton | first2 = T. O. | last3 = Brown | first3 = M. R. | year = 2010 | title = Giving voice to invisible women: "FIRE" as model of a successful women's community radio in Africa | url = | journal = Howard Journal of Communications | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 164–181 | doi=10.1080/10646171003727441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example dealing with Africa is slavery and how slavery differed greatly depending on if one was the slave or the master. If there were any power relationships there could never be a single perspective. No viewpoint could ever be complete, and there is no limit to anyone's perspective.

Asante and Davis’s (1989) study of interracial encounters in the workplace found that because of different cultural perspectives, approaching organizational interactions with others with different beliefs, assumptions, and meanings often leads to miscommunication. Brenda Allen stated in her research that, "Organizational members' experiences, attitudes, and behaviors in the workplace are often influenced by race-ethnicity"&lt;ref&gt;Allen, B. J. (1995). "'Diversity' and organizational communication". ''Journal of Applied Communication Research'', 23, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Adler and John Jermier suggest that management scholars should be aware of their standpoints. They write that those studying management should "consciously choose [their] standpoints and take responsibility for the impact (or lack of impact) of [their] scholarship on the world"&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Paul, and John Jermier. 2005. "Developing a field with more soul: Standpoint theory and public policy research for management scholars". ''The Academy of Management Journal'' 48 (6): 942.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Jermier argued that all parts of a research study- identifying the problem, theorizing research questions, gathering and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and the knowledge produced are there to some extent because of the researcher’s standpoint. This caused him to question what standpoint to adopt in the management of scientists. To avoid falling into limitations of the status quo and certain standpoints, he said that "the view from below has greater potential to generate more complete and more objective knowledge claims." He continues to say that, “if our desire is to heal the world, we will learn more about how the root mechanisms of the world work and about how things can be changed by adopting the standpoints of those people and other parts of nature that most deeply suffer its wounds.”&lt;ref&gt;Jermier, J.M. 1998. "Critical perspectives on organizational control". ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 43: 235–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist standpoint theory&lt;!--Section may be linked from elsewhere (see [[MOS:HEAD]]: do not rename without fixing linking articles)--&gt;==
{{main|Standpoint feminism}}
Feminist standpoint theorists make three principal claims: (1) Knowledge is socially situated. (2) Marginalized groups are socially situated in ways that make it more possible for them to be aware of things and ask questions than it is for the non-marginalized.  (3) Research, particularly that focused on power relations, should begin with the lives of the marginalized.&lt;ref name=Bowell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowell|first1=T.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-stan/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Feminist standpoint theorists such as Dorothy Smith, Patricia Hill Collins, Nancy Hartsock, and Sandra Harding claimed that certain socio-political positions occupied by women (and by extension other groups who lack social and economic privilege) can become sites of epistemic privilege and thus productive starting points for enquiry into questions about not only those who are socially and politically marginalized, but also those who, by dint of social and political privilege, occupy the positions of oppressors. This claim was specifically generated by Sandra Harding and as such, "Starting off research from women's lives will generate less partial and distorted accounts not only of women's lives but also of men's lives and of the whole social order."&lt;ref name="Griffin_b"&gt;Griffin, E. M. (2009). ''A first look at communication theory'' (7th edn). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is also quite evident when women enter into professions that are considered to be male oriented. [[Londa Schiebinger]] states, "While women now study at prestigious universities at about the same rate as men, they are rarely invited to join the faculty at top universities...The sociologist [[Harriet Zuckerman]] has observed that 'the more prestigious the institution, the longer women wait to be promoted.' Men, generally speaking, face no such trade-off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has feminism changed science?|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|pages=33–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standpoint feminists have been concerned with these dualisms for two related reasons. First, dualisms usually imply a hierarchical relationship between the terms, elevating one and devaluing the other.&lt;ref name=WestTurner&gt;West, R., and H. L. Turner (2004). ''Communication Theory. Analysis and Application''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that when we suggest that decisions should be made rationally, not emotionally, for example, we are showing that reason holds a higher value in our culture than does emotion. Also, related to this issue is the concern that these dualisms often become gendered in our culture. In this process, men are associated with one extreme and women with the other. In the case of reason and emotion, women are identified with emotion. Because our culture values emotion less than reason, women suffer from this association. Feminist critics are usually concerned with the fact that dualisms force false dichotomies (partition of a whole) onto women and men, failing to see that life is less either/or than both/and, as [[relational dialectics theory]] holds.

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that standpoint theory, despite challenging essentialism, relies itself on essentialism, as it focuses on the dualism of subjectivity and objectivity.&lt;ref name=WestTurner /&gt; In regards to feminist standpoint theory: though it does dispel many false generalizations of women, it is argued that focus on social groups and social classes of women is still inherently essentialist. Generalizations across the entire female gender can be broken into smaller more specific groups pertaining to women's different social classes and cultures, but are still generalized as distinct groups, and thus marginalization still occurs. West and Turner stated that an author by the name of Catherine O'Leary (1997) argued that although standpoint theory has been helpful in reclaiming women's experiences as suitable research topics, it contains a problematic emphasis on the universality of this experience, at the expense of differences among women's experiences.&lt;ref name=WestTurner /&gt;

Another main criticism of Harding and Wood's standpoint theory is the credibility of strong objectivity vs. subjectivity. Standpoint theorists argue that standpoints are relative and cannot be evaluated by any absolute criteria, but make the assumption that the oppressed are less biased or more impartial than the privileged.&lt;ref name="Griffin_b" /&gt; This leaves open the possibility of an overbalance of power, in which the oppressed group intentionally or unintentionally becomes the oppressor. Intentional overbalance of power, or revenge, can manifest as justification for extremism and militarism, which can sometimes be seen in more extreme forms of feminism.

While the beginnings of standpoint theory are based on the critical paradigm from a Marxist view of social class oppression, a feminist philosophy developed in the 1970s and 1980s and the main focus has been on the feministic side. Other groups, as of now, need to be included into the theory and a new emphasis needs to be made toward other marginalized or muted groups. These groups envelop minorities, culturally different and the disabled or those that have a disability. When Harding and Wood conceived Standpoint theory they did not understand, when they defined it as a feminist view, that there are different cultures existing in the same social group. Many researchers are unsure of the idea of it having essentialism, as essentialism refers to the practice of generalizing all groups as though they were, in essence, the same.” Early standpoint theorists sought to understand the way in which the gendered identity of knowers affected their epistemic resources and capacities”&lt;ref name="Wylie" /&gt;{{rp|48}}. These other muted or marginalized groups have a more realistic approach to standpoint theory as they have different experiences than those that are in power and even within those muted groups differences defined by different cultures of people can have an altered standpoint. This view gives a basis that in part Standpoint Theory has a central principle of the inversion thesis and Joshua St. Pierre defined this as "the inversion thesis gives epistemic authority to those marginalized by systems of oppression insofar as these people are often better knowers than those who benefit from oppression. Put simply: social dispossession produces epistemic privilege."

Part of standpoint theory’s return to favor comes from a re-articulation of its methodology, aims, and limitations that directly answer the criticisms mentioned above.

Wylie has perhaps provided the most succinct articulation of second-wave standpoint theory. For her, a standpoint does not mark out a clearly defined territory such as “women” within which members have automatic privilege but is a rather a posture of epistemic engagement. Responding to the claim that the situated knowledge thesis reifies essentialism, Wylie thus argues that it is "an open (empirical) question whether such structures obtain in a given context, what form they take, and how they are internalized or embodied by individuals".&lt;ref name="Wylie" /&gt;{{rp|62}} Identities are complex and cannot be reduced to simple binaries. Likewise, she argues that the criticism of automatic privilege is falters insofar as a standpoint is never given, but is achieved. (St. Pierre)&lt;ref name="Wylie"&gt;Wylie, Alison. 2012. "Feminist Philosophy of Science: Standpoint Matters." Presidential Address delivered to the Pacific Division APA, in ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', 86.2: 47–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5950">'''Stochastic frontier analysis''' (SFA) is a method of [[Model (economics)|economic modeling]].  It has its starting point in the [[stochastic]] production frontier models simultaneously introduced by Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusen and Van den Broeck (1977).

The ''production frontier model'' without random component can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;y_i  = f(x_i ;\beta ) \cdot TE_i&lt;/math&gt;
the best 
where ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the observed scalar output of the producer ''i'', ''i=1,..I, x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a vector of ''N'' inputs used by the producer ''i'', ''f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, β)'' is the production frontier, and &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;/math&gt; is a vector of technology parameters to be estimated.

''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the technical efficiency defined as the ratio of observed output to maximum feasible output.
''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1'' shows that the ''i-th'' firm obtains the maximum feasible output, while ''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1'' provides a measure of the shortfall of the observed output from maximum feasible output.

A stochastic component that describes random shocks affecting the production process is added. These shocks are not directly attributable to the producer or the underlying technology. These shocks may come from weather changes, economic adversities or plain luck. We denote these effects with &lt;math&gt;\exp \left\{ {v_i } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Each producer is facing a different shock, but we assume the shocks are random and they are described by a common distribution.

The stochastic production frontier will become:

&lt;math&gt;y_i  = f(x_i ;\beta ) \cdot TE_i  \cdot \exp \left\{ {v_i } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

We assume that ''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also a stochastic variable, with a specific distribution function, common to all producers.

We can also write it as an exponential &lt;math&gt;TE_i  = \exp \left\{ { - u_i } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0'', since we required ''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1''. Thus, we obtain the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;y_i  = f(x_i ;\beta ) \cdot  \exp \left\{ { - u_i } \right\}   \cdot \exp \left\{ {v_i } \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

Now, if we also assume that ''f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, β)'' takes the log-linear [[Cobb–Douglas]] form, the model can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\ln y_i  = \beta _0  + \sum\limits_n {\beta _n \ln x_{ni}  + v_i  - u_i } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the “noise” component, which we will almost always consider as a two-sided [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] variable, and ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the non-negative technical inefficiency component. Together they constitute a compound [[Errors and residuals in statistics|error term]], with a specific distribution to be determined, hence the name of “composed error model” as is often referred.

Stochastic Frontier Analysis has examined also "cost" and "profit" efficiency (see Kumbhakar &amp; Lovel 2003). The "Cost frontier" approach attempts to measure how far from full-cost minimization (i.e. cost-efficiency) is the firm. Modeling-wise, the non-negative cost-inefficiency component is added rather than subtracted in the stochastic specification. "Profit frontier analysis" examines the case where producers are treated as profit-maximizers (both output and inputs should be decided by the firm) and not as cost-minimizers, (where level of output is considered as exogenously given). The specification here is similar with the "production frontier" one.

Stochastic Frontier Analysis has also been applied in micro data of consumer demand in an attempt to benchmark consumption and segment consumers. In a two-stage approach, a stochastic frontier model is estimated and subsequently deviations from the frontier are regressed on consumer characteristics (Baltas 2005).

==Extensions: The two-tier stochastic frontier model==
Polacheck &amp; Yoon (1987) have introduced a three-component error structure, where one non-negative error term is added to, while the other is subtracted from, the zero-mean symmetric random disturbance. This modeling approach attempts to measure the impact of informational inefficiencies (incomplete and imperfect information) on the prices of realized transactions, inefficiencies that in most cases characterize both parties in a transaction (hence the two inefficiency components, to disentangle the two effects).

Recently, various non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches were proposed in the literature, where no parametric assumption on the functional form of production relationship is made, see for example Parmeter and Kumbhakar (2014) and  Park, Simar and Zelenyuk (2015) &lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jproda/v43y2015i2p199-214.html  Park, B., Simar, L. and V. Zelenyuk (2015) "Categorical data in local maximum likelihood: theory and applications to productivity analysis," Journal of Productivity Analysis 43:2, pp. 199-214.]&lt;/ref&gt; and references cited therein.

[[File:Tattva.jpg|thumb|Seven tattvas]]
{{Jainism}}
{{classic element}}

[[Jain philosophy]] explains that seven '''tattvas''' (truths or fundamental principles) constitute reality.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=6}} These are:{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}}— 
#''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]''- the soul which is characterized by consciousness
#''ajīva''- the non-soul
#''āsrava'' (influx)- inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
#''bandha'' (bondage)- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas''.
#''samvara'' (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''nirjara'' (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling-off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
#''mokṣha'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

The knowledge of these reals is said to be essential for the liberation of the soul.

== Overview ==
The first two are the two ontological categories of the soul ''jīva'' and the non-soul ''ajīva'', namely the axiom that they exist. The third truth is that through the interaction, called ''yoga'', between the two substances, soul and non-soul, karmic matter flows into the soul (''āsrava''), clings to it, becomes converted into [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] and the fourth truth acts as a factor of bondage (''bandha''), restricting the manifestation of the consciousness intrinsic to it. The fifth truth states that a stoppage (''saṃvara'') of new karma is possible through asceticism through practice of right conduct, faith and knowledge. An intensification of asceticism burns up the existing karma – this sixth truth is expressed by the word ''nirjarā''. The final truth is that when the soul is freed from the influence of karma, it reaches the goal of Jaina teaching, which is liberation or ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|mokṣa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last = Soni|first = Jayandra|coauthors = |title = Jain Philosophy|journal = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher = Routledge|location = London|year = 1998|url = http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1|accessdate = 2008-03-05|editor-last = Craig|editor-first = E.|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060722002023/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1|archivedate = 22 July 2006|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some texts ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]'' or spiritual merit and ''papa'' or spiritual demerit are counted among the fundamental reals. But in major Jain texts like ''[[Tattvārthasūtra]]'' the number of ''tattvas'' is seven because both ''punya'' and ''papa'' are included in ''āsrava'' or ''bandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad |translator=K. K. Dixit}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain text, [[Sarvārthasiddhi]], translates S.A. Jain:{{cquote|It is not necessary to include these (merit and demerit), as these are implied in influx and bondage. If it were so, the mention of influx etc. is unnecessary, as these are included in the soul and the non-soul. No, it is not unnecessary. Here liberation is the main theme of the work. So that must be mentioned. And that (liberation) is preceded by the cycle of births and deaths. Influx and bondage are the main causes of transmigration. Stoppage and gradual dissociation are the chief causes of liberation. Hence these are mentioned severally in order to indicate the chief causes and effects. It is well-known that the particulars implied in the general are mentioned separately according to needs.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}}}}

==Jīva==
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
[[Jainism]] believes that the souls (''jīva'') exist as a reality, having a separate existence from the body that houses it. ''Jīva'' is characterised by ''cetana'' (consciousness) and ''upayoga'' (knowledge and perception).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Nayanar | first =Prof. A. Chakravarti | title =Pañcāstikāyasāra of Ācārya Kundakunda | publisher =Today &amp; Tomorrows Printer and Publisher | year =2005 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-7019-436-9 }} 
, Gāthā 16&lt;/ref&gt; Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state of soul and appearance of another state, these being merely the modes of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Nayanar | first =Prof. A. Chakravarti | title =Pañcāstikāyasāra of Ācārya Kundakunda | publisher =Today &amp; Tomorrows Printer and Publisher | year =2005 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-7019-436-9 }} 
, Gāthā 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ajīva==
{{main|Ajiva}}
''Ajīva'' are the five non-living substances that make up the universe along with the ''jīva''. They are:
*'''Pudgala''' ([[Matter]]) –Matter is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Shah | first =Natubhai | title =Jainism: The World of Conquerors | publisher =Sussex Academy Press | year =1998 | location =Sussex | series =Volume I and II | isbn =1-898723-30-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramānu or ultimate particles are considered the basic building block of all matter. One of the qualities of the ''Paramānu'' and ''Pudgala'' is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed.
*'''Dharma-tattva''' (Medium of [[Motion (physics)|Motion]]) and '''Adharma-tattva''' (Medium of rest) – They are also known as ''Dharmāstikāya'' and ''Adharmāstikāya''. They are unique to Jain thought depicting the principles of motion and rest. They are said to pervade the entire universe. ''Dharma-tattva'' and ''adharma-tattva'' are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without ''dharmāstikāya'' motion is not possible and without ''adharmāstikāya'' rest is not possible in the universe.
*'''Ākāśa''' (Space) – [[Space]] is a substance that accommodates souls, matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest, and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points.
*'''Kāla '''(Time) – [[Time]] is a real entity according to Jainism and all activities, changes or modifications can be achieved only through time. In Jainism, the time is likened to a wheel with twelve spokes divided into descending and ascending halves with six stages, each of immense duration estimated at billions of ''sagaropama'' or ocean years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =James | first =Edwin Oliver | title =Creation and Cosmology: A Historical and Comparative Inquiry | publisher =BRILL | year =1969 | location =Netherland | isbn =90-04-01617-1 }}  p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jains, sorrow increases at each progressive descending stage and happiness and bliss increase in each progressive ascending stage.

==Āsrava==
{{Main|Asrava}}
''Asrava'' (influx of ''karma'') refers to the influence of body and mind causing the soul to generate karma. It occurs when the karmic particles are attracted to the soul on account of vibrations created by activities of mind, speech and body.&lt;ref name="Jaini1998"&gt;{{citation | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 |page= 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''āsrava'', that is, the influx of karmic occurs when the karmic particles are attracted to the soul on account of vibrations created by activities of mind, speech and body.&lt;ref name=Jaini112&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }} p.112&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tattvārthasūtra]]'', 6:1–2 states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kuhn | first =Hermann | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate | publisher =Crosswind Publishing | year =2001 | location =Wunstorf, Germany | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; "The activities of body, speech and mind is called ''yoga''. This three-fold action results in ''āsrava'' or influx of karma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Tatia | first = Nathmal | title =Tattvārtha Sūtra: That Which Is of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =Rowman Altamira | year =1994 | location =Lanham, MD | language =Sanskrit, English | isbn =0-7619-8993-5 }} p.151&lt;/ref&gt; 
The karmic inflow on account of ''yoga'' driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001). p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bandha==
{{Main|Bandha (Jainism)}}
The karmas have effect only when they are bound to the consciousness. This binding of the karma to the consciousness is called ''bandha''. However, the ''yoga'' or the activities alone do not produce bondage. Out of the many causes of bondage, passion is considered as the main cause of bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions.&lt;ref name="Jaini1998" /&gt;

==Saṃvara==
{{main|Samvara}}
''[[Samvara|Saṃvara]]'' is stoppage of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]]. The first step to emancipation or the realization of the self is to see that all channels through which karma has been flowing into the soul have been stopped, so that no additional karma can accumulate. This is referred to as the stoppage of the inflow of karma (''saṃvara'').&lt;ref name="KalghatgiPhilosophy"&gt;T. G. Kalghatgi, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 15, No. 3/4, (Jul. - Oct., 1965), pp. 229-242 University of Hawai Press&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of ''saṃvara'': that which is concerned with mental life (''bhava-saṃvara''), and that which refers to the removal of karmic particles (''dravya- saṃvara''). This stoppage is possible by self-control and freedom from attachment. The practice of vows, carefulness, self-control, observance of ten kinds of dharma, meditation, and the removal of the various obstacles, such as hunger, thirst, and passion stops the inflow of karma and protect the soul from the impurities of fresh karma.

==Nirjarā==
{{main|Nirjara}}
''[[Nirjara|Nirjarā]]'' is the shedding or destruction of karmas that has already accumulated. ''Nirjarā'' is of two types: the psychic aspect
of the removal of karma (''bhāva-nirjarā'') and destruction of the particles of
karma (''dravya-nirjarā'').&lt;ref name="KalghatgiPhilosophy" /&gt; Karma may exhaust itself in its natural course when its fruits are completely exhausted. In this, no effort is required. The remaining karma has to be removed by means of penance (''avipaka-nirjarā''). The soul is like a mirror which looks dim when the dust of karma is deposited on its surface. When karma is removed by destruction, the soul shines in its pure and transcendent form. It then attains the goal of ''mokṣa''.

==Mokṣha==
{{Main|Moksha (Jainism)}} 

Mokṣha means liberation, salvation or emancipation of soul. As per [[Jainism]], Mokṣha is the attainment of an altogether different state of the soul, completely free from the karmic bondage, free from [[samsara]] (the cycle of birth and death). It means the removal of all the impurities of karmic matter and the body, characterized by the inherent qualities of the soul such as knowledge and bliss free from pain and suffering.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=2}} Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=2}} A liberated soul is said to have attained its true and pristine nature of infinite bliss, infinite knowledge and infinite perception. In Jainism, it is the highest and the noblest objective that a soul should strive to achieve. It fact, it is the only objective that a person should have; other objectives are contrary to the true nature of soul. That is why, Jainism is also known as {{IAST|mokṣamārga}} or the “path to liberation”.

'''The Voice Project''' is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit advocacy group focused on promoting freedom of artistic expression as an agent of social change.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://voiceproject.org/movement.php The Voice Project Movement]'', The Voice Project. Retrieved 17 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was founded in 2009 as a response to the [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency|Lord's Resistance Army Insurgency]] in Northern [[Uganda]], but has since expanded programs into [[Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Cuba]], and the [[United States]].

==Background==
The Voice Project works to defend the right of freedom of expression by advocating for artists who use their work as an agent of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceproject.org/going-forward/ |title=Going Forward |publisher=The Voice Project |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was founded in [[Uganda]] in 2009, having built radio stations and produced broadcast content in support of local singers who were using their songs to engourage combatants to return home from war in that country. The Voice Project has since worked to provide advocacy and legal aid for imprisoned artists as well as fiscal sponsorship and other support to activist-artists who use their artistic work as an agent for social change. In addition to its actions as an advocacy group, The Voice Project serves as a news source for updates in the field of freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceproject.org/news/ |title=News and Updates |publisher=The Voice Project |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.originmagazine.com/2012/10/18/the-voice-project-by-hunter-heaney/ |title=The Voice Project by Hunter Heaney |publisher=ORIGIN Magazine |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Central Africa===
Founded in 2009, The Voice Project was inspired by women's groups in Northern Uganda who have used songs passed by word of mouth and on the radio to let children and soldiers who have been abducted and forced to fight in [[Joseph Kony|Joseph Kony’s]] [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) know that they are forgiven for the atrocities they were forced to commit and are welcome home. The project was started by Hunter Heaney who in the fall of 2008 was volunteering at an IDP ([[Internally Displaced Persons]]) camp in Agoro, a small village in northern Uganda's war-torn [[Kitgum District]] when he first heard the "dwog paco" ("come home") songs. Upon returning to the United States, Heaney and friends Anna Gabriel (daughter of [[Peter Gabriel]]) and Chris Holmes ([[Ashtar Command (band)|Ashtar Command]]) co-founded the organization, enlisting friends and musicians from around the world and having them pass participation from one to another by word of mouth and through music by covering another artist’s song in "cover chains." &lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Augusta (October 1, 2010).

Participants have included indie rock acts such as [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]], [[Andrew Bird]], [[Dawes (band)|Dawes]], and [[Joe Purdy]] as well as international recording artists such as [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Mike Mills]] ([[R.E.M.]]), [[Angélique Kidjo]] and former child soldier [[Emmanuel Jal]].&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Augusta (October 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Vine, Lauren (August 11, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreps, Daniel (June 22, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Jonathan Daniel (June 22, 2010).

In 2012 it was reported that The Voice Project had been working with the [[United Nations]] to build [[FM radio]] stations, produce music content, and record family members and ex-combatants in their native [[Luo languages]] encouraging LRA escapes and defections and encouraging former combatants to return home, and that between 2010 and 2012 more than 100 soldiers had escaped or defected from the LRA with many returnees claiming that the radio broadcasts were the main factor in their decision to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, Shannon (February 13, 2012).

====Pussy Riot Support Fund====
[[File:TVP &amp; Pussy Riot in Santa Fe, NM.jpg|thumb|The Voice Project's Hunter Heaney here with Pussy Riot's Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alekhina using a press conference to call artist Tania Bruguera who was being detained in Cuba. May 2015.]]
From 2012 to 2014, The Voice Project coordinated international donations through an international legal defense and support fund for [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]] and [[Maria Alyokhina]] of [[Pussy Riot]] during their [[Pussy Riot#Imprisonment|imprisonment]] in Russian [[corrective labor colony|corrective labor colonies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20026056 |title=Russia sends Pussy Riot women to camps east of Moscow |date=October 22, 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=November 1, 2012 |archivedate=November 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BqwqmePP?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20026056 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which supported the women's legal expenses, supplied them with provisions while in the prison camps and child care, in addition to safety monitoring by local Russian lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/kim-gordon-james-murphy-and-jake-gyllenhaal-party-for-pussy-riot-20140207 |title= Kim Gordon, James Murphy and Jake Gyllenhaal Party for Pussy Riot |date=February 7, 2014 |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://voiceproject.org/docs/financials/TVP-2013-Financials.pdf The Voice Project 2013 Financials]"&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 1, 2014, The Voice Project reported that the fund had raised over USD$120,000 in support of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, the majority of which (USD$94,000) went to  support efforts such as hiring local monitoring attorneys, food, clothing and supplies for the women and care for their children via their families, with the rest supporting other Pussy Riot members (USD$16,000) and legal defense efforts ($10,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceproject.org/your-voice/2014/01/01/the-pussy-riot-international-support-fund-%E2%80%93-january-1-2014-report/ |title=The Pussy Riot International Support Fund January 1, 2014 Report |date=January 1, 2014 |publisher= The Voice Project |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zona Prava and MediaZona====
In 2014, though the support fund itself had closed with the release of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, The Voice Project continued in its work with the women promoting human rights, notably by coordinating their first visit to the United States in February, 2014, and the arrangement of the [[New York City|New York]] human rights gala which marked it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304680904579368892816595538 |title=Two Pussy Riot Members Make A Splash In New York |date=February 7, 2014 |publisher= The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 The Voice Project formed a partnership with Tolokonnikova and Alekhina's newly formed prisoners' rights NGO, Zona Prava, to provide donations-processing and administrative support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/nadya-tolokonnikova.html |title=Nadya Tolokonnikova |date=August 16, 2014 |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=August 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice Project's partnership with Zona Prava has continued through its fiscal sponsorship of the organization's US activities, and coordination, participation, and partnership in events such as the Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina's September, 2014 panel at [[Harvard University]] and subsequent meeting with philosopher and activist [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2014/09/15/namesriot/r2hHUjV4UctHWB3BveQtAO/story.html |title=Pussy Riot Bring Message to Harvard |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher= The Boston Globe |accessdate=December 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2015, The Voice Project, Zona Prava, and [[SITE Santa Fe]] made a surprise phone call to detained Cuban activist-artist [[Tania Bruguera]] following an event hosted by SITE and the [[Santa Fe University of Art and Design]]. During the phone call Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina made a public declaration of their solidarity with Bruguera and stated that they would be working together going forward to address the issues facing each of their groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Pussy-Riot-The-Voice-Project-and-SITE-Santa-Fe-Call-Detained-Artist-Tania-Bruguera-20150515 |title=Pussy Riot, The Voice Project and SITE Santa Fe Call Detained Artist Tania Bruguera |date=May 15, 2015 |publisher= Broadway World Music |accessdate=June 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
In 2012, The Voice Project worked in partnership with [[Los Angeles]]-born Afghan-American filmmaker and musician Ariana Delawari in [[Kabul, Afghanistan|Kabul]], sponsoring her appearance at the 2012 [[TED (conference)|TEDx Kabul]] conference and her appearance at the Sound Central music festival, the first of its kind in post-Communist Afghanistan, as such performances were outlawed under the [[Taliban]] and other Afghan regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arianadelawari.com/news/ |title=News – TEDx Kabul |date=September 8, 2012 |publisher=Ariana Delawari |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/10/06/kabul-school-of-rock-muslims/1615751/ |title=Kabul School of Rock Gains Acceptance Among Muslims |date=October 8, 2012 |publisher=USA Today |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delawari began working with The Voice Project when she traveled to Uganda in order to aid with documenting and filming the Amplify Peace campaign, and it is in Uganda that The Voice Project began to support her work in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tedxkabul.com/videos.html |title=2012 Speakers |date=October 2012 |publisher=TEDx Kabul |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal shared by The Voice Project, Delawari, and the Sound Central and TEDx Kabul programs has been the creation of a safe and flourishing environment for expression and the arts in Central Asia.

===United States===

====Solidarity Wisconsin====
Beginning with the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]] over [[collective bargaining]] rights, the Solidarity Sing Along has been a continued gathering in the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] building and grounds for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wnpj.org/pdf/2011_AnnReport.pdf |title=2011 Annual Report |publisher=Wisconsin Network for Peace and Justice |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the state government began requiring permits for demonstrations by groups of four or more in the State Capitol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/105254165/Wisconsin-State-Facilities-Access-Policy |title=Wisconsin State Facilities Access Policy |date= December 2011 |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Administration |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and began arresting, issuing tickets to, and prosecuting protestors, including the Solidarity Singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=41433 |title=Protesters file some 15,000 complaints against Capitol police over Solidarity Sing Along arrests |date=November 19, 2013 |publisher=The Daily Page |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, [[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]], through its ''Daily Page'' website, reported on The Voice Project's ''Solidarity Wisconsin'' campaign in support of the Solidarity Singers, calling for the dismissal of the charges brought against the singers, raising the topic on social media, and petitioning Attorney General [[J. B. Van Hollen]] to stop the continued prosecution of the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=42250 |title=Pussy Riot members petition Wisconsin attorney general to stop prosecuting Solidarity Sing Along |date=March 11, 2014 |publisher=The Daily Page |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video produced by The Voice Project in 2014 brought increased attention to the cases outside Wisconsin, much of which resulted from the declaration of solidarity from [[Pussy Riot]] members [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]] and [[Maria Alyokhina]], who had previously worked with The Voice Project, with the demonstrations in the capitol. [[The Capital Times]] newspaper, based in Madison, reported on The Voice Project's activism in advocating for demonstration rights in Wisconsin, framed through the context of more familiar human rights abuses in Russia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://host.madison.com/entertainment/music/pussy-riot-joins-the-cause-of-wisconsin-s-solidarity-singers/article_771e6413-869f-5597-8e96-814615c8713a.html |title=Pussy Riot joins the cause of Wisconsin's solidarity singers |date=March 11, 2014 |publisher=The Capitol Times |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 19, 2014, [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]] Judge John Markson has dismissed 29 tickets based on his ruling in ''State of Wisconsin v. Michael W. Crute'', No. 13FO2108 (1st Cir. Feb. 5, 2014), which found that the permit law was against the [[Constitution of Wisconsin|State Constitution]] but the Department of Justice had issued an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=42310 |title=Wisconsin DOJ to appeal Dane County court ruling dismissing Solidarity Sing Along tickets on constitutional grounds |date=March 19, 2014 |publisher=The Daily Page |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2015, the Wisconsin Fourth District Court of Appeals dismissed all of the approximately 400 cases brought against the Solidarity Singers, upholding the lower court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/01/29/1360955/-Wisconsin-Appeals-Court-Upholds-Dismissal-of-Solidarity-Sing-Along-Citations |title=Wisconsin Appeals Court Upholds Dismissal of Solidarity Sing Along Citations |date=January 29, 2015 |publisher=The Daily Kos |accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice Project has continued to advocate for the free expression and assembly of the protestors who continue in the Solidarity Sing Along.

====Cecily McMillan====
In 2014, The Voice Project spearheaded a letter-writing campaign in support of [[Occupy Wall Street]] activist [[Cecily McMillan]], who was tried and subsequently convicted of assault on a plainclothes police officer, which she claimed was in self-defense from sexual assault.  A majority of the jurors who convicted McMillan argued that she should not receive a prison sentence, as she faced a potential seven-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/cecily-mcmillan-jurors-judge-occupy-activist-jail|publisher=The Guardian|title=Cecily McMillan jurors tell judge Occupy activist should not go to jail|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to McMillan's harsh potential sentence, The Voice Project conducted a campaign, encouraging supporters to write letters petitioning for leniency to Judge Ronald Zweibel, who was overseeing the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/05/19/cecily-mcmillan-sentencing/|publisher=Mashable|title=Occupy Activist Cecily McMillan Gets 3 Months in Prison: A Rare Interview|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign collected letters from the general public, as well as numerous artists including [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Kim Gordon]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[JD Samson]], [[Lauren Mayberry]], [[Justin Vivian Bond]], and [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concertblogger.com/2014/05/voice-project-campaign-cecily-mcmillan-w-pussy-riot-kim-gordon-chvrches/|publisher=Concert Blogger|title=The Voice Project Campaign For Cecily McMillan with Pussy Riot, Kim Gordon, Chvrches, and More|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibet===
In 2014 the Voice Project spearheaded two letter-writing campaigns to the Chinese government, regarding the treatment and detention of activists in Tibet, calling for the release of activist artists and an end to the governmental crackdown on voices of dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ventsmagazine.com/arrested-chinese-artist-guo-jian-must-be-released-the-voice-project/|publisher=Vents Magazine|title=Arrested Chinese Artist Guo Jian Must Be Released – The Voice Project|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campaign specifically focused on Gebey, a Tibetan singer arrested after a May 24, 2014 concert in which he sang songs promoting use of the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/song-05262014160729.html|publisher=Radio Free Asia|title=Tibetan Singer Held After Belting Out Song Calling for Language Protection|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gebey was released in June, 2014, the campaign in support of the other 10 detained artists is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/release-06172014154208.html|publisher=Radio Free Asia|title=Chinese Authorities Release Tibetan Singer Who Sought Language Protection|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
[[File:Peter Gabriel Stand By You Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|Projected image of Peter Gabriel with a yellow umbrella in Hong Kong.]]
In November, 2014, The Voice Project was reported to have partnered with [[Hong Kong]] art collective [[Art of the Umbrella Movement#Message boards|Stand By You: Add Oil Machine]]
and activist organization [[Human Rights in China (organization)|Human Rights in China]] in the Stand By You 2.0 campaign, which featured the projection of messages from supporters around the world onto the Lennon Wall in Downtown Hong Kong, the operational center of the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/peter-gabriel-pussy-riot-show-support-for-hong-kong-protestors-20141129 |title=Peter Gabriel, Pussy Riot Show Support for Hong Kong Protestors |date=November 29, 2014 |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images projected included messages from [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Pussy Riot]], and [[Iron &amp; Wine]] in a stated mission for the organizations and supporters to "show [protestors] that we still stand with them, and to help counteract propaganda that they don't have support out there." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2854422/Peter-Gabriel-Pussy-Riot-rally-Hong-Kong-protesters.html |title=Peter Gabriel, Pussy Riot Rally for Hong Kong Protestors |date=November 29, 2014 |publisher=The Daily Mail |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/pussy-riot/81425 |title=Pussy Riot and Peter Gabriel Send Messages of Support to Hong Kong Demonstrators |date=November 29, 2014 |publisher=NME |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the supporters holding umbrellas, namesake and common symbol of the [[Umbrella Movement]], appeared bearing messages of their solidarity as captions in both English and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/30/peter-gabriel-pussy-riot-show-support-for-hong-kon/ |title=Peter Gabriel, Pussy Riot Show Support For Hong Kong Protesters |date=November 30, 2014 |publisher=The Washington Times |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba===
In January, 2015, The Voice Project launched an advocacy campaign in support of the [[Cuban American]] artist [[Tania Bruguera]], who was arrested by Cuban government authorities ahead of her planned December 30, 2014 performance art piece "Yo También Exijo" (I Also Demand) which consisted of an open microphone in [[Havana|Havana's]] [[Plaza de la Revolución]], inviting Cubans to openly share their thoughts on the state of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/cultura/arte/20150129/abci-tania-bruguera-izquierda-espana-201501282118.html|publisher=ABC Sevilla|title=Tania Bruguera "La izquierda no debería desentenderse de mi retensión en Cuba"|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Bruguera was released, the government has kept her under surveillance while building charges against her, with an extended detention barring her from leaving. In response, The Voice Project launched a campaign in which activists wrote letters to Cuban president [[Raúl Castro]] and [[Council of Ministers (Cuba)|Minister of Justice]] María Esther Reus González, "strongly urging [the government] to unconditionally drop the case against this artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.artinfo.com/artintheair/2015/02/05/tania-bruguera-detained-in-cuba-for-at-least-60-more-days/|publisher=Blouin Art Info|title=Tania Bruguera Detained in Cuba for At Least 60 More Days|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice Project has continued to work with Bruguera and the Yo También Exijo platform to support the artist through advocacy as her case proceeds, as well as facilitating collaboration between Bruguera and the other artists supported by the group.

'''Traditional medicine''' (also known as '''indigenous''' or '''folk medicine''') comprises medical aspects of [[traditional knowledge]] that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern [[medicine]]. The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] defines traditional medicine as "the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/definitions/en/|title=Traditional Medicine: Definitions|date=2008-12-01|accessdate=2014-04-20|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their [[primary health care]] needs.  When adopted outside its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often considered a form of [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref name = WHO/&gt;  Practices known as traditional medicines include traditional European medicine, [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[traditional Korean medicine]], [[traditional African medicine]], [[Ayurveda]], [[Siddha medicine]], [[Unani]], [[ancient Iranian Medicine]], [[Irani Traditional medicine|Iranian (Persian)]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Islamic medicine]], [[Muti]], and [[Ifá]]. Scientific disciplines which study traditional medicine include [[herbalism]], [[ethnomedicine]], [[ethnobotany]], and [[medical anthropology]].

The WHO notes, however, that "inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects" and that "further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety" of several of the practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems.&lt;ref name = WHO/&gt; Ultimately, the World Health Organization has implemented a nine year strategy to "support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/traditional/trm_strategy14_23/en/|title=WHO traditional medicine strategy: 2014-2023|last=|first=|date=December 2013|website=The World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and history==

=== Classical history ===
{{further|Medicine in ancient Greece|Medicine in ancient Rome}}
In the written record, the study of herbs dates back 5,000 years to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, who described well-established medicinal uses for plants. In [[Ancient Egyptian medicine]], the [[Ebers papyrus]] from c. 1552 BC records a list of folk remedies and magical medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebers' Papyrus|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/443.html|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Testament]] also mentions herb use and cultivation in regards to [[Kashrut]].

Many herbs and minerals used in Ayurveda were described by ancient Indian herbalists such as [[Charaka]] and [[Sushruta]] during the 1st millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Girish Dwivedi|first=Shridhar Dwivedi|year=2007|title=History of Medicine: Sushruta – the Clinician – Teacher par Excellence|publisher=[[National Informatics Centre]]|url=http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Chinese herbology|Chinese herbal]] book was the ''[[Shennong|Shennong Bencao Jing]]'', compiled during the [[Han Dynasty]] but dating back to a much earlier date, which was later augmented as the ''[[Yaoxing Lun]]'' (''Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs'') during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. Early recognised Greek compilers of existing and current herbal knowledge include [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoras and his followers]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], [[Theophrastus]], [[Dioscorides]] and [[Galen]].

Roman sources included [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' and [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]]'s ''[[De Medicina]]''.&lt;ref name="Kay1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kay|first=MA|year=1996|title=Healing with plants in the American and Mexican West|isbn=0-8165-1646-4|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|pages=19&amp;ndash;20|location=Tucson}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] drew on and corrected earlier authors for his ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', adding much new material; the work was translated into several languages, and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names were added to it over the centuries.&lt;ref name="Blunt1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Raphael, Sandra |author2=Blunt, Wilfrid |title=The Illustrated herbal|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|year=1994|pages=|isbn=0-7112-0914-6|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Latin manuscripts of ''De Materia Medica'' were combined with a Latin herbal by [[Pseudo-Apuleius|Apuleius Platonicus]] (''Herbarium Apuleii Platonici'') and were incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon [[codex]] ''Cotton Vitellius C.III''. These early Greek and Roman compilations became the backbone of European medical theory and were translated by the Persian [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sīnā, 980&amp;ndash;1037), the Persian [[Rhazes]] (Rāzi, 865&amp;ndash;925) and the Jewish [[Maimonides]].&lt;ref name = Kay1996/&gt;

The [[Unani]] system of traditional medicine is also based on the ''Canon''.

Translations of the early Roman-Greek compilations were made into German by [[Hieronymus Bock]] whose herbal, published in 1546, was called ''Kreuter Buch''. The book was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as ''Pemptades'' by [[Rembert Dodoens]] (1517&amp;ndash;1585), and from Dutch into [[English language|English]] by [[Carolus Clusius]], (1526&amp;ndash;1609), published by [[Henry Lyte (botanist)|Henry Lyte]] in 1578 as ''A Nievve Herball''. &lt;!--many other similar herbals, all based on Dioscorides, should be discussed here--&gt; This became [[John Gerard]]'s (1545&amp;ndash;1612) ''Herball or General Hiftorie of Plantes''.&lt;ref name = Kay1996/&gt;&lt;ref name = Blunt1994/&gt;  Each new work was a compilation of existing texts with new additions.

[[Francisco Hernández de Toledo|Francisco Hernández]], physician to [[Philip II of Spain]] spent the years 1571–1577 gathering information in [[Mexico]] and then wrote ''Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus'', many versions of which have been published including one by [[Francisco Ximénez]].

Martín de la Cruz wrote an herbal in [[Nahuatl]] which was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Juan Badiano]] as ''[[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis]]'' or ''Codex Barberini, Latin 241'' and given to King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]] of Spain in 1552.&lt;ref name="Heinrich2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heinrich|first1=M|last2=Pieroni|first2=A|last3=Bremner|first3=P|year=2005|chapter=Plants as medicines|editors=Prance G &amp; Nesbitt M|isbn=0-415-92746-3|title=The Cultural history of plants|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=205–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was apparently written in haste&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arqueologiamexicana.mx/mexico-antiguo/libellus-de-medicinalibus-indorum-herbis-librito-de-las-yerbas-medicinales-de-los|title=Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis (Librito de las yerbas medicinales de los indios) o Códice Badiano|last=Lozoya|first=Xavier|date=2016|website=Arqueología Mexicana|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced by the European occupation of the previous 30 years.

== Knowledge transmission and creation ==
Indigenous medicine is generally transmitted [[Oral tradition|orally]] through a community, family and individuals until "collected". Within a given culture, elements of indigenous medicine knowledge may be diffusely known by many, or may be gathered and applied by those in a specific role of healer such as a [[Shamanism|shaman]] or [[Midwifery|midwife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Acharya|first=D|author2=Anshu S|year=2008|title=Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices|publisher=Aavishkar Publishers|location=[[Jaipur]]|isbn=978-81-7910-252-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three factors legitimize the role of the healer &amp;ndash; their own beliefs, the success of their actions and the beliefs of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(00)91989-5.pdf|title=ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE: NIGERIA The role of traditional medicine|last=Maurice Mwu, Eric Gbodossou|first=|date=December 2000|website=The Lancet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the claims of indigenous medicine become rejected by a culture, generally three types of adherents still use it &amp;ndash; those born and socialized in it who become permanent believers, temporary believers who turn to it in crisis times, and those who only believe in specific aspects, not in all of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Laguerre, Michel S.|title=Afro-Caribbean folk medicine|publisher=Bergin &amp; Garvey|location=New York|year=1987|pages=|isbn=0-89789-113-9|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}

== Definition and terminology ==
Traditional medicine may sometimes be considered as distinct from folk medicine, and the considered to include formalized aspects of folk medicine. Under this definition folk medicine are longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people. Folk medicine consists of the [[healing]] practices and ideas of body [[physiology]] and [[health]] preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, Deepak and Shrivastava Anshu (2008): Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices, Aavishkar Publishers Distributor, Jaipur- India. {{ISBN|978-81-7910-252-7}}. pp 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folk medicine ===
[[File:Curandera performing a limpieza.jpg|thumb|[[Curandera]] performing a ''limpieza'' in Cuenca, Ecuador]]
Many countries have practices described as folk medicine which may coexist with formalized, science-based, and institutionalized systems of medical practice represented by conventional [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="who2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional, complementary and integrative medicine|url=http://www.who.int/traditional-complementary-integrative-medicine/about/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of folk medicine traditions are [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[traditional Korean medicine]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic indigenous medicine]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] traditional medicine, Japanese [[Kampō]] medicine, traditional Aboriginal [[bush medicine]], and [[Georgian folk medicine]], among others.&lt;ref name="who2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/92455/9789241506090_eng.pdf?sequence=1|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home remedies===
{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}
A '''home remedy''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''granny cure''') is a treatment to cure a [[disease]] or ailment that employs certain spices, vegetables, or other common items. Home remedies may or may not have [[medicinal properties]] that treat or cure the disease or ailment in question, as they are typically passed along by laypersons (which has been facilitated in recent years by the [[Internet]]). Many are merely used as a result of [[tradition]] or [[Habituation|habit]] or because they are effective in inducing the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/placebo-effect-a-cure-in-the-mind/|title=Placebo Effect: A Cure in the Mind|work=Scientific American|date=February–March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more popular examples of a home remedy is the use of [[chicken soup]] to treat [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] [[infection]]s such as a cold or mild [[flu]]. Other examples of home remedies include [[duct tape]] to help with setting broken bones; and duct tape or superglue to treat [[plantar wart]]s; and [[Kogel mogel]] to treat sore throat. In earlier times, mothers were entrusted with all but serious remedies. Historic [[cookbook]]s are frequently full of remedies for [[dyspepsia]], fevers, and female complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Beecher|Catherine Esther Beecher]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=FEQFN3bN7xEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Recipes+date:0-1920&amp;num=30#PPA13,M1 Mrs. Beecher's Housekeeper and Healthkeeper] 1874.

In Chinese folk medicine, medicinal [[congee]]s (long-cooked rice soups with herbs), foods, and soups are part of treatment practices.&lt;ref&gt;''Prince Wen Hui's Cook'' Bob Flaws and Honora Wolf 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Safety concerns===
Although 130 countries have regulations on folk medicines, there are risks associated with the use of them. It is often assumed that because supposed medicines are herbal or natural that they are safe, but numerous precautions are associated with using herbal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js7916e/2.html|title=National Policy on Traditional Medicine and Regulation of Herbal Medicines - Report of a WHO Global Survey|publisher=World Health Organization|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of endangered species===
[[File:Slow_loris_-_dried_01.JPG|right|thumb|Sometimes traditional medicines include parts of endangered species, such as the [[slow loris]] in Southeast Asia.]]
Endangered animals, such as the [[slow loris]], are sometimes killed to make traditional medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = C. | last2 = Nekaris | first2 = K. A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="915">In [[philosophy]], to say that a statement is '''truth-apt''' is to say that it could be uttered in some context (without its meaning being altered) and would then express a [[Truth|true]] or false proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Blackburn. The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy (2 rev. ed.) Oxford University Press. http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199541430.001.0001/acref-9780199541430-e-3154&lt;/ref&gt; 

Truth-apt sentences are capable of being true or false, unlike questions or commands. Whether [[Paradox|paradoxical sentences]], prescriptions (especially [[Normative#Philosophy|moral claims]]), or attitudes are truth-apt is sometimes controversial.

In [[semantics]] and [[Pragmatics|pragmatics]], a '''truth condition''' is the condition under which a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] is [[wikt:true|true]]. For example, "It is snowing in Nebraska" is true precisely when it is snowing in Nebraska. Truth conditions of a sentence don't necessarily reflect current reality. They are merely the conditions under which the statement would be true.&lt;ref&gt;Birner, Betty J. Introduction to Pragmatics.  2013. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, a truth condition makes for the truth of a sentence in an [[inductive definition]] of truth (for details, see the [[semantic theory of truth]]). Understood this way, truth conditions are [[theoretical entities]]. To illustrate with an example: suppose that, in a particular truth theory&lt;ref&gt;Field, H. (1972). Tarski's Theory of Truth. ''The Journal of Philosophy,'' ''69''(13), 347-375. doi:10.2307/2024879&lt;/ref&gt; which is a theory of truth where truth is somehow made acceptable despite semantic terms as close as possible, the word "Nixon" [[reference|refers]] to [[Richard M. Nixon]], and "is alive" is associated with the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of currently [[Living Thing|living things]]. Then one way of representing the truth condition of "Nixon is alive" is as the [[ordered pair]] &lt;Nixon, {x: x is alive}&gt;. And we say that "Nixon is alive" is true if and only if the referent (or referent of) "Nixon" belongs to the set associated with "is alive", that is, if and only if Nixon is alive.

In [[semantics]], the truth condition of a sentence is almost universally considered distinct from its [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The meaning of a sentence is conveyed if the truth conditions for the sentence are understood. Additionally, there are many sentences that are understood although their truth condition is [[Uncertainty|uncertain]]. One popular argument for this view is that some sentences are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] — that is, they are true whatever happens to obtain. All such sentences have the same truth conditions, but arguably do not thereby have the same meaning. Likewise, the sets {x: x is alive} and {x: x is alive and x is not a rock} are identical — they have precisely the same members — but presumably the sentences "Nixon is alive" and "Nixon is alive and is not a rock" have different meanings.

In the [[social sciences]], '''unintended consequences''' (sometimes '''unanticipated consequences''' or '''unforeseen consequences''') are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/nyregion/robert-k-merton-versatile-sociologist-and-father-of-the-focus-group-dies-at-92.html Robert K. Merton, Versatile Sociologist and Father of the Focus Group, Dies at 92], Michael T. Kaufman, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types:
* ''Unexpected benefit'':  A positive unexpected benefit (also referred to as [[luck]], [[serendipity]] or a [[wikt:windfall|windfall]]).
* ''Unexpected drawback'':  An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy (e.g., while [[irrigation]] schemes provide people with water for agriculture, they can increase [[waterborne diseases]] that have devastating health effects, such as [[schistosomiasis]]).
* ''Perverse result'': A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended (when an intended solution makes a problem worse). This is sometimes referred to as 'backfire'.

==History==
===John Locke===
The idea of ''unintended consequences'' dates back at least to [[John Locke]] who discussed the unintended consequences of [[interest rate]] [[regulation]] in his letter to Sir John Somers, Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/763#lf0128-04_head_002''The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes''], (London: Rivington, 1824 12th ed.). Vol. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Smith===
The idea was also discussed by [[Adam Smith]], the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], and [[consequentialism]] (judging by results).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The Theory of Moral Sentiments|page=93|url=http://metalibri.wikidot.com/title:theory-of-moral-sentiments:smith-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] popularised this concept in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renowned Columbia Sociologist and National Medal of Science Winner Robert K. Merton Dies at 92|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/03/02/robertKMerton.html|publisher=Columbia News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mar03/indextwo.html Robert K. Merton Remembered] Footnotes, American Sociological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merton/&gt;

In "The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action" (1936), Merton tried to apply a systematic analysis to the problem of unintended consequences of deliberate acts intended to cause [[social change]]. He emphasized that his term ''purposive action'', "[was exclusively] concerned with 'conduct' as distinct from 'behavior.' That is, with action that involves motives and consequently a choice between various alternatives".&lt;ref name=Merton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=895|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton's usage included deviations from what [[Max Weber]] defined as rational social action: instrumentally rational and value rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|date=1978|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton also stated that "no blanket statement categorically affirming or denying the practical feasibility of ''all'' social planning is warranted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=904|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everyday usage===
More recently, the ''law of unintended consequences'' has come to be used as an adage or idiomatic warning that an intervention in a [[complex system]] tends to create unanticipated and often undesirable outcomes.&lt;ref name="Norton "&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Norton |first=Rob |editor=[[David R. Henderson]] |encyclopedia=[[Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |title=Unintended Consequences |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html  |year=2008 |edition= 2nd |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0865976658 |oclc=237794267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/mislj71&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/flsulr28&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=28 Florida State University Law Review 2000–2001 Mandatory Minimum Sentences: Exemplifying the Law of Unintended Consequences Comment |publisher=Heinonline.org |date=1993-06-18 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/antil65&amp;div=47&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin to [[Murphy's law]], it is commonly used as a wry or humorous warning against the [[hubris]]tic belief that humans can fully control the world around them.

==Causes==
Possible causes of unintended consequences include the world's inherent [[complexity]] (parts of a system responding to changes in the environment), [[perverse incentive]]s, human [[stupidity]], [[self-deception]], failure to account for human nature, or other [[cognitive bias|cognitive]] or [[emotional bias|emotional]] biases. As a sub-component of complexity (in the scientific sense), the chaotic nature of the universe—and especially its quality of having small, apparently insignificant changes with far-reaching effects (e.g., the [[butterfly effect]])—applies.

[[Robert K. Merton]] listed five possible causes of unanticipated consequences in 1936:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Merton, Robert K|title=On Social Structure and Science|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|year=1996|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo3626245.html|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Ignorance, making it  impossible to anticipate everything, thereby leading to incomplete analysis.
# Errors in analysis of the problem or following habits that worked in the past but may not apply to the current situation.
# Immediate interests overriding long-term interests.
# Basic values which may require or prohibit certain actions even if the long-term result might be unfavourable (these long-term consequences may eventually cause changes in basic values).
# [[Self-defeating prophecy]], or, the fear of some consequence which drives people to find solutions before the problem occurs, thus the non-occurrence of the problem is not anticipated.

In addition to Merton's causes, psychologist Stuart Vyse has noted that [[groupthink]], described by [[Irving Janis]], has been blamed for some decisions that result in unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Can Anything Save Us from Unintended Consequences? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=20-23 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919223200/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/can_anything_save_us_from_unintended_consequences |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of "[[no-man's land]]s" during the [[Cold War]], in places such as the border between Eastern and Western Europe, and the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], has led to large natural habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/from-iron-curtain-to-green-belt-how-new-life-came-to-the-death-strip-1686294.html |title=From Iron Curtain to Green Belt: How new life came to the death strip |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2009-05-17 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kate Connolly |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jul/04/germany-green-line-iron-curtain |title=From Iron Curtain to Green Belt |publisher=Guardian |date=2009-07-04 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europeangreenbelt.org/001.route_ce.html |title=European Green Belt |publisher=European Green Belt |accessdate=2010-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129132357/http://europeangreenbelt.org/001.route_ce.html |archive-date=2010-01-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinking of ships in shallow waters during wartime has created many artificial [[coral reefs]], which can be scientifically valuable and have become an attraction for recreational divers. Retired ships have been purposely sunk in recent years, in an effort to replace coral reefs lost to [[global warming]] and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/dnrnews/pressrelease2008/020708a.html |title=Maryland Artificial Reef Initiative Celebrates 1 Year Anniversary |publisher=Dnr.maryland.gov |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18853363/ |title=Sinking ships will boost tourism, group says&amp;nbsp;– News&amp;nbsp;– msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090921/NATIONAL/709209873/1042/FOREIGN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132717/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090921%2FNATIONAL%2F709209873%2F1042%2FFOREIGN |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-05-09 |title=Life after death on the ocean floor&amp;nbsp;– The National Newspaper |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbs4.com/local/vandenberg.fish.key.2.1250653.html |title=Sea Life Flourishing On Vandenberg Wreck Off Keys |publisher=cbs4.com |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227174325/http://cbs4.com/local/vandenberg.fish.key.2.1250653.html |archivedate=2009-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdnn.info/news/industry/i061227.html |title=CDNN : Diver Wants to Sink Old Navy Ships off California Coast |publisher=Cdnn.info |date=2006-12-27 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], most [[Medication|drugs]] have unintended consequences ('[[side effect]]s') associated with their use. However, some are beneficial. For instance, [[aspirin]], a [[pain reliever]], is also an [[anticoagulant]] that can help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and reduce the severity and damage from [[thrombotic stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=BBC15Feb2001&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1168850.stm |title=BBC 15 February 2001, ''Aspirin heart warning'' |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-02-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of beneficial [[side effect]]s also leads to [[off-label use]]—prescription or use of a drug for an unlicensed purpose. Famously, the drug [[Viagra]] was developed to lower blood pressure, with its use for treating [[erectile dysfunction]] being discovered as a side effect in clinical trials.

The objective of microfinance initiatives is to foster micro-entrepreneurs but an unintended consequence can be informal intermediation: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413_Microfinance_for_poverty_alleviation_Do_transnational_initiatives_overlook_fundamental_questions_of_competition_and_intermediation|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103–117|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] made [[bicycle helmet|safety helmets]] mandatory for all bicycle riders. While there was a reduction in the number of head injuries, there was also an unintended reduction in the number of juvenile cyclists—fewer cyclists obviously leads to fewer injuries, assuming [[Ceteris paribus|all else being equal]]. The risk of death and serious injury per cyclist seems to have increased, possibly due to [[risk compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclehelmets.org/1241.html |title=Evaluating Head Injuries and Helmet Laws in Australia and New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Vulcan, ''et al.'' found that the reduction in juvenile cyclists was because the youths considered wearing a bicycle helmet unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Maxwell H. |last2=Vulcan |first2=A.

[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition in the 1920s United States]], originally enacted to suppress the alcohol trade, drove many small-time alcohol suppliers out of business and consolidated the hold of large-scale [[organized crime]] over the illegal alcohol industry. Since alcohol was still popular, criminal organisations producing alcohol were well-funded and hence also increased their other activities. Similarly, the [[War on Drugs]], intended to suppress the [[illegal drug trade]], instead increased the power and profitability of drug cartels who became the primary source of the products.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Forero, "Colombia's Coca Survives U.S. plan to uproot it", The New York Times, August 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Podesta and Douglas Farah, "Drug Policy in Andes Called Failure," ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 27, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="streatfeild"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dominic Streatfeild |title=Source Material for ''Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography'': Interview between Milton Friedman and Dominic Streatfeild |date=June 2000 |url=http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |publisher=Dominicstratfeild |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113201345/http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |archivedate=2012-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An open letter |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |publisher=Prohibition Costs |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passenger-side [[airbag]]s in motorcars were intended as a safety feature, but led to an increase in child fatalities in the mid-1990s as small children were being hit by deploying airbags during collisions. The supposed solution to this problem, moving the child seat to the back of the vehicle, led to an increase in the number of children forgotten in unattended vehicles, some of whom died under extreme temperature conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/hot-car-death/ |work=Time |first1=Justin |last1=Worland/Ridgefield |title=Who's To Blame For Hot Car Deaths? |date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk compensation, or the [[Risk compensation|Peltzman effect]], occurs after implementation of safety measures intended to reduce injury or death (e.g. bike helmets, seatbelts, etc.). People may feel safer than they really are and take additional risks which they would not have taken without the safety measures in place. This may result in no change, or even an increase, in morbidity or mortality, rather than a decrease as intended.

The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi, [[Cobra effect|offered a bounty for every dead cobra]]. This was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, enterprising people began breeding cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, they scrapped the reward program, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse, becoming known as the [[Cobra effect]].

[[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Theobald Mathew]]'s temperance campaign in 19th-century [[Ireland]] resulted in thousands of people vowing never to drink [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] again. This led to the consumption of [[diethyl ether]], a much more dangerous intoxicant  — due to its high flammability — by those seeking to become intoxicated without breaking the letter of their pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-eth1.htm |title=Etheromaniac |publisher=World Wide Words |date=2006-09-09 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://unintendedconsequenc.es/substitutions-temperance-movement-ether/|title=Substitutions - The Temperance Movement and Ether - Unintended Consequences|date=2018-09-16|work=Unintended Consequences|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was thought that adding south-facing [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatories]] to British houses would reduce energy consumption by providing extra insulation and warmth from the sun. However, people tended to use the conservatories as living areas, installing heating and ultimately increasing overall energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;"Our innate ability to think of new ways to use energy" Professor [[Tadj Oreszczyn]].

A reward for [[ghost net|lost nets]] found along the Normandy coast was offered by the French government between 1980 and 1981.

Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1960s, the Canadian federal government gave the Catholic Church in Quebec $2.25 per day per psychiatric patient for their cost of care, but only $0.75 a day per orphan. The perverse result is that the orphan children were diagnosed as mentally ill so the church could receive the larger amount of money. This psychiatric misdiagnosis affected up to 20,000 people, and the children are known as the [[Duplessis Orphans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 |title=The Spokesman-Review  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 |title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 |title=The Prescott Courier |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental intervention==

Most modern technologies have negative consequences that are both unavoidable and unpredictable. For example, almost all [[environmental problem]]s, from chemical [[pollution]] to [[global warming]], are the unexpected consequences of the application of modern technologies. [[Traffic congestion]], deaths and injuries from car accidents, [[air pollution]], and global warming are unintended consequences of the invention and large scale adoption of the [[automobile]]. [[Hospital infection]]s are the unexpected side-effect of [[antibiotic resistance]], and even [[human overpopulation]] is the side effect of various technological (i.e., [[Agricultural revolution (disambiguation)|agricultural]] and [[industrial revolution|industrial]]) revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|author1=Huesemann, Michael H.|author2=Joyce A.

Because of the complexity of [[ecosystems]], deliberate changes to an ecosystem or other environmental interventions will often have (usually negative) unintended consequences. Sometimes, these effects cause permanent [[irreversible change]]s. Examples include:

* After about 1900, public demand led the US government to fight [[forest fire]]s in the American West, and set aside land as national forests and parks to protect them from fires. This policy led to fewer fires, but also led to growth conditions such that, when fires did occur, they were much larger and more damaging. Modern research suggests that this policy was misguided, and that a certain level of wildfires is a natural and important part of [[forest ecology]].&lt;ref name="How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joyce|first=Christopher|title=How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/23/159373691/how-the-smokey-bear-effect-led-to-raging-wildfires|work=npr.org|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="92404">In the [[foundations of mathematics]], '''von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory''' ('''NBG''') is an [[axiomatic set theory]] that is a [[conservative extension]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC). NBG introduces the [[Primitive notion|notion]] of [[Class (set theory)|class]], which is a collection of [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s defined by a [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] whose [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s range only over sets. NBG can define classes that are larger than sets, such as the class of all sets and the class of all [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s. [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] (MK) allows classes to be defined by formulas whose quantifiers range over classes. NBG is finitely axiomatizable, while ZFC and MK are not.

A key theorem of NBG is the class existence theorem, which states that for every formula whose quantifiers range only over sets, there is a class consisting of the sets satisfying the formula. This class is built by mirroring the step-by-step construction of the formula with classes. Since all set-theoretic formulas are constructed from two kinds of [[atomic formula]]s ([[Membership (set theory)|membership]] and [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]) and finitely many [[logical symbols]], only finitely many [[axiom]]s are needed to build the classes satisfying them. This is why NBG is finitely axiomatizable. Classes are also used for other constructions, for handling the [[Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes|set-theoretic paradoxes]], and for stating the [[axiom of global choice]], which is stronger than ZFC's [[axiom of choice]].

[[John von Neumann]] introduced classes into set theory in 1925. The [[primitive notion]]s of his theory were [[Function (set theory)|function]] and [[Argument of a function|argument]]. Using these notions, he defined class and set.&lt;ref name=VN1925def&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|pp=221&amp;ndash;224, 226, 229}}; English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|pp=396&amp;ndash;398, 400, 403}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bernays]] reformulated von Neumann's theory by taking class and set as primitive notions.&lt;ref name=Bernays1937def&gt;{{harvnb|Bernays|1937}}, pp. 66&amp;ndash;67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Gödel]] simplified Bernays' theory for his [[relative consistency]] proof of the [[axiom of choice]] and the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=Godel1940&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classes in set theory ==
=== The uses of classes ===
Classes have several uses in NBG:
* They produce a finite axiomatization of set theory.
* They are used to state a "very strong form of the [[axiom of choice]]"&lt;ref name=Godelp6&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—namely, the [[axiom of global choice]]: There exists a global choice function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; defined on the class of all nonempty sets such that &lt;math&gt;G(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for every nonempty set &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; This is stronger than ZFC's axiom of choice: For every set &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty sets, there exists a [[choice function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in s.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Axiom of global choice]] explains why it is provably stronger.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes|set-theoretic paradoxes]] are handled by recognizing that some classes cannot be sets. For example, assume that the class &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; of all [[Ordinal number|ordinal]]s is a set. Then &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Transitive (set theory)|transitive]] set [[well-order]]ed by &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;. So, by definition, &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; is an ordinal. Hence, &lt;math&gt;Ord \in Ord&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; being a well-ordering of &lt;math&gt;Ord.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; is not a set. Because a class that is not a set is called a [[proper class]], &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class.
* Proper classes are useful in constructions. In his proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of global choice and the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]], Gödel used proper classes to build the [[constructible universe]]. He constructed a function on the class of all ordinals that, for each ordinal, builds a constructible set by applying a set-building operation to previously constructed sets. The constructible universe is the [[Image (set theory)|image]] of this function.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=35&amp;ndash;38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== Axiom schema versus class existence theorem ===
Once classes are added to the language, it is simple to axiomatize a set theory with classes that is similar to ZFC. First, the [[axiom schema]] of class comprehension is added. This axiom schema states: For every formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; that quantifies only over sets, there exists a class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-[[tuple]]s}} satisfying the formula—that is, &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \cdots \,\forall x_n [(x_1, \ldots , x_n) \in A \iff \phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)].&lt;/math&gt; Then the [[axiom schema of replacement]] is replaced by a [[#NBG's axiom of replacement|single axiom]] that uses a class. Finally, ZFC's [[axiom of extensionality]] is modified to handle classes: If two classes have the same elements, then they are identical. The other axioms of ZFC are not modified.

This theory is not finitely axiomatized. ZFC's replacement schema has been replaced by a single axiom, but the axiom schema of class comprehension has been introduced. 

To produce a theory with finitely many axioms, the axiom schema of class comprehension must be replaced with a class existence theorem that makes the same statement: For every formula that quantifies only over sets, there exists a class of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} satisfying it. The proof of this theorem, which is [[#CET|given below]], requires only finitely many class existence axioms to translate the construction of a formula into a construction of the class satisfying the formula.

== Axiomatization of NBG ==
=== Classes and sets ===
NBG has two types of objects: classes and sets. Intuitively, every set is also a class. There are two ways to axiomatize this. Bernays used [[First-order_logic#Many-sorted_logic|many-sorted logic]] with two sorts: classes and sets. Gödel avoided sorts by introducing primitive predicates: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Cls}(A)&lt;/math&gt; for "&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a class" and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}(A)&lt;/math&gt; for "&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set" (in German, "set" is ''Menge''). He also introduced axioms stating that every set is a class and that if class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a member of a class, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set.&lt;ref name=Godel1940p3&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Using predicates is the standard way to eliminate sorts. [[Elliott Mendelson]] modified Gödel's approach by having everything be a class and defining the set predicate &lt;math&gt;M(A)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\exists C(A \in C).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mendelson|1997|pp=225&amp;ndash;226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This modification eliminates Gödel's class predicate and his two axioms.

Bernays' two-sorted approach may appear more natural at first, but it creates a more complex theory.{{efn|The historical development suggests that the two-sorted approach does appear more natural at first. In introducing his theory, Bernays stated: "According to the leading idea of von Neumann set theory we have to deal with two kinds of individuals, which we may distinguish as ''sets'' and ''classes''." {{harv|Bernays|1937|p=66.}}}} In Bernays' theory, every set has two representations: one as a set and the other as a class. Also, there are two [[membership relation]]s: the first, denoted by "∈", is between two sets; the second, denoted by "η", is between a set and a class. This redundancy is required by many-sorted logic because variables of different sorts range over disjoint subdomains of the [[domain of discourse]].

The differences between these two approaches does not affect what can be proved, but it does affect how statements are written. In Gödel's approach, &lt;math&gt;A \in C&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are classes is a valid statement. In Bernays' approach this statement has no meaning. However, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set, there is an equivalent statement: Define "set &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; represents class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;" if they have the same sets as members—that is, &lt;math&gt;\forall x(x \in a \iff x \;\eta \;A).&lt;/math&gt; The statement &lt;math&gt;a \;\eta \;C&lt;/math&gt; where set &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; represents class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to Gödel's &lt;math&gt;A \in C.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernays1937def /&gt;

The approach adopted in this article is that of Gödel with Mendelson's modification. This means that NBG is a [[axiomatic system]] in [[first-order predicate logic]] with [[Equality in set theory|equality]], and its only [[primitive notion]]s are class and the membership relation.

=== Definitions and axioms of extensionality and pairing ===
A set is a class that belongs to at least one class: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set if and only if &lt;math&gt;\exist C(A \in C)&lt;/math&gt;.
A class that is not a set is called a proper class: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall C(A \notin C)&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, every class is either a set or a proper class, and no class is both (if the theory is [[consistent]]).

Gödel introduced the convention that uppercase variables range over classes, while lowercase variables range over sets.&lt;ref name=Godel1940p3 /&gt; Gödel also used names that begin with an uppercase letter to denote particular classes, including functions and [[relation (math)|relation]]s defined on the class of all sets. Gödel's convention is used in this article. It allows us to write:
{{plainlist|indent=1}}
* &lt;math&gt;\exist x\, \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\exist x \bigl(\exist C (x \in C) \land \phi(x)\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x\, \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\forall x \bigl(\exist C (x \in C) \implies \phi(x)\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
{{endplainlist}}

The following axioms and definitions are needed for the proof of the class existence theorem.

'''Axiom of extensionality.{{space|thin}}''' If two classes have the same elements, then they are identical.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\forall B \,[\forall x(x \in A \iff x \in B) \implies A = B]&lt;/math&gt;

This axiom generalizes ZFC's [[axiom of extensionality]] to classes. 

'''[[Axiom of pairing]].{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are sets, then there exists a set &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; whose only members are &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \,\forall y \,\exists p \,\forall z \,[z \in p \iff (z = x \,\lor\, z = y)]&lt;/math&gt;

As in ZFC, the axiom of extensionality implies the uniqueness of the set &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, which allows us to introduce the notation &lt;math&gt;\{x, y\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[Ordered pair]]s are defined by: 
:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) = \{\{x\}, \{x, y\}\}&lt;/math&gt;
Tuples are defined [[Inductive definition|inductive]]ly using ordered pairs:
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1) = x_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{For } n &gt; 1\!: (x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n) = ((x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}), x_n)&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|Gödel defined &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = (x_1, (x_2, \ldots, x_n)).&lt;/math&gt; This affects the statements of some of his definitions, axioms, and theorems. This article uses Mendelson's definition. ({{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Mendelson|1997|p=230}}.)}}

=== Class existence axioms and axiom of regularity ===
The class existence axioms will be used to prove the class existence theorem: For every formula in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; [[free variable|free set variable]]s that quantifies only over sets, there exists a class of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} that satisfy it. The following example starts with two classes that are [[Function (set theory)|function]]s and builds a [[composite function]]. This example illustrates the techniques used to prove the class existence theorem, and hence the types of class existence axioms that are needed.

{{Anchor|Ex1}}
:{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top; style="background: white" 
|'''Example 1:{{space|thin}}''' If the classes &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are functions, then the composite function &lt;math&gt;G \circ F&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the formula: &lt;math&gt;\exists t[(x, t) \in F \,\land\, (t, y) \in G].&lt;/math&gt; Since this formula has two free set variables, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y,&lt;/math&gt; the class existence theorem constructs the class of ordered pairs: &lt;math&gt;G \circ F\,=\,\{(x, y): \exists t[(x, t) \in F \,\land\, (t, y) \in G]\}.&lt;/math&gt; 

Because this formula is built from simpler formulas using [[Conjunction (logic)|conjunction]] &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; and [[existential quantification]] &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, class [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]]s are needed that take classes representing the simpler formulas and produce classes representing the formulas with &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;. To produce a class representing a formula with &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;, [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] used since &lt;math&gt;x \in A \cap B \iff x \in A \land x \in B.&lt;/math&gt; To produce a class representing a formula with &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Domain of a relation|domain]] is used since &lt;math&gt;x \in Dom(A) \iff \exists t[(x,t) \in A].&lt;/math&gt;

Before taking the intersection, the tuples in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; need an extra component so they have the same variables. The component &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is added to the tuples of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is added to the tuples of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;: 
:&lt;math&gt;F' = \{(x, t, y): (x, t) \in F\}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,G' = \{(t, y, x): (t, y) \in G\}&lt;/math&gt; 
In the definition of &lt;math&gt;F',&lt;/math&gt; the variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not restricted by the statement &lt;math&gt;(x, t) \in F,&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; ranges over the class &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of all sets. Similarly, in the definition of &lt;math&gt;G',&lt;/math&gt; the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ranges over &lt;math&gt;V.&lt;/math&gt; So an axiom is needed that adds an extra component (whose values range over &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) to the tuples of a given class.

Next, the variables are put in the same order to prepare for the intersection: 
:&lt;math&gt;F'' = \{(x, y, t): (x, t) \in F\}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,G'' = \{(x, y, t): (t, y) \in G\}&lt;/math&gt;
To go from &lt;math&gt;F'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;F''&lt;/math&gt; and from &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G''&lt;/math&gt; requires two different [[permutation]]s, so axioms that support permutations of tuple components are needed.

The intersection of &lt;math&gt;F''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G''&lt;/math&gt; handles &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;F'' \cap G'' = \{(x, y, t): (x, t) \in F \,\land\, (y, t) \in G\}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;(x, y, t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;((x, y), t)&lt;/math&gt;, taking the domain of &lt;math&gt;F'' \cap G''&lt;/math&gt; handles &lt;math&gt;\exists t&lt;/math&gt; and produces the composite function:
:&lt;math&gt;G \circ F = Dom(F'' \cap G'') = \{(x, y): \exists t ((x, t) \in F \,\land\, (t, y) \in G)\}&lt;/math&gt;
So axioms of intersection and domain are needed.

The class existence axioms are divided into two groups: axioms handling language primitives and axioms handling tuples. There are four axioms in the first group and three axioms in the second group.{{efn|Bernays' class existence axioms specify unique classes. Gödel weakened all but three of Bernays' axioms (intersection, complement, domain) by replacing [[biconditional]]s with [[Material conditional|implication]]s, which means they specify only the ordered pairs or the 3-tuples of the class. The axioms in this section are Gödel's except for Bernays' stronger [[#Product by V axiom|product by V axiom]], which specifies a unique class of ordered pairs. Bernays' axiom simplifies the proof of the [[#CET|class existence theorem]]. Gödel's axiom B6 appears as the fourth statement of the [[#Tuple lemma|tuple lemma]]. Bernays later realized that one of his axioms is redundant, which implies that one of Gödel's axioms is redundant. Using the other axioms, axiom B6 can be proved from axiom B8, and B8 can be proved from B6, so either axiom can be considered the redundant axiom. ({{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=56}}; {{harvnb|Bernays|1937|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=5, 9}}; {{harvnb|Mendelson|1997|p=231}}.) The names for the tuple-handling axioms are from the French Wikipédia article: [[:fr:Théorie des ensembles de von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel#Compréhension pour les classes|Théorie des ensembles de von Neumann]].}}

'''Axioms for handling language primitives:'''

'''Membership.{{space|thin}}''' There exists a class &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; containing all the ordered pairs whose first component is a member of the second component.
:&lt;math&gt;\exists E \,\forall x \,\forall y \,[(x,y) \in E \iff x \in y]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Intersection (conjunction).{{space|thin}}''' For any two classes &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; consisting precisely of the sets that belong to both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\forall B \,\exists C \,\forall x \,[x \in C \iff (x \in A \,\land\, x \in B)]&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Complement (set theory)|Complement]] (negation).{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; consisting precisely of the sets not belonging to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall x \,[x \in B \iff \neg(x \in A)]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Domain (existential quantifier).{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; consisting precisely of the first components of the ordered pairs of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall x \,[x \in B \iff \exists y((x,y) \in A)]&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

By the axiom of extensionality, class &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in the intersection axiom and class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in the complement and domain axioms are unique. They will be denoted by: &lt;math&gt;A \cap B,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\complement A,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Dom(A),&lt;/math&gt; respectively.{{efn|name=Bourbaki|This article uses [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]'s complement notation &lt;math&gt;\complement A&lt;/math&gt; and relative complement notation &lt;math&gt;\complement_X A = \complement_A \cap X&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Bourbaki|2004|p=71}}. This prefix relative complement notation is used by the class existence theorem to [[#Mirror|mirror]] the prefix logical not (&lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;).}} On the other hand, extensionality is not applicable to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in the membership axiom since it specifies only those sets in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; that are ordered pairs.   

{{Anchor|Empty class}}The first three axioms imply the existence of the empty class and the class of all sets: The membership axiom implies the existence of a class &lt;math&gt;E.&lt;/math&gt; The intersection and complement axioms imply the existence of &lt;math&gt;E \cap \complement E&lt;/math&gt;, which is empty. By the axiom of extensionality, this class is unique; it is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\empty.&lt;/math&gt; The complement of &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; is the class &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;of all sets, which is also unique by extensionality. The set predicate &lt;math&gt;M(A)&lt;/math&gt;, which was defined as &lt;math&gt;\exists C(A \in C)&lt;/math&gt;, is now redefined as &lt;math&gt;A \in V&lt;/math&gt; to avoid quantifying over classes.

'''Axioms for handling tuples:'''

{{Anchor|Product by V axiom}}'''[[Cartesian product|Product]] by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; consisting precisely of the ordered pairs whose first component belongs to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall u \,[u \in B \iff \exists x \, \exists y \,(u = (x, y) \land x \in A)]&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Circular permutation]].{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; whose 3{{nbhyph}}tuples are obtained by applying the circular permutation &lt;math&gt;(y,z,x) \mapsto (x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; to the 3{{nbhyph}}tuples of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall x \,\forall y \,\forall z \,[(x,y,z) \in B \iff (y,z,x) \in A]&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Transposition (mathematics)|Transposition]].{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; whose 3{{nbhyph}}tuples are obtained by transposing the last two components of the 3{{nbhyph}}tuples of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall x \,\forall y \,\forall z \,[(x,y,z) \in B \iff (x,z,y) \in A]&lt;/math&gt;

By extensionality, the product by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; axiom implies the existence of a unique class, which is denoted by &lt;math&gt;A \times V.&lt;/math&gt; This axiom is used to define the class &lt;math&gt;V^n&lt;/math&gt; of all {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}}: &lt;math&gt;V^1 = V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V^{n+1} = V^n \times V.\,&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a class, extensionality implies that &lt;math&gt;A \cap V^n&lt;/math&gt; is the unique class consisting of the {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} of &lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt; For example, the membership axiom produces a class &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; that may contain elements that are not ordered pairs, while the intersection &lt;math&gt;E \cap V^2&lt;/math&gt; contains only the ordered pairs of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

The circular permutation and transposition axioms do not imply the existence of unique classes because they specify only the 3{{nbhyph}}tuples of class &lt;math&gt;B.&lt;/math&gt; By specifying the 3{{nbhyph}}tuples, these axioms also specify the {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} for &lt;math&gt;n \ge 4&lt;/math&gt; since: &lt;math&gt;(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-2}, x_{n-1}, x_n) = ((x_1, \ldots, x_{n-2}), x_{n-1}, x_n).&lt;/math&gt; The axioms for handling tuples and the domain axiom imply the following lemma, which is used in the proof of the class existence theorem.

{{Anchor|Tuple lemma}}'''Tuple lemma.'''

One more axiom is needed to prove the class existence theorem: the [[axiom of regularity]]. Since the existence of the empty class has been proved, the usual statement of this axiom is given.{{efn|Since Gödel states this axiom before he proves the existence of the empty class, he states it without using the empty class {{harv|Gödel|1940|p=6}}.}}

{{Anchor|Axiom of regularity}}'''Axiom of regularity.{{space|thin}}''' Every nonempty set has at least one element with which it has no element in common.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a\,[a \neq \empty \implies \exists u(u \in a \land u \cap a = \empty)].&lt;/math&gt;

This axiom implies that a set cannot belong to itself: Assume that &lt;math&gt;x \in x&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;a = \{x\}.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x \cap a \ne \empty&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;x \in x \cap a.&lt;/math&gt; This contradicts the axiom of regularity because &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the only element in &lt;math&gt;a.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x \notin x.&lt;/math&gt; The axiom of regularity also prohibits infinite descending membership sequences: &lt;math&gt;\;\;\cdots \in x_{n+1} \in x_n \in \cdots \in x_1 \in x_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Gödel stated regularity for classes rather than for sets in his 1940 monograph, which was based on lectures given in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Kanamori|2012|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he proved that regularity for sets implies regularity for classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|2003|p=121}}. Both references contain Gödel's proof but Kanamori is easier to follow since he uses modern terminology.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Class existence theorem ===
{{Anchor|CET}}'''Class existence theorem.{{space|thin}}''' Let &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)&lt;/math&gt; be a formula that quantifies only over sets and contains no [[free variable]]s other than &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily all of these). Then for all &lt;math&gt;Y_1, \dots, Y_m&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} such that: &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \cdots \,\forall x_n [(x_1, \dots , x_n) \in A \iff \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)].&lt;/math&gt; The class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{(x_1, \dots , x_n): \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)\}.&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|The proofs in this and the next section come from Gödel's proofs, which he gave at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] where he "could count upon an audience well versed in [[mathematical logic]]" {{harv|Dawson|1997|p=134}}. To make Gödel's proofs more accessible to Wikipedia readers, a few modifications have been made. The goal in this and the next section is to prove Gödel's M4, his fourth class existence theorem. The proof in this section mostly follows the M1 proof {{harv|Gödel|1940|pp=8&amp;ndash;11}}, but it also uses techniques from the M3 and M4 proofs. The theorem is stated with class variables rather than M1's symbols for special classes (universal quantification over the class variables is equivalent to being true for any instantiation of the class variables). The major differences from the M1 proof are: unique classes of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} are generated at the end of the basis and inductive steps (which require Bernays' stronger product by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; axiom), and [[bound variable]]s are replaced by subscripted variables that continue the numbering of the free set variables. Since bound variables are free for part of the induction, this guarantees that, when they are free, they are treated the same as the original free variables. One of the benefits of this proof is the [[#Mirror|example output]] of the function Class, which shows that a class's construction mirrors its defining formula's construction.}}

The theorem's proof will be done in two steps:
# Transformation rules are used to transform the given formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; into a [[logically equivalent|equivalent]] formula that simplifies the [[Mathematical induction|inductive]] part of the proof. For example, the only logical symbols in the transformed formula are &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, so the induction handles logical symbols with just three cases.  
# The class existence theorem is proved inductively for transformed formulas. Guided by the structure of the transformed formula, the class existence axioms are used to produce the unique class of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} satisfying the formula.

'''Transformation rules.{{space|thin}}''' In rules 1 and 2, &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; denote set or class variables. These two rules eliminate all occurrences of class variables before an &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; and all occurrences of equality. Each time rule 1 or 2 is applied to a subformula, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; differs from the other variables in the current formula. The three rules are repeated until there are no subformulas to which they can be applied. This produces a formula that is built only with &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, set variables, and class variables &lt;math&gt;Y_k&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Y_k&lt;/math&gt; does not appear before an &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;.

# &lt;math&gt;\,Y_k \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is transformed into &lt;math&gt;\exists z_i(z_i = Y_k \,\land\, z_i \in \Gamma).&lt;/math&gt;
# Extensionality is used to transform &lt;math&gt;\Delta = \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\forall z_i(z_i \in \Delta \iff z_i \in \Gamma).&lt;/math&gt; 
# Logical identities are used to transform subformulas containing &lt;math&gt;\lor, \implies, \iff,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; to subformulas that only use &lt;math&gt;\neg, \land,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Transformation rules: [[bound variables]].{{space|thin}}''' Consider the composite function formula of [[#Ex1|example 1]] with its free set variables replaced by &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\exists t[(x_1, t) \in F \,\land\, (t, x_2) \in G].&lt;/math&gt; The inductive proof will remove &lt;math&gt;\exists t&lt;/math&gt;, which produces the formula &lt;math&gt;(x_1, t) \in F \land (t, x_2) \in G.&lt;/math&gt; However, since the class existence theorem is stated for subscripted variables, this formula does not have the form expected by the [[induction hypothesis]]. This problem is solved by replacing the variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_3.&lt;/math&gt; Bound variables within nested quantifiers are handled by increasing the subscript by one for each successive quantifier. This leads to rule 4, which must be applied after the other rules since rules 1 and 2 produce quantified variables.

# &lt;li value="4"&gt;If a formula contains no free set variables other than &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n,&lt;/math&gt; then bound variables that are nested within &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; quantifiers are replaced with {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;x_{n+q}&lt;/math&gt;.}} These variables have ''(quantifier) nesting depth'' &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

|'''Example 2:''' {{space|thin}}Rule 4 is applied to the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1)&lt;/math&gt; that defines the class consisting of all sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\{\empty, \{\empty, \dots\}, \dots\}.&lt;/math&gt; That is, sets that contain at least &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; and a set containing &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; — for example, &lt;math&gt;\{\empty, \{\empty, a, b, c\}, d, e\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a, b, c, d,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; are sets.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\phi(x_1) \,&amp;=\, \exists u\;\,[\,u \in x_1 \,\land\, \neg\exists v\;\,(\;v\, \in \,u\,)] \,\land\, \,\exists w\;\bigl(w \in x_1 \,\land\, \exists y\;\,[(\;y\, \in w \;\land\; \neg\exists z\;\,(\;z\, \in \,y\,)]\bigr) \\
\phi_r(x_1) \,&amp;=\, \exists x_2[x_2 \!\in\! x_1 \,\land\, \neg\exists x_3(x_3 \!\in\! x_2)] \,\land\, \,\exists x_2\bigl(x_2 \!\in\! x_1 \,\land\, \exists x_3[(x_3 \!\in\! x_2 \,\land\, \neg\exists x_4(x_4 \!\in\! x_3)]\bigr)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is the only free variable, &lt;math&gt;n = 1.&lt;/math&gt; The quantified variable &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; appears twice in &lt;math&gt;x_3 \in x_2&lt;/math&gt; at nesting depth 2. Its subscript is 3 because &lt;math&gt;n+q=1+2=3.&lt;/math&gt; If two quantifier scopes are at the same nesting depth, they are either identical or disjoint. The two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; are in disjoint quantifier scopes, so they do not interact with each other.

'''Proof of the class existence theorem.{{space|thin}}''' The proof starts by applying the transformation rules to the given formula to produce a transformed formula. Since this formula is equivalent to the given formula, the proof is completed by proving the class existence theorem for transformed formulas.

Gödel pointed out that the class existence theorem "is a [[metatheorem]], that is, a theorem about the system [NBG], not in the system …"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theorem about NBG because it is proved in the [[metatheory]] by induction on NBG formulas. Also, its proof—instead of invoking finitely many NBG axioms—inductively describes how to use NBG axioms to construct a class satisfying a given formula. For every formula, this description can be turned into a constructive existence proof that is in NBG. Therefore, this metatheorem can generate infinitely many NBG proofs.

A [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] [[computer program]] succinctly captures the construction of a class from a given formula. The definition of this program does not depend on the proof of the class existence theorem. However, this proof is needed to prove that the class constructed by the program satisfies the given formula and is built using the axioms. This program is written in [[pseudocode]] that uses a [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-style [[case statement]].{{efn|Recursive computer programs written in pseudocode have been used elsewhere in [[pure mathematics]]. For example, they have been used to prove the [[Heine-Borel theorem]] and other theorems of [[Analysis (math)|analysis]] {{harv|Gray|1991}}.}}

=== Extending the class existence theorem ===
Gödel extended the class existence theorem to formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; containing [[Finitary relation|relation]]s over classes (such as &lt;math&gt;Y_1 \subseteq Y_2&lt;/math&gt; and the [[unary relation]] &lt;math&gt;M(Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;), special classes (such as &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt;{{space|hair|2}}), and [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s (such as &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_1 \cap Y_1&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=11&amp;ndash;13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To extend the class existence theorem, the formulas defining relations, special classes, and operations must quantify only over sets. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be transformed into an equivalent formula satisfying the [[#CET|hypothesis of the class existence theorem]].

The following definitions specify how formulas define relations, special classes, and operations:
# A relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is defined by: &lt;math&gt;R(Z_1, \dots, Z_k) \iff \psi_R(Z_1, \dots, Z_k).&lt;/math&gt;
# A special class &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is defined by: &lt;math&gt;u \in  C \iff \psi_C(u).&lt;/math&gt;
# An operation &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined by: &lt;math&gt;u \in P(Z_1, \dots, Z_k) \iff \psi_P(u, Z_1, \dots, Z_k).&lt;/math&gt;

A {{em|[[Term (logic)|term]]}} is defined by:
# Variables and special classes are terms.
# If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is an operation with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; arguments and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1, \dots, \Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; are terms, then &lt;math&gt;P(\Gamma_1, \dots, \Gamma_k)&lt;/math&gt; is a term. 

The following transformation rules eliminate relations, special classes, and operations. Each time rule 2b, 3b, or 4 is applied to a subformula, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; differs from the other variables in the current formula. The rules are repeated until there are no subformulas to which they can be applied. &lt;math&gt;\, \Gamma_1, \dots, \Gamma_k, \Gamma,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; denote terms.

'''Class existence theorem (extended version).{{space|thin}}''' Let &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)&lt;/math&gt; be a formula that quantifies only over sets, contains no free variables other than &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n,  Y_1, \dots, Y_m&lt;/math&gt;, and may contain relations, special classes, and operations defined by formulas that quantify only over sets. Then for all &lt;math&gt;Y_1, \dots, Y_m,&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} such that &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \cdots \,\forall x_n [(x_1, \dots , x_n) \in A \iff \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)].&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|This theorem is Gödel's theorem M4. He proved it by first proving M1, a class existence theorem that uses symbols for special classes rather than free class variables.

Theorem M2 extends this theorem to formulas containing relations, special classes, and operations. Theorem M3 is obtained from M2 by replacing the symbols for special classes with free variables. Gödel used M3 to define &lt;math&gt;A \times B = \{x: \exists y \exists z[x = (y, z) \land y \in A \land z \in B]\},&lt;/math&gt; which is unique by extensionality.

Gödel's approach, especially his use of M3 to define &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt;, eliminates the need for Bernays' stronger form of the product by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; axiom. {{harv|Gödel|1940|pp=8&amp;ndash;15.}}}}

'''Proof:{{space|thin}}''' Apply the transformation rules to &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; to produce an equivalent formula containing no relations, special classes, or operations. This formula satisfies the hypothesis of the class existence theorem. Therefore, for all &lt;math&gt;Y_1, \dots, Y_m,&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} satisfying &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \cdots \,\forall x_n [(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in A \iff \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)].&lt;/math&gt;

=== Set axioms ===
The axioms of pairing and regularity, which were needed for the proof of the class existence theorem, have been given above. NBG contains four other set axioms. Three of these axioms deal with class operations being applied to sets.

'''Definition.{{space|thin}}''' &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Function (set theory)|function]] if &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq V^2 \land \forall x\, \forall y\, \forall z\, [(x,y) \in F \,\land\, (x,z) \in F \implies y = z].&lt;/math&gt;

In set theory, the definition of a function does not require specifying the domain or codomain of the function (see [[Function (set theory)]]). NBG's definition of function generalizes ZFC's definition from a set of ordered pairs to a class of ordered pairs. 

ZFC's definitions of the set operations: [[Image (set theory)|image]], [[Union (set theory)|union]], and [[power set]] are also generalized to class operations. The image of class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; under the function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;F[A] = \{y: \exists x(x \in A \,\land\, (x, y) \in F)\}.&lt;/math&gt; This definition does not require that &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Dom(F).&lt;/math&gt; The union of class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\cup A = \{x: \exists y(x \in y\, \,\land\, y \in A)\}.&lt;/math&gt; The power class of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(A) = \{x: x \subseteq A\}.&lt;/math&gt; The extended version of the class existence theorem implies the existence of these classes. The axioms of replacement, [[Axiom of union|union]], and [[Axiom of power set|power set]] imply that when these operations are applied to sets, they produce sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=16&amp;ndash;18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|NBG's axiom of replacement}}'''Axiom of replacement.{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a function and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then &lt;math&gt;F[a]&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Image (set theory)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, is a set.

Not having the requirement &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Dom(F)&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of &lt;math&gt;F[A]&lt;/math&gt; produces a stronger axiom of replacement, which is used in the following proof.
 
{{Anchor|NBG's axiom of separation}}'''Theorem (NBG's [[axiom of separation]]).{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a subclass of &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a set. &lt;br&gt;
'''Proof:{{space|thin}}''' The class existence theorem constructs the [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of the [[identity function]] to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;I{\restriction_B} = \{(x_1, x_2): x_1 \in B \land x_2 = x_1\}.&lt;/math&gt; Since the image of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;I{\restriction_B}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, the axiom of replacement implies that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a set. This proof depends on the definition of image not having the requirement &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Dom(F)&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;Dom(I{\restriction_B}) = B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Dom(I{\restriction_B}).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Axiom of union.{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then there is a set containing &lt;math&gt;\cup a.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a\, \exists b\, \forall x\,[\,\exists y(x \in y\, \,\land\, y \in a) \implies x \in b\,].&lt;/math&gt;

'''Axiom of power set.{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then there is a set containing &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(a).&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a\, \exists b\, \forall x\, (x \subseteq a \implies x \in b).&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|Gödel weakened Bernays' axioms of union and power set, which state the existence of these sets, to the above axioms that state there is a set containing the union and a set containing the power set ({{harvnb|Bernays|1941|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=5}}). Bernays published his axioms after Gödel, but had sent them to Gödel in 1931 ({{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|2003|p=104&amp;ndash;115}}).}}

'''Theorem.{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then &lt;math&gt;\cup a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(a)&lt;/math&gt; are sets.&lt;br&gt;
'''Proof:{{space|thin}}''' The axiom of union states that &lt;math&gt;\cup a&lt;/math&gt; is a subclass of a set &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, so the axiom of separation implies &lt;math&gt;\cup a&lt;/math&gt; is a set. Likewise, the axiom of power set states that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(a)&lt;/math&gt; is a subclass of a set &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, so the axiom of separation implies that  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(a)&lt;/math&gt; is a set.

'''Axiom of infinity.{{space|thin}}''' There exists a nonempty set &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\exists a\, [\exists u(u \in a) \,\land\, \forall x(x \in a \implies \exists y(y \in a \,\land\, x \subset y))].&lt;/math&gt;

The axioms of infinity and replacement prove the existence of the [[empty set]]. In the [[#Empty class|discussion of the class existence axioms]], the existence of the empty class &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; was proved. We now prove that &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; is a set. Let function &lt;math&gt;F = \empty&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be the set given by the axiom of infinity. By replacement, the image of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, which equals &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;, is a set.

NBG's axiom of infinity is implied by ZFC's [[axiom of infinity]]: &lt;math&gt;\,\exists a\, [\empty \in a \,\land\, \forall x(x \in a \implies x \cup \{x\} \in a)].\,&lt;/math&gt; The first [[Conjunct (logic)|conjunct]] of ZFC's axiom, &lt;math&gt;\empty \in a&lt;/math&gt;, implies the first conjunct of NBG's axiom. The second conjunct of ZFC's axiom, &lt;math&gt;\forall x(x \in a \implies x \cup \{x\} \in a)&lt;/math&gt;, implies the second conjunct of NBG's axiom since &lt;math&gt;x \subset x \cup \{x\}.&lt;/math&gt; To prove ZFC's axiom of infinity from NBG's axiom of infinity requires some of the other NBG axioms (see [[Weak axiom of infinity]]).{{efn|Since ZFC's axiom requires the existence of the empty set, an advantage of NBG's axiom is that the axiom of the empty set is not needed. Mendelson's axiom system uses the ZFC's axiom of infinity and also has the axiom of the empty set {{harv|Mendelson|1997|pp=228, 239}}.}}

=== Axiom of global choice ===
The class concept allows NBG to have a stronger axiom of choice than ZFC. A [[choice function]] is a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, defined on a set &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty sets, such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in s.&lt;/math&gt; ZFC's axiom of choice states that for every set of nonempty sets, there exists a choice function. A global choice function is a function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; defined on the class of all nonempty sets such that &lt;math&gt;G(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for every nonempty set &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; The axiom of global choice states that there exists a global choice function. This axiom implies ZFC's axiom of choice since for every set &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty sets, &lt;math&gt;G\vert_s&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;) is a choice function for &lt;math&gt;s.&lt;/math&gt; In 1964, [[William Bigelow Easton|William B. Easton]] proved that global choice is stronger than the axiom of choice by using [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] to construct a [[Model (mathematical logic)|model]] that satisfies the axiom of choice and all the axioms of NBG except the axiom of global choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Easton|1964|pp=56a&amp;ndash;64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The axiom of global choice is equivalent to every class having a well-ordering, while ZFC's axiom of choice is equivalent to every set having a well-ordering.{{efn|For &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; having a well-ordering implying global choice, see [[Implications of the axiom of limitation of size]]. For global choice implying the well-ordering of any class, see {{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=53}}.}}

==History==
[[File:NBG Evolution svg.svg|thumb|400px|History of approaches that led to NBG set theory]]
=== Von Neumann's 1925 axiom system ===
Von Neumann published an introductory article on his axiom system in 1925. In 1928, he provided a detailed treatment of his system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925}}, {{harvnb|von Neumann|1928}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann based his axiom system on two domains of [[Primitive notion|primitive]] objects: functions and arguments. These domains overlap—objects that are in both domains are called argument-functions. Functions correspond to classes in NBG, and argument-functions correspond to sets. Von Neumann's primitive operation is [[function application]], denoted by [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''x''] rather than ''a''(''x'') where ''a'' is a function and ''x'' is an argument. This operation produces an argument. Von Neumann defined classes and sets using functions and argument-functions that take only two values, ''A'' and ''B''. He defined ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''a'' if [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''x'']&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''A''.&lt;ref name=VN1925def /&gt;

Von Neumann's work in set theory was influenced by [[Georg Cantor]]'s articles, [[Zermelo set theory|Ernst Zermelo's 1908 axioms for set theory]], and the 1922 critiques of [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]]'s set theory that were given independently by [[Abraham Fraenkel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]]. Both Fraenkel and Skolem pointed out that Zermelo's axioms cannot prove the existence of the set {''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...} where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of [[natural number]]s and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[power set]] of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. They then introduced the axiom of replacement, which would guarantee the existence of such sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|p=369}}. In 1917, [[Dmitry Mirimanoff]] published a form of replacement based on cardinal equivalence {{harv|Mirimanoff|1917|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were reluctant to adopt this axiom: Fraenkel stated "that Replacement was too strong an axiom for 'general set theory'", while "Skolem only wrote that 'we could introduce' Replacement".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2012|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann worked on the problems of [[Zermelo set theory]] and provided solutions for some of them:
* '''A theory of ordinals''' 
** Problem: Cantor's theory of [[ordinal number]]s cannot be developed in Zermelo set theory because it lacks the axiom of replacement.{{efn|name=ordinaltheorem|In 1928, von Neumann stated: "A treatment of ordinal number closely related to mine was known to Zermelo in 1916, as I learned subsequently from a personal communication. Nevertheless, the fundamental theorem, according to which to each well-ordered set there is a similar ordinal, could not be rigorously proved because the replacement axiom was unknown." {{harv|Hallett|1984|p=280.}}}} 
** Solution: Von Neumann recovered Cantor's theory by defining the ordinals using sets that are [[well-ordered]] by the ∈-relation,{{efn|{{harvnb|von Neumann|1923}}. Von Neumann's definition also used the theory of well-ordered sets. Later, his definition was simplified to the current one: An ordinal is a [[transitive set]] that is well-ordered by ∈ {{harv|Kunen|1980|p=16}}.}} and by using the axiom of replacement to prove key theorems about the ordinals, such as every well-ordered set is [[order-isomorphic]] with an ordinal.{{efn|name=ordinaltheorem}} In contrast to Fraenkel and Skolem, von Neumann emphasized how important the replacement axiom is for set theory: "In fact, I believe that no theory of ordinals is possible at all without this axiom."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|p=223}} (footnote); English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|p=398 (footnote)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''A criterion identifying classes that are too large to be sets''' 
** Problem: Zermelo did not provide such a criterion. His set theory avoids the large classes that lead to the [[Georg Cantor#Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes|paradoxes]], but it leaves out many sets, such as the one mentioned by Fraenkel and Skolem.{{efn|After introducing the [[cumulative hierarchy]], von Neumann could show that Zermelo's axioms do not prove the existence of ordinals α&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ω, which include uncountably many [[hereditarily countable set]]s. This follows from Skolem's result that V&lt;sub&gt;ω+ω&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies Zermelo's axioms {{harv|Kanamori|2012|p=61}} and from α&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; implying α&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β {{harv|Kunen|1980|pp=95&amp;ndash;96}}. Kunen uses the notation R(β) instead of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;.}} 
** Solution: Von Neumann introduced the criterion: A class is too large to be a set if and only if it can be mapped [[onto]] the class ''V'' of all sets. Von Neumann realized that the set-theoretic paradoxes could be avoided by not allowing such large classes to be members of any class. Combining this restriction with his criterion, he obtained his [[axiom of limitation of size]]: A class ''C'' is not a member of any class if and only if ''C'' can be mapped onto ''V''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallett|1984|pp=288&amp;ndash;290}}. Von Neumann stated his axiom in an equivalent functional form ({{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|p=225}}; English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|p=400}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Finite axiomatization''' 
** Problem: Zermelo had used the imprecise concept of "definite [[propositional function]]" in [[Zermelo set theory#The axioms of Zermelo set theory|his axiom of separation]].
** Solutions: Skolem introduced the [[axiom schema of separation]] that was later used in ZFC, and Fraenkel introduced an equivalent solution. However, Zermelo rejected both approaches "particularly because they implicitly involve the concept of natural number which, in Zermelo's view, should be based upon set theory."{{efn|Fraenkel, ''Historical Introduction'' in {{harvnb|Bernays|1991|p=13}}. Skolem's approach implicitly involves natural numbers because the formulas of an axiom schema are built using [[structural recursion]], which is a generalization of [[mathematical recursion]] over the natural numbers.}} Von Neumann avoided [[axiom schema]]s by formalizing the concept of "definite propositional function" with his functions, whose construction requires only finitely many axioms. This led to his set theory having finitely many axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|pp=224&amp;ndash;226}}; English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|pp=399&amp;ndash;401}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[Richard Montague]] proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Montague|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The axiom of regularity''' 
** Problem: Zermelo set theory starts with the empty set and an infinite set, and iterates the axioms of pairing, union, power set, separation, and choice to generate new sets. However, it does not restrict sets to these. For example, it allows sets that are not [[well-founded set|well-founded]], such as a set ''x'' satisfying ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''x''.&lt;ref&gt;Mirimanoff defined well-founded sets in 1917 {{harv|Mirimanoff|1917|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Solutions: Fraenkel introduced an axiom to exclude these sets. Von Neumann analyzed Fraenkel's axiom and stated that it was not "precisely formulated", but it would approximately say: "Besides the sets ... whose existence is absolutely required by the axioms, there are no further sets."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|pp=230&amp;ndash;232}}; English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|pp=404&amp;ndash;405}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann proposed the axiom of regularity as a way to exclude non-well-founded sets, but did not include it in his axiom system. In 1930, Zermelo became the first to publish an axiom system that included regularity.{{efn|[[Akihiro Kanamori]] points out that Bernays lectured on his axiom system in 1929-1930 and states that "… he and Zermelo must have arrived at the idea of incorporating Foundation [regularity] almost at the same time." {{harv|Kanamori|2009|pp=53&amp;ndash;54}}. However, Bernays did not publish the part of his axiom system containing regularity until 1941 {{harv|Bernays|1941|p=6}}.}}

=== Von Neumann's 1929 axiom system ===
[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|upright=0.8|John von Neumann]]

In 1929, von Neumann published an article containing the axioms that would lead to NBG. This article was motivated by his concern about the consistency of the axiom of limitation of size. He stated that this axiom "does a lot, actually too much." Besides implying the axioms of separation and replacement, and the [[well-ordering theorem]], it also implies that any class whose [[cardinality]] is less than that of ''V'' is a set. Von Neumann thought that this last implication went beyond Cantorian set theory and concluded: "We must therefore discuss whether its [the axiom's] consistency is not even more problematic than an axiomatization of set theory that does not go beyond the necessary Cantorian framework."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1929|p=229}}; {{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=379&amp;ndash;380}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann started his consistency investigation by introducing his 1929 axiom system, which contains all the axioms of his 1925 axiom system except the axiom of limitation of size. He replaced this axiom with two of its consequences, the axiom of replacement and a choice axiom. Von Neumann's choice axiom states: "Every relation ''R'' has a subclass that is a function with the same domain as ''R''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|pp=49, 53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''S'' be von Neumann's 1929 axiom system. Von Neumann introduced the axiom system ''S'' + Regularity (which consists of ''S'' and the axiom of regularity) to demonstrate that his 1925 system is [[relative consistency|consistent relative]] to ''S''. He proved:
# If ''S'' is consistent, then ''S'' + Regularity is consistent.
# ''S'' + Regularity implies the axiom of limitation of size. Since this is the only axiom of his 1925 axiom system that ''S'' + Regularity does not have, ''S'' + Regularity implies all the axioms of his 1925 system. 
These results imply: If ''S'' is consistent, then von Neumann's 1925 axiom system is consistent. Proof: If ''S'' is consistent, then ''S'' + Regularity is consistent (result  1). Using [[proof by contradiction]], assume that the 1925 axiom system is inconsistent, or equivalently: the 1925 axiom system implies a contradiction. Since ''S'' + Regularity implies the axioms of the 1925 system (result 2), ''S'' + Regularity also implies a contradiction. However, this contradicts the consistency of ''S'' + Regularity. Therefore, if ''S'' is consistent, then von Neumann's 1925 axiom system is consistent.

Since ''S'' is his 1929 axiom system, von Neumann's 1925 axiom system is consistent relative to his 1929 axiom system, which is closer to Cantorian set theory. The major differences between Cantorian set theory and the 1929 axiom system are classes and von Neumann's choice axiom. The axiom system ''S'' + Regularity was modified by Bernays and Gödel to produce the equivalent NBG axiom system.

=== Bernays' axiom system ===
[[File:PaulBernays 1949 MFO.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Paul Bernays]]
In 1929, [[Paul Bernays]] started modifying von Neumann's new axiom system by taking classes and sets as primitives. He published his work in a series of articles appearing from 1937 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|pp=48, 58}}. Bernays' articles are reprinted in {{harvnb|Müller|1976|pp=1&amp;ndash;117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernays stated that:

{{quote|The purpose of modifying the von Neumann system is to remain nearer to the structure of the original Zermelo system and to utilize at the same time some of the set-theoretic concepts of the [[Ernst Schröder#Work|Schröder logic]] and of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' which have become familiar to logicians. As will be seen, a considerable simplification results from this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernays|1937|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bernays handled sets and classes in a [[Many-sorted first-order logic|two-sorted logic]] and introduced two membership primitives: one for membership in sets and one for membership in classes. With these primitives, he rewrote and simplified von Neumann's 1929 axioms. Bernays also included the axiom of regularity in his axiom system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|pp=48&amp;ndash;54}}. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gödel's axiom system (NBG) ===
[[File:Kurt gödel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Kurt Gödel]]
In 1931, Bernays sent a letter containing his set theory to [[Kurt Gödel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|2003|pp=104&amp;ndash;115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel simplified Bernays' theory by making every set a class, which allowed him to use just one sort and one membership primitive. He also weakened some of Bernays' axioms and replaced von Neumann's choice axiom with the equivalent axiom of global choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Proof that von Neumann's axiom implies global choice: Let &lt;math&gt;R = \{(x, y): x \ne \empty \land y \in x\}.&lt;/math&gt; Von Neumann's axiom implies there is a function &lt;math&gt;G \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Dom(G) = Dom(R).&lt;/math&gt; The function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a global choice function since for all nonempty sets &lt;math&gt;x,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;G(x) \in x.&lt;/math&gt; Proof that global choice implies von Neumann's axiom: Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a global choice function, and let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a relation. For &lt;math&gt;x \in Dom(R),&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x) = \text{least}\,\{\alpha: \exists y[(x, y) \in R \cap V_\alpha]\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all sets having [[Rank (set theory)|rank]] less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha.&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;z_x = \{y: (x, y) \in R \cap V_{\alpha(x)}\}.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;F = \{(x, G(z_x)): x \in Dom(R)\}&lt;/math&gt; is a function that satisfies von Neumann's axiom since &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Dom(F) = Dom(R).&lt;/math&gt;}} Gödel used his axioms in his 1940 monograph on the relative consistency of global choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|pp=56&amp;ndash;58}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reasons have been given for Gödel choosing NBG for his monograph:{{efn|Gödel used von Neumann's 1929 axioms in his 1938 announcement of his relative consistency theorem and stated "A corresponding theorem holds if ''T'' denotes the system of ''Principia mathematica''" {{harv|Gödel|1990|p=26}}. His 1939 sketch of his proof is for Zermelo set theory and ZF {{harv|Gödel|1990|pp=28&amp;ndash;32}}. Proving a theorem in multiple [[formal systems]] was not unusual for Gödel. For example, he proved his [[incompleteness theorem]] for the system of ''Principia mathematica'', but pointed out that it "holds for a wide class of formal systems ..." {{harv|Gödel|1986|p=145}}.}}
* Gödel gave a mathematical reason—NBG's global choice produces a stronger consistency theorem: "This stronger form of the axiom [of choice], if consistent with the other axioms, implies, of course, that a weaker form is also consistent."&lt;ref name=Godelp6 /&gt;
* [[Robert Solovay]] conjectured: "My guess is that he [Gödel] wished to avoid a discussion of the technicalities involved in developing the rudiments of [[model theory]] within axiomatic set theory."{{efn|{{harvnb|Gödel|1990|p=13}}. Gödel's consistency proof builds the [[constructible universe]]. To build this in ZF requires some model theory. Gödel built it in NBG without model theory. For Gödel's construction, see {{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=35&amp;ndash;46}} or {{harvnb|Cohen|1966|pp=99&amp;ndash;103}}.}}
* [[Kenneth Kunen]] gave a reason for Gödel avoiding this discussion: "There is also a much more combinatorial approach to '''L''' [the [[constructible universe]]], developed by ... [Gödel in his 1940 monograph] in an attempt to explain his work to non-logicians. ... This approach has the merit of removing all vestiges of logic from the treatment of '''L'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunen|1980|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Parsons (philosopher)|Charles Parsons]] provided a philosophical reason for Gödel's choice: "This view [that 'property of set' is a primitive of set theory] may be reflected in Gödel's choice of a theory with class variables as the framework for ... [his monograph]."{{efn|{{harvnb|Gödel|1990|p=108}}, footnote i. The paragraph containing this footnote discusses why Gödel considered "property of set" a primitive of set theory and how it fit into his [[ontology]]. "Property of set" corresponds to the "class" primitive in NBG.}}

Gödel's achievement together with the details of his presentation led to the prominence that NBG would enjoy for the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] proved his [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independence]] proofs for ZF with the help of some tools that Gödel had developed for his relative consistency proofs for NBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ZFC became more popular than NBG.  This was caused by several factors, including the extra work required to handle [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] in NBG,{{efn|{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=65}}: "Forcing itself went a considerable distance in downgrading any formal theory of classes because of the added encumbrance of having to specify the classes of generic extensions."}} Cohen's 1966 presentation of forcing, which used ZF,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1966|pp=107&amp;ndash;147}}. Cohen also gave a detailed proof of Gödel's relative consistency theorems using ZF {{harv|Cohen|1966|pp=85&amp;ndash;99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the proof that NBG is a conservative extension of ZFC.{{efn|In the 1960s, this conservative extension theorem was proved independently by Paul Cohen, [[Saul Kripke]], and Robert Solovay. In his 1966 book, Cohen mentioned this theorem and stated that its proof requires forcing. It was also proved independently by [[Ronald Jensen]] and Ulrich Felgner, who published his proof in 1971. ({{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=381&amp;ndash;382}}; {{harvnb|Cohen|1966|p=77}}; {{harvnb|Felgner|1971}}.)}}

==NBG, ZFC, and MK==
NBG is not logically equivalent to ZFC because its language is more expressive: it can make statements about classes, which cannot be made in ZFC. However, NBG and ZFC imply the same statements about sets. Therefore, NBG is a [[conservative extension]] of ZFC. NBG implies theorems that ZFC does not imply, but since NBG is a conservative extension, these theorems must involve proper classes. For example, NBG implies that the class ''V'' of all sets can be well-ordered and that every proper class can be put into one-to-one correspondence with ''V''.{{efn|Both theorems follow from the theorem that every proper class can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all ordinals. A proof of this theorem is outlined in {{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=53}}.}}

One consequence of conservative extension is that ZFC and NBG are [[equiconsistent]]. Proving this uses the [[principle of explosion]]: from a [[contradiction]], everything is provable. Assume that either ZFC or NBG is inconsistent. Then the inconsistent theory implies the contradictory statements ∅&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∅ and ∅&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;∅, which are statements about sets. By the conservative extension property, the other theory also implies these statements. Therefore, it is also inconsistent. So although NBG is more expressive, it is equiconsistent with ZFC. This result together with von Neumann's 1929 relative consistency proof implies that his 1925 axiom system with the axiom of limitation of size is equiconsistent with ZFC. This completely resolves von Neumann's concern about the relative consistency of this powerful axiom since ZFC is within the Cantorian framework.

Even though NBG is a conservative extension of ZFC, a theorem may have a shorter and more elegant proof in NBG than in ZFC (or vice versa). For a survey of known results of this nature, see {{harvnb|Pudlák|1998}}. 

[[Morse–Kelley set theory]] has an axiom schema of class comprehension that includes formulas whose quantifiers range over classes. MK is a stronger theory than NBG because MK proves the consistency of NBG,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mostowski|1950|p=113}}, footnote 11. Footnote references [[Hao Wang (academic)|Wang]]'s NQ set theory, which later evolved into MK.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]] implies that NBG cannot prove the consistency of NBG. 

For a discussion of some [[ontology|ontological]] and other philosophical issues posed by NBG, especially when contrasted with ZFC and MK, see Appendix C of {{harvnb|Potter|2004}}.

===Models=== 
ZFC, NBG, and MK have [[ Model (mathematical logic)|model]]s describable in terms of [[the cumulative hierarchy]] ''V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''{{space|hair}} and the [[constructible hierarchy]] ''L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''{{space|hair}}. Let  ''V'' include an [[inaccessible cardinal]] κ and let Def(''X'') denote the Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; definable subsets of ''X'' (see [[constructible universe]]). Then:
* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; are models of [[ZFC]].
* Def(''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;) is a model of Mendelson's version of NBG, which replaces global choice by ordinary choice. Def(''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;) is not necessarily a model of NBG since global choice might fail.
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, where κ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[successor cardinal]] of κ, is a model of NBG.
* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ+1&lt;/sub&gt; is a model of MK, which implies that it is also a model of NBG.

==Category theory==
The ontology of NBG provides scaffolding for speaking about "large objects" without risking paradox. For instance, in some developments of [[category theory]], a "[[large category]]" is defined as one whose [[object (category theory)|object]]s and [[morphism]]s make up a proper class. On the other hand, a "small category" is one whose objects and morphisms are members of a set. Thus, we can speak of the "[[category of all sets]]" or "[[category of all small categories]]" without risking paradox since NBG supports large categories. 

However, NBG does not support a "category of all categories" since large categories would be members of it and NBG does not allow proper classes to be members of anything. An ontological extension that enables us to talk formally about such a "category" is the [[Conglomerate (set theory)|conglomerate]], which is a collection of classes. Then the "category of all categories" is defined by its objects: the conglomerate of all categories; and its morphisms: the conglomerate of all morphisms from ''A'' to ''B'' where ''A'' and ''B'' are objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adámek|Herrlich|Strecker|2004|pp=15&amp;ndash;16, 40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On whether an ontology including classes as well as sets is adequate for category theory, see {{harvnb|Muller|2001}}.
