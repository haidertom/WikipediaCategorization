In [[computer science]], a '''4D vector''' is a 4-component [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]] [[data type]]. Uses include [[homogeneous coordinates]] for [[3-dimensional space]] in [[computer graphics]], and ''red green blue alpha'' ([[RGBA]]) values for [[bitmap]] images with a color and [[alpha channel]] (as such they are widely used in computer graphics). They may also represent [[quaternion]]s (useful for rotations) although the algebra they define is different.

== Computer hardware support ==
&lt;!-- Todo: some earlier workstations must have had similar vector engines. --&gt;
Some [[microprocessor]]s have hardware support for 4D vectors with instructions dealing with 4 [[SIMD lane|lane]] ''single instruction, multiple data'' ([[SIMD]]) instructions, usually with a [[128-bit]] data path and [[32-bit floating point]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=intel SSE intrinsics|url=https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#techs=SSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific instructions (e.g., 4 element [[dot product]]) may facilitate the use of one 128-bit register to represent a 4D vector. For example, in chronological order: [[Hitachi SH4]], [[PowerPC]] VMX128 extension,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putting It All Together: Anatomy of the XBox 360 Game Console (see VMX128 dot product)|url=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cis371-Spring11/lectures/15_xbox.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Intel [[x86]] SSE4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=intel SSE4 dot product|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/583111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 4-element vector engines (e.g., the [[PS2 vector unit]]s) went further with the ability to broadcast components as multiply sources, and [[cross product]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VU0 user manual|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/e3lsv80kb1jb6sh/VU0E.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=feasibility study on using the playstation 2 for scientific computing|url=http://gamehacking.org/faqs/VPUThesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier generations of [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) shader pipelines used ''[[very long instruction word]]'' (VLIW) [[instruction set]]s tailored for similar operations.

== Software support ==
SIMD use for 4D vectors can be conveniently wrapped in a ''[[vector maths library]]'' (commonly implemented in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sce vectormath|url=https://github.com/erwincoumans/sce_vectormath}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GLM (vector maths library)|url=http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft DirectX Maths|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee415652(v=vs.85).aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
commonly used in [[video game development]], along with [[4×4 matrix]] support. These are distinct from more general [[linear algebra libraries]] in other domains focussing on [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of arbitrary size. Such libraries sometimes support 3D vectors padded to 4D or loading 3D data into 4D registers, with arithmetic mapped efficiently to SIMD operations by per platform [[intrinsic function]] implementations. There is choice between [[AOS and SOA]] approaches given the availability of 4 element registers, versus SIMD instructions that are usually tailored toward homogenous data.

[[Shading language]]s for [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) programming usually have a 4D datatypes (along with 2D, 3D) with x-y-z-w accessors including ''[[Permutation|permutes]]'' or ''swizzle'' access, e.g., allowing easy swapping of RGBA or ARGB formats, accessing two 2D vectors packed into one 4D vector, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GLSL data types &amp; swizzling|url=https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Data_Type_(GLSL)#Swizzling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern GPUs have since moved to scalar [[single instruction, multiple threads]] (SIMT) pipelines (for more efficiency in ''[[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]]'' (GPGPU)) but still support this programming model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMD graphics core next|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4455/amds-graphics-core-next-preview-amd-architects-for-compute/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10888">'''African Consensus''' is an [[Economics|economic]] [[paradigm]] proposed in 2011 for [[sustainable development]] in [[Africa]]. It is built on practical experiences across the African continent together with shared experiences from other regions facing similar challenges. It merges existing efforts of [[civil society]] in such areas as [[renewable energy]], community finance and empowerment, [[Organic farming|organic agriculture]] and [[water resource management]], [[Environmental protection|environmental]] and [[endangered species]] protection. It couples these with the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] experiences of business and finance in an attempt to scale these efforts into viable [[economic model]]s. Seeking a pragmatic path for development, it emphasizes the importance of heritage, cultural and identity protection with the need for economic advancement.&lt;ref name="Rio20"&gt;{{cite web|title=AFRICA CONSENSUS STATEMENT TO RIO+20 |url=http://www.nepad.org/system/files/COncensus-english.pdf |website=The Africa Regional Preparatory Conference for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) |publisher=The New Partnership For Africa's Development |accessdate=15 November 2014 |location=Addis Ababa, Ethiopia |date=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127144827/http://www.nepad.org/system/files/COncensus-english.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--the misspelling is embedded in the document filename only--&gt;

==African Consensus Forum==
The African Consensus Forum is proposed as an annual event, chaired by [[Tanzania]]'s president [[Jakaya Kikwete]], to convene stakeholders from civil society, government, business and finance. It is intended to address major challenges of development and present a range of concrete experiences, as well as to outline practical solutions that are economically viable and scalable. The annual meeting will initially be held in [[Dar Es Salaam]] with plans for breakout meetings alternating in the five regional zones during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forum Charter|url=http://africanconsensus.org/foundation-documents/forum-charter/|website=African Consensus|publisher=African Consensus Forum|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Consensus Crisis Prevention Center==
The African Consensus Crisis Prevention Center is an anticipated outcome of the Africa Consensus Forum to address crises of violence, which may arise over allocation of resources and resource benefits. African Consensus Forum will seek to anticipate crisis situations and offer a [[Track II diplomacy|second track dialogue process]] toward economic solutions to prevent crisis. The center's work will be hosted by the secretariat. It should coordinate efforts with those initiatives ongoing in the [[African Union]], and other initiatives active on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onuoha|first1=B|title=Power, conflict and consensus building in Africa: Ideology revisited|journal=African Journal on Conflict Resolution|date=2011|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajcr/article/view/69829|accessdate=15 November 2014|issn=1562-6997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The African Consensus concept emerged during the 2011 [[World Social Forum]] held in [[Dakar]], Senegal. Drafting of the African Consensus Resolution was undertaken by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] leaders working throughout the event (late January and throughout February 2011). Key spokespersons of the process were West African celebrity rapper [[Didier Awadi]] who is known for his outspoken activism, and Alioune Tine who has been a peace mediator in both [[Darfur]] and [[Ivory Coast]]. Leaders of the African branch of the World Social Forum were also deeply involved in the process.&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"&gt;{{cite web|title=African Consensus Resolution|url=http://www.himalayanconsensus.org/african+resolution|website=Action for Ethnic Diversity and Cultural Sustainable Development|publisher=Himalayan Consensus|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurence Brahm]] was invited by these activists to help articulate the concepts and draft the original African Consensus Declaration that was tabled before the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) NGO Forum two months later. The African Consensus Declaration was adopted by the ACHPR Forum in [[Gambia]], in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|url=http://www.achpr.org|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2014}}

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] picked up on the ideas in the declaration and held a drafting session in October 2011 to draft a document called "African Consensus Statement to Rio+20". It was presented at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20) during the conference summer 2012, incorporating the vision into the ideas of inclusive sustainability promoted by the UN system. The two documents – ''African Consensus Declaration'' and the ''African Consensus Statement to Rio+20''&lt;ref name="Rio20"/&gt; – underpin the economic paradigm by building a body of internationally recognized documentation.

In summer 2014, Tanzania's president Jakaya Kikwete summoned Laurence Brahm (the original drafter of the African Consensus Declaration) together with John Masuka (Tanzania's "father of inclusive finance") to the northern State House in [[Dodoma]]. There President Kikwete explained his own intention to convene the African Consensus Forum as a multi-stakeholder process between civil society, business-finance and government. Kikwete was one of the original conveners of the Helsinki Process, in his previous role as Tanzania's foreign minister. The [[Helsinki Process on Globalisation and Democracy]] calls for multi-stakeholder participation in resolving political and leadership challenges. By convening the African Consensus Forum as an extension of the Helsinki Process, Kikwete extended that process from the realm of governance to economics. The Uongozi Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UONGOZI Institute|url=http://www.uongozi.or.tz/|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leadership organization that is an outcome of the original Helsinki Process, is the body where the African Consensus Institute is to be located. Expectations are for the African Consensus to convene each year in early December.

There is increasing recognition of the notion that Africa must have its own unique economic development paradigm created by Africans themselves. The view has increasingly shifted from the NGO and civil society networks to the mainstream. Books such as ''African Consensus'' by [[Ludger Kühnhardt]], published in 2014, and articles by Kwame Marfo in ''Neo-African Consensus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MARFO|first1=KWAME|title=DEAR GOD: Why are we so poor?|url=http://neoafricanconsensus.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/dear-god-why-are-we-so-poor/|website=Neo-African Consensus|publisher=Neo-African Consensus|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Towards a just and sustainable world'' by CIDSE further attest to a global paradigm shift in the development narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nnaemeka|first1=Abonyi Nichodemus|title=Towards an Alternative Development Paradigm for Africa|journal=J Soc Sci|date=2009|volume=21|issue=1|pages=39–48|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSS/JSS-21-0-000-09-Web/JSS-21-1-000-09-Abst-PDF/JSS-21-1-039-09-707-Nnaemeka-A-N/JSS-21-1-039-09-707-Nnaemeka-A-N-Tt.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core principles and rights==
The African Consensus economic paradigm is based on three core principles:&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;
#Protect [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]], [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous identity]], endangered species and environment; 
#Through community empowerment involving local financing for sustainable and [[socially responsible business]]es; 
#Prioritizing environmental protection and community advancement.

African Consensus seeks to protect three core [[rights]]:&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;
#The right to ethnic diversity 
#The right to culturally sustainable development 
#The right to water, food security and the protection of our natural environment.

African Consensus can be a framework for preventing [[violence]] and [[terrorism]], which are often rooted in both economic and social marginalization of people from different identity groups.&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;

==Core theme==
It is proposed that African Consensus will be built upon the pan-African visions articulated by Mwalimu [[Julius Nyerere]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shivji|first1=Issa G|title=Nyerere, nationalism and Pan-Africanism|url=http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category/features/71793|website=Pambazuka News|publisher=Fahamu|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the global context the challenges of [[global warming|climate change]] and [[Resource depletion|diminishing resources]] as they relate to [[Developing country|developing countries]]. It is intended that it will adopt the multi-stakeholder approach of the Helsinki Process, and hopefully extending that process from politics and governance into the realms of economics, business and finance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Foundation documents==
African Consensus is established as an economic paradigm based on two documents:
#''The African Consensus Declaration'' adopted by the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights NGO Forum convened in Banjul, Gambia, April 2011{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
#''The African Consensus Statement to Rio+20'' submitted by the Economic Commission on Africa jointly with the African Union, African Development Bank, UN ECOSOC, UNDEP and UNEP to the Rio+20 conference in Brazil, July 2012.&lt;ref name="Rio20"/&gt;

On the basis of these two documents African Consensus is intended to evolve during future African Consensus Forum meetings where stakeholders in the African continent – from civil society, business, finance, and government – will convene each year, with regional break-out meetings throughout the year, to define and articulate the aspirations and pathways to African development based on pragmatism, and experiences shared between stakeholders.

The African Consensus Forum "Green-print" will be the annual outcome document of each African Consensus Forum to serve as a [[green growth]] blueprint of development and a continuing reference of best practices articulated by the stakeholders each year.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2839">Between 2009 and 2012, '''Agriculture and Rural Development Day''' ('''ARDD''') was an annual event co-organized by the [[CGIAR|Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR), [[Earth System Science Partnership]] (ESSP), [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), [[Global Forum on Agricultural Research]] (GFAR), [[International Federation of Agricultural Producers]] (IFAP), and [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI).

== History ==
The first event took place as a side event at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ARDDay2009/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2009 Website|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second event took place as a side event at the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Cancún]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ardday2010/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2010|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third event took place as a side event at the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ardday2011/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2011|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth event took place at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD)—also called Rio 2012, Rio+20, or the Earth Summit 2012—in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. It was co-hosted by the [[Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation]] (Embrapa) and the CGIAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cgiar.org/consortium-events/2012/06/18/agriculture-and-rural-development-day/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day|work=CGIAR|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and final ARDD, called Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agricultureday.org/about/index.html Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5]&lt;/ref&gt;(ALL-5), took place alongside Forest Day on the sidelines of the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP18) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wle.cgiar.org/thrive/2012/12/05/story-agriculture-and-climate-change-road-we%E2%80%99ve-travelled|title=The Story of Agriculture and Climate Change: The Road We’ve Travelled|date=2012-12-05|work=Water, Land and Ecosystems|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, this event merged with [[Forest Day]] to become the [[Global Landscapes Forum]] (GLF).

'''Appropriation of knowledge''' is the process of constructing [[knowledge]] from social and cultural sources, and integrating it into pre-existing schemas.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[developmental process]] that comes about through socially formulated, goal-directed, and tool-mediated actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation draws on the developmental theories of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]], as both the cognitive and social-constructivist views of learning are equally emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Jenkins]], discusses appropriation as "the ability to meaningfully sample and remix the content(s)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Multiculturalism, Appropriation, and the New Media Literacies|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2009/06/multiculturalism_appropriation.html|publisher=Henry Jenkins|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of our culture for new expressive purposes. Jenkins noted that many literature classes in schools are embracing appropriation. A common example of appropriation at its finest is [[Ricardo Pitts-Wiley]]'s "Moby-Dick: Then and Now", a contemporary reworking of Herman Melville's [[Moby-Dick]] narrative. Fundamental to appropriation is the idea that knowledge is socially constructed and that the student plays an active role in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation has occurred when the student has adapted the information in a way that is meaningful to them and they can use the knowledge as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity theory==

Appropriation in [[education]] is often understood and analyzed through [[activity theory]]. This theory was developed by [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]] and focuses on understanding the socio-cultural context (specifically the setting) learning occurs in.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Hung (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Activity theory is predicated on the assumption that a person's frameworks for thinking are developed and carried out in specific settings,&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and that these settings mediate [[cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Since appropriation also places a strong emphasis on setting, these theories complement each other when being used to analyze learning environments.

==Process of appropriating knowledge==

Hung&lt;ref&gt;Hung (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; has developed steps through which the appropriation of knowledge usually occurs. The process is as follows:

; 1. Growing into {{Interlanguage link multi|social dependency|wikt|3=dependency|lt=dependency}} (''submitting''): the [[student]] recognizes the differences between their beliefs/knowledge and the beliefs/knowledge of the [[teacher]]. The student accepts the teacher as the leader and submits to their beliefs, knowledge and rules.
; 2. Dependency (''mirroring''): The student adapts strategies to help submit to the beliefs, knowledge and rules of the teacher. The student questions the teacher and other students and begins to co-construct and negotiate meanings.
; 3. Growing out of dependency (''constructing''): the student experiments with the beliefs, knowledge and rules co-constructed with the teacher and other students and uses these ideas outside of the classroom. The student discovers patterns, ideas, concepts and beliefs inherent to the [[learning community]] and applies them to other environments.

==Five degrees of appropriation==

Through research with English teachers, Grossman ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; developed a theory to describe the varying levels of appropriation. The degrees 
; Lack of appropriation: the student has not appropriated the knowledge. This may occur because the [[concept]] being taught is too difficult for the student to comprehend or is too foreign to fit into the learner’s prior frameworks at that point in their development.
; Appropriating a label: the student knows the name of the concept but knows none of the features.
; Appropriating surface features: the student knows most of the features of the concept, but does not understand how those features contribute to the conceptual whole.
; Appropriating conceptual underpinnings: the student grasps the theoretical basis that informs and motivates the use of the concept and is able to make use of the concept in new contexts and for solving new problems. This is the level of appropriation that teachers and students should strive for.
; Achieving mastery: the student has the skills to use the concept effectively and to its fullest effect. This should also be strived for, but would likely to years of practice to achieve.

===Factors affecting the degree of appropriation===
There are a variety of factors that can affect the level of appropriation that the student achieves. Some of these factors are:

*The role the student plays in the [[learning process]]: students that play an active role in their learning process are more likely to appropriate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[social context]] of learning: this refers to the environment where the student learning, the values and expectations implied in the learning environment, how the knowledge is introduced by the teacher, and the social practices that occur in the learning environment. A more positive learning environment will most likely result in higher degrees of appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individual characteristics of the student: this includes the beliefs, goals, expectations, and motives of the student. The closer a student’s values align with those of the teacher, the more likely a student will appropriate the knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998), Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; A student’s motives also affect the degree of appropriation. Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to reach a higher level of appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Poleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interest and knowledge of the teacher: a teacher who appears more interested and/ or knowledgeable in the content being taught is more likely to influence appropriation in their students.&lt;ref&gt;Poleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes of appropriation==

Through appropriation students construct their own versions of knowledge, allowing [[internalization]] of the information they have learned.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Their beliefs and behaviours concerning the concepts learned also change.&lt;ref&gt;Poleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; These transformations alter the student’s conception of the information, which will affect how that information is given to others interacting with the student.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998), Cook et al (2002), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; How knowledge is transferred from one person to the next is an important aspect of appropriation and demonstrates the collaborative aspect of appropriation, where knowledge is constantly being negotiated with other.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboratively, students and teachers construct knowledge in a way that is meaningful to them.

[[File:Cell S1, lock-up of the Old Supreme Court Building, Singapore - 20101010.jpg|thumb|upright|A cell of the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Singapore|Old Supreme Court Building]] lock-up. Article 9 of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] guarantees the [[right to life|rights to life]] and [[political freedom|personal liberty]] and other rights of arrested persons, but these rights are not absolute.]]

'''Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore''', specifically Article 9(1), guarantees the [[right to life]] and the [[political freedom|right to personal liberty]]. The [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] has called the right to life the most basic of human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]]. Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] of [[Singapore]] has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.

Article 9(1) states that persons may be deprived of life or personal liberty "in accordance with law". In ''[[Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1980), an appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] from Singapore, it was held that the term ''law'' means more than just legislation validly enacted by [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]], and includes fundamental rules of [[natural justice]]. Subsequently, in ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General]]'' (2011), the Court of Appeal held that such fundamental rules of natural justice embodied in the Constitution are the same in nature and function as [[common law]] rules of natural justice in [[administrative law in Singapore|administrative law]], except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. A related decision, ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (2010), apparently rejected the contention that Article 9(1) entitles courts to examine the substantive fairness of legislation, though it asserted a judicial discretion to reject [[bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] and absurd or arbitrary legislation. In the same case, the Court of Appeal held that ''law'' in Article 9(1) does not include rules of [[customary international law]].

Other subsections of Article 9 enshrine rights accorded to persons who have been arrested, namely, the right to apply to the High Court to challenge the legality of their detention, the right to be informed of the grounds of arrest, the [[right to counsel]], and the right to be produced before a magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. These rights do not apply to [[enemy alien]]s or to persons arrested for [[Parliament of Singapore#Powers|contempt of Parliament]]. The Constitution also specifically exempts the [[Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Singapore)|Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act]] ({{Singapore legislation|cap=67|ed=2000}}), the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] ({{Singapore legislation|cap=143|ed=1985}}), and Part IV of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]] ({{Singapore legislation|cap=185|ed=2008}}) from having to comply with Article 9.

==Text of Article 9==
Article 9 of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution of the Republic of Singapore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; guarantees to all persons the [[right to life]] and [[political freedom|right to personal liberty]]. It states:

{{quote|9.— (1) No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.

(2) Where a complaint is made to the High Court or any Judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained, the Court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the Court and release him.

(3) Where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.

(4) Where a person is arrested and not released, he shall, without unreasonable delay, and in any case within 48 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey), be produced before a Magistrate, in person or by way of video-conferencing link (or other similar technology) in accordance with law, and shall not be further detained in custody without the Magistrate's authority.

(5) Clauses (3) and (4) shall not apply to an enemy alien or to any person arrested for contempt of Parliament pursuant to a warrant issued under the hand of the Speaker.

(6) Nothing in this Article shall invalidate any law —

:(a) in force before the commencement of this Constitution which authorises the arrest and detention of any person in the interests of public safety, peace and good order; or
:(b) relating to the misuse of drugs or intoxicating substances which authorises the arrest and detention of any person for the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation,

by reason of such law being inconsistent with clauses (3) and (4), and, in particular, nothing in this Article shall affect the validity or operation of any such law before {{sic|10|th|hide=y}} March 1978.}}

Article 9(1) embodies the concept of the [[rule of law]], an early expression of which was the 39th article of the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215: "No [[wikt:freeman#Noun|freeman]] shall be taken captive or imprisoned, or deprived of his lands, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor will we go with force against him nor send forces against him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the [[law of the land]]."&lt;ref&gt;The version in force in the UK is Article 29 of the Magna Carta reissued by [[Edward I of England]] in 1297, which reads: "No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be [[wikt:disseisin|disseised]] of his [[Freehold (English law)|Freehold]], or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.": Magna Carta 1297 ([http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519 1297 c. 9]).&lt;/ref&gt; Article 9(1) is similar, but by no means identical, to the Due Process Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which prohibits any state from denying "any person of life, liberty, or property, without [[due process]] of law", and to Article 21 of the [[Constitution of India]] which states: "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law." Article 5(1) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] and Singapore's Article 9(1) are worded the same way as the latter was adopted in 1965 from the former following [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|Singapore's independence from Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Republic of Singapore Independence Act}}, s. 6(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights to life and personal liberty==

===Meaning of ''life''===
[[File:Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Reprint).jpg|thumb|Article 9(1) in the 1999 Reprint of the [[Constitution of Singapore]], which prohibits the deprivation of life or personal liberty save in accordance with law]]

In ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (2010),&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong"&gt;''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [2010] 3 S.L.R. [''Singapore Law Reports''] 489, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore]] called the [[right to life]] "the most basic of human rights".&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 84"&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'', p. 528, para. 84. This case is elaborated upon in the "[[#Meaning of save in accordance with law|Meaning of ''save in accordance with law'']]" section below.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the courts have not yet had the opportunity to define the term ''life'' in Article 9(1).

Jurisdictions such as India, Malaysia and the United States interpret the same term in their respective constitutions broadly. In the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Munn v. Illinois]]'' (1877),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Munn v. Illinois]]'' {{ussc|94|113|1877}}, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field]] stated that the term ''life'' means more than mere animal existence. Rather, the definition extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. His rationale was that the term should not be "construed in any narrow or restricted sense".&lt;ref&gt;''Munn'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian courts have likewise adopted a broad interpretation of ''life'' in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to mean more than mere existence – instead, it includes the right to livelihood&lt;ref&gt;''Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corp.'' A.I.R. 1986 S.C. 180, [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] (India); and ''Delhi Transport Corp. v. D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress'' A.I.R. 1991 S.C. 101, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to a healthy environment. Subsequently, in ''Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;''Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh'' A.I.R. 1997 S.C. 3297, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; the meaning of ''life'' was expanded to include the right to live with human dignity; and to the provision of minimum sustenance, shelter, and those other rights and aspects of life that make life meaningful and worth living. Similarly, Justice [[Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati]] held in ''Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India'' (1984)&lt;ref&gt;''Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India'' A.I.R. 1984 S.C. 802, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; that the expression ''life'' included the right to be free from exploitation, and to the basic essentials of life included in the [[Directive Principles in India|Directive Principles of State Policy]] that appear in the Indian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Bandhua Mukti Morcha'', pp. 811–812.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Malaysian case ''[[Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan &amp; Another|Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan]]'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan &amp; Another|Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan]]'' [1996] 1 M.L.J. 261, [[Court of Appeal of Malaysia|Court of Appeal]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; the appellant had appealed against his [[wrongful dismissal]] from employment on the grounds of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life.&lt;ref name="Tan Tek Seng, p. 288"&gt;''Tan Tek Seng'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving ''life'' a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment,&lt;ref&gt;The court in ''Tan Tek Seng'' cited [[Chief Justice of India|Chief Justice]] [[Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud]] in ''Olga Tellis'' who stated at p. 193: "An equally important facet of that right is the right to livelihood because, no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood. If the right to livelihood is not treated as a part of the constitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to the point of abrogation." See ''Tan Tek Seng'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment.&lt;ref name="Tan Tek Seng, p. 288"/&gt; He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Tek Seng'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Yong Vui Kong'' case suggests that Singapore courts may interpret the word ''life'' more narrowly than the Indian and Malaysian courts when called upon to do so. The Court of Appeal stated that the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution had been expanded by the Indian courts to include "numerous rights relating to life, such as the right to education, the right to health and medical care and the right to freedom from noise pollution", attributing this to the "pro-active approach of the Indian Supreme Court in matters relating to the social and economic conditions of the people of India".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 528, para. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court declined to apply ''Mithu v. State of Punjab'',&lt;ref&gt;''Mithu v. State of Punjab'' A.I.R. 1983 S.C. 473, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the mandatory death penalty had been found unconstitutional, stating it was "not possible" to interpret Singapore's Article 9(1) in the way that the Indian Supreme Court had interpreted Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 84"/&gt;

===Meaning of ''personal liberty''===
''Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;''Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave'' [2008] 4 S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 754, [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; took a narrow approach to the reading of ''personal liberty'' in Article 9(1). The [[High Court of Singapore]] held that ''personal liberty'' only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention, and does not include a liberty to contract. Although it was suggested this had always been the understanding of the term, no authority was cited.&lt;ref&gt;''Lo Pui Sang'', p. 760, para. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach taken in ''Lo Pui Sang'' can be compared to the more liberal interpretation of ''liberty'' in the United States and Malaysia. In the US Supreme Court case of ''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'' (1897),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'' {{ussc|165|578|1897}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; where a Louisiana statute was struck down on the ground that it violated an individual's right to contract, it was held that ''liberty'' in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution meant not only the right of the citizen to be free from any physical restraint of his person, but also the right to freely enjoy all his faculties – that is, to be free to use them in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any livelihood or avocation; and for that purpose to enter into all contracts that may be proper, necessary, and essential to his carrying out those purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Allgeyer'', p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liberty'' was accorded the same broad reading in the subsequent case ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' (1923),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' {{ussc|262|390|1923}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Supreme Court held that a state statute mandating that English be the only language used in schools was unconstitutional as it infringed on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court stated that ''liberty''

{{quote|... denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.&lt;ref&gt;''Meyer'', p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was held in the Malaysian Court of Appeal case of ''Sugumar Balakrishnan v. Pengarah Imigresen Negeri Sabah'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;''Sugumar Balakrishnan v. Pengarah Imigresen Negeri Sabah'' [1998] 3 M.L.J. 289, C.A. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; that the term ''life'' in Article 5(1) of the Constitution is not limited to mere existence, but is a wide concept that must receive a broad and liberal interpretation. Likewise, ''personal liberty'' should be similarly interpreted, as any other approach to construction will necessarily produce an incongruous and absurd result.&lt;ref&gt;''Sugumar'', p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; On the facts, personal liberty extended to the liberty of an aggrieved person to go to court and seek judicial review, and thus a statutory provision that sought to oust the power of judicial review was apparently inconsistent with this fundamental liberty. However, the apparent inconsistency could be resolved by permitting an [[ouster clause]] to immunize from judicial review only those administrative acts and decisions that are not infected by an error of law.&lt;ref&gt;''Sugumar'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]] reversed the Court of Appeal on this point,&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Sabah v. Sugumar Balakrishnan &amp; Another|Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Sabah v. Sugumar Balakrishnan]]'' [2002] 3 M.L.J. 72, [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]], Malaysia.&lt;/ref&gt; in the subsequent case ''[[Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [2009] 5 M.L.J. 301, F.C. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; the Federal Court held that the provisions of the Constitution should be interpreted "generously and liberally", and that "on no account should a literal construction be placed on its language, particularly upon those provisions that guarantee to individuals the protection of fundamental rights".&lt;ref name="Lee Kwan Woh 8"&gt;''Lee Kwan Woh'', p. 311, para. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In its view:

{{quote|... it is the duty of a court to adopt a prismatic approach when interpreting the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part II of the Constitution. When light passes through a prism it reveals its constituent colours. In the same way, the prismatic approach will reveal to the court the rights submerged in the concepts employed by the several provisions under Part II.&lt;ref name="Lee Kwan Woh 8"/&gt;}}

The Federal Court went on to state that ''personal liberty'' "includes other rights" such as the right to "cross the frontiers in order to enter or leave the country when one so desires".&lt;ref&gt;''Lee Kwan Woh'', p. 314, para. 14, citing ''Government of Malaysia v. Loh Wai Kong'' [1978] 2 M.L.J. 175 at 178, H.C. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that since Article 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution is pitched at a high level of generality,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jack Lee Tsen-Ta|title=Rediscovering the Constitution|url=http://works.bepress.com/jacklee/8/|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1995|volume=16|pages=157–211 at 190}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no limitation in the ordinary natural meaning of the phrase. Thus, there is no requirement in the Constitution for ''personal liberty'' to be construed narrowly to mean only freedom from physical restraint.&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan"&gt;Lee, p. 191. Lee notes at p. 190 that in ''[[Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1980/1980_32.html &amp;#91;1980&amp;#93; UKPC 32], [1981] A.C. 648, [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) 710, [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] (on appeal from Singapore), [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] indicated that the Constitution should not be treated as ordinary legislation but as "''[[sui generis]]'', calling for principles of interpretation of its own, suitable to its character": ''Ong Ah Chuan'' [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 721, para. 23, citing ''Minister of Home Affairs v. Fisher'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1979/1979_21.html &amp;#91;1979&amp;#93; UKPC 21], [1980] A.C. 319 at 329, P.C. (on appeal from Bermuda).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning of ''save in accordance with law''===
The meaning of the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on the scope of the Article. If ''law'' is read broadly (for example, as incorporating [[customary international law]] principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, ''law'' is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.

====Fundamental rules of natural justice====
[[File:Downing Street.jpg|thumb|400px|Up to October 2009, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] met at Downing Street ''(pictured)'' in the Council Chamber. In a 1980 case on appeal from [[Singapore]], the Privy Council held that the term ''law'' in provisions of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Singapore Constitution]] such as Article 9 included fundamental rules of [[natural justice]].]]

In the Malaysian case ''Arumugam Pillai v. Government of Malaysia'' (1976),&lt;ref&gt;''Arumugam Pillai v. Government of Malaysia'' [1975] 2 M.L.J. 29, F.C. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]] construed the phrase ''save in accordance with law'' in Article 13(1) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] restrictively. This provision states: "No person shall be deprived of property save in accordance with law." The Court held that all that was required for the legislation in question to be constitutional was for it to have been validly passed by Parliament. Hence, the validity of any duly enacted piece of legislation could not be questioned on grounds of reasonableness, no matter how arbitrary the law appeared to be.&lt;ref&gt;''Arumugam Pillai'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1980 the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] rejected this interpretation in the case of ''[[Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor]]'',&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan"/&gt; a decision on appeal from Singapore. This appeal questioned the constitutional validity of section 15 of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]],&lt;ref name=MDA&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Misuse of Drugs Act|titlelink=Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|cap=185|ed=2008}} ("MDA").&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the issues that had to be decided was the interpretation of the word ''law'' in Article 9(1). The Public Prosecutor contended that ''law'' should be given a narrow meaning. He argued that

{{quote|since 'written law' is defined in Art 2(1) to mean 'this Constitution and all Acts and Ordinances and subsidiary legislation for the time being in force in Singapore' and 'law' is defined as including 'written law', the requirements of the Constitution are satisfied if the deprivation of life and liberty has been carried out in accordance with provisions contained in any Act passed by the [[Parliament of Singapore]], however arbitrary or contrary to fundamental rules of natural justice the provisions of such Act may be.&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan 24"&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 721, para. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the Public Prosecutor qualified the statement by providing a limitation, namely, that "the arbitrariness, the disregard of fundamental rules of natural justice for which the Act provides, must be of general application to all citizens of Singapore so as to avoid falling foul of the anti-discriminatory provisions of [[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|Art 12(1)]]".&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan 24"/&gt;

In a judgment delivered by Lord Diplock, the Privy Council rejected this interpretation, finding the Public Prosecutor's argument fallacious. Reading the definition of ''written law'' as stated in Article 2(1) together with Article 4, which provides that "any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void", their Lordships held that "the use of the expression 'law' in Art 9(1) ... does not, in the event of challenge, relieve the court of its duty to determine whether the provisions of an Act of Parliament passed after 16 September 1963 and relied upon to justify depriving a person of his life or liberty are inconsistent with the Constitution and consequently void".&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 722, para. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with their view that Part IV of the Constitution should be given "a generous interpretation ... suitable to give to individuals the full measure of the
[fundamental liberties] referred to",&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 721, para. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; their Lordships held that "references to 'law' in such contexts as 'in accordance with law', 'equality before the law', 'protection of the law' and the like ... refer to a system of law which incorporates those fundamental rules of natural justice that had formed part and parcel of the common law of England that was in operation in Singapore at the commencement of the Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 722, para. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of the meaning of ''law'' in Article 9(1) has been affirmed by the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] in ''Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20101115085712/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/46431.html &amp;#91;2004&amp;#93; SGCA 47], [2005] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 103 at 125, para. 82, C.A. (Singapore), archived from [http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/46431.html the original] on 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), pp. 499–500, para. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been highlighted that this elevation of principles of [[natural justice]] to constitutional status, with the implication that they may override local statutes due to the supremacy of the Constitution over them, creates some tension with Article 38 which vests the law-making power of Singapore in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=C.L. Lim|title=The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law: ''Nguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor''|ssrn=952611|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|year=2005|volume=1|pages=218–233 at 229}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Extent of natural justice=====
In ''Ong Ah Chuan'' and the subsequent decision ''[[Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1981/1981_23.html &amp;#91;1981&amp;#93; UKPC 23], [1982] A.C. 136, [1981–1982] S.L.R.(R.) 133, P.C. (on appeal from Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the Privy Council declined to set out a comprehensive list of fundamental rules of [[natural justice]] and merely stated some principles to deal with the issues at hand. At a 2000 conference, the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]] [[Chan Sek Keong]], who became [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] in 2006, remarked that this gives the Court of Appeal a free hand to determine the scope of the fundamental rules of natural justice unencumbered by [[precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Chan Sek Keong |authorlink=Chan Sek Keong |contribution=Rethinking the Criminal Justice System of Singapore for the 21st Century |url=http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/Data/Files/File/Speeches/RethinkingCriminalJusticeSystem.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uViu4266?url=http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/Data/Files/File/Speeches/RethinkingCriminalJusticeSystem.pdf |archivedate=25 November 2010 |editor=Singapore Academy of Law |editor-link=Singapore Academy of Law |title=The Singapore Conference: Leading the Law and Lawyers into the New Millennium @ 2020 |location=Singapore |publisher=[[LexisNexis|Butterworths Asia]] |year=2000 |pages=29–58 at 39–40 |isbn=978-981-236-106-6 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guidance as to the scope of fundamental rules of natural justice was provided in ''Haw Tua Tau''. First, the Privy Council said that rules of natural justice are not stagnant and may change with the times. Secondly, they should be considered in the local context, in light of the entire system as a whole and from the perspective of the people operating the system.&lt;ref&gt;''Haw Tua Tau'', [1982] A.C. at p. 154, [1981–1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 144, paras. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in order to satisfy the rules of natural justice, the law in question should not be "obviously unfair".&lt;ref&gt;''Haw Tua Tau'', [1982] A.C. at p. 148, [1981–1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 137, para. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In its view, under a system of justice in which the court is invested with partly [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] functions, compelling an accused to answer questions put to him by a judge cannot be regarded as contrary to natural justice.&lt;ref&gt;''Haw Tua Tau'', [1982] A.C. at p. 154, [1981–1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 144, para. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal later ruled in ''Public Prosecutor v. Mazlan bin Maidun'' (1992)&lt;ref&gt;''Public Prosecutor v. Mazlan bin Maidun'' [1992] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 968, C.A. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[privilege (evidence)|privilege]] against [[self-incrimination]] was not a fundamental rule of natural justice, and thus not a constitutional right.

In ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General]]'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General|link=Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General|court=SGCA|year=2011|num=9|parallelcite=[2011] 2 S.L.R. 1189|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal stated that fundamental rules of natural justice embodied in the concept of ''law'' in constitutional provisions such as Articles 9(1) and 12(1) are the same in nature and function as [[common law]] rules of natural justice in [[administrative law in Singapore|administrative law]], except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. The former invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality and can only be altered by amending the Constitution, while the latter invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles and can be abrogated or disapplied by ordinary legislation.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2011), pp. 1242–1243, paras. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A procedural or substantive concept?=====
Traditionally, at common law, natural justice is taken to be a procedural concept that embodies the twin pillars of ''[[audi alteram partem]]'' (hear the other party) and ''[[nemo iudex in causa sua]]'' (no one should be a judge in his or her own cause). In the United States, [[due process]] has both procedural and substantive components. [[Substantive due process]] involves the courts assessing the reasonableness of executive actions and legislation using [[rational basis review]] if a fundamental right is not implicated and [[strict scrutiny]] if it is. The question thus arises whether substantive fundamental rules of natural justice may be developed by local courts. However, a line of Malaysian cases has expressed the view that the concept of substantive due process is not applicable to Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Harun bin Haji Idris'' [1976] 2 M.L.J. 116, [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Court]] (Kuala Lumpur); ''Attorney-General, Malaysia v. Chiow Thiam Guan'' [1983] 1 M.L.J. 51, H.C. (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia); ''Public Prosecutor v. Lau Kee Hoo'' [1983] 1 M.L.J. 157, F.C. (Malaysia); ''Public Prosecutor v. Yee Kim Seng'' [1983] 1 M.L.J. 252, H.C. (Ipoh, Malaysia); and ''Che Ani bim Itam v. Public Prosecutor'' [1984] 1 M.L.J. 113, F.C. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; There is also academic commentary that rejects the notion of "substantive natural justice", arguing that it is too vague and leads to problems in application.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=A[ndrew] J. Harding|title=Natural Justice and the Constitution|journal=Malaya Law Review|year=1981|volume=23|pages=226–236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument against substantive natural justice is the fear that it may become an avenue for judges to invalidate laws on the basis of their own subjective opinions, leading to unbounded [[judicial activism]].

On the other hand, it has also been suggested that substantive natural justice would merely be a full exercise of the judiciary's proper role as conferred by the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jack Lee Tsen-Ta|title=Rediscovering the Constitution|url=http://works.bepress.com/jacklee/8/|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1995|volume=16|pages=157–211 at 201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one scholar has asserted that there is no doubt that a judicial inquiry covers both substantive and procedural aspects. It is said that Article 9(1) connotes a judicial inquiry into the "fairness" of the law tested against certain principles regarded as fundamental to the legal system. Distinguishing between substantive and procedural fairness is a meaningless exercise, as it merely clouds the process of judicial inquiry. Judicial review is judicial review under whatever name, and as far as Article 9(1) is concerned, there is no room for making this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=T.K.K. Iyer|title=Article 9(1) and 'Fundamental Principles of Natural Justice' in the Constitution of Singapore|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/sjls23&amp;div=25|journal=Malaya Law Review|year=1981|volume=23|pages=213–225 at 224–225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor'' (2010)&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong"/&gt; the Court of Appeal appeared to reject such an approach by declining to require that procedural laws must be "fair, just and reasonable"&lt;ref&gt;The approach taken to Article 21 of the Indian Constitution in ''Mithu'', para. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; before they can be regarded as ''law'' for the purpose of Article 9(1). It noted that the provision neither contains such a qualification, nor can such a qualification be implied from its context or wording. The Court considered it "too vague a test of constitutionality" and said: "Such a test hinges on the court’s view of the reasonableness of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policy making."&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), pp. 526–527, para. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Court acknowledged that Article 9(1) does not justify all legislation whatever its nature.&lt;ref&gt;Citing ''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1980] A.C. at 659.&lt;/ref&gt; It held, ''[[obiter dictum|obiter]]'', that ''law'' might not encompass [[wikt:colourable#Adjective|colourable]] legislation (that is, [[bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] – legislation purporting to be of general application but in fact directed at securing the conviction of particular individuals), or legislation "of so absurd or arbitrary a nature that it could not possibly have been contemplated by our constitutional framers as being 'law' when they crafted the constitutional provisions protecting fundamental liberties".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 500, para. 16; see also pp. 524–525, para. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Customary international law====
[[File:UN General Assembly.jpg|thumb|The [[United Nations General Assembly]] hall in New York. The [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Singapore Court of Appeal]] acknowledged in a 2004 case that Article 5 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, prohibits [[torture]] and cruel and inhumane treatment, and that this is considered [[customary international law]]. However, what constitutes "cruel and inhumane treatment" remains unclear.]]

In ''Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor'' (2004), the Court of Appeal considered whether ''law'' in Article 9(1) includes principles of [[customary international law]]. In that case, the appellant argued that effecting a death sentence for drug trafficking by [[hanging]] is unconstitutional as a form of [[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and inhuman punishment]] not "in accordance with law". The Court agreed that there was a prohibition against [[torture]] and cruel and inhumane treatment in Article 5 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and that this is considered customary international law. However, a customary international law rule had to be "clearly and firmly established" before it was adopted by the courts,&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen Tuong Van'', pp. 126–127, para. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; and there was insufficient practice among states to hold that death by hanging was within the ambit of this prohibition. Also, even if there was a customary international law rule against death by hanging, domestic statutes would prevail in the event of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen Tuong Van'', p. 128, para. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal clarified in ''Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor'' (2010),&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong"/&gt; that customary international law cannot be read into the Constitution for two reasons. First, in order for a customary international law rule to have legal effect in Singapore, it has to be incorporated into [[municipal law|domestic law]]. The incorporation can occur either by enactment in a statute&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 89"&gt;In which case the rule will be regarded as part of domestic legislation and no longer a customary international law rule: ''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 530, para. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; or by a court declaration that the rule forms part of the common law.&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 89"/&gt; The Court felt it would be incorrect to incorporate customary international law rules into the meaning of ''law'' in Article 9(1) as this would cloak the common law with the constitutional status to nullify a statute, thus reversing the usual hierarchy of legal rules.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 530, para. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the term ''law'' is defined in Article 2(1) to include the common law only "in so far as it is in operation in Singapore". However, a court cannot treat rules of customary international law as having been incorporated into Singapore common law if they are inconsistent with existing statutes. Furthermore, if there is a conflict between such a rule and a domestic statute, the latter prevails.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 531, para. 91; {{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|title='It is a Little Known Legal Fact': Originalism, Customary Human Rights Law and Constitutional Interpretation: ''Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor''|ssrn=1802666|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|year=2010|pages=558–570 at 568–569}}. The Court of Appeal also held that since a significant number of nations still retain the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences and other serious crimes, it had not been established that customary international law prohibited the imposition of the mandatory death penalty: ''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 533, para. 96. Further, a customary international law rule prohibiting the mandatory death penalty cannot be regarded as part of ''law'' in Article 9(1) of the Constitution because the [[Government of Singapore]] rejected a recommendation to include a prohibition against inhuman punishment in the Constitution in 1966: p. 531, para. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution is silent as to the reception of [[international law]] in domestic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|title=The Death Penalty as Cruel and Inhuman Punishment before the Singapore High Court?: Customary Human Rights Norms, Constitutional Formalism and the Supremacy of Domestic Law in ''Public Prosecutor v Nguyen Tuong Van'' (2004)|journal=[[Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal]]|year=2004|volume=4|issue=2|pages=213–226 at 223}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Yong Vui Kong'' the Court of Appeal accepted that domestic law, including the Constitution, should "as far as possible" be consistently interpreted with Singapore's international obligations. Nonetheless, while international human rights law can increase the normative pool judges may resort to in interpreting the Constitution, there are "inherent limits" such as the express wording of the constitutional text and constitutional history that "[militates] against the incorporation of those international norms".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 519, para. 59; Thio, "Little Known Legal Fact", p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that although where possible local statutes should be interpreted in light of international treaties, it is not the role of the judiciary to import international law standards into the Constitution that are inconsistent with legislation instead of [[judicial deference|deferring]] to the views of the [[executive (government)|executive]]. According to this view, which hinges on a strict adherence to the [[separation of powers in Singapore|separation of powers]] doctrine, the judiciary should guard against unwarranted incursions into the executive sphere, as it is for the executive to determine Singapore's attitude and position in relation to foreign affairs. The judiciary must not undertake its task of interpreting the Constitution arbitrarily, but should accord with legal reasoning and sound principles.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law", p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; This necessarily raises the question of what the applicable legal principle during the interpretation process should be. It has been suggested that the executive and the judiciary should show solidarity by speaking with "one voice",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=C.L. Lim |title=Public International Law before the Singapore and Malaysian Courts |journal=Singapore Year Book of International Law |url=http://law.nus.edu.sg/sybil/downloads/articles/SYBIL-2004/SYBIL-2004-243.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uYgsk8Fk?url=http://law.nus.edu.sg/sybil/downloads/articles/SYBIL-2004/SYBIL-2004-243.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2010 |year=2004 |volume=8 |pages=243–281 at 272 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the courts should exercise deference in favour of what the executive deems to be the nation's attitude towards the particular international law norm that is sought to be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law", p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be submitted that such judicial deference to the executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, it is crucial that the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law", p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Right to life===

====Abortion====
One of the most difficult questions involving the right to life is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting [[abortion]] would thus be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see {{citation|author=Dawn Tan|title=Christian Reflections on Universal Human Rights and Religious Values: Uneasy Bedfellows?|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1997|volume=18|pages=216–250 at 220|quote=Since the advent of the modern human rights movement, the term 'human rights' has been bandied about with great fervour by its proponents; often, persons on opposite sides of an argument are able to defend their position by talking in terms of rights. For instance, abortion is condemned in the name of the foetus's right to life; the outlawing of abortion, in the name of the mother's right to choose – a women's right.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.

In Singapore, the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Penal Code|titlelink=Penal Code (Singapore)|cap=224|ed=2008}}, ss. 313–316.&lt;/ref&gt; lays out sanctions for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Termination of Pregnancy Act|cap=324|ed=1985}} ("TPA").&lt;/ref&gt; which limits abortion to women who have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;TPA, s. 4(a). Compare the Malaysian Penal Code (Act 574, 2006 Rev. Ed.), s. 312, which states that abortion is permissible within 120 days of conception only if the pregnancy poses a threat to an expectant mother's physical or mental health: see {{citation|author=Ahmad Mesum|title=An Overview of the Right to Life under the Malaysian Federal Constitution|journal=Malayan Law Journal|year=2008|volume=6|pages=xxxiv–xlix at xxxiv–xlviii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]] provides that the state shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of the Philippines]], Art. II, s. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] 1992 (Czech Republic), Art. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.

====Right to die====
In Singapore, [[failed suicide attempt|attempted suicide]],&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code, s. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; abetment of suicide, and abetment of attempted suicide&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code, s. 309 read with s. 107 (abetment); and s. 306 (abetment of suicide).&lt;/ref&gt; are criminal acts. This applies to physicians who aid patients in ending their lives. Such physicians are unable to claim a defence under section 88 of the Penal Code since they intended to cause the patients' deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code, s. 88, reads: "Nothing, ''which is not intended to cause death'', is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent." (Emphasis added.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for [[terminal illness]]es by issuing [[advance health care directive|advance medical directives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Advance Medical Directive Act|cap=4A|ed=1997}}, s. 20(1). Nothing in the Act authorizes an act that causes or accelerates death as distinct from an act that permits the dying process to take its natural course; or condones, authorizes or approves abetment of suicide or [[euthanasia]]: s. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the right to life guaranteed by Article 9(1) encompasses a [[right to die]] – that is, a right to commit suicide or a right to [[assisted suicide]], usually in the face of a terminal illness – has not been the subject of any Singapore court case. In other jurisdictions, the [[right to life]] has generally not been interpreted in this way. In ''Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;''Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab'' A.I.R. 1996 S.C. 1257, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; the Indian Supreme Court held that the right to life is a natural right embodied in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and since suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life it is incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of the right to life.&lt;ref&gt;''Gian Kaur'', para. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The US Supreme Court has also declined to recognize that choosing death is a right protected by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'' {{ussc|521|702|1997}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Washington residents asserted that a state law banning assisted suicide&lt;ref&gt;[[Revised Code of Washington|Wash. Rev. Code]] Ann. §9A.36.060(1): "A person is guilty of promoting a suicide attempt when he knowingly causes or aids another person to attempt suicide."&lt;/ref&gt; was unconstitutional on its face. The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the [[due process]] clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Several of the justices seemed persuaded that the availability of [[palliative care]] to "alleviate suffering, even to the point of causing unconsciousness and hastening death"&lt;ref&gt;''Glucksberg'', p. 737.&lt;/ref&gt; outweighed recognizing a new [[unenumerated rights|unenumerated]] "right to commit suicide which itself includes a right to assistance in doing so".&lt;ref&gt;''Glucksberg'', p. 723.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to personal liberty===

====Rights of arrested persons====
[[File:Changi Prison, Singapore.jpg|thumb|The Prison Link Centre, the gateway to the [[Changi Prison|Changi Prison Complex]]. Article 9 provides that arrested persons have a right to challenge the legality of their detention, to be informed of the grounds of their arrest, to [[right to counsel|consult counsel]], and to be produced before a magistrate within 48 hours of arrest.]]

Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines the right of persons who have been detained to apply to the High Court challenging the legality of their detention. The application is for an order for review of detention, which was formerly called a [[writ]] of ''[[habeas corpus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The application procedure is governed by Order 54 of the [http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/data/doc/ManagePage/97/eROC2006rev/eROC2006.htm Rules of Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701223648/http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/data/doc/ManagePage/97/eROC2006rev/eROC2006.htm |date=1 July 2010 }} (Cap. 322, R 5, 2006 Rev. Ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court is required to inquire into the complaint, and order the detainee to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that the detention is lawful.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 9(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9(3) requires that an arrested person be informed "as soon as may be" of the grounds of his arrest. Article 9(4) goes on to provide that if the arrested person is not released he must, without unreasonable delay, and in any case within 48 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey) be produced before a magistrate and cannot be further detained in custody without the authority of the magistrate. The person's attendance before the magistrate may be in person or by way of [[videoconferencing|video-conferencing]] or other similar technology in accordance with law.

=====Right to counsel=====
Article 9(3) also states that an arrested person must be allowed to consult and be defended by a [[lawyers in Singapore|legal practitioner]] of his choice.

==Restrictions on the rights to life and personal liberty==
As mentioned [[#Meaning of save in accordance with law|above]], Parliament is entitled to restrict the rights to life and personal liberty as long as it acts "in accordance with law". More specific restrictions on Article 9 include Article 9(5), which provides that Articles 9(3) and (4) of the Constitution do not apply to [[enemy alien]]s or to persons arrested for [[Parliament of Singapore#Powers|contempt of Parliament]] pursuant to a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] issued by the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore|Speaker]].

===Detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act===
Article 9(6) saves any law
:(a) in force before the commencement of the Constitution authorizing the arrest and detention of any person in the interests of public safety, peace and good order; or
:(b) relating to the misuse of drugs or intoxicating substances which authorizes the arrest and detention of any person for treatment and [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]],
from being invalid because of inconsistency with Articles 9(3) and (4). This provision took effect on 10 March 1978 but was expressed to apply to laws in force prior to that date. Introduced by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution (Amendment) Act|no=5|year=1978|lk=off}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the provision immunizes the [[Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Singapore)|Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act
|titlelink=Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Singapore)|cap=67|ed=2000}} ("CLTPA").&lt;/ref&gt; and Part IV of the Misuse of Drugs Act&lt;ref name=MDA/&gt; from unconstitutionality.

[[Preventive detention]] is the use of executive power to detain individuals on the basis that they are predicted to commit future crimes that will threaten national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Claire Macken|title=Preventive Detention and the Right to Personal Liberty and Security under Article 5 ECHR|journal=International Journal of Human Rights|year=2006|volume=10|issue=3|pages=195–217 at 196|doi=10.1080/13642980600828487}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act empowers the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]], if satisfied that a person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, to order that he or she be detained for a period not exceeding 12 months if the Minister is of the view that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.&lt;ref&gt;CLTPA, s. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Director of the [[Central Narcotics Bureau]] may order [[drug addiction|drug addicts]] to undergo drug treatment or rehabilitation at an approved institution for renewable six-month periods up to a maximum of three years.&lt;ref&gt;MDA, s. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detention under the Internal Security Act===
Section 8(1) of Singapore's [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] ("ISA")&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Internal Security Act|titlelink=Internal Security Act (Singapore)|cap=143|ed=1985}} ("ISA").&lt;/ref&gt; gives the Minister for Home Affairs the power to detain a person without trial for any period not exceeding two years on the precondition that the [[President of Singapore|President]] is: "satisfied ... that ... it is necessary to do so ... with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore ... or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein". The period of detention may be renewed by the President indefinitely for periods not exceeding two years at a time as long as the grounds for detention continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;ISA, s. 8(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISA has its constitutional basis in Article 149 of the Constitution, which sanctions preventive detention and allows for laws passed by the legislature against [[subversion]] to override the Articles protecting the personal liberties of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Yee Chee Wai|author2=Ho Tze Wei Monica|author3=Seng Kiat Boon Daniel|title=Judicial Review of Preventive Detention under the Internal Security Act – A Summary of Developments|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/singlrev10&amp;div=8|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1989|volume=10|pages=66–103 at 74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Article 149(1) declares such legislation to be valid notwithstanding any inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 9.&lt;ref&gt;The other provisions are Arts. 11, 12, 13 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, detentions under the ISA cannot be challenged on the basis of deprivation of these rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Eunice Chua|title=Reactions to Indefinite Preventive Detention: An Analysis of how the Singapore, United Kingdom and American Judiciary give Voice to the Law in the Face of (Counter) Terrorism|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=2007|volume=25|pages=3–23 at 6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avatar''' ({{lang-sa|अवतार}}) (from "'''A'''erobic '''V'''ehicle for Transatmospheric Hypersonic '''A'''erospace '''T'''r'''A'''nspo'''R'''tation") is a concept study for a robotic [[Single-stage-to-orbit|single-stage]] [[Reusable launch system|reusable]] [[spaceplane]] capable of [[CTOL|horizontal takeoff and landing]], by India's [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]]. The mission concept is for low cost military and commercial [[satellite]] [[outer space|space]] launches.&lt;ref name="Gujarat 2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scity.gujarat.gov.in/plane-avatar.htm |title=Indian Scientists unveils space plane Avatar in US |work=Gujarat Science City |date=10 July 2001 |accessdate=2014-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125628/http://www.scity.gujarat.gov.in/plane-avatar.htm |archivedate=22 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/india-01i.html |title=India Eyes New Spaceplane Concept |work=Space Daily |location=New Delhi |date=August 8, 2001 |accessdate=2014-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defence India"&gt;{{cite news |title=AVATAR- Hyper Plane to be built by INDIA |work=India's Military and Civilian Technological Advancements |date=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
In  [[Sanskrit]], the word avatar ([[wikt:अवतार#Sanskrit|अवतार]] ''{{IAST|avatāra}}'') is derived from [[wiki:अव-तर#Sanskrit|अव-तर]] ''{{IAST|ava-tara}}'' (lit. to move/cross below, i.e. descend) and literally means "that which descends". In Hinduism, an avatar refers to deliberate descent of a [[deity]] to Earth, or a descent of the [[Supreme Being]].

The idea is to develop a [[spaceplane]] vehicle that can [[takeoff|take off]] from conventional airfields. Its [[liquid air cycle engine]] would collect air in the [[atmosphere]] on the way up, [[Liquefaction|liquefy]] it, separate [[oxygen]] and store it on board for subsequent flight beyond the atmosphere. The Avatar, a [[reusable launch system|reusable launch vehicle]], was first announced in May 1998 at the [[Aero India]] 98 exhibition held at Bangalore.

Avatar is projected to weigh 25 tons, of which 60% of that mass would be [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel.&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt; The oxygen required by the vehicle for combustion in outer space would be collected from the atmosphere during takeoff, thus reducing the need to carry oxygen during launch.&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt; The notional specification is for a [[Maximum takeoff weight|payload]] weighing up to {{convert|1000|kg|abbr=on}} to [[low Earth orbit]] and to withstand up to 100 launches and reentries.&lt;ref name="Gujarat 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt;

If built, Avatar would take off [[HTHL|horizontally]] like a conventional airplane from a conventional airstrip using [[Ramjet|turbo-ramjet]] engines that burn hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt; During this cruising phase, an on-board system would collect air from the atmosphere, from which liquid oxygen would be separated and stored and used to burn the stored hydrogen in the final flight phase to attain orbit. The vehicle would be designed to permit at least one hundred launches and [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentries]].&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt;

==Feasibility study==
The Avatar concept study was commissioned by India's [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Gujarat 2014"/&gt; India's Space Agency [[ISRO]] has no connection with the project.&lt;ref name="Avatar is DRDO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/usq251.pdf |title=AVATAR Project |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408110239/http://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/usq251.pdf |archive-date=8 April 2017 |dead-url=yes |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=116544&amp;lsno=15|title=AVATAR Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Air Commodore Raghavan Gopalaswami, who headed the study, made a presentation on the [[spaceplane]] at the global conference on propulsion at Salt Lake City, United States on July 10, 2001.&lt;ref name="Gujarat 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt; Gopalaswami said the idea for Avatar originated from the work published by the [[RAND Corporation]] of the United States in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015353.pdf|title=Report of the Horizontal Launch Study|date=June 2011|publisher=[[NASA]]|format=PDF|quote=Last year of effort: 2001|work=DARPA|accessdate=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barthélemy Boganda''' (4 April 1910 – 29 March 1959) was the leading [[Nationalism|nationalist]] politician of what is now the [[Central African Republic]]. Boganda was active prior to his country's independence, during the period when the area, part of [[French Equatorial Africa]], was administered by [[France]] under the name of [[Oubangui-Chari]]. He served as the first [[List of heads of government of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|Prime Minister]] of the Central African Republic [[territorial autonomy|autonomous territory]].

Boganda was born into a family of subsistence farmers, and was adopted and educated by [[Roman Catholic Church]] [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]]. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During [[World War II]], Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of [[Bangui]] to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]], where he maintained a political [[party platform|platform]] against [[racism]] and the [[Colonialism|colonial regime]]. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a grassroots movement in opposition of [[French colonial empires|French colonialism]]. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the [[MESAN|Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa]] (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the [[working class]]. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was [[Defrocking|laicized]] from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and [[civil rights]] for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.

In 1958, after the [[French Fourth Republic]] began to consider granting independence to most of its African colonies, Boganda met with [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared the establishment of the Central African Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first [[List of heads of state of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|President of the independent CAR]]. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the [[List of intelligence agencies of France|French secret service]], and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more than one year later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the Central African Republic attained formal independence from France.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Boganda was born to a family of [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] in [[Bobangui]], a large [[M'Baka]] village in the [[Lobaye]] basin located at the edge of the equatorial forest some {{convert|80|km|mi}} southwest of [[Bangui]].&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; French commercial exploitation of Central Africa had reached an apogee around the time of Boganda's birth, and although interrupted by [[World War I]], activity resumed in the 1920s. The French consortia used what was essentially a form of slavery—the ''corvée''—and one of the most notorious was the Compagnie forestière de la Sangha-Oubangui, involved in rubber gathering in the Lobaye district.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s, Boganda's mother was beaten to death by the company's officials while collecting rubber in the forest.&lt;ref name="Chirot378"&gt;Chirot, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle, whose son [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] would later crown himself as the Emperor of the [[Central African Empire]], was beaten to death at the colonial police station as a result of his alleged resistance to [[employment|work]].&lt;ref name="Chirot378"/&gt; Boganda's father was a [[witch doctor]] who had engaged in [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] rituals.&lt;ref name="TimeMagazine"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Death of a Strongman |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810965,00.html |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date=13 April 1959 |accessdate=22 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his early years, Boganda was adopted by Catholic missionaries. As a boy he attended the school opened at [[Mbaiki]] (the administrative centre for the Lobaye [[prefecture]]) by the post's founder, Lieutenant Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; From December 1921 to December 1922, he spent two hours a day with [[Monsignor]] Jean-Réné Calloch learning how to read, while spending the rest of his time performing manual labour. On 24 December, he was received into the church under the name [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Barthélemy]],&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bradshaw |first=Richard A. |title=Bibliography and Reference Work for the Central African Republic: Letra C |url=http://webs.ono.com/bradshawproject/letra%20C.htm |publisher= |date=10 December 2006 |accessdate=22 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150104093215/http://webs.ono.com/bradshawproject/letra%20C.htm |archivedate=4 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in honour of one of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus Christ]] who was believed to have worked as [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary]] in Africa. Father Gabriel Herrau sent Boganda to the Catholic School of Betou and then to the school of the Saint Paul Mission at Bangui, where he completed his primary studies under Mgr Calloch, whom he would consider his spiritual father.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The missionaries there, encouraged by his intellectual promise and pious demeanour, helped him continue secondary studies at small seminaries in [[Brazzaville]] and [[Kisantu]] (under [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]) before he moved on to the great seminary at [[Yaoundé]]. On 17 March 1938, fulfilling an ambition he had had since age twelve,&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"/&gt; he was ordained and became the first [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] priest native to [[Oubangui-Chari]], as the colony was then called. He ministered at Bangui, [[Grimari]] and [[Bangassou]],&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1939, his bishop denied his request to join the [[French Army]]. He was needed at home, as many Frenchmen involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in [[World War II]], during which he served in a number of missions.&lt;ref name="AN"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Biographies des députés de la IV République: Barthélémy Boganda |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/boganda-barthelemy-04041910.asp |publisher=[[National Assembly of France]] |accessdate=29 February 2008 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings in politics and marriage===
After World War II, Boganda was urged by the Bishop of Bangui, Mgr Grandin, to complement his humanitarian and social works through political action. Boganda decided to run for election to the [[National Assembly of France]]. On 10 November 1946, he became the first Oubanguian [[French legislative election, November 1946|elected]] to the assembly after winning almost half of the total votes cast and defeating three other candidates, including the outgoing incumbent, François Joseph Reste, who had formerly served as the Governor-General of [[French Equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref name="AN"/&gt; Boganda arrived in [[Paris]] attired in his clerical garb and introduced himself to his fellow legislators as the son of a polygamous cannibal.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1947 on, Boganda conducted a lively campaign against racism and the colonial regime. Soon realizing the limits of his influence in France (he served in parliament until 1958 but gradually detached himself from its activities),&lt;ref&gt;An [[Popular Republican Movement|MRP]] deputy until 1950, Boganda was an independent thereafter. He only spoke twice, in 1947 on the abuses of colonialism and in 1950 on the lack of social justice in French Equatorial Africa. After 1956, he practically stopped attending the Paris parliament. National Assembly of France biography.&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to Oubangui-Chari to organise a grassroots movement of teachers, truck drivers and small producers to oppose French colonialism, although his previous attempt to set up a marketing cooperative among African planters of his own ethnicity had failed.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Gardinier, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This was the Société Coopérative Oubangui, Lobaye, Lesse (SOCOULOLE), which aimed to provide food, clothing, lodging, medical care and education. The SOCOULOLE was disbanded after a few months. National Assembly of France biography; Kalck (2005), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September 1949, at Bangui, he founded the [[Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa]] (MESAN), a quasi-religious [[political movement]] and [[political party|party]] that sought to affirm black humanity and quickly came to dominate local politics. His political creed was summed up in the [[Sango language|Sango]] phrase "''zo kwe zo''", which translated to "every human being is a person".&lt;ref&gt;The preamble of the CAR's 2004 Constitution reads, in part, 'Animated by the wish of assuring to man his dignity with respect to the principle of "ZO KWE ZO" enunciated by the Founder of the Central African Republic Barthélemy BOGANDA'. {{cite book|last=Heyns|first=Christoph (ed.)|authorlink=|year=1999|title=Human Rights Law in Africa|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|location=[[The Hague]]|isbn=90-411-0287-6|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, he was looking for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks within the [[French Union]] rather than independence, at least for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;He declared MESAN's goal was "to promote the political, economic and social evolution of black Africa, to break down the barriers of tribalism and racism, to replace the degrading notion of colonial subordination with the more human ones of fraternity and cooperation." National Assembly of France biography. He also declared that MESAN "aims to develop and liberate the black race by progressive and pacific evolution, achieved by the combined efforts of all negroes throughout the world. Each ethnic or administrative group, each family, clan or tribe, each district, region, division, province or department, each territory, each federation, will organise its own branches, federations and committees." Kalck (1971), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; He demarginalised large masses of people—women, youth, workers, poor cultivators—with the intent of unleashing the creativity of the Oubanguian people by placing them centre stage in the making of their country's history.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Gardinier, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Gaulle and Boganda.jpg|thumb|Boganda (right) receiving Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle in Brazzaville in 1958 to discuss the political future of Oubangui-Chari]]
The movement was more popular among villagers than among ''[[évolué]]'' townsmen, whom Boganda considered servile and to whom he applied the derogatory term "''Mboundjou-Voko''" ("Black-Whites").&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he created the Intergroupe Liberal Oubanguien (ILO) in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed to elect an equal number of black and white politicians to the assembly, so that a united [[electoral college]] could be established.&lt;ref name="Kalck1971p89"&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; MESAN's activities angered the French administration and the companies trading in cotton, coffee, diamonds and other commodities. The Bangui chamber of commerce was controlled by these companies, and the men who gathered at this club strongly resented the demise of forced labour and the resultant rise of black nationalism. They hated Boganda in particular, viewing him as a dangerous revolutionary demagogue and a threat to their "free enterprise", and they resolved to get rid of him.&lt;ref name="Titley"&gt;Titley, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; They also set up local [[Rally of the French People|RPF]] branches to counter MESAN, and the presence of African Democratic Rally (RDA) in the other three territories of French Equatorial Africa posed some menace for MESAN, but by 1958, although other parties were allowed, they had been reduced to tiny groups.&lt;ref name="Kalck"&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; On many occasions, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] expressed his sympathy for Oubangui-Chari, which had supported de Gaulle's [[Free French Forces]] as early as August 1940, and refused to support the violent intrigues of the RPF against Boganda and his men. He received Boganda, by then head of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa and pushing for independence, in Paris in July 1958 and was in turn received at Brazzaville in August. The discussions there led to the General accepting Boganda's demands for independence and the endorsement of the [[French Community]] in September throughout [[French Equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boganda's attachment to his chosen calling weakened when he met and fell in love with a young Frenchwoman, Michelle Jourdain, who was employed as a parliamentary secretary. They were married on 13 June 1950, for which Boganda was expelled from the priesthood and cut off from the Catholic hierarchy's support. Boganda and Jourdain would later have two daughters and a son. The affair caused a minor scandal in Paris, but it did little to dent his popularity with his people. In the National Assembly he continued to battle, often in vain, against repressive features of the French administration in Oubangui-Chari. Arbitrary arrest, low wages, compulsory cotton cultivation, and the exclusion of blacks from restaurants and cinemas were all targets of his rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Titley"/&gt;

===Increasing popularity and move toward autonomy===
On 29 March 1951, Boganda was sentenced to two months in prison&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p27"&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; following his arrest on 10 January for "endangering the peace" after intervening in a local market dispute (the "Bokanga incident" in Lobaye).&lt;ref name="AppiahandGatesp277"&gt;Appiah and Gates, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife was sentenced to 15 days in prison, but neither served their terms. On 17 June, he was [[French legislative election, 1951|re-elected]] to the National Assembly with 48% of the vote despite the obstacles placed in his way by the administration and strong opposition by the authorities, colonists, and the missions, with two prominent French candidates seeking to oust him.&lt;ref name="AN"/&gt; At this time, he emerged as an extraordinarily popular messianic folk hero and his country's leading nationalist; MESAN became the majority party in the [[Ubangi-Shari parliamentary election, 1952|Territorial Assembly elections]] in March 1952. In this period he divided his time between his coffee plantation, his emancipation work and new political positions.&lt;ref name="AN"/&gt; In April 1954, an incident that would showcase Boganda's talent and appeal with crowds erupted at [[Berbérati]]. A white public works agent, who had recently been reprimanded for his brutality toward Africans, announced that his cook and the cook's wife had died.&lt;ref name="Kalck1971p89"/&gt; A riot broke out and the governor sent in parachutists while armoured vehicles patrolled the streets. Boganda hesitated to appear in a village that was not one of his strongholds, but did so anyway and declared before the rioters that justice would be the same for blacks and whites. Upon hearing Boganda's words, the crowd became calm and dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Barthélemy Boganda's proposed United States of Latin Africa.png|thumb|250px|Map of the proposed [[United States of Latin Africa]]: the Central African Republic alongside the present-day states of [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]] and [[Rwanda]].]]
He played a crucial role at the beginning of internal autonomy (1956–1958), although the relatively conservative Boganda remained sympathetic to French interests and still did not advocate immediate independence.&lt;ref&gt;Appiah and Gates, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As late as April 1958, with the [[French Fourth Republic]] in its death throes, he formed part of a majority of African francophone leaders who still sought associational formulae that would somehow preserve viable links between France and its African empire. For them, "independence" meant autonomy within some form of French political community, not complete rejection of France and all it had meant for them. This is not entirely surprising, as these leaders had participated in the Republic's birth, helped write its constitution and laws, and participated in its legislatures and political parties. Le Vine, pp. 122, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; For Boganda, the [[French legislative election, 1956|1956 election]], in which he took 89% of the vote against another Oubanguian, was an uncontested speaker's platform with which the colonial administration had come to terms; the French had realised that opposing him would be dangerous and sought to accommodate him. That year he agreed to European representation on election lists in exchange for the financial support of French business leaders, and on 18 November, was elected as the first mayor of Bangui. On 31 March 1957, MESAN won all seats in the [[Ubangi-Shari parliamentary election, 1957|Territorial Assembly election]]; on 18 June, Boganda was elected president of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa (a forum he used to broadcast his views on African unity)&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and in May was appointed vice-president of the Oubangui-Chari Government Council (the French governor was still its president).&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pragmatist, Boganda spoke before the local assembly on 30 December 1957 in praise of the new Comité de Salut Economique, which envisioned joint administration of the economy between French colonials and MESAN territorial councilors (he called it "the union of capital and Oubanguian labour"), but lack of French investment and opposition by Oubanguians soon led him to turn away from the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; With the numerous declarations of independence being made in much of Francophone Africa, Boganda advised that an independent Oubangui-Chari would face major economic problems from the onset. Instead, he advocated the independence of all of [[French Equatorial Africa]] and its integration into a [[United States of Latin Africa]] comprising the former French, Belgian, and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonies of Central Africa;&lt;ref name="AppiahandGatesp277"/&gt; he intended for Oubangui-Chari to become a federal unit within that structure. However, such a federation proved unrealistic, foundering on the rocks of regional jealousy and personal ambition,&lt;ref&gt;On 28 September, at Boganda's call, 98% of Oubanguian voters endorsed a referendum establishing the [[French Community]]. However, it emerged at the Brazzaville Conference of 24–25 November that the leaders of Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, and above all Gabon (which had seen its revenues transferred for the development of the Middle Congo) were determined to go it alone, and their nations became autonomous republics within the French Community on 28 November 1958. Kalck (2005), p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and Boganda came to accept a constitution covering only Oubangui-Chari as the Central African Republic. Thus, after 1 December 1958, when Boganda declared the establishment of the Central African Republic as an autonomous member of the French Community, the name was applied only to the former Oubangui-Chari.&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p27"/&gt; On 8 December, the CAR's first government came into being with Boganda as prime minister; a French governor remained in the country but was now called high commissioner. The new government began by adopting a law banning nudity and vagabondage, Boganda's missionary education still showing through.&lt;ref name="Titleyp16"/&gt; Its main task, however, was to draw up a constitution, which was democratic and modelled to some extent on that of France; this was approved by the assembly on 16 February 1959. Formal independence came later, on 13 August 1960.&lt;ref name="StateDept"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Central African Republic (03/08) |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4007.htm |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=March 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080306025418/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4007.htm| archivedate= 6 March 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and aftermath===
Boganda was poised to become the first president of the independent CAR when he boarded a plane at Berbérati for a flight to Bangui on 29 March 1959, just prior to legislative elections. The aircraft exploded in midair over Boukpayanga in the [[Sub-prefectures of the Central African Republic|sub-prefecture]] of [[Boda, Lobaye|Boda]] (about {{convert|160|km|mi|-1}} west of Bangui), killing all passengers and crew.&lt;ref&gt;Aboard were four crew and five passengers, including the government's information chief and a member of parliament. {{cite news |last= |first= |title=African Leader Found Dead in Crashed Plane |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=1 April 1959|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prunierp103"&gt;Prunier, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; No clear cause has ever been ascertained for the mysterious crash&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p27"/&gt; and no commission of inquiry was ever formed;&lt;ref name="Prunierp103"/&gt; sabotage was widely suspected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Prunier]] footnotes his statement, "the probability of foul play was very high", saying, without a direct accusation, "The whites who worked for what was left of the Grandes Compagnies Concessionaires hated Boganda, who had been instrumental in finally getting compulsory labor outlawed in 1946.  They also hated his intelligence, which was unsettling to their view of black inferiority." Prunier, pp. 103 &amp; 393&lt;/ref&gt; The nation was shocked at the death of its revered leader, whose funeral on 2 April at the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Bangui saw a great outpouring of grief from thousands of Oubanguians.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The 7 May edition of the Paris weekly ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' revealed that experts had found traces of explosive in the wreckage, but the French high commissioner banned the sale of that magazine edition when it appeared in the CAR. Many suspected that expatriate businessmen from the Bangui chamber of commerce, possibly aided by the French secret service, played a role.&lt;ref name="Titleyp16"/&gt; Michelle Jourdain was also suspected of being involved: by 1959, relations between Boganda and his wife had deteriorated, and he thought of leaving her and returning to the priesthood. She had a large insurance policy on his life, taken just days before the accident. According to Brian Titley, author of ''Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa'', there are good reasons for suspecting her involvement in the plane crash.&lt;ref name="Titleyp16"&gt;Titley, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abel Goumba]], the vice-premier and finance minister whom Titley describes as "intelligent, honest, and strongly nationalistic",&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as Boganda's logical successor. However, his close confidant and cousin, interior minister [[David Dacko]], more likely to lead a regime deferential to foreign interests, was backed by the high commissioner, Colonel Roger Barberot, with the support of the chamber of commerce and Michelle Jourdain.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; He thus brushed aside Goumba and by 1962 had shut down the opposition, with MESAN becoming the country's single party.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The events after Boganda's death are strongly evocative of other French efforts to maintain economic domination by ensuring that compliant leaders came to power in its former colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It also robbed the country of a charismatic leader in the [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny|Houphouët-Boigny]] or [[Léopold Sédar Senghor|Senghor]] mould, whose prestige alone might have sufficed to retain civilian rule, which ended when Bokassa deposed the unpopular Dacko in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Boganda 1959 stamp.jpg|thumb|200px|His country's first postage stamp, from 1959, features Boganda flanked by his design for the [[flag of the Central African Republic]]. He combined the red, white and blue of the [[Flag of France|French tricolour]] with the [[Pan-African colours]]: red, green and yellow.]]
Boganda is not only considered the hero and father of his nation but also as one of the great leaders of [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization in Africa]]; the historian Georges Chaffard described him after his death as "the most prestigious and the most capable of Equatorial political men,"&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p27"/&gt; while political historian [[Gérard Prunier]] called him "probably the most gifted and most inventive of French Africa's decolonization generation of politicians."&lt;ref&gt;Prunier, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the places named after him are an avenue in Bangui, one of the city's largest high schools, a Château Boganda and [[Barthélemy Boganda Stadium]]. 29 March, the anniversary of his death, is Boganda Day, a public holiday. Boganda was also the designer of the [[flag of the Central African Republic]], originally intended for the [[United States of Latin Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boganda is one in a long line of African political leaders who, in an attempt to develop specifically national political cultures, were presented (or presented themselves) as the great national leader, glorified and sometimes nearly deified. They were hailed as the fathers of their nations and considered wise in the ways of understanding the best interests of their peoples. Others who became particular objects of hero-worship include [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], [[Modibo Keïta]], [[Léon M'ba]] and [[Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly]].&lt;ref name="Le Vinep106"&gt;Le Vine, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Boganda did little to discourage wide circulation of tales about his supernatural powers, putative invulnerability and even immortality. Shortly before his death, a large crowd waited on the shore of the [[Ubangui River]] to see him cross by walking upon the waters. He did not show up, but apparently a good many people still believed that he could have made the miraculous crossing.&lt;ref name="Le Vinep106"/&gt; More than just a charismatic political leader, he was seen as the "black Christ", a great religious figure endowed with extraordinary powers. Along with [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]]'s [[Fulbert Youlou]], who remained a priest while president, Boganda was not particularly concerned with his religious mission once he entered politics, but he unabashedly used the enormous popular respect for the Church and the cloth to political advantage. He successfully manipulated religious symbols (clerical garb, crosses, baptism, disciples, acolytes, etc.) for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Le Vine, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once he died, his mystique grew: he was a national martyr, and miracles were regularly attributed to him. The Boganda myth continues to exercise a strong hold on many people in the CAR, and it has frequently been used by his successors in their appeals for national unity. Those who were related to him even tenuously, such as Bokassa (who was from the same village and minority ethnic group, was the son of his mother's uncle, justified his coup using Boganda's name and created a cult of Boganda as founder of the party and state),&lt;ref name="Kalck"/&gt; or Dacko (who posed as the ideological successor of Boganda by championing for "national reconciliation" during the [[Central African Republic presidential election, 1981|1981 election]])&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; were able to capture some of his aura and use it to their advantage.&lt;ref name="Titleyp16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Vinep106"/&gt;

==Etymology and related terms==
[[Sanskrit]] ''Brahman'' (an ''n''-stem, nominative ''{{IAST|bráhmā}}'') from a [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''{{IAST|bṛh}}-'' "to swell, expand, grow, enlarge"  is a neuter noun to be distinguished from the masculine ''{{IAST|[[brahmán]]}}''—denoting a person associated with Brahman, and from [[Brahmā]], the creator God in the Hindu Trinity, the [[Trimurti]]. Brahman is thus a gender-neutral concept that implies greater impersonality than masculine or feminine conceptions of the deity. Brahman is referred to as the supreme self. Puligandla states it as "the unchanging reality amidst and beyond the world",{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=222}} while Sinar states Brahman is a concept that "cannot be exactly defined".{{sfn|Sinari|2000|p=384}}

In [[Vedic Sanskrit]]:
* ''Br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्रह्म) (nominative singular), ''br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;n'' (ब्रह्मन्) (stem) (neuter&lt;ref name="neuter"&gt;Not Masculine or Feminine  (see [[Grammatical gender]]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[gender]]) from root ''bṛh-'', means "to be or make firm, strong, solid, expand, promote".&lt;ref name=jangondaetymo&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1962), Some Notes on the Study of Ancient-Indian Religious Terminology, ''History of Religions'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;n&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्रह्मन) (nominative singular, never plural), from stems ''brh&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (to make firm, strong, expand) + Sanskrit ''-man-'' from Indo-European root ''-men-'' which denotes some manifest form of "definite power, inherent firmness, supporting or fundamental principle".&lt;ref name=jangondaetymo/&gt;

In later Sanskrit usage:
* ''Br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्रह्म) (nominative singular), ''brahman'' (stem) (neuter&lt;ref name="neuter" /&gt; [[gender]]) means the concept of the transcendent and immanent ultimate reality, Supreme Cosmic Spirit in Hinduism. The concept is central to Hindu philosophy, especially Vedanta; this is discussed below. ''Brahm'' is another variant of ''Brahman''.
* ''Br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hmā'' (ब्रह्मा) (nominative singlular), ''Brahman'' (ब्रह्मन्) (stem) ([[masculine]] [[gender]]), means the deity or [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] [[Brahma (god)|Prajāpati Brahmā]]. He is one of the members of the [[Trimurti|Hindu trinity]] and associated with creation, but does not have a cult in present-day India. This is because Brahmā, the creator-god, is long-lived but not eternal i.e. Brahmā gets absorbed back into [[Purusha]] at the end of an aeon, and is born again at the beginning of a new [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]].

These are distinct from:
* A ''brāhm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ṇ&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्राह्मण) (masculine, pronounced {{IPA-sa|ˈbraːhməɳə|}}), (which literally means "pertaining to prayer") is a prose commentary on the [[Veda|Vedic mantras]]—an integral part of the Vedic literature.
* A ''brāhm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ṇ&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्राह्मण) (masculine, same pronunciation as above), means priest; in this usage the word is usually rendered in English as "[[Brahmin]]". This usage is also found in the [[Atharva Veda]]. In neuter plural form, Brahmāṇi. See [[Vedic priest]].
* ''[[Ishvara]]'', (lit., Supreme Lord), in Advaita, is identified as a partial worldly manifestation (with limited attributes) of the ultimate reality, the attributeless Brahman. In [[Visishtadvaita]] and [[Dvaita]], however, Ishvara (the Supreme Controller) has infinite attributes and the source of the impersonal Brahman.
* ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]'', the expansions of Brahman/God into various forms, each with a certain quality. In the Vedic religion, there were 33 devas, which later became exaggerated to 330 million devas. In fact, devas are themselves regarded as more mundane manifestations of the One and the Supreme Brahman (See [[Para Brahman]]). The Sanskrit word for "ten million" also means group, and 330 million devas originally meant 33 types of divine manifestations.

==History and literature==

===Vedic===
''Brahman'' is a concept present in Vedic [[Samhita]]s, the oldest layer of the [[Vedas]] dated to the 2nd millennium BCE. For example,&lt;ref name=barbarah29/&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
The ''Ṛcs'' are limited (''parimita''),
The ''Samans'' are limited,
And the ''Yajuses'' are limited,
But of the Word ''Brahman'', there is no end.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Taittiriya Samhita VII.3.1.4|Translated by Barbara Holdrege&lt;ref name=barbarah29&gt;Barbara Holdrege (1995), Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791416402}}, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept is extensively discussed in the Upanishads embedded in the Vedas (see next section), and also mentioned in the [[Vedas#Vedanga|vedāṅga]] (the limbs of Vedas) such as the Srauta sutra 1.12.12 and Paraskara Gryhasutra 3.2.10 through 3.4.5.&lt;ref name=mauricebrahman/&gt;

[[Jan Gonda]] states that the diverse reference of ''Brahman'' in the Vedic literature, starting with Rigveda Samhitas, convey "different senses or different shades of meaning".&lt;ref name=jangondameaning&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1962), Some Notes on the Study of Ancient-Indian Religious Terminology, ''History of Religions'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 269–271&lt;/ref&gt; There is no one single word in modern Western languages that can render the various shades of meaning of the word ''Brahman'' in the Vedic literature, according to Jan Gonda.&lt;ref name=jangondameaning/&gt; In verses considered as the most ancient, the Vedic idea of ''Brahman'' is the "power immanent in the sound, words, verses and formulas of Vedas". However, states Gonda, the verses suggest that this ancient meaning was never the only meaning, and the concept evolved and expanded in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1962), Some Notes on the Study of Ancient-Indian Religious Terminology, ''History of Religions'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 271–272&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upanishads===
[[File:Mozzercork - Heart (by).jpg|thumb|Swan (Hansa, हंस) is the symbol for Brahman-Atman in Hindu iconography.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Jones (2005), ''Encyclopedia of religion'', Volume 13, Macmillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028657332}}, page 8894, Quote: "In Hindu iconography the swan personifies Brahman-Atman, the transcendent yet immanent ground of being, the Self."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denise Cush (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415556231}}, page 697&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The primary focus on the early Upanishads is ''Brahmavidya'' and ''Atmavidya'', that is the knowledge of Brahman and the knowledge of Atman (self, soul), what it is and how it is understood.&lt;ref&gt;R. Prasad and P. D. Chattopadhyaya (2008), ''A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept'', {{ISBN|978-8180695445}}, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; The texts do not present a single unified theory, rather they present a variety of themes with multiple possible interpretations, which flowered in post-Vedic era as premises for the diverse schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=sphilips/&gt;

[[Paul Deussen]] states that the concept of ''Brahman'' in the Upanishads expands to [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[ontology|ontological]] and [[soteriology|soteriological]] themes, such as it being the "primordial reality that creates, maintains and withdraws within it the universe",&lt;ref name=pauldeussen243&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 243, 325–344, 363, 581&lt;/ref&gt; the "principle of the world",&lt;ref name=pauldeussen243/&gt; the "[[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 358, 371&lt;/ref&gt; the "general, universal",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 305, 476&lt;/ref&gt; the "cosmic principle",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 110, 315–316, 495, 838–851&lt;/ref&gt; the "ultimate that is the cause of everything including all gods",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 211, 741–742&lt;/ref&gt; the "divine being, Lord, distinct God, or God within oneself",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 308–311, 497–499&lt;/ref&gt; the "knowledge",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 181, 237, 444, 506–544, 570–571, 707, 847–850&lt;/ref&gt; the "soul, sense of self of each human being that is fearless, luminuous, exalted and blissful",&lt;ref name=pauldeussen52&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 52, 110, 425, 454, 585–586, 838–851&lt;/ref&gt; the "essence of liberation, of spiritual freedom",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 173–174, 188–198, 308–317, 322–324, 367, 447, 496, 629–637, 658, 707–708&lt;/ref&gt; the "universe within each living being and the universe outside",&lt;ref name=pauldeussen52/&gt; the "essence and everything innate in all that exists inside, outside and everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 600, 619–620, 647, 777&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavin Flood summarizes the concept of ''Brahman'' in the Upanishads to be the "essence, the smallest particle of the cosmos and the infinite universe", the "essence of all things which cannot be seen, though it can be experienced", the "self, soul within each person, each being", the "truth", the "reality", the "absolute", the "bliss" (''ananda'').&lt;ref name=gavinflood84/&gt;

According to [[Radhakrishnan]], the sages of the [[Upanishads]] teach Brahman as the ultimate essence of material phenomena that cannot be seen or heard, but whose nature can be known through the development of self-knowledge (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atma jnana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, S., ''The Principal Upanisads'', HarperCollins India, 1994, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The Upanishads contain several ''mahā-vākyas'' or "Great Sayings"  on the concept of Brahman:&lt;ref name="EoH 270"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0816073368|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Upanishad discuss the metaphysical concept of Brahman in many ways, such as the Śāṇḍilya doctrine in Chapter 3 of the Chandogya Upanishad, among of the oldest Upanishadic texts.&lt;ref name=hume314/&gt; The Śāṇḍilya doctrine on Brahman is not unique to Chandogya Upanishad, but found in other ancient texts such as the Satapatha Brahmana in section 10.6.3. It asserts that Atman (Soul, Self inside man) exists, the Brahman is identical with Atman, that the Brahman is inside man—thematic quotations that are frequently cited by later schools of Hinduism and modern studies on Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=hume314/&gt;&lt;ref name=gjha314&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English#page/n165/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad with Shankara Bhashya] Ganganath Jha (Translator), pages 150–157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For modern era cites:

==Discussion==

The concept Brahman has a lot of undertones of meaning and is difficult to understand. It has relevance in :
* [[Metaphysics]]
* [[Ontology]]
* [[Axiology]] ([[Ethics]] &amp; [[Aesthetics]])
* [[Teleology]]
* [[Soteriology]]

===Brahman as a metaphysical concept===
Brahman is the key metaphysical concept in various schools of Hindu philosophy. It is the theme in its diverse discussions to the two central questions of [[metaphysics]]: what is ultimately real, and are there principles applying to everything that is real?&lt;ref&gt;Edward Craig (1998), [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/metaphysics/ Metaphysics], Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISBN|978-0415073103}}, Accessed (13 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Brahman is the ultimate "eternally, constant" reality, while the observed universe is a different kind of reality but one which is "temporary, changing" [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] in various orthodox Hindu schools. Maya pre-exists and co-exists with Brahman—the Ultimate Reality, The Highest Universal, the Cosmic Principles.&lt;ref name=aegough&gt;Archibald Edward Gough (2001), ''The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415245227}}, pages 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the concept of Brahman, Hindu metaphysics includes the concept of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]—or soul, self—which is also considered ultimately real.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt; The various schools of Hinduism, particularly the [[dualism (Indian philosophy)|dual]] and non-dual schools, differ on the nature of Atman, whether it is distinct from Brahman, or same as Brahman. Those that consider Brahman and Atman as distinct are theistic, and [[Dvaita Vedanta]] and later [[Nyaya]] schools illustrate this premise.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. Perrett (Editor, 2000), ''Indian Philosophy: Metaphysics'', Volume 3, Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|978-0815336082}}, page xvii;&lt;br&gt;K. K. Chakrabarti (1999), ''Classical Indian Philosophy of Mind: The Nyaya Dualist Tradition'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791441718}} pages 279–292&lt;/ref&gt; Those that consider Brahman and Atman as same are monist or pantheistic, and [[Advaita Vedanta]], later [[Samkhya]]&lt;ref&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), ''Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age'', Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, pages 60-62&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] schools illustrate this metaphysical premise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Lipner]] (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S. Mittal and G. Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0415215277}}, pages 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Patton (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S. Mittal and G.

Fowler (1996), ''Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices'', Sussex University Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723608}}, pages 135–137&lt;/ref&gt; In schools that equate Brahman with Atman, Brahman is the sole, ultimate reality.&lt;ref name="acdas"/&gt; The predominant teaching in the Upanishads is the spiritual identity of soul within each human being, with the soul of every other human being and living being, as well as with the supreme, ultimate reality ''Brahman''.&lt;ref&gt;William Indich (2000), ''Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812512}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hacker (1978), Eigentumlichkeiten dr Lehre und Terminologie Sankara: Avidya, Namarupa, Maya, Isvara, in Kleine Schriften (Editor: L. Schmithausen), Franz Steiner Verlag, Weisbaden, pages 101–109 (in German), also pages 69–99;&lt;br&gt;[http://www.vedantaadvaita.org/AdvaitaVedanta_3.htm Advaita Vedanta - A Bird's Eye View], Topic III: ''Philosophy of Advaita Vedanta'', D. Krishna Ayyar (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the metaphysics of the major schools of Hinduism, Maya is perceived reality, one that does not reveal the hidden principles, the true reality—the Brahman. Maya is unconscious, Brahman-Atman is conscious. Maya is the literal and the effect, Brahman is the figurative ''Upādāna''—the principle and the cause.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt; Maya is born, changes, evolves, dies with time, from circumstances, due to invisible principles of nature. Atman-Brahman is eternal, unchanging, invisible principle, unaffected absolute and resplendent consciousness. Maya concept, states Archibald Gough, is "the indifferent aggregate of all the possibilities of emanatory or derived existences, pre-existing with Brahman", just like the possibility of a future tree pre-exists in the seed of the tree.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt;

While Hinduism sub-schools such as Advaita Vedanta emphasize the complete equivalence of ''Brahman'' and ''Atman'', they also expound on Brahman as ''[[saguna Brahman]]''—the Brahman with attributes, and ''[[nirguna Brahman]]''—the Brahman without attributes.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.7825/2164-6279.1250|title = Heirarchies{{sic|hide=y}} in the Nature of God?

===Brahman as an ontological concept===
Brahman, along with Soul/Self (Atman) are part of the ontological&lt;ref&gt;that is things, beings or truths that are presumed to exist for its philosophical theory to be true, and what is the nature of that which so exists?; see: Edward Craig (1998), [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/ontology/ Ontology], ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', {{ISBN|978-0415073103}}&lt;/ref&gt; premises of Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Craig (1998), [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/ontology/ Ontology], ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', {{ISBN|978-0415073103}}, Accessed (13 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H.

A Causal Objection], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 51, No. 4, pages 492–506&lt;/ref&gt; Different schools of Indian philosophy have held widely dissimilar ontologies. [[Buddhism]] and [[Carvaka]] school of Hinduism deny that there exists anything called "a soul, a self" (individual Atman or Brahman in the cosmic sense), while the orthodox schools of Hinduism, [[Jainism]] and [[Ajivika]]s hold that there exists "a soul, a self".&lt;ref&gt;K.

Brahman as well the Atman in every human being (and living being) is considered equivalent and the sole reality, the eternal, self-born, unlimited, innately free, blissful Absolute in schools of Hinduism such as the [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]].&lt;ref name=barbarasca&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S.

Morgan (2015), ''Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy of Sport'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415829809}}, pages 135–136, '''Quote''': "As a dualistic philosophy largely congruent with Samkhya's metaphysics, Yoga seeks liberation through the realization that Atman equals Brahman; it involves a cosmogonic dualism: purusha an absolute consciousness, and prakriti original and primeval matter."&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing one's own self is knowing the God inside oneself, and this is held as the path to knowing the ontological nature of Brahman (universal Self) as it is identical to the Atman (individual Self). The nature of Atman-Brahman is held in these schools, states Barbara Holdrege, to be as a pure being (''sat''), consciousness (''cit'') and full of bliss (''ananda''), and it is formless, distinctionless, nonchanging and unbounded.&lt;ref name=barbarasca/&gt;

In theistic schools, in contrast, such as [[Dvaita Vedanta]], the nature of Brahman is held as eternal, unlimited, innately free, blissful Absolute, while each individual's soul is held as distinct and limited which can at best come close in eternal blissful love of the Brahman (therein viewed as the Godhead).&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney and Tony Stewart (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S. Mittal and G. Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0415215277}}, pages 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

Other schools of Hinduism have their own ontological premises relating to Brahman, reality and nature of existence. [[Vaisheshika]] school of Hinduism, for example, holds a substantial, realist ontology.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kloetzli and Alf Hiltebeitel (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S. Mittal and G. Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0415215277}}, page 554&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carvaka]] school denied Brahman and Atman, and held a materialist ontology.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Myers (2000), ''Brahman: A Comparative Theology'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700712571}}, pages 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahman as an axiological concept===
Brahman and Atman are key concepts to Hindu theories of [[axiology]]: ethics and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;R. Prasad and P. D. Chattopadhyaya (2008), ''A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept'', {{ISBN|978-8180695445}}, pages 56–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Pande (1990), ''Foundations of Indian Culture'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807105}}, pages 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ananda'' (bliss), state Michael Myers and other scholars, has axiological importance to the concept of Brahman, as the universal inner harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Myers (1998), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400017 Śaṅkarācārya and Ānanda], ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 48, No. 4, pages 553–567&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Hartman (2002), ''The Knowledge of Good: Critique of Axiological Reason'', Rodopi, {{ISBN|978-9042012202}}, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars equate Brahman with the highest value, in an axiological sense.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. P. Mahadevan (1954), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397291 The Metaphysics of Śaṁkara], ''Philosophy East and Wes''t, Vol. 3, No. 4, pages 359–363&lt;/ref&gt;

The axiological concepts of Brahman and Atman is central to Hindu theory of values.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (1999), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40018229 The Puruṣārthas: An Axiological Exploration of Hinduism], ''The Journal of Religious Ethics'', Vol. 27, No. 2, pages 223–256&lt;/ref&gt; A statement such as ‘I am Brahman’, states Shaw, means ‘I am related to everything,’ and this is the underlying premise for compassion for others in Hinduism, for each individual's welfare, peace, or happiness depends on others, including other beings and nature at large, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Shaw (2011), [http://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/comparativephilosophy/s1/Freedom-East-and-West-by-J-L-Shaw.pdf Freedom: East and West], ''SOPHIA'', Vol 50, Springer Science, pages 481–497&lt;/ref&gt; Tietge states that even in non-dual schools of Hinduism where Brahman and Atman are treated ontologically equivalent, the theory of values emphasizes individual agent and ethics. In these schools of Hinduism, states Tietge, the theory of action are derived from and centered in compassion for the other, and not egotistical concern for the self.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine L Tietge (1997), ''Ontology and Genuine Moral Action: Jñaña (Intuitive Perception) Ethics and Karma-Yoga in Sankara's Advaita Vedanta and Schopenhauer's On the Basis of Morality'', Ph.D. Thesis, Dept. of Philosophy, Southern Illinois University (US), [http://philpapers.org/rec/TIEOAG Archive Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The axiological theory of values emerges implicitly from the concepts of Brahman and Atman, states Bauer.&lt;ref name=nancybauer/&gt; The aesthetics of human experience and ethics are one consequence of self-knowledge in Hinduism, one resulting from the perfect, timeless unification of one's soul with the Brahman, the soul of everyone, everything and all eternity, wherein the pinnacle of human experience is not dependent on an afterlife, but pure consciousness in the present life itself.&lt;ref name=nancybauer/&gt; It does not assume that an individual is weak nor does it presume that he is inherently evil, but the opposite: human soul and its nature is held as fundamentally unqualified, faultless, beautiful, blissful, ethical, compassionate and good.&lt;ref name=nancybauer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2000), ''Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195644418}}, pages 57–61&lt;/ref&gt; Ignorance is to assume it evil, liberation is to know its eternal, expansive, pristine, happy and good nature.&lt;ref name=nancybauer&gt;Nancy Bauer (1987), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399082 Advaita Vedānta and Contemporary Western Ethics], ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 37, No. 1, pages 36–50&lt;/ref&gt; The axiological premises in the Hindu thought and Indian philosophies in general, states Nikam, is to elevate the individual, exalting the innate potential of man, where the reality of his being is the objective reality of the universe.&lt;ref name=nikam/&gt; The Upanishads of Hinduism, summarizes Nikam, hold that the individual has the same essence and reality as the objective universe, and this essence is the finest essence; the individual soul is the universal soul, and Atman is the same reality and the same aesthetics as the Brahman.&lt;ref name=nikam&gt;N. A. Nikam (1952), A Note on the Individual and His Status in Indian Thought, ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 2, No. 3, pages 254–258&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahman as a teleological concept===
Brahman and Atman are very important teleological concepts. [[Teleology]] deals with the apparent purpose, principle or goal of something. In the first chapter of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], these questions are dealt with. It says :
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
"People who make inquiries about brahman say:

What is the cause of Brahman? Why were we born? By what do we live? On what are we established? Governed by whom, O you who know Brahman, do we live in pleasure and in pain, each in our respective situation?
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Svetashvatara Upanishad|Hymns 1.1&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduwebsite.com/sveta.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://estudantedavedanta.net/Svetasvatara_Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Tyagisananda%20%281949%29%20{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[Sanskrit-English].pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The main purpose of the Brahman and why it exists is a subjective question according to the [[Upanishads]]. One can only find out its true purpose when one becomes the Brahman as the 'Brahman' is all the knowledge one can know itself. Hence, complete answers for anything in life can only be determined or obtained when the Brahman is realized as the Brahman is all the complete knowledge itself. This is said in the [[Aitareya Upanishad]] 3.3 and [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 4.4.17 and many other [[Upanishads]].

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Knowledge is the eye of all that, and on knowledge it is founded. Knowledge is the eye of the world, and knowledge, the foundation. Brahman is knowing.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Aitereya Upanishad|Hymns 3.3&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/13/CLF-aitareya_upanishad.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://esamskriti.com/essays/Aitareya-Upanishad.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the reasons to why the Brahman should be realized according to the Upanishads is because it removes suffering from a person's life. This is because the person has the ability and knowledge to discriminate between the unchanging (Atman and Brahman) and the ever-changing ([[Prakrit]]) and so the person is not attached to the transient. Hence, the person is only content with the self and not his body or anything other than the self.

In [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 3.9.26 it mentions that the atman 'neither trembles in fear nor suffers injury' and in the [[Isha Upanishad]] 6-7 it too talks about suffering as non existent when one becomes the Brahman as they see the self in all beings and all beings in the self. Therefore, the apparent purpose of Brahman is in discussion in the [[Upanishads]] but the Brahman itself is the only self-contained purpose and true goal according to the [[Upanishads]], so posing the question is redundant. The [[Upanishads]] consider the Brahman the only actual worthwhile goal in life and ultimately one should aim to become it as it is the means and an end in and of itself to ultimate knowledge, immortality, etc. So the question of what is the ultimate purpose of everything including the Brahman is answered by realizing or attaining the Brahman as the Brahman itself is ultimate knowledge. Hence, the Brahman is a teleological concept as it is the ultimate purpose and goal of everything possible and permeates everything and is in everything.

===Brahman as a soteriological concept: Moksha===
{{Main|Moksha}}

The orthodox schools of Hinduism, particularly Vedanta, Samkhya and Yoga schools, focus on the concept of Brahman and Atman in their discussion of [[moksha]]. The Advaita Vedanta holds there is no being/non-being distinction between Atman and Brahman. The knowledge of Atman (Self-knowledge) is synonymous to the knowledge of Brahman inside the person and outside the person. Furthermore, the knowledge of Brahman leads to a sense of oneness with all existence, self-realization, indescribable joy, and moksha (freedom, bliss),&lt;ref&gt;Anantanand Rambachan (1994), ''The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas'', University of Hawaii Press, pages 124–125&lt;/ref&gt; because Brahman-Atman is the origin and end of all things, the universal principle behind and at source of everything that exists, consciousness that pervades everything and everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta Up to Śaṃkara and His Pupils'', Volume 3, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 210–215&lt;/ref&gt;

The theistic sub-school such as Dvaita Vedanta of Hinduism, starts with the same premises, but adds the premise that individual souls and Brahman are distinct, and thereby reaches entirely different conclusions where Brahman is conceptualized in a manner similar to God in other major world religions.&lt;ref name=mmyers/&gt; The theistic schools assert that moksha is the loving, eternal union or nearness of one's soul with the distinct and separate Brahman ([[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] or equivalent henotheism). Brahman, in these sub-schools of Hinduism is considered the highest perfection of existence, which every soul journeys towards in its own way for moksha.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Stafford (2010) "Dvaita, Advaita, And Viśiṣṭadvaita: Contrasting Views Of Mokṣa", ''Asian Philosophy'', pages 215–224&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book ''Sunlightenment: Science of Universe''&lt;ref name="Fathor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brain Mechanic|first=Fathor|title=Sunlightenment: Science of Universe|year=2018|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sunlightenment-Science-Universe-Fathor-ebook/dp/B07KX3X393/}}&lt;/ref&gt; says 'Brahman as the State of a Ripple made by the Great Swan as it olam infinites, like the Pulses of Universe as the State of Sun.'

==Schools of thought==

===Vedanta===
The concept of Brahman, its nature and its relationship with Atman and the observed universe, is a major point of difference between the various sub-schools of the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.

====Advaita Vedanta====
{{Main|Advaita Vedanta}}
{{Advaita}}
[[Advaita Vedanta]] espouses [[nondualism]]. ''Brahman'' is the sole unchanging reality,&lt;ref name=acdas&gt;AC Das (1952), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397304 Brahman and Māyā in Advaita Metaphysics], ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 2, No. 2, pages 144–154&lt;/ref&gt; there is no duality, no limited individual souls nor a separate unlimited cosmic soul, rather all souls, all of existence, across all space and time, is one and the same.&lt;ref name=jeffreybrodd/&gt;&lt;ref name=barbarasca/&gt;&lt;ref name=rdalal&gt;Rosen Dalal (2014), Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-8184752779}}, see article on Brahman&lt;/ref&gt; The universe and the soul inside each being is Brahman, and the universe and the soul outside each being is Brahman, according to Advaita Vedanta. Brahman is the origin and end of all things, material and spiritual. ''Brahman'' is the root source of everything that exists. He states that Brahman can neither be taught nor perceived (as an object of intellectual knowledge), but it can be learned and realized by all human beings.&lt;ref name="Arvind Sharma 2007 pages 19-40"/&gt; The goal of Advaita Vedanta is to realize that one's Self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'') gets obscured by ignorance and false-identification ("[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]"). When Avidya is removed, the Atman (Soul, Self inside a person) is realized as identical with Brahman.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; The Brahman is not an outside, separate, dual entity, the Brahman is within each person, states Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. ''Brahman'' is all that is eternal, unchanging and that which truly exists.&lt;ref name=acdas/&gt; This view is stated in this school in many different forms, such as "''Ekam sat''" ("Truth is one"), and all is ''Brahman''.

The universe does not simply come from Brahman, it ''is'' Brahman. According to [[Adi Shankara]], a proponent of [[Advaita Vedanta]], the knowledge of Brahman that [[shruti]] provides cannot be obtained by any other means besides self inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Anantanand Rambachan (1994), ''The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas.'' University of Hawaii Press, pages 125, 124&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Advaita Vedanta]], nirguna Brahman, that is the Brahman without attributes, is held to be the ultimate and sole reality.&lt;ref name=acdas/&gt;&lt;ref name=williamw/&gt; Consciousness is not a property of Brahman but its very nature. In this respect, Advaita Vedanta differs from other Vedanta schools.&lt;ref&gt;[Sangeetha Menon (2007), ''Advaita Vedānta''], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

Example verses from [[Bhagavad-Gita]] include:
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
The [[Yajna|offering]] is Brahman; the oblation is Brahman;
offered by Brahman into the fire of Brahman.
Brahman will be attained by him,
who always sees Brahman in action. – Hymn 4.24&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (Editor) and Winthrop Sargeant (Translator), ''The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, page 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane D. Fowler (2012), ''The Bhagavad Gita'', Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

And his light within,

&lt;/poem&gt;
|Bhagavad Gita|}}

====Dvaita Vedanta====
{{Vaishnavism}}
Brahman of [[Dvaita]] is a concept similar to God in major world religions.&lt;ref name=mmyers/&gt; Dvaita holds that the individual soul is dependent on God, but distinct.&lt;ref name=mmyers/&gt;

Dvaita propounds Tattvavada which means understanding differences between [[Tattva]]s (significant properties) of entities within the universal substrate as follows:{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

# Jîva-Îshvara-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between the soul and Vishnu
# Jada-Îshvara-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between the insentient and Vishnu
# Mitha-jîva-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between any two souls
# Jada-jîva-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between insentient and the soul
# Mitha-jada-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between any two insentients

====Achintya Bheda Abheda====
The [[Acintya Bheda Abheda]] philosophy is similar to [[Dvaitadvaita]] (differential [[monism]]). In this philosophy, Brahman is not just impersonal, but also personal.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} That Brahman is Supreme Personality of Godhead, though on first stage of realization (by process called [[jnana]]) of Absolute Truth, He is realized as impersonal Brahman, then as personal Brahman having eternal [[Vaikunta|Vaikuntha]] abode (also known as Brahmalokah sanatana), then as [[Paramatma]] (by process of [[yoga]]–[[meditation]] on Supersoul, Vishnu-God in heart)—Vishnu ([[Narayana]], also in everyone's heart) who has many abodes known as Vishnulokas (Vaikunthalokas), and finally (Absolute Truth is realized by [[bhakti]]) as [[Bhagavan]], Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is source of both Paramatma and Brahman (personal, impersonal, or both).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Vaishnavism===
{{Main|Vaishnavism}}
All [[Vaishnava]] schools are [[panentheistic]] and perceive the Advaita concept of identification of Atman with the impersonal Brahman as an intermediate step of self-realization, but not [[Moksha|Mukti]], or final liberation of complete God-realization through [[Bhakti Yoga]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a form of Achintya Bheda Abheda philosophy, also concludes that Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to them, Brahman is Lord Vishnu/Krishna; the universe and all other manifestations of the Supreme are extensions of Him.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Bhakti movement===
{{main|Bhakti movement}}

The Bhakti movement of Hinduism built its theosophy around two concepts of Brahman—''Nirguna'' and ''Saguna''.&lt;ref name=karen21&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), ''The Embodiment of Bhakti'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nirguna'' Brahman was the concept of the Ultimate Reality as formless, without attributes or quality.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefxxvii&gt;Jeaneane D. Fowler (2012), ''The Bhagavad Gita'', Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, pages xxvii–xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saguna'' Brahman, in contrast, was envisioned and developed as with form, attributes and quality.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefxxvii/&gt; The two had parallels in the ancient pantheistic unmanifest and theistic manifest traditions, respectively, and traceable to Arjuna-Krishna dialogue in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlernirgunasaguna&gt;Jeaneane D. Fowler (2012), ''The Bhagavad Gita'', Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, pages 207–211&lt;/ref&gt; It is the same Brahman, but viewed from two perspectives, one from ''Nirguni'' knowledge-focus and other from ''Saguni'' love-focus, united as Krishna in the Gita.&lt;ref name=fowlernirgunasaguna/&gt; ''Nirguna'' bhakta's poetry were ''Jnana-shrayi'', or had roots in knowledge.&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt; ''Saguna'' bhakta's poetry were ''Prema-shrayi'', or with roots in love.&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt; In Bhakti, the emphasis is reciprocal love and devotion, where the devotee loves God, and God loves the devotee.&lt;ref name=fowlernirgunasaguna/&gt;

Jeaneane Fowler states that the concepts of Nirguna and Saguna Brahman, at the root of Bhakti movement [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], underwent more profound development with the ideas of [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, particularly those of [[Adi Shankara]]'s Advaita Vedanta, [[Ramanuja]]'s Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, and [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefxxvii/&gt; Two 12th-century influential treatises on bhakti were ''Sandilya Bhakti Sutra''—a treatise resonating with Nirguna-bhakti, and ''Narada Bhakti Sutra''—a treatise that leans towards Saguna-bhakti.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Frazier and Gavin Flood (2011), ''The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies'', Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-0826499660}}, pages 113–115&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nirguna'' and ''Saguna'' Brahman concepts of the Bhakti movement has been a baffling one to scholars, particularly the ''Nirguni'' tradition because it offers, states David Lorenzen, "heart-felt devotion to a God without attributes, without even any definable personality".&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenns/&gt; Yet given the "mountains of ''Nirguni'' bhakti literature", adds Lorenzen, bhakti for ''Nirguna Brahman'' has been a part of the reality of the Hindu tradition along with the bhakti for ''Saguna Brahman''.&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenns&gt;David Lorenzen (1996), ''Praises to a Formless God: Nirguni Texts from North India'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791428054}}, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; These were two alternate ways of imagining God during the bhakti movement.&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt;

==Buddhist understanding of Brahman==

Buddhism rejects the Upanishadic doctrine of Brahman and Atman (soul, permanent self, essence).{{refn|group=note|Merv Fowler, ''Zen Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 2005), p. 30: "''Upanisadic'' thought is anything but consistent; nevertheless, there is a common focus on the acceptance of a totally transcendent Absolute, a trend which arose in the ''Vedic'' period. This indescribable Absolute is called Brahman [...] The true Self and Brahman are one and the same. Known as the Brahman-Atman synthesis, this theory, which is central to ''Upanisadic'' thought, is the cornerstone of Indian philosophy. The Brahman-Atman synthesis, which posits the theory of a permanent, unchanging self, was anathema to Buddhists, and it was as a reaction to the synthesis that Buddhism first drew breath.

According to Merv Fowler, some forms of Buddhism have incorporated concepts that resemble that of Brahman.{{refn|group=note|Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 34: "It was inevitable that the non-theistic philosophy of orthodox Buddhism should court the older Hindu practices and, in particular, infuse into its philosophy the belief in a totally transcendent Absolute of the nature of Brahman."}} As an example, Fowler cites the early [[Sarvastivada]] school of Buddhism, which "had come to accept a very pantheistic religious philosophy, and are important because of the impetus they gave to the development of Mahayana Buddhism".&lt;ref&gt;Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Theodore De Bary, in the doctrines of the [[Yogacara]] school of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], "the Body of Essence, the Ultimate Buddha, who pervaded and underlay the whole universe [...] was in fact the World Soul, the Brahman of the Upanishads, in a new form".&lt;ref&gt;William Theodore De Bary, cited in Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fowler, some scholars have identified the Buddhist ''[[nirvana]]'', conceived of as the Ultimate Reality, with the Hindu Brahman/atman; Fowler claims that this view "has gained little support in Buddhist circles."&lt;ref&gt;Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler asserts  that the authors of a number of Mahayana texts took pains to differentiate their ideas from the Upanishadic doctrine of Brahman.{{refn|group=note|Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 82: "The original writers of these Mahayana texts were not at all pleased that their writings were seen to contain the Brahman of the ''Upanisads'' in a new form. The authors of the ''Lankavatara''  strenuously denied that the womb of Tathagatahood, [...] was in any way equatable with the 'eternal self', the Brahmanical ''atman'' of ''Upanisadic'' thought. Similarly, the claim in the ''Nirvana Sutra'' that the Buddha regarded Buddhahood as a 'great atman' caused the Yogacarins considerable distress."}}

===Brahma as a surrogate for Brahman in Buddhist texts===
The spiritual concept of Brahman is far older in the Vedic literature, and some scholars suggest deity Brahma may have emerged as a personal conception and icon with form and attributes (saguna version) of the impersonal, nirguna (without attributes), formless universal principle called Brahman.&lt;ref name=brucesullivan&gt;Bruce Sullivan (1999), Seer of the Fifth Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816763}}, pages 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hindu texts, one of the earliest mention of deity Brahma along with [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] is in the fifth ''Prapathaka'' (lesson) of the [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]], probably composed in late 1st millennium BCE, after the rise of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=hume51&gt;{{citation|first=Robert Ernest|last=Hume|title=The Thirteen Principal Upanishads |url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n443/mode/2up|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1921|pages=422–424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

Jayatilleke|title=Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcs41sp8ON4C |year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0619-1 |pages=68, 374}}, Quote: "We may conclude from the above that the rise of Buddhism is not far removed in time from, though it is prior to, the Maitri Upanishad".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1968), The Hindu Trinity, Anthropos, Vol. 63, pages 215–219&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Buddhists attacked the concept of Brahma, states Gananath Obeyesekere, and thereby [[polemic]]ally attacked the Vedic and Upanishadic concept of gender neutral, abstract metaphysical Brahman.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2006p179"/&gt; This critique of Brahma in early Buddhist texts aim at ridiculing the [[Vedas]], but the same texts simultaneously call ''metta'' (loving-kindness, compassion) as the state of union with Brahma. The early Buddhist approach to Brahma was to reject any creator aspect, while retaining the value system in the Vedic [[Brahmavihara]] concepts, in the Buddhist value system.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2006p179"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEK4Qgm7Z0kC |year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2609-0 |pages=177–179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin Wiltshire, the term "Brahma loka" in the Buddhist canon, instead of "Svarga loka", is likely a Buddhist attempt to choose and emphasize the "truth power" and knowledge focus of the Brahman concept in the Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin G.

 }}
The metaphysical concept of Brahman, particularly as ''nirguni Brahman''—attributeless, formless, eternal Highest Reality—is at the foundation of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name=sskohli39&gt;S. S. Kohli (1993), ''The Sikh and Sikhism'', Atlantic, {{ISBN|81-71563368}}, page 39&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is observed through ''nirguni Bhakti'' by the Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;Hardip Syan (2014), in ''The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies'' (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Mandair (2011), Time and religion-making in modern Sikhism, in ''Time, History and the Religious Imaginary in South Asia'' (Editor: Anne Murphy), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415595971}}, pages 188–190&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gauri, which is part of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], Brahman is declared as "One without a second", in Sri Rag "everything is born of Him, and is finally absorbed in Him", in Var Asa "whatever we see or hear is the manifestation of Brahman".&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Kohli (1993), ''The Sikh and Sikhism'', Atlantic, {{ISBN|81-71563368}}, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; Nesbitt states that the first two words, ''Ik Onkar'', in the twelve-word Mul Mantar at the opening of the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib, has been translated in three different ways by scholars: "There is one god", "This being is one", and as "One reality is".&lt;ref name=eleanor/&gt;

Similar emphasis on "One without a second" for metaphysical concept of Brahman, is found in ancient texts of Hinduism, such as the Chandogya Upanishad's chapter 6.2.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Muller]], [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/92/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1] Oxford University Press, pages 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 156–157, 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas about God and Highest Reality in Sikhism share themes found in the ''Saguna'' and ''Nirguna'' concepts of Brahman in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=sskohli39/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Mandair (2009), ''Postcolonial Philosophy of Religion'' (Editor: Purushottama Bilimoria, Andrew B. Irvine), Springer, {{ISBN|978-9400791770}}, pages 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Ultimate Reality (Brahman) is also referred in Sikhism as ''Nam'', ''Sat-naam'' or ''Naam'', and ''Ik Oankar'' like Hindu [[Om]] symbolizes this Reality.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1998), ''The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices'', 2nd edition, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pages 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. S. Singha (2009), ''Sikh Studies'', Vol. 7, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170102458}}, page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahman in Jainism==
Scholars contest whether the concept of Brahman is rejected or accepted in Jainism. The concept of a theistic God is rejected by Jainism, but ''Jiva'' or "Atman (soul) exists" is held to be a metaphysical truth and central to its theory of rebirths and [[Kevala Jnana]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray Billington (1997), ''Understanding Eastern Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415129657}}, page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Bissett states that Jainism accepts the "material world" and "Atman", but rejects Brahman—the metaphysical concept of Ultimate Reality and Cosmic Principles found in the ancient texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;James Bissett, ''Cultural and Religious Heritage of India'', Volume 2: Jainism (Editors: Sharma and Sharma), Mittal, {{ISBN|81-70999553}}, page 81&lt;/ref&gt; Goswami, in contrast, states that the literature of Jainism has an undercurrent of monist theme, where the self who gains the knowledge of Brahman (Highest Reality, Supreme Knowledge) is identical to Brahman itself.&lt;ref&gt;C. Caillat and N. Balbir (2008), ''Jaina Studies'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832473}}, pages ix–x&lt;/ref&gt; Jaini states that Jainism neither accepts nor rejects the premise of Ultimate Reality (Brahman), instead Jain ontology adopts a many sided doctrine called ''[[Anekantavada]]''. This doctrine holds that "reality is irreducibly complex" and no human view or description can represent the Absolute Truth.&lt;ref name=pjaini&gt;P. Jaini (1998), ''The Jaina Path of Purification'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-1578-5}}, pages 90–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Koller (2004), "Why is Anekāntavāda important?", (Editor: Tara Sethia, Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-2036-3}}, pages 400–407&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have understood and realized the Absolute Truth are the liberated ones and the Supreme Souls, with [[Kevala Jnana]].&lt;ref name=pjaini/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14871">In [[set theory]], the '''cardinality of the continuum''' is the [[cardinality]] or "size" of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes called the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]]. It is an [[Infinite set|infinite]] [[cardinal number]] and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;|\mathbb R|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt; (a lowercase [[fraktur (script)|fraktur script]] "c").

The real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; are more numerous than the [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; has the same number of elements as the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;. Symbolically, if the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as [[aleph number#Aleph-naught|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;]], the cardinality of the continuum is
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c = 2^{\aleph_0} &gt; \aleph_0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;}}
This was proven by [[Georg Cantor]] in his [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|1874 uncountability proof]], part of his groundbreaking study of different infinities; the inequality was later stated more simply in his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]. Cantor defined cardinality in terms of [[bijective function]]s: two sets have the same cardinality if and only if there exists a bijective function between them.

Between any two real numbers ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'', no matter how close they are to each other, there are always infinitely many other real numbers, and Cantor showed that they are as many as those contained in the whole set of real numbers. In other words, the [[open interval]] (''a'',''b'') is [[equinumerous]] with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R.&lt;/math&gt; This is also true for several other infinite sets, such as any ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; (see [[space filling curve]]). That is,
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;|(a,b)| = |\mathbb R| = |\mathbb R^n|.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The smallest infinite cardinal number is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number#Aleph-naught|aleph-null]]). The second smallest is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number#Aleph-one|aleph-one]]). The [[continuum hypothesis]], which asserts that there are no sets whose cardinality is strictly between &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;,}} implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c = \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

===Uncountability===
[[Georg Cantor]] introduced the concept of [[cardinality]] to compare the sizes of infinite sets. He famously showed that the set of real numbers is [[uncountably infinite]]; i.e. &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt; is strictly greater than the cardinality of the [[natural numbers]], &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;:
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 &lt; \mathfrak c.&lt;/math&gt;}}
In other words, there are strictly more real numbers than there are integers. Cantor proved this statement in several different ways. See [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]] and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]].

===Cardinal equalities===
A variation on Cantor's diagonal argument can be used to prove [[Cantor's theorem]] which states that the cardinality of any set is strictly less than that of its [[power set]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;|A| &lt; 2^{|A|}&lt;/math&gt;, and so the power set &lt;math&gt;\wp(\mathbb N)&lt;/math&gt; of the [[natural number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; is uncountable. In fact, it can be shown{{citation_needed|date=September 2017}} that the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\wp(\mathbb N)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt;:
#Define a map &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb R\to\wp(\mathbb Q)&lt;/math&gt; from the reals to the power set of the [[rationals]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; by sending each real number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the set &lt;math&gt;\{q \in \mathbb{Q}: q \leq x\}&lt;/math&gt; of all rationals less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (with the reals viewed as [[Dedekind cut]]s, this is nothing other than the [[inclusion map]] in the set of sets of rationals). This map is [[Injective function|injective]] since the rationals are [[Dense set|dense]] in '''R'''. Since the rationals are countable we have that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c \le 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
#Let &lt;math&gt;\{0,2\}^{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of infinite [[sequence]]s with values in set &lt;math&gt;\{0,2\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set has cardinality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; (the natural [[bijection]] between the set of binary sequences and &lt;math&gt;\wp(\mathbb N)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[indicator function]]). Now associate to each such sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; the unique real number in the [[unit interval|interval]] &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with the [[Ternary numeral system|ternary]]-expansion given by the digits &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\dotsc&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i3^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th digit after the fractional point is &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; with respect to base &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;. The image of this map is called the [[Cantor set]]. It is not hard to see that this map is injective, for by avoiding points with the digit 1 in their ternary expansion we avoid conflicts created by the fact that the ternary-expansion of a real number is not unique. We then have that &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} \le \mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;.
By the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]] we conclude that
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c = |\wp(\mathbb{N})| = 2^{\aleph_0}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The cardinal equality &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}^2 = \mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; can be demonstrated using [[cardinal arithmetic]]:
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}^2 = (2^{\aleph_0})^2 = 2^{2\times{\aleph_0}} = 2^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak{c}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

By using the rules of cardinal arithmetic one can also show that
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c^{\aleph_0} = {\aleph_0}^{\aleph_0} = n^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak c^n = \aleph_0 \mathfrak c = n \mathfrak c = \mathfrak c,&lt;/math&gt;}}
where ''n'' is any finite cardinal ≥ 2, and
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak c ^{\mathfrak c}  =  (2^{\aleph_0})^{\mathfrak c}  = 2^{\mathfrak c\times\aleph_0} = 2^{\mathfrak c},&lt;/math&gt;}}
where &lt;math&gt;2 ^{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of the power set of '''R''', and &lt;math&gt;2 ^{\mathfrak c} &gt; \mathfrak c &lt;/math&gt;.

===Alternative explanation for &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c} = 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;===
Every real number has at least one infinite [[decimal expansion]].  For example,
{{block indent|1=1/2 = 0.50000...}}
{{block indent|1=1/3 = 0.33333...}}
{{block indent|1=π = 3.14159....}}
(This is true even when the expansion repeats as in the first two examples.)
In any given case, the number of digits is [[countable set|countable]] since they can be put into a [[one-to-one correspondence]] with the set of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. This fact makes it sensible to talk about (for example) the first, the one-hundredth, or the millionth digit of π. Since the natural numbers have cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0,&lt;/math&gt; each real number has &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; digits in its expansion.

Since each real number can be broken into an integer part and a decimal fraction, we get
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c} \leq \aleph_0 \cdot 10^{\aleph_0} \leq 2^{\aleph_0} \cdot {(2^4)}^{\aleph_0} = 2^{\aleph_0 + 4 \cdot \aleph_0} = 2^{\aleph_0} &lt;/math&gt;}}

since
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 + 4 \cdot \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;}}

On the other hand, if we map &lt;math&gt;2 = \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\{3, 7\}&lt;/math&gt; and consider that decimal fractions containing only 3 or 7 are only a part of the real numbers, then we get
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} \leq {\mathfrak c} \,.&lt;/math&gt;}}

and thus
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c} = 2^{\aleph_0} \,.&lt;/math&gt;}}

==Beth numbers==
{{main|Beth number}}
The sequence of beth numbers is defined by setting &lt;math&gt;\beth_0 = \aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beth_{k+1} = 2^{\beth_k}&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt; is the second beth number, '''beth-one''':
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c = \beth_1.&lt;/math&gt;}}
The third beth number, '''beth-two''', is the cardinality of the power set of '''R''' (i.e. the set of all subsets of the [[real line]]):
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;2^\mathfrak c = \beth_2.&lt;/math&gt;}}

==The continuum hypothesis==
{{main|Continuum hypothesis}}

The famous continuum hypothesis asserts that &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt; is also the second [[aleph number]]  &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the continuum hypothesis states that there is no set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; whose cardinality lies strictly between &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt;
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\nexists A \quad:\quad \aleph_0 &lt; |A| &lt; \mathfrak c.&lt;/math&gt;}}
This statement is now known to be independent of the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the axiom of choice (ZFC). That is, both the hypothesis and its negation are consistent with these axioms. In fact, for every nonzero [[natural number]] ''n'', the equality &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\aleph_n&lt;/math&gt; is independent of ZFC (the case &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; is the continuum hypothesis). The same is true for most other alephs, although in some cases equality can be ruled out by [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]] on the grounds of [[cofinality]], e.g.,  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}\neq\aleph_\omega.&lt;/math&gt; In particular,  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; could be either &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\omega_1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[first uncountable ordinal]], so it could be either a [[successor cardinal]] or a [[limit cardinal]], and either a [[regular cardinal]] or a [[singular cardinal]].

==Sets with cardinality of the continuum==

A great many sets studied in mathematics have cardinality equal to &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt;. Some common examples are the following:

{{unordered list
|the [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
|any ([[Degeneracy (mathematics)|nondegenerate]]) closed or open [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (such as the [[unit interval]] &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;)

For instance, for all &lt;math&gt;a,b \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; we can define the bijection
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f\colon \mathbb{R} &amp;\to (a,b)\\
 x &amp;\mapsto \frac{\arctan x + \frac{\pi}{2}}{\pi}\cdot(b - a) + a
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}
Now we show the cardinality of an infinite interval. For all &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; we can define the bijection
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f\colon \mathbb{R} &amp;\to (a,\infty)\\
 x &amp;\mapsto \begin{cases}
\arctan x + \frac{\pi}{2} + a &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \\
x + \frac{\pi}{2} + a &amp; \mbox{if } x \ge 0
\end{cases}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}
and similarly for all &lt;math&gt;b \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f\colon \mathbb{R} &amp;\to (-\infty,b)\\
 x &amp;\mapsto \begin{cases}
x - \frac{\pi}{2} + b &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \\
\arctan x - \frac{\pi}{2} + b &amp; \mbox{if } x \ge 0
\end{cases}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}
|the [[irrational number]]s
|the [[transcendental numbers]]

We note that the set of real [[algebraic number]]s is countably infinite (assign to each formula its [[Gödel numbering|Gödel number]].) So the cardinality of the real algebraic numbers is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, the real algebraic numbers and the real transcendental numbers are disjoint sets whose union is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, since the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;, the cardinality of the real transcendental numbers is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c - \aleph_0 = \mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;. A similar result follows for complex transcendental numbers, once we have proved that  &lt;math&gt;\left\vert \mathbb{C} \right\vert = \mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;.
|the [[Cantor set]]
|[[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Gouvea&gt;[http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/pubs/AMM-March11_Cantor.pdf Was Cantor Surprised?], [[Fernando Q. Gouvêa]], ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
|the [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;

We note that, per Cantor's proof of the cardinality of Euclidean space,&lt;ref name=Gouvea /&gt; &lt;math&gt;\left\vert \mathbb{R}^2 \right\vert = \mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;. By definition, any &lt;math&gt;c\in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; can be uniquely expressed as &lt;math&gt;a + bi&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a,b \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. We therefore define the bijection
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f\colon \mathbb{R}^2 &amp;\to \mathbb{C}\\
 (a,b) &amp;\mapsto a+bi
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}
|the [[power set]] of the [[natural number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})&lt;/math&gt; (the set of all subsets of the natural numbers)
|the set of [[sequences]] of integers (i.e. all functions &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, often denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;)
|the set of sequences of real numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
|the set of all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
|the [[Euclidean topology]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the set of all [[open set]]s in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;)
|the [[Borel algebra|Borel σ-algebra]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the set of all [[Borel set]]s in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;).
}}

==Sets with greater cardinality==

Sets with cardinality greater than &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt; include:

*the set of all subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., power set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;)
*the set [[Power set#Representing subsets as functions|2&lt;sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sup&gt;]] of [[indicator function]]s defined on subsets of the reals (the set &lt;math&gt;2^{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphic]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the indicator function chooses elements of each subset to include)
*the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of all functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
*the [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue σ-algebra]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the set of all [[Lebesgue measurable]] sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
*the set of all [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue-integrable]] functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
*the set of all [[Measurable function|Lebesgue-measurable]] functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
*the [[Stone–Čech compactification]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
*the set of all automorphisms of the (discrete) field of complex numbers.

These all have cardinality &lt;math&gt;2^\mathfrak c = \beth_2&lt;/math&gt; ([[Beth number#Beth two|beth two]]).

== History ==
Although ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' prohibited racial segregation in schools, in 1963, Chicago's public schools continued to be segregated as a result of residential segregation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This was exacerbated by the migration of more black Americans from the [[Southern United States]] to Chicago during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; School boundary lines were drawn specifically to preserve racial segregation, even as predominantly [[Black people|black]] schools grew overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2013/10/22/1963-chicago-public-school-boycott|title=1963 Chicago Public School Boycott|website=Chicago Tonight {{!}} WTTW|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes were held in hallways, and there were not enough books for all of the students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some schools held double shifts, meaning students attended less than a full day of class.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/today-in-history-200-000-students-boycotted-chicago-public-schools/|title=Today in history: 200,000 students boycotted Chicago public schools|last=Russum|first=Barbara|date=2012-10-22|work=People's World|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than send black students to underpopulated white schools, CPS Superintendent Benjamin Willis instituted the use of mobile classrooms; 625&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/31/obituaries/bc-willis-86-led-chicago-schools-for-13-years.html|title=B.C. Willis, 86; Led Chicago Schools for 13 Years|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|date=1988-08-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[aluminium]] trailers parked in the parking lots and playgrounds of overcrowded schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rosie Simpson of [[Englewood, Chicago]], coined the term "Willis Wagons" to describe the mobile classrooms. At one high school, these trailers were used to maintain segregation within the school; black students' classes were held in Willis Wagons, while white students went to class in the school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Freedom Day ==
In response to the school segregation enacted by Willis, community members began organizing resistance. Organizers included Chicago activist [[Albert Raby]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO) took the lead, organizing "Freedom Day," the mass boycott and protest.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JybHqgpKAkC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=sQPpSaWlyj&amp;dq=1963%20chicago%20public%20school%20boycott&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA1|title=Something Better for Our Children: Black Organizing in Chicago Public Schools, 1963–1971|last=Danns|first=Dionne|date=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415935753|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the chairman of the CCCO, Lawrence Landry, "The boycott is an effort to communicate dissatisfaction on how schools are being run."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title=It's freedom day! expect thousands to participate|last=|first=|date=October 22, 1963|work=The Chicago Defender|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Chicago Defender]]'' estimated that forty percent of CPS students would participate in the boycott.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On October 22, 1963, nearly half of all CPS students skipped school, leaving schools on Chicago's [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] and [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] mostly empty.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://facingfreedom.org/public-protest/school-boycott|title=School Boycott {{!}} Facing Freedom|website=facingfreedom.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported that 224,770 students were absent from CPS, amounting to 47 percent of the student population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=224,770 or 47 Pct. of all Pupils, Miss Classes|last=|first=|date=October 23, 1963|work=Chicago Tribune|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the boycott, nearly 10,000 protesters marched in [[Chicago Loop|Chicago's downtown]], stopping outside the Chicago Board of Education offices. [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]] kept protesters from entering the building.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

While Freedom Day was popular and widely covered, it did not have significant impact in changing the policies of Superintendent Willis. This ''[[de facto]]'' school segregation was supported by Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]],&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2013/05/20/remembering-chicagos-great-school-boycott-of-1963|title=Remembering Chicago's great school boycott of 1963|last=Joravsky|first=Ben|work=Chicago Reader|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who went on to nominate two school board members who did not support the CCCO's push for integration. Ultimately, CPS was not moved to integrate after Freedom Day, despite the best efforts of Black activists and the CCCO.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Use of Willis Wagons prevailed,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Willis himself did not retire until 1966 (albeit four months before the end of his term).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, the size of the first Freedom Day protest inspired subsequent boycotts in Chicago&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=2 BIG UPSETS: BOYCOTT WINS!

Re-thinking the diversity of knowledge : cognitive polyphasia, belief and representation [online]. London: LSE Research Online.
Available at: http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2628&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''polloi'' "many", ''phasis'' "appearance".

In his research on popular [[social representations|representations]] of [[psychoanalysis]] in [[France]], [[Serge Moscovici]]  observed that different and even contradictory modes of thinking about the same issue often co-exist. In contemporary societies people are "speaking" medical, psychological, technical, and political languages in their daily affairs. By extending this phenomenon to the level of thought he suggests that "the dynamic co-existence—interference or specialization—of the distinct modalities of [[knowledge]], corresponding to definite relations between man and his environment, ''determines a state of cognitive polyphasia''".&lt;ref&gt;Moscovici, S. (1976). ''La psychanalyse son image et son public''. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension and applications==
[[Cognition|Cognitive]] systems do not habitually develop towards a state of [[consistency]]. Instead, judgements are based on representational terms being dominant in one field of interests, while playing a minor role in other fields; that is, thoughts tend to be ''locally'' but not ''globally consistent''. Contemporaries in Western and non-western societies alike face a variety of situations where particular modes of reasoning fit better than others. Some are more useful in the family and in matters involving relatives, and others are more apt in situations involving political, economic, societal, religious or scientific matters. Knowledge and talking are always situated.

[[Science|Scientific]] explanations frequently contradict everyday and common-sense based explanations. Nevertheless, people tend to apply each of the two ways of [[explanation]] in their talk depending on the audience and the particular situation. This can be observed with health related issues where [[Sandra Jovchelovitch]] and Marie-Claude Gervais have shown how members of the Chinese community attend to Western medical doctors and simultaneously apply traditional Chinese treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Jovchelovitch, S., &amp; Gervais, M.-C. (1999). Social representations of health and illness: The case of the Chinese community in England. Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology, 9, 247-260.&lt;/ref&gt; In their study on modernization processes in the educated middle-class of the city of [[Patna]] in [[India]], [[Wolfgang Wagner (social psychologist)|Wolfgang Wagner]], [[Gerard Duveen]], Matthias Themel and Jyoti Verma showed a similar behaviour with regard to [[mental health]]. Respondents in the study were more likely to mention traditional ideas about treatment in private and family contexts while displaying "modern" psychiatric reasoning in the public.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, W., Duveen, G., Verma, J. &amp; Themel, M. (2000). "I have some faith and at the same time I don't believe in it" - Cognitive polyphasia and culture change. Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology, 10, 301-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[social representations|social representation theory]] such contradictions highlight the role of representational systems as serving the purpose of relating, social belonging and communication in everyday life. This contrasts with [[science]] that aims at veridical representations of the world according to standards of scientific evidence. Both systems of knowledge have their own domain of validity but they are at the same time fluid enough to cross-fertilize each other in [[dialog]]ical encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, W. &amp; Hayes, N. (2005). Everyday Discourse and Common-Sense—The Theory of Social Representations. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jovchelovitch, S. (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42141">'''Communication privacy management''' ('''CPM'''), originally known as '''communication boundary management''', is a systematic research theory designed to develop an evidence-based understanding of the way people make decisions about revealing and concealing private information. CPM theory suggests that individuals maintain and coordinate privacy boundaries (the limits of what they are willing to share) with various communication partners depending on the perceived benefits and costs of information disclosure. It was first developed by [[Sandra Petronio]] in 1991.

Petronio uses a boundary [[metaphor]] to explain the privacy management process. '''[[#Private boundaries|Privacy boundaries]]''' draw divisions between private information and public information. This theory argues that when people disclose private information, they depend on a [[#Rule-based management system|rule-based management system]] to control the level of accessibility. An individual's privacy boundary governs his or her
[[self-disclosure]]s. Once a disclosure is made, the negotiation of privacy rules between the two parties is required. A
distressing sense of "[[#Boundary turbulence|boundary turbulence]]" can arise when
clashing expectations for privacy management are identified. Having the mental image of protective boundaries is central to understanding the five core principles of Petronio's CPM:

(1) People believe they own and have a right to control their private information. (2) People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules. (3) When others are told or given access to a person's private information, they become co-owners of that information. (4) Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules about telling others. (5) When co-owners of private information don't effectively negotiate and follow mutually held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result.

== Background ==
Petronio's communication privacy management (CPM) theory is built on Altman's dialectical
conception of privacy as a process of opening and closing a boundary to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communication Privacy Management in Electronic Commerce|last = |first = |date = 2001|journal = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altman and Taylor's [[social penetration theory]] focused on [[self-disclosure]] as the primary way to develop close relationships. However, openness is only part of the story. We also have a desire for privacy. When Petronio first developed this theory in 1991, it was called ''communication boundary management''. In 2002, she renamed it to ''communication privacy management'', underscoring private disclosure as the main thrust of the theory.

==Theory elements==

=== Private information ===
[[File:CPM Basic Suppositions.png|thumb|230x230px]]
The content of concealing and revealing is private information. Petronio favored the term "private information" over the term "self-disclosure" because there are many [[caveat lector|caveats]] inherent to private information disclosure that are not present with self-disclosure.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20022"&gt;Petronio, S. (2002). Boundaries of Privacy: Dialectics of Disclosure. Albany, NY: SUNY Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the motivations behind sharing are many, including but not limited to: sharing a burden, righting a wrong, and influencing others.&lt;ref name="Petronio 19912"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S | year = 1991 | title = Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples | url = | journal = Communication Theory | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 311–335 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.1991.tb00023.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since private information can be about yourself or others, the decision as to what is private and whom to share it with plays a part when taking the idea of boundaries into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=Alicia|last2=Derlega|first2=Valerien|last3=Morrow|first3=Jennifer|title=What is Highly Personal Information and How Is It Related to Self-Disclosure Decision-Making?|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=Aug 20, 2006|volume=23|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1080/08824090600668915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to share is ultimately left up to the process of the privacy rule management system which combines rules for coordination of information, characteristics of disclosure, and attributes of the nature of boundaries.

=== Private boundaries ===
To understand CPM theory it is important to follow the metaphor of the [[Personal boundaries|boundary]]. Private boundaries are the division between private information and public information.&lt;ref name="Petronio, et al. 19982"&gt;Petronio, S., Ellmers, N., Giles, H., Gallois, C. (1998). (Mis)communicating across boundaries: Interpersonal and intergroup considerations. Communication Research, 25, 571–595.
&lt;/ref&gt; When private information is shared, there will be a '''collective boundary'''. When private information remains with an individual and is not disclosed, the boundary is called a '''personal boundary'''. An individual's private information is protected by their boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing. Boundaries can be relatively permeable (easy to cross) or relatively impregnable (rigid and difficult to cross).
[[File:Personal and Collective Boundaries.jpg.png|thumb|Personal and collective boundaries]]

=== Control and ownership ===
Communication privacy management theory understands information (as well as boundaries) as something that is owned, and each owner must decide whether or not they are willing to have a confidant, i.e. a co-owner, to that information. In some cases, it is preferable for the owner to have another person share the private information, though this may not be the case for the confidant. [[Concurrent estate|Co-ownership]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;of information is characterized by two things: heavy responsibility and a knowledge of the rules for a particular disclosure. However, ownership can be felt to different degrees, and the understanding of disclosure rules can be different from owner to owner. Also, the act of sharing is coupled along with the realization that boundaries have expanded and that they may never return to their original state. It is the responsibility of co-owners to decide and make clear if, when, and how information can or should be shared with others.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Durham 20082"&gt;Petronio, S., &amp; Durham, W.T. (2008). Communication privacy management theory. In L.A. Baxter &amp; D.O. Braithwaite (Eds.), Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (pp. 309-322). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule-based management system===
[[File:Three processes.jpg.png|thumb|right]]

As the framework for understanding the decisions people make about private information, this system allows for management on the individual and collective levels through three processes: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.

=== Management dialectics ===
[[File:Boundaries in a Life Span.png|thumb|224x224px]]
Petronio's understanding and argument of privacy management rests on the idea that a dialectic exists wherever the decision is made to disclose or conceal private information. Thus, costs and benefits must be weighed and consideration must be given to how such information will be owned, used, and spread.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Rierson 2009"&gt;Petronio, S., &amp; Reierson, J. (2009). Regulating the Privacy of Confidentiality: Grasping the Complexities through Communication Privacy Management Theory. Uncertainty, Information Management, and Disclosure Decisions: Theories and Applications. 365–383.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of [[dialectic]] that Petronio borrows from can be found in Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery's theory of [[relational dialectics]], wherein various approaches to the contradictory impulses of relational life are discussed. The theory focuses on the idea that there are not only two contradictory stances within a relationship, but that at any given moment decisions are weighed using multiple viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Baxter, Montgomery 1996"&gt;Baxter, L.A., &amp; Montgomery, B. (1996). Relating Dialogues and dialectics: New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rule-based management system ==
Petronio views boundary management as a rule based process, not an individual decision. This rule-based management system allows for management on the individual and collective levels. This system depends on three privacy rule management to regulate the process of revealing and concealing private information: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.

===Privacy rule characteristics===
The characteristics of privacy rules are divided into two sections, attributes and development. Privacy rule attributes refer to how people obtain rules of privacy and understand the properties of those rules.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991"&gt;Petronio, S. (1991). Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples. [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]], 1, 311–335.&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally done through social interactions where the boundaries for rules are put to the test. Rules are set in different social situations which dictate the type of disclosure that should be made, for example, the difference between disclosure at a family member's birthday party versus an office event at work. Petronio asserts that each situation will come with its own set of rules for managing privacy that are learned over time. The development of privacy rule characteristics has to do with the criteria implemented to decide if and how information will be shared.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20072"&gt;Petronio, S. (2007). Translational Research Endeavors and the Practices of Communication Privacy Management. Journal of Applied Communication Research, 35, 218-222.
&lt;/ref&gt; Communication privacy management theory general lists those criteria as the following:

|Owners of information can form certain bonds that lead to disclosure, or conversely the express interest in forming bonds may cause private information to be shared. Motivations for sharing can include reciprocity or self-clarification.
|If you have disclosed a great deal to me, out of reciprocity, I might be motivated to disclose to you
|-
|''Risk/benefit ratio ''
|catalyst
|Owners of private information evaluate risks relative to the benefits of disclosure or maintaining information private. 
|Our rules are influenced by our assessment of the ratio of risks to benefits of disclosing
|}
With these five criteria, personal and group privacy rules are developed, but disclosure of private information necessitates the inclusion of others within the boundary of knowledge, which demands an understanding between parties for how to coordinate ownership of knowledge.

===Boundary coordination===
An individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing, and allow certain parts of the public access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. Once private information is shared, co-owners must coordinate the boundaries of privacy and disclosure based on boundary permeability, boundary linkage, and boundary ownership.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991" /&gt; Petronio describes this mutual boundary coordination by co-owners as drawing the same borders on a map around a shared piece of information.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20072"/&gt; By no means is this an easy process considering that each owner will approach the information from distinct viewpoints and referencing their personal criteria for privacy rule development.  
*'''''Boundary permeability''''' refers to the nature of the invisible divisions that keep private information from being known outside of an individual or particular group. When private information is kept with one owner, the boundaries are said to be thick because there is less possibility for information to make its way out into the public sphere. Once information is shared to one or more persons, the boundaries for that private information expand, become more permeable, and are considered ''thin''.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Durham 20082"/&gt;
*'''''Boundary linkage''''' has to do with how owners are connected when they build associations through a boundary. For example, doctors and patients are linked to each other in such a way that private information is passed within their boundaries constantly. These linkages can be strong or weak depending on how information was shared or whether a co-owner wanted to know or was prepared to learn a new piece of information. Case in point, the link between an organization and a spy meant to infiltrate the organization is weak because the two are not coordinated on how information will be maintained private or disclosed.&lt;ref name="Caughlin, Afifi 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caughlin | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Afifi | first2 = T.D. | year = 2004 | title = When is topic avoidance unsatisfying? Examining moderators of the association between avoidance and dissatisfaction | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 479–513 | doi=10.1093/hcr/30.4.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Boundary ownership''''' refers to the responsibilities and rights each person has over the control of the spread of information that they [[Ownership|own]]. When working to mutually create the boundary of privacy it is key for all parties to have a clear understanding of whether information should be shared, who it should be shared with, and when it should be shared.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991" /&gt; A simple example of this is the planning of a surprise birthday party; all those involved in planning must agree on how the information about the party will be spread so as not to ruin the surprise. As new guests are invited, they become an owner of the information and are bound to the rules of privacy maintenance, or else the surprise could be ruined.

===Boundary turbulence===
Often, boundaries are not coordinated as well as they should be to maintain the level of privacy or exposure desired by owners – this leads to problems known as boundary turbulence. The coordination of shared boundaries is key to avoiding over-sharing. When the boundaries are unclear, owners may come into conflict with one another. [[Clear-air turbulence|Turbulence]] among co-owners is caused when rules are not mutually understood by co-owners and when the management of private information comes into conflict with the expectations each owner had,&lt;ref name="Petronio 20022"/&gt; which can happen for a number of reasons.

Boundary turbulence can be caused by mistakes, such as an uninvited party overhearing private information (causing weak boundary linkage) or a disclosure an owner might make under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. Disclosure to a new party was not the intent, but, when it happens, other co-owners can feel that their expectations of maintaining boundaries have been violated.

In addition, boundary turbulence occurs when a co-owner intentionally breaks the coordinated boundary of privacy to disclose private information.&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Afifi | first1 = T. D. | year = 2003 | title = Feeling caught" in stepfamilies: managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 729–755 | doi=10.1177/0265407503206002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such intentional disclosure would be a daughter revealing to a doctor that her father is indeed an active smoker when the father has told the doctor that he no longer smokes after his heart surgery. The daughter in this case must weigh the risks of breaking the family privacy boundary against the benefits of the doctor being better informed of her father's condition.

Lastly, boundary turbulence can also occur when there have not been pre-existing rules for a situation. For example, with the emergence of [[social media]] and, in particular, [[Facebook]], boundary rules had not been established. As parents began to join Facebook and [[Friending|"friend"]] their children, the children felt turbulence. There was a perception of privacy invasion between the parent-child relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kanter |first1=M. |last2=Robbins |first2=S. |title=The Impact of Parents "Friending" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent-Child Relationship Quality |journal=Journal of Communication |date=2012 |page=900 of 917 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x |volume=62|issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of boundary turbulence, co-owners of information can feel that their expectations have been violated and lose trust in other co-owners. In these cases, the goal of each party is to reduce turbulence by reestablishing and coordinating boundaries.&lt;ref name="Petronio, et al. 19982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003" /&gt; It should be noted, however, that turbulence doesn't always have a negative outcome, there has been studies which show that turbulence within relationships can lead to stronger and improved relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLaren|first1=R.M.|title=Emotions, Communicative responses, and relational consequences of boundary turbulence|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|date=August 2013|volume=30|issue=5|pages=606–626|doi=10.1177/0265407512463997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication privacy management can be applied across different contexts, primarily include: (1) family communication, with a particular focus on parental privacy invasions, (2) online social media, (3) health, and (4) relational issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Brief Status Report on Communication Privacy Management Theory|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = Journal of Family Communication|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/15267431.2013.743426|pmid = |volume=13 |pages=6–14|last1 = Petronio|first1 = Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (5) work environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Seumas | last2 = Weckert | first2 = John | year = 2000 | title = Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet | url = | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 255–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family communication===

Specific applications of CPM highlight family privacy management. Research focused on secrets and topic avoidance, such as questions of concealment to [[Stepfamily|stepfamily members]] feeling caught, and parents-adolescent conversations about sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'Feeling caught' in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules|last = Afifi|first = T.D.|date = 2003|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0265407503206002|pmid =|volume=20|issue = 6|pages=729–755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family privacy research over the decades are also inspired specifically by the chapter of parental privacy invasion. For example, work by Hawk and his colleagues explore perceived parental invasions from the view of adolescents in reaction to such issues as control attempts, solicitation of information, and conflict outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Brief Status Report on Communication Privacy Management Theory|last = Petronio|first = Sandra|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Family Communication|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/15267431.2013.743426|pmid =|volume=13|pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way that family communication uses CPM is with child bearing or the lack thereof; whom childless-couples choose to disclose to that they voluntarily do not want children is another way CPM has been explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durham|first1=Wesley|title=The Rules-Based Process of Revealing/Concealing the Family Planning Decisions of Voluntarily Child-Free Couples: A Communication Privacy Management Perspective|journal=Communication Studies|date=May 21, 2008|volume=59|issue=2|pages=132–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pregnancy loss due to [[miscarriage]] could be a unique CPM case in the family setting as couples often manage this information jointly as they decide whether to share the miscarriage with people outside the dyad. The research found that couples frame miscarriage as a shared but distinct experience and that both members exert rights of ownership over the information. Couples' privacy rules centered on issues of social support and others' need to know about the loss. Even though couples described their privacy rules as implicitly understood, they also recalled having explicit conversations to develop rules. We discuss how the management of co-owned information can improve communication and maintain relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=738c24b7-e7cd-414e-a7c6-b864903d0734%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100015365&amp;db=ufh|title=Co-ownership of Private Information in the Miscarriage Context|last=Bute, J.

===Online social media===

Recent researchers apply CPM to investigate privacy management for online [[blog]]ging, Facebook usage and [[online dating]]. Further, there have been investigations into parental behavior that is enacted through online social media; specifically when parents 'friend' their children and the management of privacy that ensues from that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanter|first1=Maggie|last2=Robbins|first2=Stephanie|title=The Impact of Parents "Friending" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent–Child Relationship Quality|journal=Journal of Communication|date=October 2012|volume=62|issue=5|pages=900–917|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy practices in social network sites often appear paradoxical, as content-sharing behavior stands in conflict with the need to reduce disclosure-related harms. Some study explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Friends Only: Examining a Privacy-Enhancing Behavior in Facebook|last = Fred Stutzman, Jacob Kramer-Duffield|first = |date = April 2010|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar research has been done on the perceptions of teachers' disclosures on Facebook and their impact on credibility. The relevance and valence of disclosures were compared between disclosures made in the classroom and those made on Facebook and were found to be significantly different. Students' perceptions of teacher credibility were shown to decrease as relevance of disclosures increased and as negativity increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=738c24b7-e7cd-414e-a7c6-b864903d0734%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=101487383|title=Perceptions of Teachers’ Disclosures on Facebook and their Impact on Credibility|last=Coffelt, T. A., Strayhorn|first=J., &amp; Tillson, L. D|date=2014|website=|publisher=Kentucky Journal of Communication|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular SNS Twitter was examined as well. In the research, Twitter was regarded as an onion with multiple privacy layers. The research found out that there were significant differences at the descriptive and inferential levels among the multiple dimensions of private information, including daily lives, social identity, competence, socio-economic status, and health. Private information regarding daily lives and entertainment was disclosed easily and located at the outermost layer of the disclosure onion. In contrast, health-related private information was concealed and located within the innermost layer of the disclosure onion. What's more, there were significant differences among current Twitter users, nonusers, and dropouts with regard to personality traits and privacy concerns about Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=95546c19-b61c-4971-9aaf-7eea06c2bcb6%40sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=90180338&amp;db=ufh|title=The roles of virtual identity discrepancy and personality traits in communication privacy management on Twitter|last=Jin, Seung|first=A Annie|date=2013|website=|publisher=New Media &amp; Society|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people especially highschool and college students are an important part of SNS users. A recent study examined college students' privacy concerns and impacts on their Twitter usage behaviors. Regression analyses concluded that Control and Boundary Rules of Private Information on Twitter significantly predict daily minutes spent on Twitter accounts. However, the same CPM variables did not predict college students' other Twitter usage behaviors (e.g., weekly inquiries and total months of using Twitter). This shows the intricate connection between students' privacy concern and their usage behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=9b8072d1-acbd-46d4-9d13-ec29624248db%40sessionmgr105&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=118972200|title=Exploring the Relationship between Privacy Concerns and Social Media Use among College Students: A Communication Privacy Management Perspective|last=YANG, K. C.|first=PULIDO, A.|date=2016|website=|publisher=Intercultural Communication Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health communication ===

Informed by principles of CPM, health communication research using CPM to explore health privacy issues has become a growth area. Earlier study investigated physician disclosure of medical mistakes. Recently there have been a number of studies focused on ways that privacy issues influence patient care, confidentiality and control over ownership, choices about disclosure, for instance, with stigmatized health-related illness such as [[HIV/AIDS]], about [[e-health]] information, and the [[digitization]] of healthcare.

One recent study about how [[overweight]] and [[obese]] individuals handle their personal history after they become a normal weight. The result shows that the vast majority of participants perceived more benefits from disclosing their larger identity than risks, regardless of weight-loss method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romo|first=Lynsey K|title=How Formerly Overweight and Obese Individuals Negotiate Disclosure of Their Weight Loss|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=b31b1607-b9a5-4eef-a969-8e138716da4d%40sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4207&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=116509531&amp;db=aph|journal=Health Communication|volume=31|issue=9|pages=1145–1154|doi=10.1080/10410236.2015.1045790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using CPM, ''Celebrity Health Narratives &amp; the Public Health'' offers the "first extensive look at celebrity health sagas, this book examines the ways in which their stories become our stories, influencing public perception and framing dialog about wellness, disease and death. These private-yet-public narratives drive fund-raising, reduce stigma and influence policy. Celebrities such as [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]], [[Michael J. Fox]], and [[Christopher Reeve]]—as well as 200 others included in the study—have left a lasting legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-7971-9|title=McFarland - a leading independent publisher of academic and nonfiction books|website=www.mcfarlandbooks.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship issues===

Many studies emphasize the use of CPM in relationships because of the concepts of disclosure and boundaries. Not only romantic relationships, but also friendships are a factor when thinking of CPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McBride|first1=Chad|last2=Bergen|first2=Karla|title=Communication Research: Becoming a Reluctant Confidant: Communication Privacy Management in Close Friendships|journal=Texas Speech Communication Journal|date=2008|volume=33|issue=1|pages=50–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, work on conflict and topic avoidance, considering the relational impact of privacy turbulence, students and faculty relationships, and workplace relationships have all produced useful information that opens new doors regarding CPM-based research.

The mobile phone and its impact on romantic relationships is a good example. After investigating mobile phone usage rules that are negotiated by adolescents and young adults in romantic relationships, findings are that the negotiation of rules is a crucial part of young adult relationships while enhancing trust and fostering harmony were important factors in the rule development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/02500167.2016.1140666|pages= 56–74|title= Mobile communication privacy management in romantic relationships: A dialectical approach|journal= Communicatio|volume= 42|year= 2016|last1= Ngcongo|first1= Mthobeli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPM also appears in the friendship. The study intended to addresses the issue of whether personal traits and predispositions can predict the tendencies to either reveal or conceal secrets shared in confidence by a best friend suggested that a combination of several traits could successfully distinguish those who revealed secrets from those who did not. Significant discriminators included tendency to gossip and depth of disclosure. Implications of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=cd2e4976-6af1-4f4e-984f-f0a0953a3789%40sessionmgr103&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=97239961&amp;db=ufh|title=A Profile of Those Likely to Reveal Friends' Confidential Secrets|last=Bello, R. S|first=Brandau-Brown|date=2014|website=|publisher=Communication Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although privacy violations can be uncomfortable and disruptive, they have the potential for positive outcomes in relationships if addressed. Using CPM theory as a framework, a study surveyed a community sample of 273 adults to examine their retrospective accounts of privacy violations in personal relationships. Results showed that less than half of the sample offered explicit rules for information management, and the majority of participants blamed the confidant for the privacy turbulence. Findings indicated that people often do not share similar information with the violator in the future, but if they do, less than half offer explicit privacy rules during the privacy recalibration process. Confrontation efficacy was positively associated with initiating a conversation about the privacy turbulence and that people who engaged in privacy recalibration were more likely to report forgiveness and relational improvement and less likely to report relational damage than those individuals who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=7f9fc8cf-95ac-4800-b9e5-28c8506b72a3%40sessionmgr107&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=103187596&amp;db=ufh|title=Privacy Recalibration in Personal Relationships: Rule Usage Before and After an Incident of Privacy Turbulence|last=Steuber, Keli Ryan|first=Rachel M. McLaren|date=2015|website=|publisher=Communication Quarterly|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work environments===

CPM has become very applicable in the workplace as personal mobile devices have increasingly been allowed to be brought to work. The concept of [[Bring your own device|Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)]] has stirred conversation on the concept of privacy, security and boundaries between employee and employer. Companies have had to take measures to further secure their network or even decide whether they want to have employee access personal accounts (i.e. email) or devices while on the job. By the same token, some employees argue that companies should not be able to track what is being done on their personal devices or even on company computers even if they are in the work place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Seumas|last2=Weckert|first2=John|title=Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=December 2000|volume=28|issue=3|pages=255–265|doi=10.1023/a:1006232417265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=K.W.|last2=Voas|first2=J.|last3=Hurlburt|first3=G.F.|title=BYOD: Security and Privacy Considerations|journal=IT Professional|date=Sep–Oct 2012|volume=14|issue=5|pages=53–55|doi=10.1109/mitp.2012.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even before stepping foot into the workplace, much can be said about CPM and interviewing. How much we decide to reveal within an interview and the boundaries we have in that situation is directly related to CPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackney|first1=Michael|last2=Kleiner|first2=Brian|title=Conducting an Effective Selection Interview|journal=Work Study|date=1994|volume=43|issue=7|doi=10.1108/eum0000000004009|pages=8–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even interviewing within a job (as a cop, for example) requires a certain sensitivity to people's boundaries and how much private information they are willing to reveal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Martine|last2=Wright|first2=Rebecca|last3=Clark|first3=Susan|title=Improving the Competency of Police Officers in Conducting Investigative Interviews with Children|journal=Police Practice &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=11|issue=3|pages=211–226|doi=10.1080/15614260902830070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercultural communication ===
Several studies tested CPM within intercultural contexts.  For instance, a study that examined intercultural privacy management between foreign English teachers and Japanese co-workers uncovered cultural premises. This "study highlights four cultural premises that garner intercultural privacy management between foreign English language teachers (ELTs) and Japanese coworkers (JCWs) in Japan. The analysis revealed that ELTs: (a) expected not to be a "free space" for privacy inquisition by JCWs, and (b) expected voluntary reciprocity in (egalitarian) workplace relationships. JCWs viewed: (a) privacy inquisitions as acts of kindness/caring and (b) soliciting help from a supervisor as providing opportunities for better care. This study calls for attention to intercultural privacy management and enhances CPM's cultural criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Nathaniel|date=2016-08-24|title=Cultural discourses of privacy: Interrogating globalized workplace relationships in Japan|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|volume=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/17513057.2016.1142601|issn=1751-3057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the same context, foreign English teachers "employed the following management strategies: (a) withdrawal, (b) cognitive restructuring, (c) independent control, (d) lying, (e) omission, (f) avoidance, and (g) gaijin smashing. Japanese co-workers defined privacy as information that should be hidden and managed such information by: (a) drawing clear boundaries by not talking or changing contexts, and (b) being pre-emptive by demarcating privacy boundaries early on within a relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathaniel|first=Simmons,|date=2012-01-01|title=Tales of Gaijin: Health Privacy Perspectives of Foreign English Teachers in Japan|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/kaleidoscope/vol11/iss1/3/|journal=Kaleidoscope: A Graduate Journal of Qualitative Communication Research|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathaniel|first=Simmons,|date=2014-01-01|title=Negotiating Boundaries in a Globalized World: Communication Privacy Management between Foreign English Teachers and Japanese Co-workers in Japan|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:ohiou1400259896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==
There are a few communication theories that are worth noting after understanding CPM in more depth.

[[Expectancy violations theory]] discusses the importance of personal space, [[Territoriality (nonverbal communication)|territoriality]] and the expectations individuals have of another's non verbal communication. Though dealing with physical proximity, we can see the relation between expectancy violations theory and CPM as it pertains to privacy and how close we allow another to come to us. Both physical and intimate proximity requires boundaries to be crossed or permeated.

[[Social penetration theory]] explains how two individuals grow in intimacy and move from one level to the next in their relationships. The popular idea behind social penetration is that individual are like onions; they have layers and as you go deeper, the more intimate you become. For this intimacy to occur, we can safely say that private information needs to be shared and exchanged. As one does this, boundaries are permeated and become co-owned.

Finally, [[coordinated management of meaning]] explains how people establish rules for both creating and interpreting meaning. Similar to CPM, coordinated management of meaning has stages were coordination is achieved, not achieved, or partially achieved. Similarly you can have boundary ownership, boundary turbulence or boundary linkage. Moreover, in order to achieve meaning there needs to be an exchange of information between individuals to decipher. This exchange of private information falls directly into CPM.

==Academic integration==
Communication privacy management theory utilizes a socio-cultural communication tradition within an interpersonal context, and employs both a positivistic and interpretive approach to knowing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Critique==

=== Values ===

Altman speaks to the values of this theory as it advances our thinking by incorporating different "levels" or combinations of participants in communication processes (Altman 2002). Whereas earlier research and theorizing on privacy-disclosure focused on dyads or individuals, a most complicated set of dynamics has been carefully enunciated by Petronio. Petronio also describes communication within families and between family members and outsiders, within and outside work and social groups, and between many combinations of individuals, dyads, and others within and across social boundaries. In addition, her analysis of privacy-disclosure "turbulence", or breaches of desired communication patterns, is articulate and systematic.&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petronio, Martin 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S. | last2 = Martin | first2 = J.N. | year = 1986 | title = Ramifications of revealing private information: A gender gap | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 499–506 | doi=10.1002/1097-4679(198605)42:3&lt;499::aid-jclp2270420317&gt;3.0.co;2-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petronio, Martin, Litlefield 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S.

=== Criticism ===
Some researchers have questioned whether CPM theory truly is dialectical in nature.  It has argued that CPM takes a dualistic approach, treating privacy and disclosure as independent of one another and able to coexist in tandem rather than in the dynamic interplay characteristic of dialectics. This accusation of dualistic thinking might result from the theory's use of the terms ''balance'' and ''equilibrium'' in the early versions of CPM theory. Petronio argues that CPM is not focused on balance in the psychological sense. "Instead, [CPM] argues for coordination with others that does not advocate an optimum balance between disclosure and privacy. As an alternative, the theory claims there are shifting forces with a range of privacy and disclosure that people handle by making judgments about the ''degrees'' [emphasis in original] of privacy and publicness they wish to experience in any given interaction" (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13). Thus, Petronio argues that it is legitimate to call CPM theory dialectical in nature.

In modern [[literary criticism]], in particular of [[genre fiction]], '''conceit''' frequently means an extended [[rhetorical device]], summed up in a short phrase, that refers to a situation which either does not exist or exists very infrequently but which is necessary to the plot. "Faster than light travel" and "superior alien science" are examples from [[science fiction]]; the "hardboiled private gumshoe" is an example from [[detective stories]].

The word conceit was originally coined in the context of [[poetry]], deriving from the root ''concept, conceive''. It has subsequently been extended to other forms of literature, the [[performing arts]], [[painting]], [[photography]], and even [[architecture]].

== Use as praise versus criticism ==

The term '''conceit''' can be used positively or derogatorily.

* In the positive sense, a conceit originally referred to an [[extended metaphor]] with a complex [[logic]] that governs a poetic passage or entire [[poem]]. By juxtaposing, [[:wikt:usurp|usurping]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulating]] images and ideas in surprising ways, a conceit invites the reader into a more sophisticated understanding of an object of comparison. Conceits in English are part of the poetic idiom of [[Mannerism]], during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. This has been extended to describe presentation of any material whose creator uses one or more techniques to effectively induce a desired effect on the reader or viewer, such as setting a mood. In movie-making, examples include deliberately filming in black and white, emphasizing shadows, using panoramic views or employing extended zoom for a scene.
* In a derogatory sense, "conceit" refers to an excessively elaborate, contrived or unconvincing approach to the material being presented, such as a fundamentally flawed idea, preposterous plot device, or pretentious dialog or phrasing. Again, this was originally applied to poetry that someone disliked, and the areas of application later broadened. An example of derogatory use is in the title of economist [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s book, "The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism" &lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hayek. The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism.. https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0226321150&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern writing (e.g., reviews of movies or books, or descriptions of others' inventions or ideas), the word "conceit", when used by itself without preceding adjectives (such as "brilliant" or "unpersuasive"), tends to be used more often as criticism than as praise. Such use is especially common when writing for a broad audience rather than specialists in poetry or literary criticism. Which sense is actually intended, however, must be inferred from the overall content and tone of the passage containing the phrase.

== In poetry ==
===Metaphysical===
[[File:Jonquil Masquerade.jpg|thumb|The flowers are beginning their masquerade as people. [[Narcissus jonquilla|Sir Jonquil]] begins the fun. ([[Walter Crane]], 1899)]]
In [[English literature]] the term is generally associated with the 17th century [[metaphysical poets]], an extension of contemporary usage. The [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] conceit differs from an extended analogy in the sense that it does not have a clear-cut relationship between the things being compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Cushman|author2=Clare Cavanagh|author3=Jahan Ramazani|author4=Paul Rouzer|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics: Fourth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKiC6IeFR2UC&amp;pg=PA290|date=26 August 2012|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=1-4008-4142-9|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Gardner (critic)|Helen Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner (1961) ''The Metaphysical Poets'' ([[Oxford University Press]]) "Introduction" p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that "a conceit is a comparison whose ingenuity is more striking than its justness" and that "a comparison becomes a conceit when we are made to concede likeness while being strongly conscious of unlikeness." An example of the latter occurs in [[John Donne]]'s "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning", in which a couple faced with absence from each other is likened to a compass.

&lt;poem&gt;
Dull sublunary lovers' love
   (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
Absence, because it doth remove
   Those things which elemented it.

But we by a love so much refined,
   That our selves know not what it is,
Inter-assured of the mind,
   Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.

Our two souls therefore, which are one,
   Though I must go, endure not yet
A breach, but an expansion,
   Like gold to airy thinness beat.

If they be two, they are two so
   As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
   To move, but doth, if the other do.

And though it in the center sit,
   Yet when the other far doth roam,
It leans and hearkens after it,
   And grows erect, as that comes home.

Such wilt thou be to me, who must,
   Like th' other foot, obliquely run;
Thy firmness makes my circle just,
   And makes me end where I begun. &lt;/poem&gt;

The metaphysical conceit is often imaginative, exploring specific parts of an experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert H. Ray|title=An Andrew Marvell Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_buTeQdwnKsC&amp;pg=PA106|year=1998|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=978-0-8240-6248-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donne]]'s "[[s:The Flea|''The Flea'']]" is a poem seemingly about fleas in a bed. When [[Philip Sydney|Sir Philip Sidney]] begins a [[sonnet]] with the conventional idiomatic expression "My true-love hath my heart and I have his",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/truelove.htm |title=Sir Philip Sidney. "My true love hath my heart, and I have his." Love sonnet from "Arcadia." |publisher=Luminarium.org |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; he takes the metaphor literally and teases out a number of literal possibilities in the exchange of hearts. The result is a fully formed conceit.

===Petrarchan===
The [[Petrarch]]an conceit is a form of love poetry wherein a man's love interest is referred to in [[hyperbole]]. For instance, the lover is a ship on a stormy sea, and his mistress is either "a cloud of dark disdain" or the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Najat Ismaeel Sayakhan|title=THE TEACHING PROBLEMS OF ENGLISH POETRY IN THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENTS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhlBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|date=8 July 2014|publisher=[[Author House]]|isbn=978-1-4969-8399-2|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradoxical pain and pleasure of lovesickness is often described using [[oxymoron]], for instance uniting peace and war, burning and freezing, and so forth. But images which were novel in the sonnets of [[Petrarch]], in his innovative exploration of human feelings, became clichés in the poetry of later imitators. Romeo uses hackneyed Petrarchan conceits when describing his love for Rosaline as "bright smoke, cold fire, sick health".

== Etymology ==
In the [[Renaissance]], the term (which is related to the word [[concept]]) indicated any particularly fanciful expression of [[wit]], and was later used pejoratively of outlandish poetic metaphors.

Recent [[literary criticism|literary critics]] have used the term to mean simply the style of extended and heightened metaphor common in the Renaissance and particularly in the 17th century, without any particular indication of value. Within this critical sense, the Princeton Encyclopedia makes a distinction between two kinds of conceits: the Metaphysical conceit, described above, and the [[Petrarch]]an conceit. In the latter, human experiences are described in terms of an outsized metaphor (a kind of metaphorical [[hyperbole]]), like the stock comparison of eyes to the sun, which [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] makes light of in his [[Sonnet 130]]: "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun."

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Abundance (Abundantia) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Allegory|Allegorical]] depiction of the Roman goddess [[Abundantia]] with a cornucopia, by [[Rubens]] (''ca.'' 1630)]]

In [[classical antiquity]], the '''cornucopia''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɔr|n|j|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|p|i|ə|,_|ˌ|k|ɔr|n|ə|-}} (from Latin ''cornu copiae''), also called the '''horn of plenty''', was a symbol of abundance and nourishment, commonly a large horn-shaped container overflowing with produce, flowers or nuts.

==In mythology==
[[File:Salvator Rosa (Italian) - Allegory of Fortune - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|''[[Allegory of Fortune]]'' (1658) by [[Salvator Rosa]], representing [[Fortuna]], the Goddess of luck, with the horn of plenty]][[File:Cornucopia.png|right|thumb|Poster of cornucopia for California]]

[[Mythology]] offers multiple [[aition|explanations of the origin]] of the cornucopia. One of the best-known involves the birth and nurturance of the infant [[Zeus]], who had to be hidden from his devouring father [[Kronus]]. In a cave on [[Mount Ida]] on the island of [[Crete]], baby [[Zeus]] was cared for and protected by a number of divine attendants, including the goat [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amaltheia]] ("Nourishing Goddess"), who fed him with her milk. The suckling future king of the gods had unusual abilities and strength, and in playing with his nursemaid accidentally broke off one of her [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s, which then had the divine power to provide unending nourishment, as the foster mother had to the god.&lt;ref&gt;David Leeming, ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 13; Robert Parker, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=F_ATDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=cornucopia&amp;f=false Polytheism and Society at Athens]'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another myth, the cornucopia was created when [[Heracles]] (Roman [[Hercules]]) wrestled with the river god [[Achelous]] and wrenched off one of his horns; river gods were sometimes depicted as horned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 9.87–88, as cited by J. Rufus Fears, "The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), p. 821.&lt;/ref&gt; This version is represented in the ''[[Achelous and Hercules]]'' [[mural painting]] by the [[Regionalism (art)|American Regionalist]] artist [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]].

The cornucopia became the attribute of several [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek]] and [[List of Roman deities|Roman deities]], particularly those associated with the harvest, prosperity, or spiritual abundance, such as personifications of Earth ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]]); the child [[Plutus]], god of riches and son of the grain goddess [[Demeter]]; the [[nymph]] [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]; and [[Fortuna]], the goddess of luck, who had the power to grant prosperity. In [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]], abstract Roman deities who fostered peace ''([[pax Romana]])'' and prosperity were also depicted with a cornucopia, including [[Abundantia]], "Abundance" personified, and [[Annona (goddess)|Annona]], goddess of the [[grain supply to the city of Rome]]. [[Hades]], the classical ruler of the underworld in the [[mystery religions]], was a giver of agricultural, mineral and spiritual wealth, and in art often holds a cornucopia.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Clinton, ''Myth and Cult: The Iconography of the Eleusinian Mysteries'' (Stockholm, 1992), pp. 105–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern depictions==
In modern depictions, the cornucopia is typically a hollow, horn-shaped wicker basket filled with various kinds of festive [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]]. In most of [[North America]], the cornucopia has come to be associated with [[Thanksgiving]] and the harvest.  Cornucopia is also the name of the annual November Food and Wine celebration in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]], British Columbia, Canada.  Two cornucopias are seen in the [[flag of Idaho|flag]] and [[seal of Idaho|state seal]] of [[Idaho]].  The Great [[Seal of North Carolina|Seal]] of [[North Carolina]] depicts Liberty standing and Plenty holding a cornucopia.  The coat of arms of [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]], and the Coat of Arms of the State of [[Victoria, Australia]], also feature the cornucopia, symbolizing prosperity. 

The motif of the cornucopia is used in the book series ''[[The Hunger Games]]''. In the [[Fictional_world_of_The_Hunger_Games#The_Hunger_Games|eponymous gladiatorial games]] described in the series, a large horn-like cache filled with weapons and equipment is placed at the starting point: this cache serves as the focal point of fighting during the games' first minutes, and is even called the "Cornucopia". In the [[The Hunger Games (film)|film adaptation]], the [[national anthem]] of Panem, the series' primary setting, is called "the Horn of Plenty", which is mentioned several times in the lyrics.

The horn of plenty is used for body art and at [[Halloween]], as it is a symbol of fertility, fortune and abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1910 |title = |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics |editor=Hastings, James| publisher= |location= |id= |volume=III |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediaofr03hastuoft}}{{Page needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Spain}}
In the [[Iberian peninsula]], the '''crown rabbi''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''{{lang|es|rabino mayor}}''' or [[Old Portuguese]]: '''{{lang|pt|arrabi mor}}''' (''chief rabbi'') ) was a secular, administrative post occupied by a member of the Jewish community for the benefit of the governing state, and existed in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] as far back as the 13th century, and is referred to as '''crown rabbi''' by historians in English, as well as by '''court rabbi''' and other terms.

== Terminology ==

In Spanish this position was known as ''[[:es:rabino mayor|rabino mayor]]'' or {{lang|es|rab de la corte}}, which can be translated literally as "chief rabbi" or "court rabbi", respectively, and which is referred to in some English sources as "crown rabbi"&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |editor-last1=Kaplan Appel |editor-first1=Tamar |editor-link1= |title=Crown Rabbi |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=9780300119039 |oclc=170203576 |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327120806/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |archivedate=2015-03-27 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray-2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EB-Crescas" /&gt; and in others as "court rabbi".&lt;ref name="Berlin-2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JE-1906-Senior" /&gt;  In Sicily (part of Aragon) the position was known locally as the ''[[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayyan]] kalali''&lt;ref name="Stow-2009" /&gt; and in Portuguese  as ''arrabi-mor''.&lt;ref name="Herculano-1854" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oap-1903" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SingerAdler1907" /&gt;  The derivation of arrabi mor is through a very unusual, three-language merger of parts in [[Judaeo-Portuguese]], from Hebrew ''rabi'' (noun, "rabbi") preceded by [[Arabic definite article]] ''ar'' ("the", from [[Sun and moon letters|''al'' + initial ''r-'' consonsant]]), and Portuguese ''mor'' (''adj.'', "chief", in [[Portuguese_grammar#Adjectives|normal postposition]]).&lt;ref name="Wexler-2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wexler |first=Paul  |title=Jewish and Non-Jewish Creators of "Jewish" Languages: With Special Attention to Judaized Arabic, Chinese, German, Greek, Persian, Portuguese, Slavic (modern Hebrew/Yiddish), Spanish, and Karaite, and Semitic Hebrew/Ladino ; a Collection of Reprinted Articles from Across Four Decades with a Reassessment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ic5Kth7aiusC&amp;pg=PA513 |year=2006 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |location=Wiesbaden |isbn=978-3-447-05404-1 |page=513 |chapter=IX.

== History ==

The concept of an official rabbi performing administrative duties and acting as an intermediary existed as far back as the 13th century in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and elsewhere in the Iberian peninsula. 

The crown rabbi was one of the chief ways for the kingdoms in the peninsula to exert power over their Jewish communities. Those officials fulfilling this position often acquired significant secular power over their communities, and sometimes over provinces or even kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Ray-2004"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jack Wertheimer |date=2004-03-20 |title=Jewish Religious Leadership: Image and Reality, Vol. 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvUlAQAAIAAJ |volume=I |page=307-332 |chapter=Royal Authority and the Jewish Community: The Crown Rabbi in Medieval Spain and Portugal |last=Ray |first=Jonathan |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary |isbn=978-0873340977 |doi= |oclc= |access-date=2014-03-19 |quote=One of the most significant ways in which royal power came to influence the Jewish community was through the development of the post of Crown Rabbi, a product of the general expansion of royal administrations, which took place throughout the Iberian kingdoms in the second half of the thirteenth century.  Buttressed by the royal court, these Jewish magistrates quickly became the preeminent fiscal and judicial authorities with the local Jewish community ([[aljama]]) and in some instances, over the Jewries of entire provinces and kingdoms.  The nature and development of the rabbinate is one of the most important and controversial issues in medieval Jewish history, and a comprehensive study of the topic remains a desideratum. ... The common designation of "rabbi" used to describe both traditional Jewish legists and Jewish officials appointed by the crown has led some scholars to confuse the two. This confusion stems, in large part, from the relatively fluid and imprecise manner with which medieval Christian documents employ various renderings of the Hebrew term ''rav'' (lit. "teacher"), such as ''rabi'', ''arrabi'', ''rab'' and ''rap''. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castile and Aragon===

In Castile, the Court Rabbinate extended as an institution from 1255 until [[Alhambra Decree|Expulsion]] in 1492.  They were often laymen, not rabbis, and had near dictatorial authority of their flock.  They presided in appeals cases and international synods, and might also be a court physician, as well as tax collector over both the Jewish as well as the Christian community.  The last one to hold the office of crown rabbi of Castile was [[Abraham Seneor]] who became a ''[[converso]]'' rather than be expelled.&lt;ref name="Stow-2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stow|first=Kenneth|title=Alienated Minority: The Jews of Medieval Latin Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfLmJK-h3UIC&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=1 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-674-04405-0|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1386 in the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] for example, King [[John I of Aragon|John I]] in the context of a time of political reform, issued edicts defining the functions and duties of the {{lang|es|Rab Mayor}} as intermediary between the power of the kingdom and that of the ''[[aljama]]'', or Jewish community.  There were various requirements as to the good character and faith of the person holding this charge, as well as a requirement that he live among the entourage of the Court, and thus away from his community, and in constant contact with the Christian majority population. His powers and authorities over the {{lang|es|aljama}} of Castile, economic, judicial, and otherwise, were specified.&lt;ref name="Alvarez-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=209673 |journal=Edad Media: revista de historia (Middle Ages: History Magazine |language=Spanish |title=El cargo de Rab Mayor de la Corte según un documento de Juan II fechado en 1450 (The post of ''Rab Mayor'' in the Court according to a document of John II issued in 1450) |last1=Crespo Álvarez |first1=Macarena |date=2001 |website= |publisher=Á |volume= |number=4 |issn=1138-9621 |issue= |pages=157-198 |doi= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===the ''arrabi'' in Portugal===

In Portugal, the ''arrabi'' was a Jewish official who acted as a private municipal judge in a locality, chosen from among the community.&lt;ref name="Herculano-1854" /&gt;  

The term ''arrabi'' is attested from the late 12th century in Latin and Portuguese under [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], and is mentioned in a judicial sense in municipal legislation documents.  Sometimes it appears as ''Rabi''.  Documents from [[Lisbon]], [[Leiria]] and elsewhere suggest that there was one ''arrabi'' per community, who was an outpost of royal authority, parallel to and separate from the traditional rabbi who tended to their flock's religious and spiritual needs.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ray |first=Jonathan |title=The Sephardic Frontier: The Reconquista and the Jewish Community in Medieval Iberia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSXsSxs6n_8C&amp;pg=PA124 |accessdate=4 June 2015 |year=2006 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=0-8014-4401-2 |chapter=5. Jewish Communal Organization and Authority |pages=124–128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presiding above the ''arrabis'' was a high functionary of the crown known as the ''arrabi mor'' (or arrabi-môr; ''chief rabbi'') and reporting to the King.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;  Besides supervising the administration of justice, he also was in charge of fiscal administration&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herculano-1854"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herculano |first=Alexandre |title=História da origem e estabelecimento da Inquisição em Portugal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xshGAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |volume=Tomo I. |year=1854 |publisher=Imprensa Nacional |location=Lisbon |page=86 |language=Portuguese |trans-title=History of the Origin and Establishment of the Inquisition in Portugal |accessdate=5 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presided over the ''ouvidores'' (auditors) of the kingdom.&lt;ref name="oap-1903"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cardozo de Bethencourt |editor=J Leite de Vasconcellos |journal=O Archeólogo português |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXQNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |accessdate=5 June 2015 |volume=8 |date=March 1903 |publisher=Museu Ethnográphico Português |language=Portuguese, French |page=37 |title=Inscriptions Hébraïques du Portugal |trans-title=Hebrew Inscriptions of Portugal |number=2 |quote=Dans la grande division administrative du Judaisme Portugais, vers 1402, Faro fut le siege de l'un des sept auditeurs, ''ouvidores'', relevant de l{{'}}''arrabi-mor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The position of ''arrabi mor'' emerged in Portugal as a result of efforts begun in the 12th century to centralize the legal and fiscal system in the country.  By the late 13th century this effort extended to all of Portuguese Jewry, as manifested by the creation of a network of Jewish officials in each locality.  The head of this network was the ''arrabi mor'' (chief rabbi) who acted as the royal tax collector similar to the position of the ''almoxarife mayor''&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt; (chief financial administrator&lt;ref name="Roth2014"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Medieval Jewish Civilization: An Encyclopedia |editor-last1=Roth |editor-first1=Norman |editor-link1= |title=Abravanel Family |last1=Roth |first1=Norman  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvhRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |date=8 April 2014 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |orig-year=2003 |location=New York |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=978-1-136-77154-5 |oclc=827973299 |pages=6 |access-date=2015-06-08 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Castile.  Under him were seven officials also called ''arrabis'' or ''ouvidores'' (auditors) who were responsible for taxes in their region (''arrabiado''); the local ''arrabis'' were assigned to individual communities after the model in Castile and Aragon.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;

The high post tended to be filled by wealthy Jews, and the post was handed down and controlled by family dynasties.  The first ''arrabi mor'' mentioned was Don Judah in the 13th century under [[Denis of Portugal|King Dinis]], followed by his son Guedelha. The main duties were judicial, and fiscal.  Judicially, the decisions of the ''arrabi mor'' concerning matters in the Jewish community were final, per a decree by [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]] in 1266, and he was responsible only for the highest issues, as the simpler suits and appeals were judged by the local ''arrabis''.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;

A powerful ''arrabi-mor'' could sometimes influence the laws of the kingdom in favor of the ''aljama''.&lt;ref name="SingerAdler1907"&gt;{{citation |last1=Singer |first1=Isidore |authorlink1=Isidore Singer |last2=Adler |first2=Cyrus |authorlink2=Cyrus Adler |title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTsyAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=5 June 2015 |year=1907 |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company |location=New York |page=193 |chapter=Moses Navarro |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTsyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a man was Moses Navarro under King [[John I of Portugal]].

In Coimbra at the end of 1391, the chief rabbi (who was also the king's personal physician) acting on behalf of all of Portuguese Jewry, presented his Lord and King a [[papal bull]] of [[Pope Boniface IX]] dated July 2, 1389, which in turn was based on an earlier edict of July 5, 1347 by a predecessor, namely the Jewish-friendly [[Pope Clement VI]]. In this bull, which was especially translated into Portuguese, it was strictly forbidden for a Christian to force a Jew to be baptised, or to strike him, rob him, or slay him; or to interrupt the [[Jewish festivals]] and ceremonies, or to disturb their cemeteries, dig up Jewish corpses, or by means of force to induce Jews to perform a job or a service which they were not legally obliged to perform in earlier times.  According to a decree issued in Coimbra on July 17, 1392, [[John I of Portugal|King John]] not only publicized the bull in all cities of the kingdom, but also promulgated a law to the same effect. &amp;nbsp; {{gray|Dass der Fanatismus um diese Zeit nicht auch in Portugal seine Opfer forderte, war vornehmlich den Vorkehrungen des damaligen Oberrabiners D.

Juli 1389, der ein Früherer Erlaß eines Vorgängers desselben, des judenfreundlichen Papstes Clemens VI, vom 5. Juli 1347 zu Grunde lag.

'''Einstellung''' is the development of a mechanized state of mind. Often called a [[problem solving]] set, Einstellung refers to a person's predisposition to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though better or more appropriate methods of solving the problem exist. The Einstellung effect is the negative effect of previous experience when solving new problems. The Einstellung effect has been tested experimentally in many different contexts. The most famous example (which led to Luchins and Luchins' coining of the term){{cn|date=May 2016}} is the Luchins' water jar experiment, in which subjects were asked to solve a series of water jar problems. After solving many problems which had the same solution, subjects applied the same solution to later problems even though a simpler solution existed (Luchins, 1942).&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"&gt;{{harvnb|Luchins|1942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments on the Einstellung effect can be found in ''The Effect of Einstellung on Compositional Processes''{{sfn|Dronek|Blessing|2006}} and ''Rigidity of Behavior, A Variational Approach to the Effect of Einstellung''.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959}}

==Background==
Einstellung literally means "setting" or "installation" as well as a person's "attitude" in German.  Related to Einstellung is what is referred to as an Aufgabe (literally, "task" in German).  The Aufgabe is the situation which could potentially invoke the Einstellung effect.  It is a task which creates a tendency to execute a previously applicable behavior.  In the Luchins and Luchins experiment a water jar problem served as the Aufgabe, or task.

Another phenomenon similar to Einstellung is [[functional fixedness]] (Duncker 1945).{{sfn|Duncker|1945}} Functional fixedness is an impaired ability to discover a new use for an object, owing to the subject's previous use of the object in a functionally dissimilar context. It can also be deemed a cognitive bias that limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used. Duncker also pointed out that the phenomenon occurs not only with physical objects, but also with mental objects or concepts (a point which lends itself nicely to the phenomenon of Einstellung effect).

The Einstellung effect occurs when a person is presented with a problem or situation that is similar to problems they have worked through in the past.  If the solution (or appropriate behavior) to the problem/situation has been the same in each past experience, the person will likely provide that same response, without giving the problem too much thought, even though a more appropriate response might be available.  Essentially, the Einstellung effect is one of the human brain's ways of finding an appropriate solution/behavior as efficiently as possible. Note, however, that although finding the solution is efficient, the solution found might not necessarily be the ''most'' appropriate solution.

==Luchins and Luchins water jar experiment==
The water jar test, first described in Abraham Luchins 1942 classic experiment,&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"/&gt; is a commonly cited example of an Einstellung situation. The experiment's participants were given the following problem: you have 3 water jars, each with the capacity to hold a different, fixed amount of water; figure out how to measure a certain amount of water using these jars. It was found that subjects used methods that they had used previously to find the solution even though there were quicker and more efficient methods available. The experiment shines light on how mental sets can hinder the solving of novel problems. 

In Luchins experiment, subjects were divided into two groups. The experimental group was given five practice problems, followed by 4 critical test problems. The control group did not have the five practice problems. All of the practice problems and some of the critical problems had only one solution, which was "B minus A minus 2&amp;middot;C.” For example, one is given Jar A capable of holding 21 units of water, B capable of holding 127, and C capable of holding 3. If an amount of 100 units must be measured out, the solution is to fill up Jar B and pour out enough water to fill A once and C twice. 

One of the critical problems was called the extinction problem.  The extinction problem was a problem that could not be solved using the previous solution B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C.  In order to answer the extinction problem correctly, one had to solve the problem directly and generate a novel solution.  An incorrect solution to the extinction problem indicated the presence of the Einstellung effect.  The problems after the extinction problem again had two possible solutions.  These post-extinction problems helped determine the recovery of the subjects from the Einstellung effect.  

The critical problems could be solved using this solution (B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C) or a shorter solution (A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;C or A&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;C).  For example, subjects were instructed to get 18 units of water from jars with capacities 15, 39, and 3. Despite the presence of a simpler solution (A&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;C), subjects in the experimental group tended to give the lengthier solution in lieu of the shorter one.  Instead of simply filling up Jars A and C, most subjects from the experimental group preferred the previous method of B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C, whereas virtually all of the control group used the simpler solution. When Luchins and Luchins gave experimental group subjects the warning, "Don't be blind," over half of them used the simplest solution to the remaining problems.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|p=368}} Thus, this warning helped reduce the prevalence of the Einstellung effect among the experimental group.  

The results of the water jars experiment illustrates the concept of Einstellung.  The majority of the experimental subjects adopted a mechanized state of mind and relied on mental sets formed through previous experience. However, the experimental subjects would have been more efficient if they had employed the direct method of solving the problem rather than applying the same solution from previous examples.

==Explanations and interpretations==
The Einstellung effect can be supported by theories of [[inductive reasoning]].  In a nutshell, inductive reasoning is the act of inferring a rule based on a finite number of instances.  Most experiments on human inductive reasoning involve showing subjects a card with an object (or multiple objects, or letters, etc.) on it.  The objects can vary in number, shape, size, color, etc., and the subject's job is to answer (initially by guessing) "yes" or "no" whether (or not) the card is a positive instance of the rule (which must be inferred by the subject).  Over time, the subjects do tend to learn the rule, but the question is ''how''?  Kendler and Kendler (1962){{sfn|Kendler|Kendler|1962}} proposed that older children and adults tend to exhibit ''noncontinuity theory''; that is, the subjects tend to pick a reasonable rule and assume it to be true until it proves false.  Regarding Einstellung effect, one can view noncontinuity theory as a way of explaining the tendency to maintain a specific behavior until it fails to work.  In the water-jar problem, subjects generated a specific rule because it seemed to work in all situations; when they were given problems for which the same solution worked, but a better solution was possible, they still gave their ''tried and true'' response.  Where theories of inductive reasoning tend to diverge from the idea of Einstellung effect is when analyzing the fact that, even after an instance where the Einstellung rule failed to work, many subjects reverted to the old solution when later presented with a problem for which it did work (again, this problem also had a better solution).  One way to explain this observation is that in actuality subjects know (consciously) that the same solution might not always work, yet since they were presented with so many instances where it did work, they still tend to test that solution before any other (and so if it works, it will be the first solution found).

Neurologically, the idea of [[synaptic plasticity]], which is an important neurochemical explanation of memory, can help to understand the Einstellung effect.  Specifically, [[Hebbian theory]] (which in many regards is the neuroscience equivalent of original [[associationism|associationist]] theories) is one explanation of synaptic plasticity (Hebb, 1949).{{sfn|Hebb|1949}} It states that when two associated neurons frequently fire together – while infrequently firing apart from one another – the strength of their association tends to become stronger (making future stimulation of one neuron even more likely to stimulate the other).  Since the frontal lobe is most often attributed with the roles of planning and problem solving, if there is a neurological pathway which is fundamental to the understanding of Einstellung effect, the majority of it most likely falls within the frontal lobe. Essentially, a Hebbian explanation of Einstellung could be as follows: [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] are presented in such a way that the subject recognizes him or herself as being in a situation which he or she has been in before.  That is, the subject sees, hears, smells, etc., an environment which is akin to an environment which he or she has been in before.  The subject then must process the stimuli which are presented in such a way that he or she exhibits a behavior which is appropriate for the situation (be it run, throw, eat, etc.).  Because neural growth is, at least in part, due to the associations between two events/ideas, it follows that the more a given stimulus is followed by a specific response, the more likely that in the future that stimulus will invoke the same response.  Regarding the Luchins’ experiment,&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"/&gt; the stimulus presented was a water-jar problem (or to be more technical, the stimulus was a piece of paper which had words and numbers on it which, when interpreted correctly, portray a water-jar problem) and the invoked response was B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C.  While it is a bit of a stretch to assume that there is a direct connection between a ''water-jar problem'' and ''B''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''C'' within the brain, it is not unreasonable to assume that the specific neural connections which are active during a water-jar problem-state and those that are active when one thinks “take the second term, subtract the first term, then subtract two of the third term” tend to increase in the amount of overlap as more and more instances where B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C works are presented.

==Other Einstellung research==

===Psychological stress===
The following experiments were designed to gauge the effect of different [[Stress (medicine)|stressful]] situations on the Einstellung effect.  Overall, these experiments show that stressful situations increase the prevalence of the Einstellung effect.

====The speed test====
Luchins gave an elementary-school class a set of water jar problems.  In order to create a stressful situation, experimenters told the students that the test would be timed, that the speed and accuracy of the test would be reviewed by their principal and teachers, and that the test would affect their grades.  To further agitate the students during the test, experimenters were instructed to comment on how much slower the children were compared to children in lower grades.  The experimenters observed anxious, stressed, and sometimes tearful faces during the experiment.

The results of the experiment indicated that the stressful speed test situation increased rigidity.  Luchins found that only three of the ninety-eight students tested were able to solve the extinction problem, and only two students used the direct method for the critical problems.  The same experiment conducted under non-stress conditions showed 70% rigidity during the test problems and 58% failure of the extinction problem, while the anxiety-inducing situation showed 98% and 97% respectively.

The speed test was performed with college students as well, which yielded similar results.  Even when college students were told ahead of time to use the direct method in order to avoid mistakes made by children, the college students continued to exhibit rigidity under time pressure.  The results of these studies showed that the emphasis on speed increased the Einstellung effect on the water jar problems.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|pp=120–122}}

====Maze tracing====
Luchins also instructed subjects to draw a solution through a maze without crossing any of the maze’s lines. The maze was either traced normally or traced using the mirror reflection of the maze.  If the subject drew over the lines of the figure, they had to start at the beginning, which was disadvantageous since the subject was told that their score depended on the time and smoothness of the solution. The mirror-tracing situation was the stressful situation, and the normal tracing was the non-stressful, control situation.  Experimenters observed that the mirror-tracing task caused more drawing outside the boundaries, increased overt signs of stress and anxiety, and required more time to accurately complete.  The mirror-tracing situation produced 89% Einstellung solution on the first two criticals instead of the 71% observed for normal tracing.  In addition, 55% of the subjects failed with the mirror while only 18% failed without the mirror.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|pp=123–124}}

====Hidden-word test for stutterers====
In 1951, Solomon{{sfn|Solomon|1951}} gave both [[Stuttering|stutterers]] and fluent-speakers a hidden-word test, an arithmetical test, and a mirror-maze test.   Experimenters called the hidden-word test a “speech test” to increase stutterer anxiety.  There were no marked differences between the stutterers and the fluent-speakers for the arithmetical and mirror-maze tests.  However, the results reveal a [[Statistical significance|significant difference]] between the performance of the stutterers and the fluent-speakers on the "speech test."  On the first two critical problems, 58 percent of the stutterers gave Einstellung solutions whereas only 4 percent of the fluent speakers showed Einstellung effects.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|p=126}}

===Age===
The original Luchins and Luchins experiment tested nine-, ten-, eleven-, and twelve-year-olds for the Einstellung effect.&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"/&gt; The older groups showed more Einstellung effects than the younger groups in general.  However, this initial study did not control for differences in educational level and intelligence.  

To remedy this problem, Ross (1952){{sfn|Ross|1952}} conducted a study on middle-aged (mean 37.3 years) and older adults (mean 60.8 years).  The adults were grouped according to the I.Q., years of schooling, and occupation.  Ross administered five Einstellung tests including the arithmetical (water jar) test, the maze test, the hidden-word test, and two other tests.  For every test, the middle-aged group performed better than the older group.  For example, 65% of the older adults failed the extinction task of the arithmetical test, whereas only 29% of the middle-aged adults failed the extinction problem.  

Luchins devised another experiment to determine the difference between Einstellung effects in children and in adults.  In this study, 140 fifth-graders (mean 10.5 years) were compared to 79 college students (mean 21 years) and 21 adults (mean 43 years).  Einstellung effects prior to the extinction task increased with age: the observed Einstellung effects for the extinction task were 56, 68, and 69 percent for young adults, children, and older adults respectively.  This implies that there exists a curvilinear relationship between age and the recovery from the Einstellung Effect.  A similar experiment conducted by Heglin in 1955, also found this relationship when the three age groups were equated for I.Q.

Therefore, the initial manifestation of the Einstellung effect on the arithmetic test increases with age.  However, the recovery from the Einstellung effect is greatest for young adults (average age 21 years) and decreases as you move away from this age.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|pp=237–242}}

===Gender===
In Luchins and Luchins original experiment with 483 children, they found that boys demonstrated less Einstellung effects than girls.&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"/&gt;  The experimental difference was only significant for the group that was instructed to write “Don’t be blind” on their papers after the sixth problem (the DBB group).  “Don’t be blind” was meant as a reminder to pay attention and guard against rigidity for the sixth problem.  However, this message was interpreted in many different ways including thinking of the message as just some more words to remember.  The alternative interpretations occurred more frequently in girls and increased with IQ score within the female group.  This difference in interpretation of DBB may account for the fact that the male DBB group showed more direct solutions than their female counterparts.

To determine sex differences in adults, Luchins gave college students the maze Einstellung test.  The female group showed slightly more (although not statistically significant) Einstellung effects than the male group.  Other studies have provided conflicting data about the sex differences in the Einstellung effect.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|pp=246–247}}

===Intelligence===
Luchins and Luchins looked at the relationship between the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) and the Einstellung effects for the children in their original experiment.  They found that there was a statistically insignificant negative relationship between the Einstellung Effect and Intelligence.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|p=151}}  In general, large Einstellung effects were observed for all subject groups regardless of IQ score.  When Luchins and Luchins looked at the IQ range for children who did and did not demonstrate Einstellung effects, they spanned from 51 to 160 and from 75 to 155 respectively.  These ranges show a slight negative correlation between intelligence and Einstellung effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3696">The '''enrolled bill rule''' is a principle of judicial interpretation of rules of procedure in [[Legislature|legislative]] bodies. Under the doctrine, once a [[Bill (law)|bill]] passes a legislative body and is signed into law, the courts assume that all rules of procedure in the enactment process were properly followed. That is, "[i]f a legislative document is authenticated in regular form by the appropriate officials, the court treats that document as properly adopted."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Thomas'', 788 F.2d 1250 ([[7th Cir.]] 1986), ''[[certiorari|cert.]] denied'', 107 S.Ct. 187 (1986), citing ''Field v. Clark'', 143 U.S. 649, 36 L.Ed. 294, 12 S.Ct. 495 (1892).&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The doctrine was adopted  in ''[[The King v. Arundel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1616] EWHC J11&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the proposition that when an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] was passed and assented to, it was affixed with the Great Seal, the "effective legal act of enactment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/jlsp/pdf/Winter%202007/sandler.pdf |pages=217–19 |journal=Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems |title=Forget What You Learned in Civics Class: The "Enrolled Bill Rule" and Why It's Time to Overrule ''Field v. Clark'' |volume=41 |last1=Sandler |first1=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "a regal act, and no official might dispute the king's word."

The enrolled bill rule was restated by [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]] in ''Edinburgh &amp; Dalkeith Railway Co v Wauchope''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1842/J12.html &amp;#91;1842&amp;#93; UKHL J12; 1 Bell 278; 8 Cl &amp; Fin 710; 8 ER 279].&lt;/ref&gt; In that case it was complained that the passage of a [[private bill]] was defective because proper notice had not been given. The House of Lords rejected the notion that the validity of an Act could be questioned.

==United States==
In the United States, the rule was adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in {{ussc|name=Field v. Clark|143|649|1892}}. In effect, the court ruled that the enrolled bill signed by the presiding officers of the two houses of Congress was the best evidence of what had been passed, being on balance better evidence than the journals of the respective houses, so it should not be called into question.&lt;ref name=sandler/&gt;

===State law===
At the time of the decision in ''Field'', nine states had adopted the doctrine, and thirteen had rejected it.&lt;ref name=sandler&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=143&amp;invol=649 143 U.S. 649].&lt;/ref&gt; At least two states have weakened it:

*The [[Supreme Court of Kentucky]]&lt;ref&gt;''D&amp;W Auto Supply v. Dept. of Revenue'', 602 S.W.2d 420 (Ky. 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; has held that "there is a [[prima facie]] presumption that an enrolled bill is valid but such presumption may be overcome by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence establishing that constitutional requirements have not been met."
*The [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] has limited the application of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Consumer Party of Pa. v. Commonwealth'', 507 A.2d 323 (Pa. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; It held, "When a law has been passed and approved and certified in due form, it is no part of the duty of the judiciary to go behind the law as duly certified to inquire into the observance of form in its passage," but the court also noted that "it would be a serious dereliction... to deliberately ignore a clear constitutional violation."

The '''escalation archetype''' is one of possible types of system behaviour that are known as [[System Archetypes|system archetypes]].

The escalation archetype is common for situations of [[non-cooperative game]]s where each player can make own decisions and these decisions lead to the outcome for the player. However, when both player try to maximize their output (at the expense of the other one) they can get into a loop where each player will try harder and harder to surpass the opponent. While it can have favourable consequences it can also lead to [[self-destructive behaviour]].

== Structure ==

=== Elements of archetype ===

Escalation archetype system can be described using causal loop diagrams which may consist of balancing and reinforcing loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Bellinger|first=Gene|author-link=Gene Bellinger |title=Archetypes - Interaction Structures of the Universe|url=http://www.systems-thinking.org/arch/arch.htm#arches|website=Systems Thinking|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Balancing loop ====

Balancing loop is a structure representing [[negative feedback]] process. In such a structure, a change in system leads to actions that usually eliminate the effect of that change which means that the system tends to remain stable in time.

==== Reinforcing loop ====

Balancing loop is a structure representing [[positive feedback]] process. This reinforcing feedback causes that even a small change in the system can lead to huge disturbances, e.g. variable A is increased which leads to an increase of variable B which leads to another increase of A and so there might be an [[exponential growth]] over time.

=== Escalation archetype as balancing loops ===
The image below shows escalation archetype as two balancing loops. 
When X makes an action, it leads to a change in results of X relative to results of Y. Y then makes action to equalize the situation and the result again changes the balance and induces another action by X. As this repeats actions done by X and Y are bigger and bigger to keep up with other's actions and results.
[[File:Escalation Archetype - two balancing loops.jpg|framed|none|Escalation archetype as two balancing loops displayed as causal loop diagram]]

=== Escalation archetype as reinforcing loop ===
The causal loop diagram below shows escalation archetype as a single reinforcing loop. It can be read simply as that more action done by X creates bigger results of action done by X. The bigger results of X, the bigger difference between X and Y results. The bigger difference means more action by Y and more action by Y leads to bigger result of Y. The bigger result of Y leads to a smaller difference between X and Y, but the smaller is this difference, the bigger will be the action of X and it starts all over again.
[[File:Escalation archetype - one reinforcing loop.jpg|framed|none|Escalation archetype as one reinforcing loop displayed as causal loop diagram]]

The image below simplifies reinforcing loop and shows general idea of what happens. Increased activity of X leads to an increase of threat for Y which leads to an increased activity by Y. Increased activity by Y leads to increased threat for X which creates another potential for activity of X to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Senge|first1=Peter M.|title=The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization|date=2006|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-47764-4|page=199}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Arms race ===
A well known example of escalation archetype is the [[arms race]]. The idea is that in the arms race two (or more) parties are competing to have the strongest army and weapons. An example is the race in producing nuclear weapons by the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] that was an important factor in the [[Cold War]]. Over the time, each party can get temporarily a slight advantage, but then the other one produces or obtains in other way more weapons and gets the advantage on its side, temporarily. In the end, both parties have great military power that is very threatening not only to them but also to non-aligned parties.

=== Picking apples in an orchard ===

The escalation archetype can turn up in situations like picking apples in an orchard. Imagine a big apple orchard with a wealthy crop. An owner of such plantation cannot pick the whole harvest himself because there are simply too many trees. Therefore, he employs gatherers to do the work for him. He tries to figure a way how to measure the work they do so that he can reward them fairly. As he is suspicious that workers would work slowly he is hesitant to link the wage only to hours worked and he comes up with an idea. He divides workers into two groups and declares that the group which will harvest more apples will get a bonus to their regular wage.

Both groups start harvesting apples with passion and energy. First group X collects a pallet a little bit sooner than the second group Y. Therefore, the Y group motivates those who were a little bit slacking to increase their pace. Now Y is a little bit better so they not only catch up but even finish the second load before X group. The X comes with an idea that they should assign roles to their members – some will pick apples from the upper part of trees using ladders while some will collect those that are in the lower part of trees, other will load packs and one person will organise the work and help where necessary. This advantage enables X group to outrun the other again. While Y adapts the model of X, they make some changes and tweaks and soon they are the leading party. This improving of processes continues in several iterations until both parties are exceptionally effective in harvesting apples on the orchard. The owner can be really happy with the situation as containers are quickly being loaded with apples. Should everything continue this way, the orchard could be harvested in few hours with group X beating the group Y by a tenth of a percent. He could reward only the winning team or both teams because they were almost equally hardworking.

However, due to the fact that one group was always a little bit behind, the situation in the middle of day is bad for one of the groups which is slightly behind, let's say it is group Y. Now, they can continue working like up to that moment and they would finish second with a loss of a tenth of a percent. Or they can come up with another idea that would enable them to increase their production output. They have an idea that harvesting topmost apples is slower that harvesting the rest of them. Because of that they decide to skip these apples and only collect the others. This way, the situation escalated into a trouble. While Y could win the competition now, there will be considerable amount of apples left on trees. Or if both groups are instructed not to leave a single apple in the orchard they will have to stay much longer to finish these apples thus the owner will have higher costs for their wage.

Of course the owner could set a condition that none team could leave a tree that until it is fully harvested. That would help in some way to break the escalation archetype unless workers realize they are not punished for some other undesirable behaviour, for example being careless of tree condition after the harvest.

As can be seen in this example, the escalation archetype might bring positive results (faster harvesting) but it is necessary to monitor behaviour of the affected system to ensure long-term prosperity.

=== The attention fight ===

To avoid naming in this example of escalation archetype occurrence, behaviour of imaginary persons Amy, Betty, Cecile and Danielle is described.

Amy, Betty, Cecile and Danielle want to become famous celebrities with a lot of money, loving husband and amazing children. They already have many friends and everybody in the town knows each one of them. They all work hard to be best in their field of expertise and soon they are known to the whole country. They know of each other and try to work harder to become more famous than each other. This is when escalation archetype comes into play. They become the most famous celebrities in the country and each one of them realizes that to draw more attention than others they need to be unique and very special. As Amy starts to work even harder than before Betty notices that Amy's fame is growing more than hers and starts to work harder than Amy. This is noted by Cecile and she does what must be done - starts working more than anyone else. But there is also Danielle whose ambitions are not even slightly smaller, she wants to be the most famous celebrity and so she starts working even harder than anyone else. As Amy notices her effort is not sufficient, she does what is obvious - starts to work more than she was.

Now this cycle could repeat continuously until Amy, Betty, Cecile or Danielle dies of overwork. In the meanwhile some of them could start taking drugs with the presumption that it could boost their productivity and ability to concentrate or with the aim to get rid of depressions from working all the time. Another solution presumed by them as feasible would be some way of elimination the opponents - by false accusation or by pointing to their faults.

Or if they found it impossible to be better by simply working more, they could try to figure out some way how to attract attention by qualitative change instead of quantitative. This way Amy could say something shocking in TV. The issue is that due to escalation archetype being in place unfortunately. Betty could simply follow by saying something even more shocking or controversial. Then, Cecile would feel threatened and so she will come up with an idea that she could make controversial photographs. Then Danielle will try to surpass everyone and will do some action that will attract attention of media and public. And they would escalate this to extreme situation (as the behaviour can develop exponentially).

While at the beginning the competitiveness was beneficial for both Amy, Betty, Cecile, Danielle and public, in the long term many issues raised.

What could be a meaningful solution for these ladies? They could have set some limits themselves in their minds, for example how much time they are willing to work to achieve their desire to be a famous celebrity and what is alright to do and what is not. If they are not able to do so, there has to be some mechanism from outside to stop them - e.g. family or friend giving them an advice, as it would be difficult to set legal boundaries in this area.

=== Competing children ===

Tendency of parents to compare their children creates nourishing environment for escalation archetype. Parents tend to compare their kids with other children and among own kids. This creates pressure on children as they are expected to perform well.

Imagine a family with two kids named, for example, Lisa and Bartolomeo. Their parents are very much children-focused and hope their kids will get proper educations and live what they consider successful lives. They invest significant portions of both their family budget and time into both children and hope that this investment will pay off in the form of Lisa and Bartolomeo being successful in school and later in life.

Lisa and Bartolomeo are usual children with some hobbies who study diligently but without extreme passion. They simply do what they got to do. Their results are good but not perfect. So their parents come and start the escalation archetype by telling the kids that the one with better marks will go on special holiday of her or his choice. As both Lisa and Bartolomeo like travelling a lot, they start to study hard. To satisfaction of their parents  children's marks get soon better which is very positive outcome. Yet a problem arises. As they both study really hard to keep pace with the other one, something might go wrong.

For example, when Bartolomeo is very creative and skillful painter but not so talented in studying usual subjects like math or languages. Sooner or later he will reach his limits. Then to keep up the good marks he will have to abandon his painting hobby and his talent will be wasted. Or he will try to sustain great marks and then Bartolomeo will start cheating during exams.

However even when no negative effect happens there will be a difficulty how to reward children after Bartolome finishes second very closely. Should their parents appreciate only Lisa's effort or acknowledge also Bartolomeo's achievements. When they reward only Lisa, Bartolomeo could easily become demotivated and then it would be impossible to make use of positive effects of escalation archetype. On the other hand, rewarding both could mean the same and for both children as they realise that their extra effort does not have necessarily mean better outcome.

There is also an '''alternative version of how competition''' amongst children '''can be affected by escalation archetype'''. When all parents motivate children to improve in comparison to their peers, they will all study harder and harder while the differences amongst participating kids will remain relatively stable (and if teachers increase requirements they will even retain their marks). Under such simple circumstances most children might benefit from the competition nevertheless children with weaker intellectual skill may become isolated when they are no longer able to pursue others. Reversely in another alternative scenario where all children are demotivated to study for some reason, their results are worse and worse (and if teachers decrease requirements they will retain their marks while being less educated) and downward spiral is working in a way that situation gets worse and worse.

== Risks and opportunities ==

The dangers of systems with escalation archetypes are various. First, it might be difficult to identify the existence of archetype at the first sight. Then the behaviour of the system might look desirable at first and therefore requiring no immediate action. Another risk is a possibility of exponential growth within such structure. Finally the system might have different outcome in short term and long term.

Escalation archetype comes with a possibility to make a big change in the system with a little input or a small action done at the beginning (due to the fact that it behaves like reinforcing loop).

== Solution and optimization ==

To remove downward or upward spiral effect of escalation archetype there is a change in the system necessary which breaks the ongoing pattern. That change is typically switching the actors from [[non-cooperative game]] mode to [[cooperative game]] behaviour so that they stop escalating their actions to keep with others and rather find mutual solution and movement.

The '''''Fountain Archive''''' (also called '''''The Fountain Archives''''' or '''''Fountain Archive Project''''') is a [[wiktionary:processual|processual]] art project of the French conceptual artist [[Saâdane Afif]] which started in 2008/ 2009. The project includes an ongoing series of framed pages which contain one or several reproductions of the work ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]]. Here Afif uses the concept of the [[Found object|Objet trouvés]] (found object) and tears off the pages from different publications. For each publication and pages Afif normally makes only one piece for the ''Fountain Archives'', which is created as a work of art. 

The ''Fountain Archive'' also includes a bookshelf which stores all used publications of the project.

==Origin and description==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|''Fountain'', 1917, signed "R. Mutt"]]
In 2008 Saâdane Afif started to collect publications which contain reproductions of the work ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917) by [[Marcel Duchamp]]. After he was distinguished with the Marcel Duchamp Prize in 2009, Afif began the ''Fountain Archive''. At present the ''Fountain Archive'' contains over 600 images&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefountainarchives.net/current-bibliography/ |title=Current bibliography |publisher=The Fountain Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Duchamp’s porcelain urinal. In this work, Afif collects and archives every publication in which he finds a reproduction of Duchamp's urinal. As a “found object” every page containing the picture of the ''Fountain'' is torn out and then carefully framed. The frame (sometimes with a colored background), used for its preservation and highlight ornament purposes, is also part of the making process. Every step of the archiving follows meticulous rules which participate entirely in the making process of these works of art. For each publication and page Afif normally makes only one piece for the ''Fountain Archive''.&lt;ref name="schriftenreihe57"&gt;Valentina Vlasic: Saâdane Afif, in: The Present Order is the Disorder of the Future, Schriftenreihe Museum Kurhaus Kleve – Ewald Mataré-Sammlung Nr. 62, Freundeskreis Museum Kurhaus und Koekkoek-Haus Kleve e.V. (Hrsg), 2013, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a publication contains images of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' on several pages, all of them are torn off and form together a polyptych. When found, the publications are registered with an archive number ranging from FA 0001 potentially to infinite. Afif intended to continue the Series of Archives until its 1001st. The publications (sans ''Fountain'') are then stored in a bookshelf in the studio of the artist. The bookshelf creates an archive around Duchamp’s ''Fountain'', from which the common initiator has been removed: “an archive without its object“. The ''Fountain Archives'' has been presented in various exhibitions throughout the world.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefountainarchives.net/about/ |title=About |publisher=The Fountain Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, some publications presenting this project by Afif happened to reproduce the work ''Fountain'' of Duchamp. Those specific documents are also incorporated in the ''Fountain Archives'' project. But they are treated as special objects as they are doubled in order to testify of a historical echo, mark a [[mise en abyme]]. In case of the mise en abyme – a publication includes an image of Afif's ''Fountain Archive'' project – there is also one exception to the strict rule that each publication produced only a unique, singular work of the ''Fountain Archive''.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Filipovic, Xavier Hufkens: Sâadane Afif. Fontaines. Triangle Books, 2014, {{ISBN|978-2-930777-05-4}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; These pages underline an evolution in the development and perception of the ''Fountain Archives'' as an artwork. They are stored under a specific section titled “Augmented”, and they are building a step-by-step archive within the archive. Therefore, two copies of the publications (sans ''Fountain'') enter the archive bookshelf and two editions of the work are made.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

==History==
In 2013 a group of 101 ''Fountain Archives'' were shown in the exhibition “The Present Order is the Disorder of the Future” based in the Museum Kurhaus Kleve. Referring to the presentation a first text, by the art historic Valentina Vlasic, about the ''Fountain Archive'' was published in the exhibition catalogue. This catalogue contribution included a picture of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'', therefore Afif tears the page off and makes an augmented fountain archive out of it. This said Klever Fountain, with the description FA 0366,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefountainarchives.net/fountain-archives/fa-0366/ |title=FA 0366 |publisher=The Fountain Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based in the collection of the Museum Kurhaus Kleve as a permanent loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrz.de/staedte/kleve-und-umland/das-pissoir-im-archiv-der-bilder-id9479188.html|title=Das Pissoir im Archiv der Bilder|last=Gronewald|first=Claudia|access-date=2017-11-26|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
The German art historian Eva Huttenlauch named Marcel Duchamp as Afif’s guiding star, he looked up as his ideal self. Many of Afif’s concepts, like the ''Fountain Archive'', rest on the foundations Duchamp laid.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Huttenlauch: ''Everything must be scandalous'', in: Saâdane Afif. ''Another Anthology of Black Humor'', published by Susanne Gaensheimer and Eva Huttenlauch, Verlag für Moderne Kunst, Nürnberg 2012, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian art historian Valentina Vlasic termed Afif’s ''Fountain Archive'' as a repetition of the key-moment of the ready-made, the fundamental act of selecting which just as it did at that time for Duchamp, represents a complete artistic achievement. Afif does not do this with real objects, like a normal commercial one, but he uses the artistic object of the ''Fountain'' as an illustration from publications. As a charming witticism, Vlasic predicated that there is in addition the fact that Afif leads Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' in a new way back into the museum, a site it had to leave about one hundred years ago through being excluded from the exhibition.&lt;ref name="schriftenreihe57"/&gt;
    
For the art historian Elena Filipovic, the high importance of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' in art history accrued especially because of the reason that the artist understood very well that the reproduction, display, framing, dissemination, and reception of an artwork not only constructs its value and meaning, but also help determine how and if it enters history at all. These comprehension stands also for the background of Saâdane Afifs project of the ''Fountain Archives''.  After “R.Mutt“ or Marcel Duchamp Fillipovic sees in Afif another person which adopts the white urinal and also conducts the construction of an icon. The ''Fountain Archives'', which contain an image of a ''Fountain Archive'' (mise en abyme), are termed as a “remake” by Filipovic. She compares especially these works with the process of signification of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' in art history.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Filipovic, Xavier Hufkens: Sâadane Afif. Fontaines.

'''Gay pride''' or '''LGBT pride''' is the positive stance against discrimination and violence toward [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)]] people to promote their [[self-affirmation]], dignity, equality rights, increase their visibility as a [[social group]], build community, and celebrate [[sexual diversity]] and [[gender variance]]. Pride, as opposed to shame and [[social stigma]], is the predominant outlook that bolsters most [[LGBT rights]] movements throughout the world. Pride has lent its name to LGBT-themed organizations, institutes, foundations, book titles, periodicals and even a [[OutTV (Canada)|cable TV station]] and the [[Pride Library]].

Ranging from solemn to carnivalesque, pride events are typically held during [[Gay pride#LGBT Pride Month|LGBT Pride Month]] or some other period that commemorates a turning point in a country's [[LGBT history]], for example [[Moscow Pride]] in May for the anniversary of Russia's 1993 decriminalization of homosexuality. Some pride events include [[Pride parade|LGBT pride parades and marches]], rallies, commemorations, community days, dance parties, and large festivals, such as [[Sydney Mardi Gras]], which spans several weeks.

Common symbols of pride are the [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow or pride flag]], the lowercase Greek letter [[lambda (letter)|lambda (λ)]], the [[pink triangle]] and the [[Black triangle (badge)|black triangle]], these latter two [[Reappropriation|reclaimed]] from use as [[badges of shame]] in [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambda.org/symbols.htm|title=Symbols of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Movements

==Historical background==
[[File:Barbara Gittings 1965.jpg|thumb|Gay equality activist [[Barbara Gittings]] picketing  [[Independence Hall]] in 1965]]

===Pride precursors===
{{Main|List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots}}

====Annual Reminders====
The 1950s and 1960s in the United States was an extremely repressive legal and social period for LGBT people. In this context American [[homophile]] organizations such as the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] and the [[Mattachine Society]] coordinated some of the earliest demonstrations of the modern LGBT rights movement. These two organizations in particular carried out [[Picketing (protest)|pickets]] called "[[Annual Reminder]]s" to inform and remind Americans that LGBT people did not receive basic [[civil rights]] protections. Annual Reminders began in 1965 and took place each July 4 at [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]].

===="Gay is Good"====
The anti-LGBT discourse of these times equated both male and female homosexuality with mental illness.  Inspired by [[Stokely Carmichael]]'s "[[Black is beautiful|Black is Beautiful]]", Gay civil rights pioneer and participant in the Annual Reminders [[Frank Kameny]] originated the slogan "Gay is Good" in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/kameny_f.html |title=Kameny, Frank |publisher=glbtq |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524210331/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/kameny_f.html |archivedate=May 24, 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; to counter social stigma and personal feelings of guilt and shame.

===Christopher Street Liberation Day===
{{See also|Stonewall riots}}

Early on the morning of Saturday, June 28, 1969, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning persons rioted following a police raid on the [[Stonewall Inn]], a gay bar at 43 Christopher Street, New York City. This riot and further protests and rioting over the following nights were the watershed moment in modern LGBT rights movement and the impetus for organizing LGBT pride marches on a much larger public scale.

On November 2, 1969, [[Craig Rodwell]], his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, and Linda Rhodes proposed the first pride march to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) meeting in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/news/1970-a-first-person-account-of-the-first-gay-pride-march// Sargeant, Fred. "1970: A First-Person Account of the First Gay Pride March." ''The Village Voice''. June 22, 2010.] retrieved January 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
"That the Annual Reminder, in order to be more relevant, reach a greater number of people, and encompass the ideas and ideals of the larger struggle in which we are engaged—that of our fundamental human rights—be moved both in time and location.

&lt;br&gt;We propose that a demonstration be held annually on the last Saturday in June in New York City to commemorate the 1969 spontaneous demonstrations on Christopher Street and this demonstration be called CHRISTOPHER STREET LIBERATION DAY. No dress or age regulations shall be made for this demonstration.

&lt;br&gt;We also propose that we contact Homophile organizations throughout the country and suggest that they hold parallel demonstrations on that day. We propose a nationwide show of support.&lt;ref name="Carter, pg. 230"&gt;Carter, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marotta, pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teal, pp. 322–323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, pp. 255, 262, 270–280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All attendees to the ERCHO meeting in Philadelphia voted for the march except for [[Mattachine Society]] of New York, which abstained.&lt;ref name="Carter, pg. 230"/&gt; Members of the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) attended the meeting and were seated as guests of Rodwell's group, Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods (HYMN).&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings to organize the march began in early January at Rodwell's apartment in 350 [[Bleecker Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/25/nyregion/for-gays-party-search-purpose-30-parade-has-gone-mainstream-movement-s-goals.html Nagourney, Adam. "For Gays, a Party In Search of a Purpose; At 30, Parade Has Gone Mainstream As Movement's Goals Have Drifte." ''The New York Times''. June 25, 2000.] retrieved January 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At first there was difficulty getting some of the major [[New York City]] organizations like [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA) to send representatives. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, [[Michael Brown (UK politician)|Michael Brown]], Marty Nixon, and Foster Gunnison of Mattachine made up the core group of the CSLD Umbrella Committee (CSLDUC). For initial funding, Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors, while Sargeant solicited donations via the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]] customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teal, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Other mainstays of the organizing committee were Judy Miller, Jack Waluska, Steve Gerrie and [[Brenda Howard]] of GLF.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; With Dick Leitsch's replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April 1970, opposition to the march by Mattachine ended.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 314 n93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brenda Howard]] is known as the "Mother of Pride" for her work in coordinating the march. Howard also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around [[pride parade|Pride Day]] which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June.&lt;ref name="thirteen.org"&gt;[http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=2475 Channel 13/WNET Out! 2007: Women In the Movement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118011642/http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=2475 |date=January 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="queerty.com"&gt;[http://www.queerty.com/the-gay-pride-issue-20070618/ The Gay Pride Issue: Picking Apart The Origin of Pride] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712233212/http://www.queerty.com/the-gay-pride-issue-20070618/ |date=July 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Howard along with fellow LGBT Activists [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A.

Christopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street and the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride march]] in U.S. history, covering the 51&amp;nbsp;blocks to [[Central Park]]. The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&amp;nbsp;city blocks.&lt;ref name="fosburgh"&gt;Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

On the same weekend gay activist groups on the West Coast of the United States held a march in [[Los Angeles]] and a march and "Gay-in" in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="SFChron"&gt;"The San Francisco Chronicle", June 29, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CanPress"&gt;"As of early 1970, Neil Briggs became the vice-chairman of the LGBTQ Association", CanPress, February 28, 1970.

One day earlier, on Saturday, June 27, 1970, Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', June 28, 1970, p. A3&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}} from [[Washington Square Park, Chicago|Washington Square Park]] ("Bughouse Square") to the [[Chicago Water Tower|Water Tower]] at the intersection of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan]] and [[Chicago Avenue|Chicago]] avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants extemporaneously marched on to the [[Richard J. Daley Center#Daley Plaza|Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza]].&lt;ref name="CGP1971w"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newberry.org/outspoken/exhibit/objectlist_section3.html |title= Outspoken: Chicago's Free Speech Tradition |publisher= Newberry Library |accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers. Subsequent Chicago parades have been held on the last Sunday of June, coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere.

The next year, Gay Pride marches took place in [[Boston]], [[Dallas]], [[Milwaukee]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[West Berlin]], and [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="lafrank20"/&gt; By 1972 the participating cities included [[Atlanta]], [[Brighton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Brighton Ourstory |title=A History of Lesbian &amp; Gay Brighton: A Community Comes of Age, 1988-2001 |url=http://www.brightonourstory.co.uk/brighton-s-history/a-history-of-lesbian-and-gay-brighton-chapter-3-out-of-the-closet-1967-87/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Detroit]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Miami]], and [[Philadelphia]],&lt;ref name="armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&amp;nbsp;M. (October 2006).

Frank Kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, p. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred."&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as "one of the greatest mistakes of his life".&lt;ref name="clendinen25"&gt;Clendinen, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of gays retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, "stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals".&lt;ref name="clendinen25"/&gt; Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, "Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement.... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale."&lt;ref&gt;LaFrank, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===
[[File:2018 San Francisco Pride.jpg|thumb|right|San Francisco Pride 2018]]
In the 1980s there was a major cultural shift in the Stonewall Riot commemorations.  The previous loosely organized, grassroots marches and parades were taken over by more organized and less radical elements of the gay community. The marches began dropping "Liberation" and "Freedom" from their names under pressure from more conservative members of the community, replacing them with the philosophy of "Gay Pride"{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} (in the more liberal [[San Francisco]], the name of [[The Gay Parade|the gay parade]] and celebration was not changed from ''Gay Freedom Day Parade'' to ''Gay Pride Day Parade'' until 1994). The Greek [[lambda]] symbol and the [[pink triangle]], which had been revolutionary symbols of the Gay Liberation Movement, were tidied up and incorporated into the Gay Pride, or Pride, movement, providing some symbolic continuity with its more radical beginnings{{clarify|date=May 2015}}. The pink triangle was also the inspiration for the [[homomonument]] in [[Amsterdam]], commemorating all gay men and lesbians who have been subjected to persecution because of their homosexuality.

=== LGBT Pride Month ===
[[Image:CarmelPride.JPG|thumb|left|225px|HBT rally in Carmel, [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]]]
[[File:StatehouseBoisePride2011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] Pride at the [[Idaho Capitol]].]]
The month of June was chosen for LGBT Pride Month to commemorate the [[Stonewall riots]], which occurred at the end of June 1969. As a result, many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact LGBT people have had in the world. [[Brenda Howard]] is known as the ''"Mother of Pride"'', for her work in coordinating the first LGBT Pride march, and she also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June.&lt;ref name="thirteen.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queerty.com"/&gt; Additionally, Howard along with fellow LGBT rights activists [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk)]] and [[L. Craig Schoonmaker]] are credited with popularizing the word "Pride" to describe these festivities.&lt;ref name="Pride trope, Homolexis"/&gt; As LGBT rights activist [[Tom Limoncelli]] put it, "The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'"&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

On several occasions, the President of the United States has officially declared a Pride Month. First, President [[Bill Clinton]] declared June "Gay &amp; Lesbian Pride Month" on June 11, 1999 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |last = Clinton |first = Bill |date = 11 June 1999 |title = Proclamation 7203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clinton Declares June 2000 Gay &amp; Lesbian Pride Month|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/blgaylesproc.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206050022/http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/blgaylesproc.htm |archivedate=2017-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |last = Clinton |first = Bill |date = 2 June 2000 |title = Proclamation 7316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title= Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2009 |date= 1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010,&lt;ref name="2010 Proclamation"&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Proclamation 8429 |date= 28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011,&lt;ref name="2011 Proclamation"&gt;{{cite news |title=Presidential Proclamation--Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/31/presidential-proclamation-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-pride-mon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presidential Proclamation--Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2012|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/01/presidential-proclamation-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-pride-mon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/03/presidential-proclamation-lgbt-pride-month&lt;/ref&gt; 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=May 30, 2014 |title=Presidential Proclamation -- Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2014 |publisher=The White House Office of the Press Secretary |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/05/30/presidential-proclamation-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-pride-mon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=May 29, 2015 |title=Presidential Proclamation-- LGBT Pride Month, 2015 |publisher=The White House Office of the Press Secretary |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/29/presidential-proclamation-lgbt-pride-month-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=May 31, 2016 |title=Presidential Proclamation -- LGBT Pride Month, 2016 |publisher=The White House Office of the Press Secretary |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/31/presidential-proclamation-lgbt-pride-month-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] declared June LGBT Pride Month.

==Criticism==
From both outside and inside the LGBT community, there is criticism and protest against pride events. Bob Christie's documentary ''[[Beyond Gay: The Politics of Pride]]'' evaluates gay pride events in different countries within the context of local opposition.

===Initiatives and criticism by governments and political leaders===
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}

====Brazil====
In August 2011, [[Sao Paulo]] [[city alderman]] [[:pt:Carlos Apolinário|Carlos Apolinário]] of the right-wing [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] Party sponsored a bill to organize and sponsor "Heterosexual Pride Day" on the third Sunday of December. The bill was passed by the city council, and awaits the signature of mayor [[Gilberto Kassab]]. Apolinário, an Evangelical Protestant, stated that the intent of the parade was a "struggle ... against excesses and privileges". Members of [[Grupo Gay da Bahia]] and the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] criticized the bill as enhancing "the possibility of discrimination and prejudice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/Latin-America-Monitor/2011/0804/Heterosexual-Pride-Day-in-Sao-Paulo|title = 'Heterosexual Pride Day' in São Paulo?|author = Andrew Downie|newspaper = The Christian Science Monitor|date = August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no events have ever been held.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

A Brazilian photographer was arrested after refusing to delete photos of police attacking two young people participating in a gay pride parade on October 16, 2011 in the city of Itabuna, Bahia, reported the newspaper Correio 24 horas.

According to the website Notícias de Ipiau, Ederivaldo Benedito, known as Bené, said four police officers tried to convince him to delete the photos soon after they realized they were being photographed. When he refused, they ordered him to turn over the camera. When the photographer refused again, the police charged him with contempt and held him in jail for over 21 hours until he gave a statement.

According to Chief Marlon Macedo, the police alleged that the photographer was interfering with their work, did not have identification, and became aggressive when he was asked to move. Bené denied the allegations, saying the police were belligerent and that the scene was witnessed by "over 300 people", reported Agência Estado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Photos of police attack at gay pride parade land Brazilian journalist in jail |author=Natalia Mazotte |date=October 24, 2011 |agency=ZD |publisher=Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, Moody College of Communication, The University of Texas at Austin |url = https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/photos-police-attack-gay-pride-parade-land-brazilian-journalist-jail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
In a 2008 interview for the biography book ''La Reina muy cerca'' (The Queen Up Close) by Spanish journalist and writer [[Pilar Urbano]], [[Queen Sofía of Spain]] sparked off controversy by voicing her disapproval of LGBT pride in addition to overstepping her official duties as a member of the Royal Family by censuring the [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spanish Law on Marriage]] in how it names equal same-sex unions "matrimonio" (marriage). Albeit without using the slogan "Straight Pride", Queen Sofía was directly quoted as saying that if heterosexuals were to take the streets as the LGBT community does for Gay Pride parades, that the former collective would bring Madrid to a standstill.&lt;ref name="lavanguardia.es"&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20081101/53570777333.html Pilar Urbano attribute to Queen Sofía polemic comments] ''La Vanguardia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[Royal Household of Spain]] approved publication of the interview and Pilar Urbano offered to share the interview recording, both Queen Sofía and the Royal Household have refuted the comments in question.&lt;ref name="lavanguardia.es"/&gt;

====Turkey====
In 2015 police dispersed the [[Pride parade|LGBT Pride Parade]] using tear gas and rubber bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/governors-office-bans-lgbt-pride-march-in-istanbul.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=114708&amp;NewsCatID=339|title=Governor’s Office bans LGBT Pride March in Istanbul|newspaper=Hurriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 and 2017 [[Governor of İstanbul|Istanbul Governor's Office]] didn't allow the LGBT Pride Parade, citing security concerns and public order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/governors-office-bans-lgbt-pride-march-in-istanbul.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=114708&amp;NewsCatID=339|title=Governor’s Office bans LGBT Pride March in Istanbul|publisher=hurriyet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uganda====
In 2016, Ugandan police broke up a gay pride event in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ugandan police break up gay pride event |agency=Associated Press |date=August 5, 2016 |publisher=CTV News |url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/ugandan-police-break-up-gay-pride-event-1.3015989}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT rights in Uganda|Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda]].

===In-group===
In a special [[queer]] issue of ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' in 1999, [[Coming out|openly gay]] author, pundit, and journalist [[Dan Savage]] questioned the relevance of pride thirty years later, writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people, but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group, as well as being a constant reminder of shame. However, he also states that pride in some simpler forms are still useful to individuals struggling with shame. Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realises the reality that sexual orientation doesn't say much about a person's personality, after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co-supportive and inherently good group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pride |newspaper=The Stranger |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/pride/Content?oid=1313 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321002211/http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/pride/Content?oid=1313 |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth and commercialization of Christopher Street Days, coupled with their de-politicalisation, has led to an alternative CSD in Berlin, the so-called [[Kreuzberg Pride|"Kreuzberger CSD" or "Transgenialer"]] ("Transgenial"/Trans Ingenious") CSD. Political party members are not invited for speeches, nor can parties or companies sponsor floats. After the parade there is a festival with a stage for political speakers and entertainers. Groups discuss lesbian/transsexual/transgender/gay or queer perspectives on issues such as poverty and unemployment benefits (Hartz IV), gentrification, or "Fortress Europe".

In June 2010, American philosopher and theorist [[Judith Butler]] refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony, arguing and lamenting in a speech that the parade had become too commercial, and was ignoring the problems of racism and the double discrimination facing homosexual or transsexual migrants. According to Butler, even the organizers themselves promote racism.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/judith-butler/videos/racism-and-commercialization/ I must distance myself from this complicity with racism (Video)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305185509/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/judith-butler/videos/racism-and-commercialization/ |date=March 5, 2012 }} [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/judith-butler/articles/i-must-distance-myself/ (Transcript).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322041929/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/judith-butler/articles/i-must-distance-myself/ |date=March 22, 2012 }} Christopher Street Day 'Civil Courage Prize' Day Refusal Speech. [[European Graduate School]]. June 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The general manager of the CSD committee, Robert Kastl, countered Butler's allegations and pointed out that the organizers already awarded a counselling center for lesbians dealing with double discrimination in 2006. Regarding the allegations of commercialism Kastl explained further that the CSD organizers don't require small groups to pay a participation fee which starts at 50 € and goes up to 1500 €. He also distanced himself from all forms of racism and islamophobia.&lt;ref&gt;Ataman, Ferda / Kögel, Annette / Hasselmann, Jörg: [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/stadtleben/heftige-diskussionen-nach-kritik-an-csd-/1864540.html "Butler-Auftritt: Heftige Diskussionen nach Kritik an CSD"], ''Der Tagesspiegel'' (Berlin). July 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of associations and social movements have been denouncing in recent years which, in its views, is a depletion of the claims of these demonstrations and the ''[[merchandization]]'' of the parade. In this respect, they defend, in countries like Spain, the United States or Canada, a ''[[Pink capitalism#Current protest movements in Spain|Critical Pride]]'' celebration to have a political meaning again.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://blogs.publico.es/shangaylily/2014/07/02/gaypitalismo-orgullo-empresarial/ Gaypitalismo: Orgullo Empresarial.] ''Público''.

==="Straight Pride" analogy===
{{Main|Straight pride}}
"Straight Pride" and "Heterosexual Pride" are analogies and slogans that oppose heterosexuality to homosexuality by copying the phrase "Gay Pride".&lt;ref name="Massachusetts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massresistance.org/docs/downloads/romney/CommReport_Making_Colleges_Safe_7-93.pdf|title=Making colleges and universities safe for gay and lesbian students: Report and recommendations of the Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth|publisher=Massachusetts. Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth}}, page 20. "A relatively recent tactic used in the backlash opposing les/bi/gay/trans campus visibility is the so-called "heterosexual pride" strategy".&lt;/ref&gt; Originating from the [[Culture War]]s in the United States, "Straight Pride" is a form of conservative [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] as there is no straight or heterosexual [[civil rights]] movement. While criticism from inside and outside the LGBT community abounds, the "Straight Pride" incidents have, however, gained some media attention especially when they involve government and public institutions.

'''Geltungsjude''' was the term for people who were considered [[Jews]] by the first supplementary decree to the [[Nuremberg Laws]] from 14 November 1935. The term wasn't used officially, but was coined because the persons were deemed (''gelten'' in [[German language|German]]) Jews rather than exactly belonging to any of the categories of the previous Nuremberg Laws. There were three categories of Geltungsjuden: 1. offspring of an intermarriage who belonged to the Jewish community after 1935; 2. offspring of an intermarriage who was married to a Jew after 1935; 3. illegitimate child of a Geltungsjude, born after 1935.

==Definition==
The definition of these persons in the decree is as follows:
:''ARTICLE 5  (2)  A Jew is also an individual'' [jüdischer Mischling] ''who is descended from two full-Jewish grandparents if:''
::''(a)  he was a member of the Jewish religious community when this law was issued, or joined the community later;''
::''(b)  when the law was issued, he was married to a person who was a Jew, or was subsequently married to a Jew;''
::''(c)  he is the issue from a marriage with a Jew, in the sense of Section I, which was contracted after the coming into effect of the [[Nuremberg Laws|Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor of 15 September 1935]];''
::''(d)  he is the issue of an extramarital relationship with a Jew, in the sense of Section I, and was born out of wedlock after 31 July 1936.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtsu.edu/~baustin/nurmlaw2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these is ''considered'' a Jew, hence the name ''Geltungsjude''. The term ''jüdischer [[Mischling]]'' in the first sentence means ''Jewish half-breed''. A person with two Jewish grandparents who satisfied none of the criteria (a) through (d) was not considered a "Geltungsjude" but a [[Mischling|Mischling of the First Degree]]. (See also the article on the [[Mischling test]].)

==Consequences==
''Geltungsjuden'' were not citizens of the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]] anymore and did not have the right to vote. They were also prohibited to marry a ''quarter Jew''. In the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]], they were routinely deported. They were sometimes deported from the "Old Reich" (Altreich), and only very rarely from Austria{{cn|date=March 2017}}.

In contrast, while Mischlinge of the First Degree within the Old Reich were subject to various forms of discrimination, they were at least in principle exempt from deportation. Their status as "provisional citizens" was subject of an intra-regime tug-of-war between maximalists like [[Heydrich]] (who wanted them treated like Jews) and minimalists who pleaded against "throwing  out the Aryan with the Jewish blood" (such as [[Wilhelm Stuckart]] and his assistant [[Hans Globke]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2273">'''Gentleness''' is the value and quality of one's [[Moral character|character]]. Being gentle has a long history in many, but not all [[culture]]s. Gentleness is considered to play a very important role in life.

The quality of gentleness is colloquially understood to be that of kindness, consideration and amiability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gentleness&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] used it in a technical sense as the virtue that strikes the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|mean]] with regard to anger: being too quick to anger is a vice, but so is being detached in a situation where anger is appropriate; justified and properly focused anger is named mildness or gentleness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrett|first=Jan|title=Virtue Ethics: A Basic Introductory Essay|url=http://www.wku.edu/~jan.garrett/ethics/virtthry.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gentleness is a strong hand with a soft touch. It is a tender, compassionate approach toward others' weaknesses and limitations. A gentle person still speaks truth, sometimes even painful truth, but in doing so guards their tone so the truth can be well received.  "When my daughter was young, she used to love to squeeze my hand as hard as she could, trying to make it hurt. She could squeeze with all her might, but it never hurt. She didn't need to be gentle because she lacked the power to cause me any pain. Then, just for fun, I'd give her hand a tight little squeeze until she yelped.
It's the strong hand, not the weak one, that must learn to be gentle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawk|first=Dean| title=The Strength of Gentleness|url=http://www.thrivingfamily.com/Family/Faith/2011/strength-of-gentleness.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second important usage was common in medieval times, associated with higher social classes: hence the derivation of the terms [[gentleman]], [[gentlewoman]] and [[gentry]]. The broadening of gentle behavior from a literal sense of the gentry to the metaphorical "like a gentleman" applicable to any person was a later development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|title=Mere Christianity|year=2001|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0060652920|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hedonimetry''' is the study of happiness as a measurable [[economic]] asset.  The first major work in the field was an 1881 publication of ''Mathematical Psychics'' by the famous statistician and economist [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]], who hypothesized a way of measuring happiness in units.&lt;ref&gt;Edgeworth, F. Y. (1881):  ''Mathematical Psychics'', Kegan Paul, London.[https://books.google.com/books?id=StokAAAAMAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;   In recent times, it has been applied to many areas, including consumer behavior and health care.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A '''Holy Lie''' is a philosophical concept coined by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his note manuscript [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|''The Will to Power'']]. It is also mentioned in another of Nietzsche's books, [[The Antichrist (book)|''The Antichrist'']].

== Sources ==
The idea of a holy lie is seen in part one of the second book of "The Will to Power," which consists of two critiques. The two critiques are "the critique of religion" and "the critique of morality" respectively.

== Concept ==
A holy lie, according to Friedrich Nietzsche, is the means by which priests and philosophers obtain the piety of their audiences.&lt;ref name="Der wille"/&gt;{{quote|The means he employs are as follows: he alone is all knowing; he alone is virtuous......|The Will to Power, Book 2, Part 1, Note 139|source=}}

Nietzsche argues that the purpose of human action is altered by the holy lie since the original moral standards of the general public is influenced by the moral standards preached by the priests and philosophers. Consequently, the human faculty of moral judgment based on the "beneficial" versus the "harmful" is in dysfunction. People who accept the holy lie do not evaluate the fairness of a thing by what Nietzsche calls "The natural notion". Instead, the notions, standards and doctrines preached by the preachers(priests and philosophers) substitutes the natural notion.&lt;ref name="Der wille"&gt;The Will to Power. Page 94-96. Penguin Classics&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In this way, a conception of ''good'' and ''evil'' is created which appears to be entirely detached from the natural notions......In this way, the famous notion of "Conscience" is finally created. An inner voice which does not evaluate an act by its consequences, but by its intention and conformity of that intention to the "Law".|The Will to Power, Book 2, Part 1, Note 141|source=}}

In his book ''The Antichrist'', Nietzsche further explains his idea with an example of [[Paul the Apostle]] and the downfall of the [[Roman empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Antichrist.Note 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humility''' is the quality of being '''humble'''. Dictionary definitions accentuate humility as a low self-regard and sense of unworthiness.&lt;ref name="SnyderLopez2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

Humility is an outward expression of an appropriate inner, or self regard, and is contrasted with [[humiliation]] which is an imposition, often external, of [[shame]] upon a person.  Humility may be misappropriated as ability to suffer humiliation through self-denouncements which in itself remains focus on self rather than low self-focus.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer 2012"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schwarzer | first=Ralf | title=Personality, human development, and culture : international perspectives on psychological science | publisher=Psychology | location=Hove | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-415-65080-9 | pages=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Greenberg|author2=Sander L.

Humility, in various interpretations, is widely seen as a [[virtue]] which centers on low self-preoccupation, or unwillingness to put oneself forward, so it is in many religious and philosophical traditions, it contrasts with [[narcissism]], [[hubris]] and other forms of [[pride]] and is an idealistic and rare intrinsic construct that has an extrinsic side.

==Term==
The term "humility" comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[wikt:humilitas#Latin|humilitas]]'', a noun related to the adjective ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:humilis#Latin|humilis]]}}'', which may be translated as "humble", but also as "grounded", or "from the earth", since it derives from ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:humus#Latin|humus]]}}'' (earth). See the English ''[[humus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/humble "Humble" from Merriam-Webster], m-w.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "humble" may be related to feudal England where the lowest cuts of meat, or 'umbles' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallow-deer-project.net/img/upload/370/documents/1066%20and%20all%20that.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;,' that is to say whatever was left over when the upper classes had taken their parts, were provided to the lowest class of citizen.  The term 'humble pie,' meaning to exist in a lowly station, may derive from this definition.

==Mythology==
[[Aidos]], in Greek mythology, was the ''daimona'' (goddess) of shyness, shame, and humility.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Scheff and Suzanne Retzinger, Emotions and Violence: shame and rage in destructive conflicts, {{ISBN|0-595-21190-9}}, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; She was the quality that restrained human beings from wrong.

==Religious views of humility==

===Abrahamic===

====Judaism====
Rabbi Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]] states that in Judaism humility is an appreciation of oneself, one's talents, skills, and virtues.  It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher.  Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one has received. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the awesomeness of what one is and what one can achieve.  Rabbi [[Pini Dunner]] discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others' worth as important.  In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history of time, you and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, "And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man on the face of the earth." How is it possible to be humble and write you are the most humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live up to your worth and something greater.  It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/160968/jewish/What-is-Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1932762/jewish/Greatness-is-Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/83807/jewish/On-Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1218750/jewish/Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As illustrated in the person of [[Moses]], who leads the nation of [[Hebrews]] out of slavery in Egypt and to the “Promised Land”, humility is a sign of Godly strength and purpose, not weakness. Of this great leader, the Bible states, “For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth" ({{bibleref|Numbers|12:3}}).  Moses is venerated by Jewish, Christian and Muslim adherents alike.

Amongst the benefits of humility described in the [[Old Testament]], that is shared by many faiths, are [[honor]], [[wisdom]], [[prosperity]], the protection of the Lord and [[peace]]. In addition, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the  humble" ({{bibleref|Proverbs|3:34}})

====Christianity====

{{Quote box|quote=Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
Who, being in very nature God,
did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
rather, he made himself nothing
by taking the very nature of a servant,
being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man,
he humbled himself
by becoming obedient to death—
even death on a cross!
|source=Philippians 2:3-8, NIV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippians 2|url=http://biblehub.com/niv/philippians/2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;| align=right|width=30%}}

New Testament exhortations to humility are found in many places, for example "Blessed are the meek" ({{bibleref|Matthew|5}}), "He who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted" ({{bibleref|Matthew|23:12}}), as well as ({{bibleref|Philippians|2:1-17}}) and throughout the [[Epistle of James|Book of James]]. Also in [[Jesus|Jesus Christ's]] behavior in general and submission to unjust torture and execution in particular, are held up as examples of righteous humility: "Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him justly."{{bibleref|1 Peter|2:23}},&lt;ref name="Humility 1860, pp 598-599"/&gt;

[[C.S. Lewis]] writes, in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', that pride is the "anti-God" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: "Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind."&lt;ref&gt;Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis, {{ISBN|978-0-06-065292-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Lewis contends that, in Christian moral teaching, the opposite of pride is humility.  This is popularly illustrated by a  phrase wrongly attributed to Lewis, "Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less." This is an apparent paraphrase, by Rick Warren in "The Purpose Driven Life", of a passage found in "[[Mere Christianity]]:" Lewis writes, regarding the truly humble man, {{block quote|Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man he will be what most people call "humble" nowadays: he will not be a sort of greasy, smarmy person, who is always telling you that, of course, he is nobody. Probably all you will think about him is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap who took a real interest in what you said to him. If you do dislike him it will be because you feel a little envious of anyone who seems to enjoy life so easily. He will not be thinking about humility: he will not be thinking about himself at all.}}

[[St. Augustine]] stresses the importance of humility in the study of the Bible, with the exemplars of a barbarian Christian slave, the apostle Paul, and the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8 (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'', prooem. 4–7 [hereafter ''DDC'']).  Both learner and teacher need to be humble, because they learn and teach what ultimately belongs to God (''DDC'', prooem. 7–8; 1 Cor. 4:7). Humility is a basic disposition of the interpreter of the Bible. The confidence of the exegete and preacher arises from the conviction that his or her mind depends on God absolutely (''DDC'', 1.1.1). Augustine argues that the interpreter of the Bible should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (''DDC'', 2.41.62).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=Augustine’s Hermeneutics and Homiletics in ''De doctrina christiana'' | journal= Journal of Christian Philosophy | year=2013 | volume=17 | url=https://www.academia.edu/5228314/_Augustines_Hermeneutics_and_Homiletics_in_De_doctrina_christianae_Humiliation_Love_Sign_and_Discipline_Journal_of_Christian_Philosophy_17_2013_97-117 |pages=99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humility is said to be a fit recipient of grace; according to the words of St. James, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble" ({{bibleref|Proverbs|3:34}}, {{bibleref|1Peter|5:5}},{{bibleref|James|4:6}}.)

"True humility" is distinctly different from "false humility" which consists of deprecating one's own sanctity, gifts, talents, and accomplishments for the sake of receiving praise or adulation from others, as personified by the [[fictional character]] [[Uriah Heep]] created by [[Charles Dickens]]. In this context legitimate humility comprises the following behaviors and attitudes:
*Submitting to God and legitimate authority 
*Recognizing virtues and talents that others possess, particularly those that surpass one's own, and giving due honor and, when required, obedience
*Recognizing the limits of one's talents, ability, or authority.

The vices opposed to humility are: 
*[[Pride]]  
*Too great [[obsequiousness]] or abjection of oneself; this would be considered an excess of humility, and could easily be derogatory to one's office or holy character; or it might serve only to pamper pride in others, by unworthy flattery, which would occasion their sins of tyranny, arbitrariness, and arrogance. The virtue of humility may not be practiced in any external way that would occasion vices in others.&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt;

=====Catholicism=====

[[File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|thumb|240px| This ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[Domenico di Bartolo]] expresses the symbolic duality of an earthly woman with humility, as well as a [[Queen of Heaven|heavenly queen]].&lt;ref Name =Trinchieri&gt;''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&amp;pg=PA15 page 15]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Catholic]] texts view humility as annexed to the [[cardinal virtue]] of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].&lt;ref name="Humility 1910, pp 543-544"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, " Humility"], newadvent.org&lt;/ref&gt; It is viewed as a potential part of temperance because temperance includes all those virtues that restrain or express the inordinate movements of our desires or appetites.&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt;

[[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] defines it as, "A virtue by which a man knowing himself as he truly is, abases himself. Jesus Christ is the ultimate definition of Humility."&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt;

Humility was a virtue extolled by Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], and this form of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety led to the artistic development of the ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' first used by them for [[Christian contemplation|contemplation]].&lt;ref&gt;''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iconography of Christian Art'' by Gertrud Schiller 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madonna (art)|Virgin]] of humility sits on the ground, or upon a low cushion, unlike the ''Enthroned Madonna'' representations.&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt; This style of painting spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany and it became the most popular among the styles of the early [[Trecento]] artistic period.&lt;ref name=Meiss&gt;''Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death'' by Millard Meiss 1979 {{ISBN|0-691-00312-2}} pages 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], a 13th-century philosopher and theologian in the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] tradition, defines humility similarly as "the virtue of humility" that "consists in keeping oneself within one's own bounds, not reaching out to things above one, but submitting to one's superior" (Summa Contra Gent., bk. IV, ch. lv, tr. [[Joseph Rickaby]]).

====Islam====
In the [[Qur'an]], various Arabic words conveying the meaning of "humility" are used.  The very term "[[Islam]]" can be interpreted as "surrender (to God), humility”, from the triconsonantal root [[S-L-M]]; other words used are ''tawadu'' and ''khoshou'': &lt;!-- the word "humility" is a noun but the 2 Arabic words used before were verbs, so I changed these to nouns.  In order not to have a discussion about this, I will explain that I know what the previous editor had in mind. The person who used the verbs (which were the past tense of a male 3rd person singular) used what is customarily considered a "root" of the verb, which, for example, is used in finding a word in a dictionary.  This, however, was not warranted here because we just needed to have the exact translation of the noun "humility" --&gt;

{{quote|“The loftiest in status are those who do not know their own status, and the most virtuous of them are those who do not know their own virtue."
Imam ash-Shafi`i

“Your humbleness humbles others and your modesty brings out the modesty of others."

“Humility is not to think less of yourself, but to think about yourself less."

====Buddhism====
{{see also|Anatta}}
Buddhism is a religion of self-examination.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt; The natural aim of the Buddhist life is the state of [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], gradually cultivated through meditation and other spiritual practices. Humility, in this context, is a characteristic that is both an essential part of the spiritual practice, and a result of it.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|180, 183}} As a quality to be developed, it is deeply connected with the practice of Four Abodes ([[Brahmavihara]]): love-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} As a result of the practice, this cultivated humility is expanded by the wisdom acquired by the experience of ultimate emptiness ([[Shunyata]]) and non-self ([[Anatta]]).&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|181}} Humility, compassion, and wisdom are intrinsic parts of the state of enlightenment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} On the other hand, not being humble is an obstacle on the path of enlightenment which needs to be overcome.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|180}} In the [[Tipitaka]] (the Buddhist scriptures), criticizing others and praising oneself is considered a vice; but criticizing oneself and praising others is considered a virtue.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|date=1992|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=070070230X|edition=[Facsim. ed.].|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}} Attachment to the self, apart from being a vice in itself, also leads to other evil states, that create suffering.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|182}}

In the Tipitaka, in the widely known "[[Mangala Sutta]]", humility (''{{lang-pi|nivato}}'', literally: 'without air') is mentioned as one of the thirty-eight blessings in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|translator-last=Ñāṇamoli|translator-first=Bhikkhu|translator-link=Nanamoli Bhikkhu|title=The Minor Readings and The Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning|date=1960|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FCToAEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pali tradition, examples of humility that are often raised are the monk [[Sariputta|Sariputta Thera]], a leading disciple of the Buddha, and Hatthaka, a leading lay disciple. In later Pali texts and [[Atthakatha|Commentaries]], Sariputta Thera is depicted as a forgiving person, who is quick to apologize and accepting of criticism. In the ''[[suttas]]'' (discourses of the Buddha) Hatthaka is praised by the Buddha when he was unwilling to let other people know his good qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malalasekera|author-link= G P Malalasekera|first1=G.P.|title=Dictionary of Pāli proper names|volume=2|date=2007|orig-year=First published 1937|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass Publishers]]|location=Delhi|isbn=8120830229|edition=1st Indian|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/dic_idx.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhist practice]], humility is practiced in a variety of ways. For example, Japanese [[Soto Zen]] monks bow and chant in honor of their robes before they don them. This serves to remind them of the connection of the monk's robes with enlightenment. Buddhist monks in all traditions are dependent on the generosity of laypeople, through whom they receive their necessities. This in itself is a practice of humility.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|178}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tanabe|first1=Willa Jane|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|title=Robes and clothing|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|date=2004|publisher=[[Thomson Gale|Macmillan Reference USA, Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|page=732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu Dharma / Sanathana Dharma====
In Sanskrit literature, the virtue of humility is explained with many terms, some of which use the root word, ''neti'' (sometimes spelled ''nati'', ''nti'', Sanskrit: नति).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=humility+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit translations for Humility] English-Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/132.html Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary], see explanation under the term नति [ nati ], France&lt;/ref&gt; "नति" comes from "न ति" or 'No "Me" / I am not'. Related words include ''viniti'' (विनति), ''samniti'' (संनति, humility towards), and the concept ''amanitvam'', listed as the first virtue in the [[Bhagwad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-13-06.html Bhagwad Gita 13.8-12] See transliteration, and two commentaries.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amanitvam'' is a fusion word for "pridelessness" and the virtue of "humility".&lt;ref&gt;''Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern'' edited by K. R. Sundararajan, Bithika Mukerji; {{ISBN|978-8120819375}}; see pages 403-405&lt;/ref&gt; Other related concepts are ''namrata'' (नम्रता), which means ''modest and humble behavior''.

Different scholars have varying interpretations for the concept of ''amanitvam'', humility, as virtue in the Bhagwad Gita.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B. (2006). BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS DUTY AND VIRTUE ETHICS. Journal of Religious Ethics, 34(3), 373-395.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Prabhupada explains humility to mean one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others.&lt;ref&gt;''BHAGAVAD GITA AS IT IS'' - By His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.&lt;/ref&gt; The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. Jopson explains ''amanitvam'', humility, as lack of arrogance and pride, and one of twenty-six virtues in a human being that if perfected, leads one to a divine state of living and the ultimate truth.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Jopson, ''Human Energy-Body Awareness: How Our Energy Body &amp; Vibrational Frequency Create Our Everyday Life'', {{ISBN|978-1466333413}}, see Divine Qualities under Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhawuk, D. P. (2011). Epistemology and Ontology of Indian Psychology. In Spirituality and Indian Psychology (pp. 163-184). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eknath Easwaran]] writes that the Gita's subject is "the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious",&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran, ''The Bhagavad Gita'' (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-58638-019-9}} p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow".&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran, ''The End of Sorrow: The Bahagavad Gita for Daily Living (vol 1)'' (1993), {{ISBN|978-0-915132-17-1}}  p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; To get in touch with your true self, whether you call that [[God]], [[Brahman]], etc., one has to let go of the ego.  The [[Sanskrit]] word [[Ahamkara]] literally translates into The-sound-of-I, or quite simply the sense of the self or ego.

[[Mahatma Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] interprets the concept of ''humility'' in Hindu Dharma much more broadly, where humility is an essential virtue that must exist in a person for other virtues to emerge. To Mahatma Gandhi, Truth can be cultivated, as well as Love, but Humility cannot be cultivated. Humility has to be one of the starting points. He states, "Humility cannot be an observance by itself. For it does not lend itself to being practiced. It is however an indispensable test of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence)." Humility must not be confused with mere manners; a man may prostrate himself before another, but if his heart is full of bitterness for the other, it is not humility. Sincere humility is how one feels inside, it's a state of mind. A humble person is not himself conscious of his humility, states Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkgandhi.org/swmgandhi/chap02.htm Humility The Gita and Satyagraha; The Philosophy of Non-violence and The Doctrine of the Sword], SELECTED WRITINGS OF MAHATMA GANDHI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen S. Hall, Wisdom, {{ISBN|978-0-307-26910-2}}; see Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swami Vivekananda|Swami Vivekananda]], one of the scholars of Hindu Dharma in the 19th century, argues that the concept of humility does not mean "crawling on all fours and calling oneself a sinner." In Vivekananda's Hindu Dharma, each human being being the Universal, recognizing and feeling oneness with everyone and everything else in the universe, without inferiority or superiority or any other bias, is the mark of humility.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Vivekananda, The Complete Works of the Swami Vivekananda, Volume 1 (1915); see page 343&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Dr. S Radhakrishnan]], humility in Hindu Dharma is the non-judgmental state of mind when we are best able to learn, contemplate and understand everyone and everything else.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan &amp; Muirhead, Contemporary Indian Philosophy (1936), Allen 7 Sons (London)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guru Nanak]], the first [[Sikh gurus|Sikh guru]] was the prophet of humility.&lt;ref name="sggs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srigurugranthsahib.org/guru-nanak/prophet-of-humility.htm|title=Guru Nanak Dev Ji - Greatest Prophet of Humility|website=www.srigurugranthsahib.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj said about Guru Nanak that Garibi, Nimrata, Humility is the Divine Flavour, the most wonderful fragrance of the Lotus Feet of Lord Guru Nanak.&lt;ref name="sggs1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babanandsinghsahib.org/rosary/fragrance.htm|title=Rosary of Divine Wisdom - Fragrance of The Holy Feet of Guru Nanak|website=www.babanandsinghsahib.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no place for Ego (referred to in Sikhism as Haumain) in the sphere of Divine Love, in the sphere of true Prema Bhagti. That is why in the House of Guru Nanak one finds Garibi, Nimrata, Humility reigning supreme. Guru Nanak was an Incarnation of Divine Love and a Prophet of True Humility.

According to Sikhism all people, equally, have to bow before God so there ought to be no hierarchies among or between people.  According to Nanak the supreme purpose of human life is to reconnect with [[Akal]] (The Timeless One), however, egotism is the biggest barrier in doing this. Using the guru's teaching remembrance of ''[[Nām Japō|nām]]'' (the divine Word)&lt;ref name="NaamSimran"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Paths-Divine-Ancient-Indian-12/dp/1565182480/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385026816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=1565182480 | title=Paths to The Divine: Ancient and Indian: 12 | publisher=Council for Research in Values &amp; | author=McLean, George | date=15 Jun 2008 | location=1565182480 | pages=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;  leads to the end of egotism.  The immediate fruit of humility is intuitive peace and pleasure. With humility they continue to meditate on the Lord, the treasure of excellence. The God-conscious being is steeped in humility. One whose heart is mercifully blessed with abiding humility. Sikhism treats humility as a begging bowl before the god.

Sikhs extend this belief in equality, and thus humility, towards all faith:  "all religious traditions are equally valid and capable of enlightening their followers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sikhism|edition= |last= Singh Kalsi|first= Sewa|year= 2007|publisher= Bravo Ltd.|location= London|isbn= 978-1-85733-436-4|page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Vaṇḍ Chakkō|sharing]] with others Guru Nanak inspired people to earn an honest living without exploitation and also the need for [[Naam Japna|remembrance]] of the divine name (God).

====Baba Nand Singh Ji====
Baba Nand Singh Sahib is renowned as the most humble Sikh Saint in the history of Sikhism. Once the disciples of Baba Harnam Singh Ji, the spiritual preceptor of Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj asked him how much power He had transmitted to Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj to which He replied&lt;ref name="sggs2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babanandsinghsahib.org/powers/index.htm|title=Repository of Infinite Divine Powers|website=www.babanandsinghsahib.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=''"Rikhi Nand Singh holds in His hand Infinite Divine Powers. By just opening His fist He can create as many such-like universes as He likes and by closing the same fist can withdraw all those universes unto Himself.''

''But the whole beauty is that being the supreme Repository of all the Infinite Divine Powers, He claims to be nothing and is so humble."''|sign=Baba Harnam Singh Ji Maharaj}}

Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj was humbler than the humblest in spirit and He outshines everyone at the pinnacle of all spiritual glory.

Sri Guru Arjan Sahib says in Sukhmani Sahib:

{{Quote|text="Brahm Giani Sab Shresht Ka Karta
Brahm Giani Sad Jiwe Nahin Marta
...
Brahm Giani Ka Sagal Akar
Brahm Giani Aap Nirankar."''Translated it means: A true Brahm Giani is the creator of the whole universe. Brahm Giani lives through eternity; He never dies.Brahm Giani pervades the whole manifest creation. Brahm Giani is Himself the formless Universal Lord.''|sign=[[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], 273|source=&lt;ref name="sggs2" /&gt;}}

{{Quote|text=He who is the Highest is the Lowest. Highest in the Lowest is the Real Highest.|sign=Baba Narinder Singh Ji}}

====Meher Baba====
The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] held that humility is one of the foundations of devotional life: "Upon the altar of humility we must offer our prayers to God."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''3'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 129. {{ISBN|978-1-880619-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baba also described the power of humility to overcome hostility: "True humility is strength, not weakness. It disarms antagonism and ultimately conquers it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1957). ''Life at Its Best''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 25-26. {{ISBN|978-0-525-47434-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Baba emphasized the importance of being humble when serving others: "''One of the most difficult things to learn is to render service without bossing, without making a fuss about it and without any consciousness of high and low. In the world of spirituality, humility counts at least as much as utility''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1933). ''The Sayings of Shri Meher Baba.'' London: The Circle Editorial Committee. pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taoism====
{{Quote box|quote=Here are my three treasures.&lt;br/&gt;
Guard and keep them! &lt;br/&gt;
The first is pity; the second, frugality; the third, refusal to be "foremost of all things under heaven". &lt;br/&gt;
For only he that pities is truly able to be brave; &lt;br/&gt;
Only he that is frugal is able to be profuse. &lt;br/&gt;
Only he that refuses to be foremost of all things &lt;br/&gt;
Is truly able to become chief of all Ministers. &lt;br/&gt;
At present your bravery is not based on pity, nor your profusion on frugality, nor your vanguard on your rear; and this is death. |source=(translation of the [[Tao Te Ching]]) by [[Arthur Waley]] 1958:225| align=right|width=25%}}

Humility, in Taoism, is defined as a refusal to assert authority or a refusal to be first in anything and that the act of daring, in itself, is a refusal of wisdom and a rush to enjoin circumstances before you are ready.  Along with [[compassion]] and [[frugality]], humility is one the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|three treasures]] (virtues) in the possession of those who follow the  [[Tao]].&lt;ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"/&gt;

The treasure of humility, in Chinese is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: ''Bugan wei tianxia xian'' 不敢為天下先 "not dare to be first/ahead in the world". 
Ellen Chen notes&lt;ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"&gt;Lao Tzu, Jane English, and Gia-Fu Feng (1997), Tao Te Ching, Vintage Books, {{ISBN|978-0679776192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Chen, Ellen M., 1989, ''The Te Tao Ching: A New Translation with Commentary'', Paragon House.&lt;/ref&gt; that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, also according to the [[Tao Te Ching]] (77.4) a wise person acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it: – he does not wish to display his superiority.&lt;ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"/&gt;

===Wicca===

In the numerous traditions of initiatory Wicca, called in the U.S.A. '''British Traditional Wicca''', four paired &amp; balanced qualities are recommended in liturgical texts as having come from the Wiccan Goddess:

{{Quote|text=''"…let there be beauty and strength, power and compassion, honor and humility, mirth and reverence within you."''|sign=Doreen Valiente, ''The Charge of the Goddess,'' prose version}}

In the matter of humility, this deific instruction appropriately pairs being honorable with being humble. Characteristically, this Wiccan "virtue" is balanced by its partner virtue.

==Philosophical views of humility==
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s view of humility has been defined as "that meta-attitude that constitutes the moral agent's proper perspective on himself as a dependent and corrupt but capable and dignified rational agent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=4881|title=Kant and the Ethics of Humility|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's notion of humility relies on the centrality of truth and rational thought leading to proper perspective and can therefore be seen as [[emergence|emergent]].

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] is attributed as suggesting that attempting to sustain [[truth]] without humility is doomed to become an "arrogant caricature" of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060630013653/http://www.geocities.com/rkvenkat/chastity.html Gandhi on Brahmacharya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], geocities.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkgandhi.org/epigrams/h.htm Epigrams from Gandhiji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], mkgandhi.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Cohon, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/ Hume's Moral Philosophy] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;André Vauchez (2002), Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, see article on ''Humility'', James Clarke &amp; Co, {{ISBN|9780227679319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many religions and philosophers view humility as a virtue, some have been critical of it, seeing it as opposed to [[individualism]].

[[Nietzsche]] views humility as a [[strategy]] used by the weak to avoid being destroyed by the strong.  In ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' he writes: "When stepped on, a worm doubles up. That is clever. In that way he lessens the probability of being stepped on again. In the language of morality:  humility."{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} He believed that his idealized [[Übermensch]] would be more apt to roam around unfettered by pretensions of humility, proud of his stature and power, but not reveling idly in it, and certainly not displaying [[hubris]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  But, if so, this would mean the pretension aspect of this kind of humility is more akin to [[obsequiousness]] and to other kinds of pretentious humility.

==Humility and leadership==
Recent research suggests that humility is a quality of certain types of leaders. For example, [[James Collins (bioengineer)|Jim Collins]] and his colleagues found that a certain type of leader, whom they term "level 5", possesses humility and fierce resolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Collins |first=J. |year=2001 |title= Level 5 leadership: The triumph of humility and fierce resolve |work=Harvard Business Review |pages= 66–76 |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |url=http://www.hr-newcorp.com/articles/Level5%20Leadership_Jim%20Collins.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229150239/http://www.hr-newcorp.com/articles/Level5%20Leadership_Jim%20Collins.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humility is being studied as a trait that can enhance leadership effectiveness. The research suggests that humility is multi-dimensional and includes self-understanding and awareness, openness, and perspective taking.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, J. A., Brotheridge, C. M., &amp; Urbanski, J. C. (2005). Bringing humility to leadership: Antecedents and consequences of leader humility. Human Relations, 58, 1323-1350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, R., Marrone, J.

A '''launch status check''', also known as a "go/no go poll" and several other terms occurs at the beginning of an American spaceflight mission in which [[flight controller]]s monitoring various systems are queried for operation and readiness status before a launch can proceed. For [[Space Shuttle missions]], in the firing room at the [[Launch Control Center]], the NASA Test Director (NTD) performed this check via a voice communications link with other NASA personnel. The NTD was the leader of the shuttle test team responsible for directing and integrating all flight crew, orbiter, external tank/solid rocket booster and ground support testing in the shuttle launch countdown. The NTD was also responsible for the safety of all personnel inside the pad after external tank loading, including the flight crew. He reported to the [[Launch_Control_Center#Launch_Director_.28LD.29|Launch Director]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/countdown/lps/ab/ab.html NASA Web Site: Firing Room Row AB]&lt;/ref&gt; The Launch director declares if a mission is go for launch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5447">'''Linear partial information (LPI)''' is a method of making decisions based on insufficient or [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy information]]. LPI was introduced in 1970 by Polish–Swiss mathematician [[Edward Kofler]] (1911–2007) to simplify [[Decision making|decision]] processes. Compared to [[Fuzzy set|other methods]] the LPI-fuzziness is [[algorithm]]ically simple and particularly in [[decision making]], more practically oriented. Instead of an [[indicator function]] the decision maker [[linear]]izes any fuzziness by establishing of linear restrictions for fuzzy probability distributions or normalized weights. In the LPI-procedure the decision maker [[linear]]izes any fuzziness instead of applying a membership function. This can be done by establishing [[stochastic]] and non-stochastic LPI-relations. A mixed stochastic and non-stochastic fuzzification is often a basis for the LPI-procedure. By using the LPI-methods any fuzziness in any decision situation can be considered on the base of the [[linear]] [[fuzzy logic]].

== Definition ==
Any Stochastic Partial Information '''SPI(p)''', which can be considered as a solution of a [[linear]] [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] [[system]], is called Linear Partial Information '''LPI(p)''' about probability '''p'''. It can be considered as an LPI-fuzzification of the probability '''p''' corresponding to the concepts of linear fuzzy logic.

== Applications ==
;The MaxEmin Principle
: To obtain the maximally warranted [[expected value]], the decision maker has to choose the [[strategy]] which maximizes the minimal [[expected value]]. This procedure leads to the MaxEmin – Principle and is an extension of the [[Bernoulli's principle]].
;The MaxWmin Principle
: This principle leads to the maximal guaranteed [[weight function]], regarding the extreme weights.
;The Prognostic Decision Principle (PDP)
: This principle is based on the [[prognostic|prognosis]] interpretation of strategies under fuzziness.

== Fuzzy equilibrium and stability ==
Despite the fuzziness of information, it is often necessary to choose the optimal, most cautious strategy, for example in economic planning, in conflict situations or in daily decisions. This is impossible without the concept of fuzzy equilibrium. The concept of fuzzy stability is considered as an extension into a time interval, taking into account the corresponding stability area of the decision maker. The more complex is the model, the softer a choice has to be considered. 
The idea of fuzzy equilibrium is based on the optimization principles. Therefore, the MaxEmin-, MaxGmin- and PDP-stability have to be analyzed. The violation of these principles leads often to wrong predictions and decisions.

== LPI  equilibrium point ==
Considering a given LPI-decision model, as a [[convolution]] of the corresponding fuzzy states or a disturbance set, the fuzzy equilibrium strategy remains the most cautious one, despite of the presence of the fuzziness. Any deviation from this strategy can cause a loss for the decision maker.

There are 53 '''municipalities of Finland in which Finnish is not the sole official language'''.&lt;ref name="ruotsin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luoma"/&gt; In [[Finland]], as of December 31, 2013, 89.3% of the population speak [[Finnish language|Finnish]], 5.3% [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and 0.04% [[Sami languages]].&lt;ref name="statistica"&gt;[http://pxweb2.stat.fi/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=060_vaerak_tau_107&amp;ti=V%E4est%F6+kielen+mukaan+sek%E4+ulkomaan+kansalaisten+m%E4%E4r%E4+ja+maa%2Dpinta%2Dala+alueittain+1980+%2D+2011&amp;path=../Database/StatFin/vrm/vaerak/&amp;lang=3&amp;multilang=fi "Väestö kielen mukaan sekä ulkomaan kansalaisten määrä ja maa-pinta-ala alueittain 1980 – 2013" ("Population according to language and the number of foreigners and land area by region 1980 – 2013"]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, at the Statistics Finland site; accessed June 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Both Finnish and Swedish are [[Languages of Finland|official languages of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Heikki E.

Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006, {{ISBN|978-075464-874-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, a municipality is bilingual if the minority language group consists of at least 8% of the population, or at least 3,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="ruotsin"&gt;{{fi icon}} [http://www.kunnat.net/fi/kunnat/ruotsinjakaksikielisetkunnat/Diasarjat%20kuntien%20toiminnasta/Ruotsin_ja_kaksikieliset_kunnat_2013.pdf "Ruotsin- ja kaksikieliset kunnat" ("Swedish and Bilingual Municipalities")], at the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities site; accessed June 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A previously bilingual municipality remains so if the linguistic minority proportion drops below 8%, up to 6%. If it drops below 6%, it is possible for the municipality to remain bilingual by government decree, on the recommendation of the municipal council, for a further ten years.&lt;ref name="salo"&gt;Olli-Pekka Salo, "Finland's Official Bilingualism – A Bed of Roses or of Procrustes?", in Jan Blommaert, Sirpa Leppänen, Päivi Pahta (eds.), ''Dangerous Multilingualism: Northern Perspectives on Order, Purity and Normality'', p. 28&amp;ndash;9. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-023032-141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities that make use of the 3,000-speaker rule include the national capital [[Helsinki]] and the cultural center of Swedish Finns, [[Turku]]. On the [[Åland]] archipelago, where Finnish is almost absent from daily life, the language law does not apply. On the mainland, the highest proportion of Swedish-speakers is found on the western coast, in [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]].&lt;ref&gt;Claus D.

Of the 317 [[Municipalities of Finland|Finnish municipalities]], 16 are monolingually Swedish. 33 municipalities are bilingually Finnish and Swedish; of these, 15 have a Swedish-speaking majority and 18 a Finnish-speaking one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/2013/20130053]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ruotsin"/&gt; Four municipalities, all located in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], have a Finnish-speaking majority and a Sami-speaking minority: [[Enontekiö]], [[Inari, Finland|Inari]], [[Sodankylä]] and [[Utsjoki]].&lt;ref name="luoma"&gt;Kenneth Douglas McRae, Mika Helander, Sari Luoma, ''Conflict and Compromise in Multilingual Societies: Finland, Volume 3'', p. 231.

'''Low-''g'' condition''' is a phase of aerodynamic [[flight]] where the airframe is temporarily unloaded.  The pilot&amp;mdash;and the airframe&amp;mdash;feel temporarily "[[Weightlessness|weightless]]" because the aircraft is in [[free-fall]] or decelerating vertically at the top of a climb.  It may also occur during an excessively rapid entry into autorotation. This can have a disastrous effect on the aircraft, particularly in the case of helicopters, some of which need the rotor to constantly be under a non-zero amount of load.

== Effects ==

'''In smaller airplanes'''

Most smaller airplanes and gliders have no problems with 0''g'' conditions. In fact, it can be enjoyable to have zero gravity in the cockpit. To produce 0''g'', the aircraft has to follow a ballistic flight path, which is essentially an upside down parabola.
This is the only method to simulate zero gravity for humans on earth. 

'''In helicopters'''

In contrast, low-g conditions can be disastrous for [[helicopter]]s. In such a situation their [[helicopter rotor|rotor]]s may flap beyond normal limits. The excessive flapping can cause the root of the blades to exceed the limit of their hinges and this condition, known as mast bumping, can cause the separation of the blades from the hub or for the mast to shear, and hence detach the whole system from the aircraft, falling from the sky. This is especially true for helicopters with teetering rotors, such as the two-bladed design seen on [[Robinson Helicopter Company|Robinson helicopter]]s.
This effect was first discovered when many accidents with [[Bell UH-1]] and AH-1 helicopters occurred. These particular helicopters simply crashed without any obvious cause. Later, it was found that these accidents usually happened during low terrain flight after passing a ridge and initiating a dive from the previous climb.
Articulated and rigid rotor systems do not lose controlling forces up to 0''g'', but may encounter this depending on their flapping hinge offset from the mast. However, dangerous situations, as with a teetering rotor, may not occur.

'''On fixed-wing aircraft'''

Low-''g'' conditions can also affect [[fixed-wing aircraft]] in some instances, mainly by disrupting the airflow over the wings, making them difficult or impossible to control via the aerodynamic surfaces.

The controllability of an airplane by the control surfaces only depends on airspeed. So, if one keeps airspeed, control is retained. Usually the controllability is even increased, because there is no need to produce lift. 0''g'' forces are a minimal problem for fixed wing aircraft, but there are exceptions, including, but not limited to, airplanes with gravity-fed fuel systems.

==Use in space agencies==
To simulate 0-''g'' conditions some space agencies uses a modified passenger aircraft to simulate a low-''g'' condition. The [[ESA]] uses an [[Airbus A300]], for example. [[NASA]] has the [[Vomit Comet]]. One upside down parabola simulates 0''g'' for about 25 s.

{{Sex and the law}}
{{Violence against women}}
'''Marital rape''' or '''spousal rape''' is the act of [[sexual intercourse]] with one's spouse without the spouse's [[consent]]. The lack of consent is the essential element and need not involve violence. Marital rape is considered a form of [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual abuse]]. Although, historically, sexual intercourse within marriage was regarded as a right of spouses, engaging in the act without the spouse's consent is now widely recognized by law and society as a wrong and as a crime. It is recognized as [[rape]] by many societies around the world, repudiated by international conventions, and increasingly criminalized.

The issues of sexual and domestic violence within [[marriage]] and the [[family]] unit, and more specifically, the issue of [[violence against women]], have come to growing international attention from the second half of the 20th century. Still, in many countries, marital rape either remains outside the [[criminal law]], or is illegal but widely tolerated. Laws are rarely being enforced, due to factors ranging from reluctance of authorities to pursue the crime, to lack of public knowledge that sexual intercourse in marriage without consent is illegal.

Marital rape is more widely experienced by women, though not exclusively. Marital rape is often a chronic form of violence for the victim which takes place within [[domestic violence|abusive relations]]. It exists in a complex web of state governments, cultural practices, and societal ideologies which combine to influence each distinct instance and situation in varying ways. The reluctance to criminalize and prosecute marital rape has been attributed to traditional views of marriage, interpretations of religious doctrines, ideas about [[Male sexuality|male]] and [[female sexuality]], and to cultural expectations of subordination of a wife to her husband—views which continue to be common in many parts of the world. These views of marriage and sexuality started to be challenged in most [[Western countries]] from the 1960s and 70s especially by [[second-wave feminism]], leading to an acknowledgment of the woman's right to [[self-determination]] (i.e., control) of all matters relating to her body, and the withdrawal of the exemption or defense of marital rape.

Most countries criminalized marital rape from the late 20th century onward—very few legal systems allowed for the prosecution of rape within marriage before the 1970s. Criminalization has occurred through various ways, including removal of statutory exemptions from the definitions of rape, judicial decisions, explicit legislative reference in statutory law preventing the use of marriage as a defense, or creating of a specific offense of marital rape. In many countries, it is still unclear whether marital rape is covered by the ordinary rape laws, but in some it may be covered by general statutes prohibiting violence, such as [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] laws.

==History==
{{See|History of rape}}
One of the origins of the concept of a marital exemption from rape laws (a rule that a husband cannot be charged with the rape of his wife) is the idea that by marriage a woman gives irrevocable consent for her husband to have sex with her any time he demands it.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Herring. ''Family Law: A Very Short Introduction''. {{ISBN|9780199668526}}. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was described by [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (1609–1676) in ''[[History of the Pleas of the Crown]]'', published posthumously in 1736, where he wrote that "The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract". Also, American and [[English law]] subscribed until the 20th century to the system of [[coverture]], that is, a legal doctrine under which, upon marriage, a woman's legal rights were subsumed by those of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xBlack.htm |title=Extracts from William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England 1765-1769 |accessdate=2015-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032946/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xblack.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication was that once unified by marriage, a spouse could no longer be charged with raping one's spouse, anymore than be charged with raping oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Michelle J. "Marital Rape Laws Globally." Marital Rape: Consent, ''Marriage and Social Change in Global Context''. Ed. Kersti Yllö, M.G. Torres. London: Oxford University Press, 2016. 178. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the wife's legal subordination to her husband was fully ended by the case of ''[[Kirchberg v. Feenstra]]'', {{Ussc|450|455|1981|el=no}}, a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held a [[Louisiana]] [[Head and Master law]], which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/450/455/|title=Kirchberg v. Feenstra :: 450 U.S. 455 (1981) :: Justia U.S. Supreme Court Center|work=Justia Law|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; English common law also had a great impact on many legal systems of the world through [[colonialism]]. (Bovarnik, 2007).

Marriage was traditionally understood as an institution where a husband had control over his wife's life; control over her sexuality was only a part of the greater control that he had in all other areas concerning her. A husband's control over his wife's body could also be seen in the way [[adultery]] between a wife and another man was constructed; for example in 1707, English Lord Chief Justice John Holt described the act of a man having sexual relations with another man's wife as "the highest invasion of property".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=0PLYXR2x0n0C }} |title=Judging Evil: Rethinking the Law of Murder and Manslaughter |isbn=978-0-8147-6680-4 |author1=Pillsbury |first1=Samuel H |date=2000-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, in many cultures there was a conflation between the crimes of rape and adultery, since both were seen and understood as a violation of the rights of the husband. Rape as a crime was constructed as a property crime against a father or husband not as a crime against the woman's right to self-determination.

The property to be withheld in a female was her virginity; this was the commodity (Bergen, 2016). Following this line of logic, a woman was (and still is in many cultures across the globe) first the property of her father, then, upon marriage, the property of her husband (Bergen, 2016). Therefore, a man could not be prosecuted for raping his own wife because she was his possession (Schelong, 1994). However, if another man raped someone's wife, this was essentially stealing property (a women's sexuality) (Bergen, 2016). In English customs, "bride capture" (a man claiming a woman through rape) was thought to be stealing a father's property by raping his daughter. Therefore, rape laws were created to "…protect the property interests men had in their women, not to protect women themselves" (Schelong, 1994). This concept of women as property permeates current marital rape ideology and laws throughout the globe.

In some cultures, marriage is [[arranged marriage|arranged]] for the purpose of creating access to procreation (Yllö, 2016). In these situations, the parties do not necessarily consent to marriage (in the case of [[forced marriage]]) (Yllö, 2016). Following this logic, if consent is not part of marriage, then it is not necessary for intercourse. The autonomy of the wife is also often compromised in cultures where [[bride price]] is paid. Under [[customary law]] in certain parts of Africa, forced sex in marriage was not prohibited, although some specific circumstances, such as during advanced pregnancy, immediately after childbirth, during menstruation, or during mourning for a deceased close relative, were recognized as giving the wife the right to refuse sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theequalityeffect.org/pdfs/ConsentPaperMalawi.pdf |format=PDF |title=THE TREATMENT OF CONSENT IN SEXUAL ASSAULT LAW IN MALAWI |website=Theequalityeffect.org |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape has been, until recent decades, understood as a crime against honor and reputation – not only in domestic legislation, but also in international law; for example according to the Article 27 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], "Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600032?OpenDocument |title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries – Geneva Convention (IV) on Civilians, 1949 - - Section I : Provisions common to the territories of the parties to the conflict and to occupied territories |website=Icrc.org |date=1949-08-12 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1990s that the ICC statute recognized crimes of sexual violence as violent crimes against the person;&lt;ref name="byu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1294&amp;context=jpl |format=PDF |title=One Small Step for Women: Female-Friendly Provisions in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |author=Rana Lehr-Lehnardt |website=Digitalcommons.law.byu.edu |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Not until the last half century was rape understood to be an offense against the woman, against her dignity, instead of against her family's or her husband's honor".&lt;ref name="byu.edu" /&gt;

==Legal aspect==
Historically, many cultures have had a concept of spouses' [[Marriage#Rights and obligations|conjugal rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/29772 |title=Sex a conjugal right |accessdate=2004-09-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908233453/http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/29772 |archivedate=2004-09-08 |df= |date=2004-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[sexual intercourse]] with each other. This can be seen in English [[common law]], in force in [[North America]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], where the very concept of marital rape was treated as an impossibility. This was illustrated most vividly by [[Sir Matthew Hale]], (1609-1676), in his legal treatise ''[[Historia Placitorum Coronæ]]'' or ''History of the Pleas of the Crown'' (posthumously, 1736) where he wrote that "The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract."

===Formalization of the marital rape exemption in law===

====Common law and the United Kingdom====
{{See also|Rape in English law}}

Sir Matthew Hale's statement in ''History of the Pleas of the Crown'' did not cite any legal [[precedent]] though it likely relied on earlier standards. In a case of [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Lord Audley's]] (1488–1544), for instance, his citation of the jurist [[Bracton]] (c. 1210 – c. 1268) supports this rule, said to have derived from laws of King [[Æthelstan]] (r. 927–939) where upon the law holds that even "were the party of no chaste life, but a whore, yet there may be ravishment: but it is a good plea to say she was his concubine".&lt;ref&gt;Geis, Gilbert.  “Rape in Marriage: Law and Law Reform in England, the United States, and Sweden,”  Adelaide Law Review, 1978; 6(2):285.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawfulness of the conjugal act itself was understood as a [[Entailment|logical consequence]] of a lawful marriage. Marriage created conjugal rights between spouses, and marriage could not be annulled except by a private Act of Parliament—it therefore follows that a spouse could not revoke conjugal rights from the marriage, and therefore there could be no rape between spouses. The principle was repeated in East's ''Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown'' in 1803 and in Archbold's ''Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases'' in 1822.  The principle was framed as an exemption to the law of rape in an English courtroom in  ''R v Clarence'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not overturned until 1991 by the [[House of Lords]] in the case of ''R. v. R'' in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html|title=''R. v. R'' &amp;#91;1992&amp;#93; 1 AC 599.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where it was described as an anachronistic and offensive legal fiction.

===Feminist critique in the 19th century===
From the beginnings of the 19th century [[feminist movement]], activists challenged the presumed right of men to engage in forced or coerced sex with their wives. In the [[United States]], "the nineteenth-century woman's rights movement fought against a husband's right to control marital intercourse in a campaign that was remarkably developed, prolific, and insistent, given nineteenth-century taboos against the public mention of sex or sexuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | pages = 1373–1505 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suffragists]] including [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lucy Stone]] "singled out a woman's right to control marital intercourse as the core component of equality."&lt;ref&gt;Stanton: "'Woman's degradation is in man's idea of his sexual rights,' Stanton wrote to Anthony. 'How this marriage question grows on me. It lies at the very foundation of all progress.'" Stone: "It is clear to me, that [the marriage] question underlies, this whole movement and all our little skirmishing for better laws, and the right to vote, will yet be swallowed up, in the real question, viz, has woman, as wife, a right to herself? It is very little to me to have the right to vote, to own property &amp;c. if I may not keep my body, and its uses, in my absolute right. Not one wife in a thousand can do that now, &amp; so long as she suffers this bondage, all other rights will not help her to her true position." {{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | pages = 1373–1505 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth century feminist demands centered on the right of women to control their bodies and fertility, positioned consent in marital sexual relations as an alternative to contraception and abortion (which many opposed), and also embraced [[eugenics|eugenic]] concerns about excessive procreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | pages = 1435–43 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; British [[liberalism|liberal]] feminists [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Harriet Taylor Mill|Harriet Taylor]] attacked marital rape as a gross double-standard in law and as central to the subordination of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-86020-8 | id = . .  | editor1 = Nadia Urbinati  | last = Zakaras | first = Alex | author2 = Maria Morales | title = J.S.

Advocates of the [[Free love movement |Free Love Movement]], including early [[Anarcha-feminism|anarcha-feminists]] such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Emma Goldman]], as well as [[Victoria Woodhull]], Thomas Low Nichols, and Mary S. Gove Nichols, joined a critique of marital rape to advocate women's autonomy and [[sexual pleasure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | pages = 1444–51 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses Harman]], a Kansas-based publisher and advocate for women's rights, was jailed twice under the [[Comstock laws]] for publishing articles (by a woman who was victimized and a doctor who treated marital rape survivors) decrying marital rape. [[De Cleyre]] defended Harman in a well-known article, "Sexual Slavery." She refused to draw any distinction between rape outside of and within marriage: "And that is rape, where a man forces himself sexually upon a woman whether he is licensed by the marriage law to do it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1040-0656 | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 54–68 [60] | last = Palczewski | first = Catherine Helen | title = Voltairine de Cleyre: Sexual Slavery and Sexual Pleasure in the Nineteenth Century | journal = NWSA Journal | date = 1995-10-01 | jstor = 4316402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] (who was awarded the 1950 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) in his book ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929) deplored the situation of married women. He wrote "Marriage is for woman the commonest mode of livelihood, and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in [[prostitution]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notable-quotes.com/r/russell_bertrand.html |title=Bertrand Russell Quotes |publisher=Notable-quotes.com |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st century criminalization===
The marital rape exemption or defence became more widely viewed as inconsistent with the developing concepts of human rights and equality. Feminists worked systematically since the 1960s to overturn the marital rape exemption and criminalize marital rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | pages = 1482–1505 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing criminalization of spousal rape is part of a worldwide reclassification of sexual crimes "from offenses against morality, the family, good customs, honor, or chastity ... to offenses against liberty, self-determination, or physical integrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0003122410388493 | volume = 75 | issue = 6 | pages = 867–893 [871] | last = Frank | first = David John | author2 = Bayliss J.

This establishes marital rape as a [[human rights]] violation.

The importance of the right to self sexual determination of women is increasingly being recognized as crucial to [[women's rights]]. In 2012, High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf |format=PDF |title=UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA - CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS : Helen Kanzira Lecture |website=Chr.up.ac.za |accessdate=2016-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313210726/http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Violations of women's human rights are often linked to their sexuality and reproductive role. (...) In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception. (...) Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men. Personal issues—such as when, how and with whom they choose to have sex, and when, how and with whom they choose to have children—are at the heart of living a life in dignity."

Despite these trends and international moves, criminalization has not occurred in all [[United Nations member states|UN member States]]. Determining the criminal status of marital rape may be challenging, because, while some countries ''explicitly criminalize'' the act (by stipulating in their rape laws that marriage is not a defense to a charge of rape; or by creating a specific crime of 'marital rape'; or, otherwise, by having statutory provisions that expressly state that a spouse can be charged with the rape of their other spouse) and other countries ''explicitly exempt'' spouses (by defining rape as forced sexual intercourse outside of marriage; or forced sexual intercourse with a woman not the perpetrator's wife; or by providing in their rape provisions that marriage is a defense to a charge of rape), in many countries the ordinary rape laws are silent on the issue (that is, they do not address the issue one way or another)—in such cases, in order to determine whether marital rape is covered by the ordinary rape laws it must be analyzed whether there are judicial decisions in this respect; and former definitions of the law are also important (for instance whether there was previously a statutory exemption that was removed by legislators for the purpose of implicitly including marital rape).

In 2006, the UN Secretary-General's in-depth study on all forms of violence against women stated that (page 113):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/publications/English%20Study.pdf |title=VAW/for printer/1/14/0|format=PDF |website=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 States. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Marital rape is not a prosecutable offence in at least 53 States. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated. Four States are considering legislation that would allow marital rape to be prosecuted."

In 2011, the [[UN Women]] report Progress of the World's Women:In Pursuit of Justice stated that (page 17):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progress.unwomen.org/pdfs/EN-Report-Progress.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707122615/http://progress.unwomen.org/pdfs/EN-Report-Progress.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2011 |title=Progress of the World's Women 2015-2016 |work=My Favorite News |accessdate=22 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"By April 2011, at least 52 States had explicitly outlawed marital rape in their criminal code".

Traditionally, rape was a criminal offense that could only be committed outside marriage, and courts did not apply the rape statutes to acts of forced sex between spouses. With changing social views, and international condemnation of sexual violence in marriage, courts have started to apply the rape laws in marriage. The current applicability in many countries of rape laws to spouses is currently unclear, since in many countries the laws have not been recently tested in court. In some countries, notably jurisdictions which have inherited the 1860 Indian Penal Code (such as [[Singapore]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]]) and some countries in the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] region, the laws explicitly exempt spouses from prosecution (for instance, under the 1860 Indian Penal Code, which has also been inherited by other countries in the region, the law on rape states that "Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife is not rape").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globaljusticecenter.net/index.php?option%3Dcom_mtree%26task%3Datt_download%26link_id%3D105%26cf_id%3D34 |title=Domestic Criminal Laws that Conflict with International Law - Burma's Abortion and Rape Laws: a Case Study |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109183807/http://globaljusticecenter.net/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=att_download&amp;link_id=105&amp;cf_id=34 |archivedate=2014-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a country where the rape law ''explicitly excludes'' a husband as a possible perpetrator is [[Ethiopia]]; its rape law states:&lt;ref name="sgdatabase.unwomen.org"/&gt; "Article 620 - Rape: Whoever compels a woman to submit to sexual intercourse ''outside wedlock'', whether by the use of violence or grave intimidation, or after having rendered her unconscious or incapable of resistance, is punishable with rigorous imprisonment from five years to fifteen years". Another example is [[South Sudan]], where the law states: "Sexual intercourse by a married couple is not rape, within the meaning of this section". (Art 247).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goss-online.org/magnoliaPublic/en/Laws--Legislation--Policies/mainColumnParagraphs/0/content_files/file12/15.pdf |title=Government of the Republic of South Sudan - Official Portal |publisher= |accessdate=22 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20130912135220/http://www.goss-online.org/magnoliaPublic/en/Laws--Legislation--Policies/mainColumnParagraphs/0/content_files/file12/15.pdf |archivedate=12 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, an example of country where the rape law ''explicitly criminalizes'' marital rape is [[Namibia]] - The Combating of Rape Act (No. 8 of 2000) states that: "No marriage or other relationship shall constitute a defence to a charge of rape under this Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/Namibia%20-%20Combating%20of%20Rape%20Act.pdf |title=Combating of Rape Act, No. 8 of 2000 |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202239/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/Namibia%20-%20Combating%20of%20Rape%20Act.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a jurisdiction where marital rape is a ''distinct'' criminal offense is [[Bhutan]] where 'Marital rape' is defined by Article 199 which reads: "A defendant shall be guilty of marital rape, if the defendant engages in sexual intercourse with one's own spouse without consent or against the will of the other spouse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unodc.org/tldb/pdf/Bhutan_Penal_Code_2004_Eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=PENAL CODE OF BHUTAN, 2004 |website=Unodc.org |accessdate=2016-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809131736/https://www.unodc.org/tldb/pdf/Bhutan_Penal_Code_2004_Eng.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1986, in Europe, there was international pressure to criminalize marital rape: the ''European Parliament's Resolution on Violence Against Women of 1986'' called for its criminalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=VWttAAAAQBAJ |page=1 |title=The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reiterated by the Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=On The Protection Of Women Against Violence |url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805e2612 |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=30 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see para 35) This recommendation provided detailed guidelines on how legislation regarding domestic violence, rape, and other forms of violence against women should operate. It also provided a definition of violence against women, and gave a list of non-exhaustive examples, including marital rape (see section "Definition" para 1). Although the approach on the issue of violence against women has varied significantly among European countries, the traditional view that acts of violence against a woman are crimes against honor and morality, and not against the self-determination of the woman, was still prevalent in the 1990s in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/Honour%20Crimes_EN.pdf "There are many examples from different countries, mainly from the 1990s, but some even more recent than that, where judges handed down lenient sentences simply because the perpetrator claimed to have acted out of respect for his culture, tradition, religion or custom or to restore his so-called ''honour''" (explanations regarding the Istanbul Convention)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924040314/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/Honour%20Crimes_EN.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The above recommendation stated that member states must "ensure that criminal law provides that any act of violence against a person, in particular physical or sexual violence, constitutes a violation of that person's physical, psychological and/or sexual freedom and integrity, and not solely a violation of morality, honour or decency" (para 34).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383|title=Committee of Ministers - on the protection of women against violence|author1=Council of Europe Committee of Ministers Plenary|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach regarding sexual and other forms of violence against women in specific European countries did not necessarily mirror women's rights in other areas of life (such as public or political life) in those countries: in fact some countries otherwise known for advanced women's rights, such as [[Finland]] and [[Denmark]], have received strong criticism for their policies in this area.

:"A large number of the offences established in accordance with this Convention are offences typically committed by family members, intimate partners or others in the immediate social environment of the victim. There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator."

[[Belgium]] was early to criminalize marital rape. In 1979, the Brussels Court of Appeal recognized marital rape and found that a husband who used serious violence to coerce his wife into having sex against her wishes was guilty of the criminal offense of rape. The logic of the court was that, although the husband did have a 'right' to sex with his wife, he could not use violence to claim it, as Belgian laws did not allow people to obtain their rights by violence.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/womenandjustice/Legal-and-Other-Resources/DisplayCountry.cfm?CountryID=7 |title=Country Details |publisher=Lawschool.cornell.edu |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=TEqZlC3bNiYC }} |title=Corps de femmes: sexualité et contrôle social |publisher= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 laws were amended, the definition of rape was broadened, and marital rape is treated the same as other forms of rape.&lt;ref name="coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/violence/EG%282009%29%203_Legislation_F.pdf |title=Legislation Dans Les Etats Membres du Conseil de L'Europe en Matiere de Violence A L'Egard des Femmes |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220015626/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/violence/EG%282009%29%203_Legislation_F.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italy]] the law on rape, ''violenza carnale'' ('carnal violence', as it was termed) did not contain a statutory exemption, but was, as elsewhere, understood as inapplicable in the context of marriage. Although Italy has a reputation of a male dominated traditional society, it was quite early to accept that the rape law covers forced sex in marriage too: in 1976 in ''Sentenza n. 12857 del 1976'', the Supreme Court ruled that "the spouse who compels the other spouse to carnal knowledge by violence or threats commits the crime of carnal violence" ("''commette il delitto di violenza carnale il coniuge che costringa con violenza o minaccia l’altro coniuge a congiunzione carnale''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.scnu.edu.cn/ngw/ngw/xwbk/An%20overview%20of%20the%20legal%20and%20cultural%20issues%20for%20migrant%20Muslim%20women%20of%20the%20European%20union%20A%20focus%20on%20domestic%20violence%20and%20Italy.pdf |title=An overview of the legal and cultural issues for migrant Muslim women of the European union: A focus on domestic violence and Italy |accessdate=2015-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402085918/http://lib.scnu.edu.cn/ngw/ngw/xwbk/An%20overview%20of%20the%20legal%20and%20cultural%20issues%20for%20migrant%20Muslim%20women%20of%20the%20European%20union%20A%20focus%20on%20domestic%20violence%20and%20Italy.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quing.eu/files/results/cs_italy.pdf |format=PDF |title=Quality in Gender+ Equality Policies : European Commission Sixth Framework Programme Integrated Project |website=Quing.eu |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://womanjournal.wordpress.com/2011/12/08/sesso-matrimonio-e-legge/|title=Sesso, matrimonio e legge|work=WOMAN's JOURNAL|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main article| Marital rape (United States law)}}
The legal history of marital rape laws in the [[United States]] is a long and complex one, that spans over several decades. Traditional rape laws in the US defined rape as forced sexual intercourse by a male with a "female not his wife", making it clear that the statutes did not apply to married couples. The 1962 [[Model Penal Code]] stated that "''A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if: (...)''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/13023/13335893/downloadables/model_penal_code_sel_sec2.pdf |title=SELECTED MODEL PENAL CODE PROVISIONS |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205803/http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/13023/13335893/downloadables/model_penal_code_sel_sec2.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminalization of marital rape in the United States started in the mid-1970s and by 1993 marital rape was a crime in all 50 states, under at least one section of the sexual offense codes.&lt;ref name="ncvc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&amp;DocumentID=32701 |title=The National Center for Victims of Crime - Library/Document Viewer |publisher=Ncvc.org |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier laws of the 1970s often indicated that marital rape charges could only be brought about if the husband and wife were no longer living together. The case in the United States that first challenged this cohabitation clause was ''[[Oregon v. Rideout]]'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=License to Rape: Sexual Abuse of Wives|last=Finkelhor|first=David|last2=Yllo|first2=Kersti|publisher=The Free Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=172.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, most states differentiated between the way marital rape and non-marital rape were treated. These differences were visible through shorter penalties, taking into account whether or not violence was used, and allowing for shorter reporting periods. (Bergen, 1996; Russell, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Marital%20Rape.pdf |title=Marital Rape |accessdate=2013-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724221251/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Marital%20Rape.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The laws have continued to change and evolve, with most states reforming their legislation in the 21st century, in order to bring marital rape laws in line with non-marital rape, but even today there remain differences in some states. With the removal, in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=%20SB0556&amp;GA=104|title=Tennessee General Assembly » Legislation|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/|title=LexisNexis® Custom Solution: Tennessee Code Research Tool|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the requirement of a higher level of violence from the law of [[Tennessee]], which now allows for marital rape in Tennessee to be treated like any other type of rape, [[South Carolina]] remains the only US state with a law requiring excessive force/violence (the force or violence used or threatened must be of a "high and aggravated nature").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c003.php|title=Code of Laws - Title 16 - Chapter 3 - Offenses Against The Person|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcsd.net/offender/offender-law.htm|title=RCSD Sex Offender Registry Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states the criminalization has occurred by the removal of the exemptions from the general rape law by the legislature; or by the courts striking down the exemptions as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;for example in New York, in 1984, in  ''People v. Liberta'' [http://faculty.law.miami.edu/zfenton/documents/Peoplev.Liberta.pdf ''People v. Liberta'' 64 N.Y.2d 152, 474 N.E.2d 567, 485 N.Y.S.2d 207(1984)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807002114/http://faculty.law.miami.edu/zfenton/documents/Peoplev.Liberta.pdf |title=New York, in 1984, in  ''People v. Liberta''|date=August 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, however, the legislature has created a distinct crime of spousal rape. This is, for example, the case in California, where there are two different criminal offenses: Rape (Article 261) and Spousal Rape (Article 262).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=261-269|title=CA Codes (pen:261-269)|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108112543/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=261-269|archivedate=8 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England and Wales====
=====Background=====
Although the issue of marital rape was highlighted by feminists in the 19th century, and was also deplored by thinkers such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] (see above section 'Feminist critique in the 19th century'), it was not until the 1970s that this issue was raised at a political level. The late 1970s also saw the enactment of [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act of 1976]], which provided the first statutory definition of rape (prior to this rape was an offense at common law). The [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]] in their 1984 Report on Sexual Offences rejected the idea that the offense of rape should be extended to marital relations; writing the following:&lt;ref name="cambridge.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/law-general-interest/reconstructing-criminal-law-text-and-materials-3rd-edition|title=Lacey, Wells and Quick Reconstructing Criminal Law|author=Celia Wells, University of Bristol|date=28 June 2010|work=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 	
:"The majority of us ... believe that rape cannot be considered in the abstract as merely 'sexual intercourse without consent'. The circumstances of rape may be peculiarly grave. This feature is not present in the case of a husband and wife cohabiting with each other when an act of sexual intercourse occurs without the wife's consent. They may well have had sexual intercourse regularly before the act in question and, because a sexual relationship may involve a degree of compromise, she may sometimes have agreed only with some reluctance to such intercourse. Should he go further and force her to have sexual intercourse without her consent, this may evidence a failure of the marital relationship. But it is far from being the 'unique' and 'grave' offence described earlier. Where the husband goes so far as to cause injury, there are available a number of offences against the person with which he may be charged, but the gravamen of the husband's conduct is the injury he has caused not the sexual intercourse he has forced."
	  	
The Committee also expressed more general views on domestic violence arguing that "Violence occurs in some marriages but the wives do not always wish the marital tie to be severed" and reiterated the point that domestic incidents without physical injury would generally be outside the scope of the law: "Some of us consider that the criminal law should keep out of marital relationships between cohabiting partners—especially the marriage bed—except where injury arises, when there are other offences which can be charged."&lt;ref name="cambridge.org"/&gt;
	 	
Five years later, in [[Scotland]], the [[High Court of Justiciary]] took a different view, abolishing marital immunity, in ''S. v. H.M. Advocate'', 1989. The same would happen in England and Wales in 1991, in ''R v R'' (see below). Very soon after this, in Australia, at the end of 1991, in  ''R v L'', the [[High Court of Australia]] would rule the same, ruling that if the common law exemption had ever been part of the Australian law, it no longer was (by that time most Australian states and territories had already abolished their exemptions by statutory law).&lt;ref name="commonlii.org"&gt;http://www3.commonlii.org/au/journals/GriffLawRw/1993/3.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ending the exemption=====
{{Main|Rape in English law}}
The marital rape exemption was abolished in [[England and Wales]] in 1991 by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], in the case of ''[[R v R]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[1991] UKHL 12&lt;/nowiki&gt; |author= |website= |publisher=[[BAILII]] |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 1 AC 599, [1991] 3 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 767, [1991] 4 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 481, (1991) 135 SJLB 181,  [1992] 1 FZR 217, (1991) 155 JP 989, (1992) 94 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 216, [1992] Fam Law 108, [1992] ''[[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]]'' 207, (1991) 155 JPN 752, (1991) 141 NLJ 1481, [1991] UKHL 12, (1991) ''The Times'', 24 October 1991, (1991) ''The Independent'', 24 October 1991, (1991) ''The Guardian'', 30 October 1991, [[House of Lords|HL]], affirming [1991] 2 WLR 1065, [1991] 2 All ER 257, (1991) 135 ''[[Solicitors Journal|SJ]]'' 384, (1991) 93 Cr App R 1, (1991) 155 JP 373, [1991] Crim LR 475, (1991) 155 JPN 236, (1991) 141 NLJ 383, (1991) The Times, 15 March 1991, (1991) ''The Independent'', 15 March 1991, (1991) ''The Guardian'', 15 March 1991, [[Court of Appeal|CA]], affirming [1991] 1 All ER 747&lt;/ref&gt; It had been promulgated in 1736 in [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale’s]] ''History of the Pleas of the Crown'' (see above).
	 	
The first attempted [[prosecution]] of a husband for the rape of his wife was ''R v Clarke''.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarke'' [1949] 2 All ER 448&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than try to argue directly against Hale’s logic, the court held that consent in this instance had been revoked by an [[court order|order of the court]] for non-cohabitation. It was the first of a number of cases in which the courts found reasons not to apply the exemption, notably ''R v O’Brien''&lt;ref&gt;''R v O’Brien'' [1974] 3 All ER 663&lt;/ref&gt; (the obtaining of [[decree nisi]]), ''R v Steele''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Steele'' (1976) 65 Cr.App.R. 22&lt;/ref&gt; (an undertaking by the husband to the court not to molest the wife) and ''R v Roberts''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Roberts'' [1986] Crim LR 188&lt;/ref&gt; (the existence of a formal separation agreement).
	
There are at least four recorded instances of a husband successfully relying on the exemption in England and Wales. The first was ''R v Miller'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Miller'' [1954] 2 QB 282&lt;/ref&gt; where it was held that the wife had not legally revoked her consent despite having presented a divorce petition. ''R v Kowalski''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Kowalski'' (1988) 86 Cr. App. R. 339&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by ''R v Sharples'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Sharples'' [1990] Crim LR 198&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth occurred in 1991 in the case of ''R v J'', a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] made after the [[first instance]] decision of the [[Crown Court]] in ''R v R'' but before the decision of the House of Lords that was to abolish the exemption. In ''Miller'', ''Kowalski'' and ''R v J'' the husbands were instead convicted of [[assault]]. The ''R v Kowalski'' case involved, among other acts, an instance of non-consensual [[oral sex]]. For this, the husband was convicted of [[indecent assault]], as the court ruled that his wife's "implied consent" by virtue of marriage extended only to vaginal intercourse, not to other acts such as fellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php|title=Domestic Violence|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907012332/http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php|archivedate=7 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [At that time the offense of 'rape' dealt only with vaginal intercourse]

In ''R v Sharples'' in 1990, it was alleged that the husband had raped his wife in 1989. Despite the fact that the wife had obtained a Family Protection Order before the alleged rape, the judge refused to accept that rape could legally occur, concluding that the Family Protection Order had not removed the wife's implied consent, ruling that: "it cannot be inferred that by obtaining the order in these terms the wife had withdrawn her consent to sexual intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goforthelaw.com/index.php/browsearticles/loadarticleview/167.html|title=Goforthelaw.com - Legal Education and Awareness - Articles - Moot Court help - Directories - Law Web Journal - upcoming Major Central Acts…|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
		
''[[R v R]]'' in 1991 was the first occasion where the marital rights exemption had been [[appeal]]ed as far as the House of Lords, and it followed the trio of cases since 1988 where the marital rights exemption was upheld. The leading judgment, unanimously approved, was given by [[Lord Keith of Kinkel]]. He stated that the contortions being performed in the lower courts in order to avoid applying the marital rights exemption were indicative of the absurdity of the rule, and held, agreeing with earlier judgments in [[Scotland]] and in the [[Court of Appeal]] in ''R v R'', that “the fiction of [[implied consent]] has no useful purpose to serve today in the law of rape” and that the marital rights exemption was a “common law fiction” which had never been a true rule of [[English law]]. R’s appeal was accordingly dismissed, and he was convicted of the rape of his wife.

=====Aftermath=====
By 1991, when the exemption was removed, the [[Law Commission]] in its ''Working Paper'' of 1990 was already supporting the abolition of the exemption, a view reiterated in their ''Final Report'' that was published in 1992; and international moves in this direction were by now common. Therefore, the result of the ''R v R'' case was welcomed. But, while the removal of the exemption itself was not controversial, the way through which this was done was; since the change was not made through usual statutory modification. The cases of ''SW v UK'' and ''CR v UK'' arose in response to ''R v R''; in which the applicants (convicted of rape and attempted rape of the wives) appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] arguing that their convictions were a retrospective application of the law in breach of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They claimed that at the time of the rape there was a common law exemption in force, therefore their convictions were ''post facto''. Their case was not successful, with their arguments being rejected by the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled that the criminalization of marital rape had become a reasonably foreseeable development of the criminal law in the light of the evolution of social norms; and that the Article 7 does not prohibit the gradual judicial evolution of the interpretation of an offense, provided the result is consistent with the essence of the offense and that it could be reasonably foreseen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettextbooks.tk/isbn/9781859419359|title=Cases and Materials on Criminal Law by Mike Molan, Michael T.

A new definition of the offense of 'rape' was created in 1994 by the section 142 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], providing a broader definition that included anal sex; and an even broader definition was created by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], including oral sex. The law on rape does not—and did not ever since the removal of the marital exemption in 1991—provide for any different punishment based on the relation between parties. However, in 1993, in ''R v W 1993 14 Cr App R (S) 256'', the court ruled:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/s1_rape/|title=S1 Rape:Sexual offences: Sentencing Manual: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008094946/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/s1_rape/|archive-date=8 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It should not be thought a different and lower scale automatically attaches to the rape of a wife by her husband. All will depend upon the circumstances of the case. Where the parties are cohabiting and the husband insisted upon intercourse against his wife's will but without violence or threats this may reduce sentence. Where the conduct is gross and involves threats or violence the relationship will be of little significance."
	
At the time of ''R v R'', rape in [[Northern Ireland]] was a crime at common law. Northern Ireland common law is similar to that of England and Wales, and partially derives from the same sources; so any (alleged) exemption from its rape law was also removed by ''R v R''. In March 2000, a Belfast man was convicted for raping his wife, in the first case of its kind in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/669169.stm|title=BBC News - NORTHERN IRELAND - Husband jailed for raping wife|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Until 28 July 2003, rape in Northern Ireland remained solely an offense at common law that could only be committed by a man against a woman only as vaginal intercourse. Between 28 July 2003 and 2 February 2009 rape was defined by the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 as "any act of non-consensual intercourse by a man with a person", but the common law offense continued to exist, and oral sex remained excluded. On 2 February 2009 the [[Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008]] came into force, abolishing the common law offense of rape, and providing a definition of rape that is similar to that of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] of England and Wales. The [[Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland]] has the same policy for marital rape as for other forms of rape; it states in its ''Policy for Prosecuting Cases of Rape'' document that: "The Policy applies to all types of rape, including marital and relationship rape, acquaintance and stranger rape, both against male and female victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Policy for Prosecuting Cases of Rape |url=https://www.ppsni.gov.uk/SiteDocuments/PPS%20Press%20Office/PPSNI%20RAPE.pdf |publisher=Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
The criminalization of marital rape in [[Australia]] occurred in all states and territories, by both statutory and case law, from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.
In Australia, the offense of rape was based on the English common law offense of rape, being generally understood as "[[carnal knowledge]]", outside of marriage, of a female against her will. Some Australian states left rape to be defined at common law, but others had statutory definitions, with these definitions having marital exemptions. The definition of rape in [[Queensland]], for instance, was: "Any person who has carnal knowledge of a woman or girl, not his wife, without her consent, or with her consent, if the consent is obtained by force, or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind, or by fear of bodily harm, or by means of false and fraudulent representations as to the nature of the act, or, in the case of a married woman, by personating her husband, is guilty of a crime, which is called rape."&lt;ref name="qlrc.qld.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qlrc.qld.gov.au/reports/r21.pdf |title=Reform of the Law of Rape |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127114048/http://www.qlrc.qld.gov.au/reports/r21.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions of criminalization of marital rape were already taking place in the late 1970s in Queensland,&lt;ref name="qlrc.qld.gov.au"/&gt; but it was not until 1989 that it was criminalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/proceedings/20/moran.pdf |title=Patterns of rape : a preliminary Queensland perspective |format=PDF |website=Aic.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Australian state to deal with marital rape was [[South Australia]]. The changes came in 1976, but these were only partly removing the exemption. The ''Criminal Law Consolidation Act Amendment Act 1976'' read:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.flinders.edu.au/jspui/bitstream/2328/20981/1/1976083.pdf |format=PDF |title=An Act to amend the Criminal Law Consolidation Act, 1935-1975. |website=Dspace.flinders.edu.au |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No person shall, by reason only of the fact that he is married to some other person, be presumed to have consented to sexual intercourse with that other person". Nevertheless, the laws did not go as far as equating marital with non-marital rape; the law required violence, or other aggravating circumstances, in order for an act of marital intercourse to be rape; which remained law until 1992. The first Australian jurisdiction to completely remove the marital exemption was [[New South Wales]] in 1981. The same happened in [[Western Australia]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] in 1985; and [[Tasmania]] in 1987. In 1991, in  ''R v L'', the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that if the common law exemption had ever been part of the Australian law, it no longer was.&lt;ref name="seductionandrapre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.commonlii.org/au/journals/GriffLawRw/1993/3.pdf |format=PDF |title=ACTING LIKE A MAN: SEDUCTION AND RAPE IN THE LAW |author=Helen Pringle |website=Commonlii.org |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage after rape==
{{Main article|Marry-your-rapist law}}
In a variety of cultures, marriage after a rape of an unmarried woman has been treated historically as a "resolution" to the rape, that is, a "reparatory marriage". Although laws that exonerate the perpetrator if he marries his victim after the rape are often associated with the Middle East,&lt;ref name="selfscholar"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://selfscholar.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/the-middle-easts-rape-marriage-laws/ |title=The Middle East's "Rape-Marriage" Laws |work=Selfscholar |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such laws were very common around the world until the second half of the 20th century. For instance, as late as 1997, 14 [[Latin American]] countries had such laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/12/world/justice-in-peru-victim-gets-rapist-for-a-husband.html |title=Justice in Peru: Victim Gets Rapist for a Husband |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=12 March 1997 |accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most of these countries have now abolished them.

Whether women were forced to marry their rapist, or the marriage was concluded before the violence began, many victims remain in chronically violent relationships. While there are many reasons for which victims of marital rape remain in their marriages, one important reason is that divorce may be hard to obtain and/or is stigmatized (Kwiatowski, 70). Cross-culturally, one of the barriers that keep victims within their marriages is the shame and guilt they feel surrounding marital rape (Bergen, 2016), or general taboos around sexuality(Kwiatkowski, 2016) (Torres, 2016). Lastly, some victims do not categorize their abuse as marital rape in order to minimize the violence they endure. This is used as a defense mechanism so they can continue to endure their abuse (Menjívar, 2016).

==Prevalence==
The earliest study in the [[Western World]] attempting to survey marital rape was an unpublished study by Joan Seites in the spring of 1975.  Seites sent questionnaires to 40 rape-crisis centers from a list compiled by the Center for Women Policy Studies (Washington, DC).  16 Centers completed questionnaire for a response rate of 40%.  Of the 3,709 reported calls dealing with rape and attempted rape received by the 16 centers, 12 calls dealt with marital rape (0.3%).  Because rape-crisis centers did not always record the relationships of the callers, whether the 12 reported calls fully represent the number of married relationships cannot be certainly known.&lt;ref&gt;Seites, J. Marital rape: Dispelling the myth. Unpublished manuscript, 1975.  Cited in Gelles, Richard J. “Power, Sex, and Violence, The Family Coordinator, National Council on Family Relations, 1977. p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Richard Giles conducted research through in-depth interviews on violence between husbands and wives in a series of three studies between 1974 and 1976. Although the questions asked in the course of the interviews did not specifically pertain to the subject of marital rape, a subsequent analysis of the transcriptions of the interviews identified 4 women who discussed sex-related violence which might be viewed as instances of either attempted or completed marital rape.  In all 4 cases, however, there was no instance a wife actually forced into having sex, although this may have been to avoid the possibility of force.  Although the four women did not view themselves as having been raped, Giles raised the question of whether engaging in the sex act, as an act itself, constitutes violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gelles, Richard J. “Power, Sex, and Violence: The Case of Marital Rape", ''The Family Coordinator'', National Council on Family Relations, 1977. p. 344-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 [[Diana E. H. Russell]], a feminist writer and activist, conducted the seminal study on marital rape.  Her study surveyed a total of 930 women from [[San Francisco]], California (50% non-response rate, non-English speaking Asian women were specifically excluded as non-reliable respondents), of whom 644 were married, divorced, or who self-identified as having a husband although not married. Six of these women (1%) self-assessed that they had been raped by their husbands, ex-husband, or de facto husbands. The survey interviewers, however, classified 74 (12%) of these women as having been raped. Of the 286 non-married women in the sample, 228 (80%) were classified by the survey interviewers as having been raped. Russell found that when repeated instances of rape as classified by the survey interviewers, by husbands or ex-husbands, over the entire course of the marriage are included, these account for 38% of all rape instances, in comparison to the remaining 62% occurring in non-marital instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Diana E. H. |title=Rape in Marriage |location= |publisher=Indiana University Press |edition=New |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-253-35055-8 |pages=57–58, 65–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Finkelhor]] and Kersti Yllo published a study in 1985 on marital rape that drew on a scientifically-selected area probability sample from the metropolitan [[Boston]] area of 323 women who were either married or previously married who had a child living with them between the ages of six and fourteen.  The study found that of the women who were married the instance of sexual relations through physical force or the threat thereof was 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finkelhor |first=David |last2=Yllö |first2=Kersti |title=License to Rape |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-03-059474-8 |pages=204–205, Table A–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Patricia Easteal, then Senior Criminologist at the Australian Institute of Criminology, published the results of survey on sexual assault in many settings. The respondents had all been victims of numerous forms of sexual assault. Of the victim sub-sample, 10.4% had been raped by husbands or ''de facto'' husbands, with a further 2.3% raped by estranged husbands/''de factos''. &lt;!-- irrelevant statistic: 5.5 percent were raped by non-cohabiting boyfriends. (Easteal, 1994) --&gt; &lt;!-- page number would be a help --&gt;

In 2002 Basile published research intended to address the lack of a nationally probability sample to-date that measured intimate sexual coercion faced by married women.  Data were collected in a 1997 national poll by a random telephone survey of 1,108 residents in the continental U.S. of persons 18 years old or older.  The survey had a 50% response rate. Of the 1,108 respondents, the 506 men were excluded from any inquiry into unwanted sexual experiences, leaving 602 (54%) women respondents for the study. 398 (66%) women indicated no unwanted sexual relations (their marital status is not given), and 204 (34%) women responded as having engaged in unwanted sex after being subject to some level of sexual coercion; types of sexual coercion included receiving ‘a gift’, ‘ a nice dinner’, ‘a back rub’, ‘kissing’, etc. through threatened harm and physical coercion.  Of this group, a sub-sample of 120 (59%) were married, of which 9% responded as having been subject to physical force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 0886-6708 | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 511–524 | last = Basile | first = Kathleen C. | title = Prevalence of Wife Rape and Other Intimate Partner Sexual Coercion in a Nationally Representative Sample of Women | journal = Violence and Victims | date = October 2002 | doi = 10.1891/vivi.17.5.511.33717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the six scientific studies specifically on marital rape by husbands in the Western world cited above, not one gives an estimation of a rate of marital rape.  The first study, by Giles, does attempt to calculate a rate, but acknowledges that the study was not so designed, and the result (0%) may not be valid.  The next study by Russell which is often cited as the seminal study, conflates ex-husbands and those whom, though unmarried, are counted as putative husbands or de facto “husbands.”  While the data would allow estimation of a marital rape rate, it is not given.  Moreover, the study's design classifies 80% of non-married women as having been raped is vastly inconsistent with other studies.  The Yllo and Finkelhor 1985  study  is not a nationally representative sample, i.e., limited to Boston, of women who are divorced or married, and who also have a child living with them between the ages of six and fourteen. The study did not separately estimate rates for claims of rape and situations deemed rape-threatening.  In the Giles study, once threatening situations are distinguished, the findings differed significantly.  Easteal's study restricts estimation of prevalence to within only the sub-sample of victims, even though the estimation could similarly be applied to the population.  Basile study, which purportedly was to address the hitherto lack of a nationally probability sample regarding marital rape, omits the number of married women in the sample, thereby precluding the estimation of rape reports by married women in the sample population.  The lack of such estimations make inter-study comparisons difficult, and citation of national statistics subject to the qualification made in the studies.

The prevalence of marital rape is difficult to assess, especially outside the Western World. Discussing sexual matters in many cultures is taboo. One problem with studies on marital rape is that the Western concept of consent is not understood in many parts of the world. Because many societies operate on social norms which create a dual system of sexual morality—one for sexual intercourse that is ''marital'' which is seen as an obligation that cannot be refused, and ''extra-marital'', which is seen as wrong (or illicit/illegal).  Issues of consent are poorly understood, especially by young wives (which are often young girls who do not have a proper understanding of sexual rights). For instance in an interview in a study for the World Health Organization, a woman from [[Bangladesh]] who described being hit by her husband and forced to have sex said that: "''I thought this is only natural. This is the way a husband behaves''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/summary_report/chapter2/en/index6.html|title=WHO - Gender, equity, human rights|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has, nevertheless, associated specific regions with a very high level of violence, including sexual violence, against women by husbands/partners. An example of such a place is [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/summary_report/chapter2/en/|title=WHO - Gender, equity, human rights|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.reproductive-health-journal.com/content/9/1/14|title=Reproductive Health - Full text - Intimate partner violence against women in western Ethiopia: a qualitative study on attitudes, woman's response, and suggested measures as perceived by community members|journal=Reproductive Health|volume=9|pages=14|accessdate=22 August 2015|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-9-14|pmid=22906066|pmc=3453497|year=2012|last1=Abeya|first1=Sileshi Garoma|last2=Afework|first2=Mesganaw Fantahun|last3=Yalew|first3=Alemayeh Worku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6040180.stm |title=Ethiopian women are most abused |work=BBC News |date=11 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of marital rape depends on the particularly legal, national, and cultural context. In 1999, the [[World Health Organization]] conducted a study on violence against women in [[Tajikistan]], surveying 900 women above the age of 14 in three districts of the country and found that 47% of married women reported having been forced to have sex by their husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/policy_forum/vand022001.shtml |title=Women, Violence, and Tajikistan |accessdate=2001-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010701180158/http://www.eurasianet.org/policy_forum/vand022001.shtml |archivedate=2001-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Turkey]] 35.6% of women have experienced marital rape sometimes and 16.3% often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousconsultation.org/Special_Features/Amnesty_International_violence_vs_women.htm |title=Amnesty International: Report on Violence Against Women |publisher=Religiousconsultation.org |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical and psychological damage==
{{Main article|Effects and aftermath of rape}}

Rape by a spouse, partner or ex-partner is more often associated with physical violence. A nine-nation study within the European Union found that current or ex-partners were the perpetrators of around 25% of all sexual assaults, and that violence was more common in assaults by ex-partners (50% of the time) and partners (40%) than in assaults by strangers or recent acquaintances (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = [[Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit|Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit, London Metropolitan University]] | last = Burman | first = M. | author2 = J. Lovett| author3 = L. Kelly | title = Different systems, similar outcomes? Tracking attrition in reported rape cases in eleven countries | location = London | year = 2009 | page = 106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- goes to prevalence (among ex-partners/partners) and not physical/psychological damage--&gt;

Attributing the effects of marital rape in research is problematic as it is nearly impossible to find a large enough sample of spouses to study who have experienced sexual violence but have not also been physically assaulted by their spouse.&lt;ref&gt;Bernice, et al., The Relative Effects of Intimate Partner Physical and Sexual Violence on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptomatology, Violence and Victims, 2003 February; 18 vol 1, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Marital rape can spread sexually transmitted diseases and [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], adversely affecting a victim's physical and psychological health. In sub-Saharan countries with very high prevalence rates of HIV, such as [[HIV/AIDS in Lesotho|Lesotho]], instances of multiple partnerships and marital rape exacerbate the spread of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Motalingoane-Khau, Mathabo. “'But He Is My Husband! How Can That Be Rape?': Exploring Silences around Date and Marital Rape in Lesotho.” ''Agenda: Empowering Women for Gender Equity'', no. 74, 2007, pp. 58–66. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/27739343. &lt;/ref&gt;

While rape by a stranger is highly [[psychological trauma|traumatic]], it is typically a one-time event and is clearly understood as rape. In the case of rape by a spouse or long term sexual partner, the history of the relationship affects the victim's reactions.  There is research showing that marital rape can be more emotionally and physically damaging than rape by a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marital Rape|url=http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape|publisher=RAIN|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marital rape may occur as part of an [[Domestic violence|abusive relationship]]. Trauma from the rape adds to the effect of other abusive acts or abusive and demeaning talk. Furthermore, marital rape is rarely a one-time event, but a repeated if not frequent occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiddenhurt.co.uk/marital_rape.html |title=Marital Rape |publisher=Hiddenhurt.co.uk |date=2007-06-17 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it takes place once or is part of an established pattern of domestic violence, trauma from rape has serious long term consequences for victims regardless of whether the assault is prosecuted or not.

Unlike other forms of rape, where the victim can remove themselves from the company of the rapist and never interact with them again, in the case of marital rape the victim often has no choice but to continue living with their spouse: in many parts of the world divorce is very difficult to obtain and is also highly stigmatized. The researchers Finkelhor and Yllö remarked in their 1985 metropolitan Boston area study that:&lt;ref&gt;Finkelhor, David; Yllö, Kersti (1985). License to Rape. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

:"When a woman is raped by a stranger, she has to live with a frightening memory. When she is raped by her husband, she has to live with the rapist".

==In the context of forced and child marriage==
[[Forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]] are prevalent in many parts of the world, especially in parts of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/forcedmarriage/introduction_1.shtml|title=BBC - Ethics - Forced Marriages: Introduction|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a child marriage is a marriage where one or both parties are younger than 18.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/14/q-child-marriage-and-violations-girls-rights|title=Q &amp; A: Child Marriage and Violations of Girls' Rights|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of marriages are associated with a higher rate of domestic violence, including marital rape.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/|title=WHO - Child marriages: 39 000 every day|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art16.shtml|title=I have a right to - BBC World Service|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plan-uk.org/early-and-forced-marriage/ |title=Early and forced marriage - facts, figures and what you can do |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312222100/http://www.plan-uk.org/early-and-forced-marriage |archivedate=2014-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms of marriage are most common in traditional societies which have no laws against sexual violence in marriage, and where it is also very difficult to leave a marriage. Incidents taking place in some of these countries (such as [[Yemen]]) have received international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/15/world/meast/yemen-child-bride/|title=Yemen minister on child marriage: Enough is enough|author=Mohammed Jamjoom and Hakim Almasmari, CNN|date=15 September 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24083127|title=Yemeni minister seeks law to end child marriage|journal=BBC News|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization states, under the rubric "Customary forms of sexual violence", (pp.&amp;nbsp;156):&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf?ua=1 |format=PDF |title=World report on violence and health |website=Whqlibdoc.who.int |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of [[child marriage|marrying off young children]], particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice – legal in many countries – is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent. The majority of them know little or nothing about sex before they are married."

One type of forced marriages occurs in Guatemala (called robadas) and Mexico (called rapto). Robadas refers to "…abductions, in which women are ‘taken’ during the period of courtship, sometimes semivoluntarily but other times by force, by a suitor who wants to start a marital relationship with them" (Menjívar, 2016). Rapto refers to "…an abduction for sexual or erotic purposes or marriage" (Bovarnik, 2007). Following the abduction, marriage is often encouraged to maintain the family honor (Bovarnik, 2007).

In these types of forced marriages, the marital union begins with the man's intense sense of control over the woman, combined with the understanding that the wife is the possession of her husband (Menjívar, 2016).  This foundation of marriage had direct implications for sexual violence within the marriage. In reference to the practice of robadas, Cecilia Menjívar (2016) writes, "…unions that start out from the violent act of a robada can continue to breed violence, abuse, and mistreatment in the union." In addition, women victims of robadas often face embarrassment and blame, despite the act usually being initiated by male perpetrators (Menjívar, 2016). Women are blamed for disobeying their parents or not resisting their abductor strong enough (Menjívar, 2016). This notion of blaming the woman also occurs in reference to rapto in rural Mexico. Silvie Bovarnik (2007) writes, "In many cases, men and women alike look for the fault of responsibility in women's behavior due to traditional conceptualisations of women as ‘pillars of honour.’"  Abduction and rape compromises a woman's moral integrity, and therefore her honor (Bovarnik, 2007). Many of these women, who were given little choice in their marriage, are left to live with their abusers.

==Relation to other forms of marital violence==
The historical (and present day in jurisdictions where it still applies) immunity of husbands to have sexual relations with their wives without consent was not the only marital immunity in regard to abuse; immunity from the use of violence was (and still is in some countries) common—in the form of a husband's right to use "moderate chastisement" against a 'disobedient' wife. In the US, many states, especially Southern ones, maintained this immunity until the mid-19th century. For instance, in 1824, in ''Calvin Bradley v. the State'', the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] uphold this right of the husband; ruling as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/ms/unknown/court/bradley61gwl.txt |format=TXT |title=Source: Reports Of Cases Adjudged In The Supreme Court Of Mississippi : Written: 1834 : Recorded: 1818 : CALVIN BRADLEY vs. THE STATE |pages=156–157 |website=Files.usgwarchives.net |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Family broils and dissentions cannot be investigated before the tribunals of the country, without casting a shade over the character of those who are unfortunately engaged in the controversy. To screen from public reproach those who may be thus unhappily situated, ''let the husband be permitted to exercise the right of moderate chastisement, in cases of great emergency, and use salutary restraints in every case of misbehaviour, without being subjected to vexatious prosecutions, resulting in the mutual discredit and shame of all parties concerned''."

Although by the late 19th century courts were unanimously agreeing that husbands no longer had the right to inflict "chastisement" on their wives, the public policy was set at ignoring incidents deemed not 'serious enough' for legal intervention. In 1874, the [[Supreme Court of North Carolina]] ruled:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=STATE v. RICHARD OLIVER |url=http://sobek.colorado.edu/~mciverj/2481_70NC60.html |publisher=[[University of Colorado Boulder]] |accessdate=7 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130916014355/http://sobek.colorado.edu/~mciverj/2481_70NC60.html |archivedate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"We may assume that the old doctrine, that a husband had a right to whip his wife, provided he used a switch no larger than his thumb, is not law in North Carolina. Indeed, the Courts have advanced from that barbarism until they have reached the position, that the husband has no right to chastise his wife, under any circumstances.

:But from motives of public policy,--in order to preserve the sanctity of the domestic circle, the Courts will not listen to trivial complaints.

:If no permanent injury has been inflicted, nor malice, cruelty nor dangerous violence shown by the husband, it is better to draw the curtain, shut out the public gaze, and leave the parties to forget and forgive.

:No general rule can be applied, but each case must depend upon the circumstances surrounding it."

Today, husbands continue to be immune from prosecution in case of certain forms of physical abuse against their wives in some countries. For instance, in [[Iraq]] husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right. Examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |title=THE PENAL-CODE WITH AMENDMENTS |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100954/http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/10/19/uae.court.ruling/index.html?_s=PM:WORLD|title=Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wife-on-husband violence==
{{See|Male rape}}
Although most research is focused on wives as victims of marital rape, husbands experience marital rape as well. Little research exists focusing on the specific situation of non-consensual wife-to-husband sexual relations, but evidence suggests that 13%-16% of men are victims of assault by marital or cohabitating partners in their lifetime (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000). Research conducted by Morse (1995), Straus (1977-1978), and Straus and Gelles (1985) suggest that men and women have nearly the same annual rates of victimization of violence by a marital or cohabitating partner (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000). One study that looked at lifetime experiences of marital and cohabitating partner violence found nearly equal rates of victimization among men and women (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000).  However, these statistics convey the larger topic of partner violence and do not reflect rates of marital rape.

==Same-sex couples==
{{See|Male rape}}
Given that same-sex marriage is a relatively new concept, and only minimally accepted globally, little research has explored marital rape in same-sex relationships. More research must be conducted to look at these relationships within the marital context.

==Sustaining factors==
===Legal===
Legally, governments have direct impact on the occurrence of marital rape. The state "…engages in the definition, monitoring, and sanctioning of appropriate behavior" (Torres, 2016). This can play out in criminalizing or not criminalizing marital rape and therefore deeming what is appropriate. [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that rape laws in male dominated societies exist to regulate access to women from a male perspective, not to protect women's right to freely decide whether to engage in sexual intercourse or not. Whatever the reason behind such laws, even when state laws have criminalized marital rape, state institutions perpetuate it. For example, although marital rape has been criminalized throughout the United States, the original laws of the 1980s and 1990s treated marital rape differently from non-marital rape, and in some states this continues to be the case even today (see [[Marital rape (United States law)]]). As these laws exemplify, marital rape is seen as somehow less reprehensible than rape outside of marriage (Bergen, 2016). Even when marital rape is prosecuted successfully, courts often pass shorter sentences - even if the law itself does not stipulate this - based on the view that sexual violation is less serious if it occurs within marriage. Following this same understanding, British courts often pass lower sentences to marital rape than to other cases of rape because it is believed that it causes less harm to the victim (Mandal, 2014).

Police departments are another state institution that treats domestic violence differently than other forms of violence. Police often label domestic abuse calls as low priority, respond slower, and focus on what provoked the abuse rather than the violent actions of the perpetrator (Schelong, 1994). Also, they often act as mediators in the situation because they may feel that domestic violence is a family matter and therefore not their business (Schelong, 1994).

While government institutional influences are vast, marital rape is often sustained by cultural ideologies. According to Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, the issue of sexual violence, including within marriage, has not been a political spectrum issue - that is a left wing ''vs''. right wing issue - but a general ubiquitous part of the culture, "The Left and the Right have consistently had different positions on rape; but neither has acknowledged rape from the point of view of the women who experienced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&amp;context=hwlj |journal=Hastings Women's Law Journal |title=Surfacing Gender: Re-Engraving Crimes Against Women in Humanitarian Law |author=Rhonda Copleon  |volume=5 |date=1994 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culturally unrecognizable===
For many cultures, ideas of marital rape seem often foreign imposed and contradict the belief that such matters should be dealt with privately rather than by the government (Smith, 2016). In other instances, notably in the country of India, members of the government have spoken publicly that marital rape cannot be recognized in their culture. The Indian Minister of State for Home Affairs, [[Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary]], stated in April 2015, "The concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors, including levels of education, illiteracy, poverty myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs, [and] the mindset of the society to treat the marriage as sacrament" (Torres, 2016).
For many other countries, the concept of marital rape is itself an oxymoron (Smith, 2016). Women in these cultures largely "…share the cultural logic that marital rape is a contradiction in terms…" while men simultaneously "…see women's sexual consent in marriage as taken for granted…" and therefore "…reject the very concept of marital rape" (Smith, 2016).

The act of imposing sexual intercourse against the will of the wife is often not identified as morally wrong, and so it is difficult to attempt to stop the practice, "Often, men who coerce a spouse into a sexual act believe their actions are legitimate because they are married to the woman." (WHO, pp.&amp;nbsp;149).&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; This idea that sexual intercourse in marriage is 'legitimate' and so it cannot be illegal even when forced, is in some parts of the world fueled by the custom of [[bride price]]: its paying is seen as earning the man the right to sexual and reproductive control of his wife. [[UN Women]] recommended the abolition of giving bride price, and stated that: "Legislation should [...] State that a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defense to a domestic violence charge. (pp. 25) "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf |format=PDF |title=Handbook for Legislation on Violence Against Women |website=Unwomen.oreg |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young women from various settings in [[South Asia]] explained in surveys that even if they felt discomfort and didn't want to have sex, they accepted their husbands' wishes and submitted, fearing that otherwise they would be beaten.&lt;ref name="popcouncil.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/popsyn/PopulationSynthesis1.pdf |title=FORCED SEXUAL RELATIONS among married young women in developing countries |accessdate=2010-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206071139/http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/popsyn/PopulationSynthesis1.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[developing countries]] it is believed—by both men and women—that a husband is entitled to sex any time he demands it, and that if his wife refuses him, he has the right to use force.&lt;ref name="popcouncil.org"/&gt; These women, most of them either [[illiterate]] or very poorly educated, are married at very young ages (in [[Bangladesh]], for example, according to statistics from 2005, 45% of women then aged between 25–29 had been married by the age of 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/presskit/factsheets/facts_child_marriage.htm |title=Child Marriage Factsheet: State of World Population 2005 |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and depend on their husbands for their entire life. This situation leaves women with very little sexual autonomy. The notion that women are sexually autonomous and therefore have the ability to give or retract consent is not universally understood. Gabriella Torres writes, "The degree to which women and men view themselves as unique social beings with a full ability to make choices and suffer consequences varies by culture" (Torres, 2016). As a result, in cultures where women are not considered autonomous, they are not in a position to refuse sex: they have to choose between unwanted sex and being subjected to violence; or between unwanted sex and being abandoned by their husbands and ending up living in abject poverty.

According to [[Sheila Jeffreys]], in Western countries, "[[sexual liberation]]" ideologies have aggravated the problem of male sexual entitlement, leading to women submitting to unwanted sex not only due to physical force or illegal threat, but due to societal pressure: "The force which has operated on them [women] all their lives and continues to operate on them within marriages and relationships remains largely invisible. [...]  Such forces include the massive industry of [[sexology]], [[sex therapy]], sex advice literature, all of which make women feel guilty and inadequate for any unwillingness to fulfill a man's sexual desires."&lt;ref&gt;''The Idea of Prostitution'', by Sheila Jeffreys, pp 261 -262&lt;/ref&gt;

The prohibition of rape serves other purposes, such as protection of the rights of male relatives or husband, enforcing of religious laws against sex outside of marriage, or preservation of a woman's respect and reputation in society. Under such ideologies it is difficult to accept the concept of marital rape. [[Richard A. Posner]] writes that, "Traditionally, rape was the offense of depriving a father or husband of a valuable asset — his wife's chastity or his daughter's virginity".&lt;ref&gt;''Sex and Reason'', by Richard A. Posner, page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries of the world, including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan, the severity of the legal punishment for rape depends on whether the victim was a [[virgin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amnestytaunton.wordpress.com/tag/algeria/|title=Algeria - Amnesty International Taunton Local Group|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1720&amp;context=jiws |journal=Journal of International Women's Studies |title=Doctors and Sheikhs: "Truths" in Virginity Discourse in Jordanian Media |author=Ebtihal Mahadeen |volume=14 |date=December 2013 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhonda Copleon writes that, "Where rape is treated as a crime against honor, the honor of women is called into question and virginity or chastity is often a precondition."

===The way marriages are arranged===
In many cultures, marriages are still [[arranged marriage|arranged]] for the purpose of procreation, property, and consolidation of [[extended family]] relations, often including a [[bride price]] or a [[dowry]]. In such situations, marriages are pre-arranged as an affair between families and clans. In some cultures, refusal of an arranged marriage is often a cause of an [[honor killing]], because the family which has prearranged the marriage risks disgrace if the marriage does not proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honor Violence FACTSHEET |url=http://www.honordiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HD-FactSheet-HonorViolenceEast.pdf |website=Honor Diaries |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml |title=Ethics: Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sev'er |first1=Aysan |last2=Yurdakul |first2=Gökçe |title=Culture of Honor, Culture of Change - A Feminist Analysis of Honor Killings in Rural Turkey |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/17543/1/cultureofhonour.pdf |publisher=[[University of Toronto]] |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=9 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since consent to marriage is irrelevant, it follows that consent to marital sex is also irrelevant. Similarly, a woman attempting to obtain a divorce or separation without the consent of the husband/extended family can also be a trigger for honor killings. In cultures where marriages are arranged and goods are often exchanged between families, a woman's desire to seek a divorce is often viewed as an insult to the men who negotiated the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html|title=Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"|publisher=|date=2002-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/|title=FAQ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fact that people in developing countries are increasingly selecting marriage partners by whether they are in love – a much more Western world view  – does not necessarily improve the situation. These types of marriages, especially in southeastern Nigeria, are putting women in more difficult positions: if one chooses to marry based on love against their family's wishes, admitting violence in the relationship is a disgrace because it means admitting that one made the wrong judgement (Smith, 2016).

===Religion===
====Judeo-Christian====
Most of the [[Western World]] has been strongly influenced by [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Bible]].  The paradisaical narrative of man and woman in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] establishes a foundation of marriage: {{quote|“So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.”  “Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 1:27, 2:24 (NKJV)))&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This doctrine is repeated in the [[Gospel]] by [[Jesus]], but with the added conclusion “so then they are no longer two, but one flesh".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 19:4-6 , Mark 10:6-8&lt;/ref&gt;  The same doctrine is continued in the [[Epistles]]  in the writings of the Apostle Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Ephesians 5:31 (NKJV&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is further explicated by the Apostle Paul, writing, 

{{quote|“The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again.&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:4-5a (NKJV)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the standing of each party to determine how this biblical principle--denial of conjugal relations--was to be effected was codified as an ecclesiastical canon in 280 A.D. by [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|St. Dionysian of Alexandria]]: "Persons who are self-sufficient and married ought to be judges of themselves." &lt;ref&gt;The commentary on this canon reads “... this course ought to be adopted by agreement between both parties—that is to say by both the husband and the wife agreeing thereto.” Cummings, D. The Rudder, url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/orthodox/The_Rudder.pdf, Orthodox Christian Educational Society, 1957. pp. 720-721.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laiou, Angelike E. (editor), Consent and Coercion to Sex and Marriage in Ancient and Medieval Societies, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1993, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;The canon was given ecumenical application by the Sixth Ecumenical Council in 691 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, D. The Rudder, url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/orthodox/The_Rudder.pdf, Orthodox Christian Educational Society, 1957. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecclesiastical canons continued to adjudicate marital issues well into the modern era until all but entirely superseded by the civil courts.    

The Christian religion teaches that [[pre-marital sex]] is [[fornication]], and sexual relations by a married person with someone other than his or her spouse is [[adultery]], both of which are [[sins]], while sex within marriage is a [[duty]]. This concept of 'conjugal sexual rights' has the purpose to prevent sin (in the form of adultery and temptation) as well as to enable procreation.

The above is interpreted by some religious figures as to render marital rape an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2011/07/22/1980301/readers-blast-valley-paper-over.html |title=Valley paper criticized over pastor's column on spousal rape |work=Alaska Dispatch News |accessdate=22 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203959/http://www.adn.com/2011/07/22/1980301/readers-blast-valley-paper-over.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crisiscentrebahamas.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/marital-rape-ban-tragically-wrong-says-the-christian-council/|title=Marital rape ban 'tragically wrong' says the Christian Council - Bahamas Crisis Centre|work=Bahamas Crisis Centre|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all religious figures hold this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/2009/08/07/priest-signs-online-petition-to-criminalize-marital-rape&amp;post_id=50768|title=priest signs online petition to criminalize marital rape - ucanews.com|work=ucanews.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Pentecostal Christianity prescribes gender expectations for married individuals that "…reestablish a patriarchal bargain…" in which "…women acquiesce to men's authority in return for certain kinds of support" (Smith, 2016). Husbands are expected to provide for the family, and in return, wives are to submit to their husband's authority (Smith, 2016). Ultimately, this "…strengthens some of the gender dynamics that make intimate partner violence possible in the first place" (Smith, 2016).

By contrast, [[Pope Paul VI]] in his 1968 encyclical letter ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' wrote that "Men rightly observe that a conjugal act imposed on one's partner without regard to his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in the matter, is no true act of love, and therefore offends the moral order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband and wife."&lt;ref&gt;Paul VI, 1968, ''Humanae vitae'', §13.&lt;/ref&gt; This teaching, which has been reaffirmed more recently by [[Pope Francis]],&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis, 2016, ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'', §154.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been interpreted by [[Bertrand de Margerie]] to condemn "intra-marital rape", and the use of force in marriage more generally.&lt;ref&gt;de Margery, Bertrand. 'Humane vitae- To which less consideration has been given'. {{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/life-and-family/humanae-vitae/humanae-vitae-to-which-less-consideration-has-been-given/|title=Humanae Vitae - To which less consideration has been given}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other religions====
In other areas around the world, religion is intertwined with the state and directs how people are governed. In Pakistan, there is legal pluralism where the state's legal system intertwines secular and religious law of Islam (Bovarnik, 2007). The result is Shari’a law which represents the religious aspects of the Pakistani legal system. This religious aspect of Pakistani law has many implications for marital rape. For example, Shari’a law requires a female rape victim to provide four Muslim adult male witnesses on her behalf (Bovarnik, 2007). Silvie Bovarnik (2007) argues that "This law hence scrutinizes women's sexual behaviour by criminalising sex outside and decriminalising rape within the context of marriage, while failing to protect women from sexual violence in both contexts." In other words, there seems to be a preoccupation with a woman's sexual misconduct and a simultaneous lack of protection for victims of rape within their own marriage (Bovarnik, 2007). Religious ideologies emphasize a woman's honor, specifically, her virginity (Bovarnik, 2007). In general, "…women are traditionally conceptualized as the property of and a symbol of honour for her own family and later that of her husband." (Bovoarnik, 2007). In addition, Islamic norms have traditionally placed restrictions on women's behavior (Bovarnik, 2007). Women are to stay at home, please the men in one's family, raise the children, and to not become involved with the world outside the home (Bovarnik, 2007). As a result, having no connection with the world outside one's family may isolate women victims of marital rape.

Unlike Pakistan, the country of Sudan is ruled by Islamic law; there is no legal pluralism (Tonnesson, 2014). In Sudanese Islamic law, there is an understood exchange in marriage: A man is responsible for providing adequate support (food, shelter, etc.) and in return the woman is supposed to be obedient to her husband (Tonnesson, 2014). This follows the notion of [[qawama]] which states that male guardianship is ultimate and therefore a women's role is to obey her male guardianship (Tonnesson, 2014). In reference to marital rape, religious law in Sudan has implications for divorce. Under Sudanese Islamic law, disobedience from a wife is grounds for divorce, but a husband raping his wife is not (Tonnesson, 2014). 
Due to this understanding of a contractual exchange between husband and wife, forcing a wife to have sex without her consent is not considered rape (Tonnesson, 2014). However, activists with opposing views argue that consent is central to Islam (Tonnesson, 2014). Abdel Halim (2011) argues that without consent, "…a sexual act loses its legitimacy" (Tonnesson, 2014).

In India, classical Hindu law defines the state's understanding of marriage. Therefore, marriage is "not viewed as a contract but as a sacrament" (Mandal, 2014). This understanding is the basis for the lack of criminalization of marital rape. India's religious context defines marriages as "divinely ordained" and therefore the "…rights and obligations of spouses in conjugal relations [are] beyond the scope of regulation by criminal law" (Mandal, 2014). In other words, criminal law cannot touch that which is deemed sacred under the Hindu religion. As a result, marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and other family practices are governed by religious law of each community (Mandal, 2014). However, this statement is controversial because legally marriage any person who is a Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh by religion is governed by [[The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955]] in India, which has provisions to prohibit possession of multiple wives, and has a provision of divorce similar to other western marriage laws. These both provisions was not existing in classical Sanskrit law.  This law faced religious opposition but yet implemented the government at that time. The law is now widely acceptable, and implemented in present Indian society. Therefore, stating "In India, classical Hindu Law defines the states understanding of marriage" can be a misleading statement.

===Gender expectations===
{{See|Gender roles}}
Another sustaining factor is the obligatory roles placed on wives and what they come to understand as their "duty". For example, "Vietnamese women are expected to sacrifice for their families, especially for their children, which includes, for some, acceding to husbands’ sexual demands" (Kwiatkowski, 2016). Their "duty" is to maintain family harmony and happiness (Kwiatkowski, 2016). In Guatemala, violence within marriage is so normalized that wives come to believe that this is ‘the way things are’ and it is simply their role as a wife to endure the violence (Menjívar, 2016). This "…normalization of violence…rests on a continuum of coercive power that makes possible the mistreatment of women not only in their homes but also in the community, neighborhood, and society at large" (Menjívar, 2016). Further, because many of these women believe giving sex is their duty, they do not characterize their experience as marital rape (Bergen, 2016). However, "…women who have experienced forced sex in marriage understand this experience as an abuse or violation", they just may not characterize it as marital rape (Torres, 2016). Violence is so entrenched in many cultures it simply becomes a way of life, and wives are left to believe they must learn to endure it (Menjívar, 2016).

On the other hand, husbands are influenced by the expectations of their masculinity. In Africa, these expectations include being a husband, father, and head of the household which requires men to provide food, shelter and protection (Smith, 2016). Along with this "…obligation of being the provider comes the privilege and authority of patriarchy" (Smith, 2016). As a result, it is often the man's perception that his wife has challenged his authority that leads to the violence (Smith, 2016).

In the United States, masculinity is understood as a fixed entity that exists despite the changes of everyday life (Connell, 45). It is understood as being in comparison to femininity, and more specifically, in opposition to femininity: Masculinity is to superiority as femininity is to subservience (Connell). Therefore, masculinity is correlated with aggression in such a way that scholars argue violence is a way for men to show their masculine identity (Umberson et al., 2003). Another expectation of masculinity is that men are not to show their emotion (Umberson et al., 2003). Instead, as Robert Connell argues, the "masculine prototype" is a strong and stoic man who appears to remain in control of the situation and his emotions (Umberson et al., 2003). This sense of control in Western masculinity has direct implications for domestic violence. Scholars argue that some men use violence to regain this sense of control when it is lost (Umberson et al., 2003).

However, not all men who subscribe to masculinity expectations are violent. In fact, most men, in general, are not violent (Umberson et al., 2003). For those who are violent, ideals of masculinity seem to play some causal role in their violence. Research shows that "violence is more likely among men who experience a disconnection between their personal circumstances and their emotions" (Umberson et al., 2003). Evidently, there seems to be some connection between the masculine expectation of suppressing or disconnecting from one's emotions, and one's tendency to be violent (Umberson et al., 2003).

==Universal lived experience==

Although marital rape is not always defined as such in different cultures, there is a universal understanding of the violation that comes with rape. Yllö &amp; Torres (2016) argue that "…marital rape is regularly constituted across cultures as a locally recognized social violation—one that is understood to impede women in those particular cultural contexts from aspiring to a good human life." An aspect of this violation is the notion that the victim has not given their consent, however, historically and presently, consent is not always connected to marital sex. (Yllö &amp;Torres, 2016). In the United States, a woman's personhood, and therefore her consent, only began with the suffragist movement that sought women's access to equal citizenship (Yllö &amp; Torres, 2016). Globally, many cultures do not require a woman's consent in marriage because procreation is at the root of such an alliance (Yllö &amp; Torres, 2016). Further, some women are forced into marriage where her consent is not considered or required (Yllö &amp; Torres, 2016). Despite this cultural variance, "women across many cultures do experience the violation of rape in marriage—even if the way that such violations are experienced and understood differs from culture to culture" (Yllö &amp; Torres, 2016).

==Problems in prosecuting marital rape==
The criminalization of marital rape does not necessary mean that these laws are enforced in practice, with lack of public awareness, as well as reluctance or outright refusal of authorities to prosecute being common in many countries. For instance, in Ireland, where marital rape was made illegal in 1990, by 2016 there had been only two persons convicted of marital rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/marital-rape-remains-extremely-difficult-to-prosecute-1.2734172|title=Marital rape remains extremely difficult to prosecute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, gender norms that often place wives in subservient positions to their husbands, make it more difficult for women to recognize spousal rape or feel confident that it will be addressed by law enforcement. 

In many countries, most often, in practice, there will be no prosecution except in extreme cases that involve a very high level of violence. There have been many problems with prosecuting the perpetrators of spousal rape, chief amongst them has been the reluctance of the various legal systems to recognize it as a crime at all. However, criminalization has opened a new set of problems. To take an example in the [[United Kingdom]], such a category of rape was only recognized by a 1991 [[House of Lords]] decision known simply as ''R v R (1991 All ER 481)''. While most parties agreed with the House of Lords' motive in making the decision, there were many who were of the opinion that the decision involved ''post facto'' criminalization, since the House of Lords were imprisoning spouses for doing what was once, according to the law, their right.

Another problem results from prevailing social norms that exist in certain cultures. In order for any law to be successfully enforced, the acts which it prohibits must be perceived by society as abusive. As such, even if a jurisdiction enacts adequate laws against marital rape, in practice, these laws are ignored if the act is not socially considered a crime. For example, in many parts of the world, where women have few rights, it is considered unthinkable for a woman to refuse her husband's sexual demands; far from being seen as an act of abuse of a wife, marital rape is seen as an incident provoked by the wife who refused to perform her duty: for instance one survey found that 74% of women in [[Mali]] said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?rh04047 |title=Bioline International Official Site (site up-dated regularly) |publisher=Bioline.org.br |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other problems arise from the fact that, even in countries where marital rape is illegal, many people are not aware of the existing laws. Because in most parts of the world marital rape laws are very new, many people do not know of their existence. In many cultures, traditional ideas about marriage are deeply rooted in the conscience of the population, and few people know that forcing a spouse to have sex is illegal. For instance, a report by Amnesty International showed that although marital rape is illegal in [[Hungary]], in a public opinion poll of nearly 1,200 people in 2006, a total of 62% did not know
that marital rape was a crime: over 41% of men and nearly 56% of women
thought it was not punishable as a crime in Hungarian law, and nearly 12% did not know.&lt;ref name="cries unheard" /&gt; In [[Hong Kong]], in 2003, 16 months after the criminalization of marital rape, a survey showed that 40% of women did not know it was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19956971_ITM |title=Article: Publicity urged for law on marital rape. &amp;#124; AccessMyLibrary - Promoting library advocacy |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=2003-11-23 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study in [[South Africa]] (where marital rape was made illegal in 1993) showed that only 55% of respondents agreed with the affirmation "I think it is possible for a woman to be raped by her husband".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alnap.org/pool/files/13452-begin-war-at-home.pdf|format=PDF|title=The War At Home : Gender Based Violence Indicators Project|website=Alnap.org|accessdate=2016-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191608/http://www.alnap.org/pool/files/13452-begin-war-at-home.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although in recent years some countries in Africa have enacted laws against marital rape, in most parts of the continent forced marital sex is not a criminal offense. A 2003 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that: "With few exceptions across Africa, marital rape is not recognized as a crime, and domestic violence is seen as a right of married men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - hivaids1203.doc |format=PDF |website=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptability of domestic violence in most African countries is very high: surveys showed that the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea, 80% in Central African Republic, 79% in South Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php |title=Unicef Statistics |publisher= |accessdate=22 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704112113/http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php |archivedate=4 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although more countries in Africa are now enacting laws against domestic violence, social norms make it difficult to enforce these laws; and many women are not aware of their rights: for instance in Ethiopia in a survey only 49% of women knew that wife-beating is illegal (it was made illegal under the 2004 Criminal Code).&lt;ref name="sgdatabase.unwomen.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/Ethiopia%20-%20Revised%20Criminal%20Code%202004.pdf |title=THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA |accessdate=2013-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202126/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/Ethiopia%20-%20Revised%20Criminal%20Code%202004.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/Ethiopia_FGM_Final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and UNICEF in Ethiopia : PROGRESS IN ABANDONING FEMALE GENITAL MULTILATION / CUTTING AND CHILD MARRIAGE IN SELF-DECLARED WOREDAS |website=Unicef.org |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of legal and social recognition of marital rape in Africa has been cited as making the fight against HIV harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/08/18/costs-marital-rape-southern-africa|title=The costs of marital rape in Southern Africa|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7644">In [[environmental law]] and [[Environmental policy|policy]], '''market-based instruments''' ('''MBIs''') are [[policy]] instruments that use [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[price]], and other [[Economy|economic]] variables to provide [[Economic incentive|incentives]] for polluters to reduce or eliminate negative environmental [[Externality|externalities]]. MBIs seek to address the [[market failure]] of externalities (such as [[pollution]]) by incorporating the external cost of production or consumption activities through taxes or charges on processes or products, or by creating property rights and facilitating the establishment of a proxy market for the use of environmental services. Market-based instruments are also referred to as '''economic instruments''', '''price-based instruments''', '''new environmental policy instruments''' ('''NEPIs''')  or ''''new instruments of environmental policy'''. 

Examples include environmentally related [[tax]]es, charges and [[Subsidy|subsidies]], [[emissions trading]] and other tradeable permit systems, [[deposit-refund system]]s, environmental labeling laws, licenses, and [[property rights (economics)|economic property rights]]. For instance, the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] is an example of a market-based instrument to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

Market-based instruments differ from other policy instruments such as voluntary agreements (actors voluntarily agree to take action) and [[Regulation|regulatory]] instruments (sometimes called "command-and-control"; public authorities mandate the performance to be achieved or the technologies to be used). However, implementing an MBI also commonly requires some form of regulation. Market based instruments can be implemented in a systematic manner, across an economy or region, across economic sectors, or by environmental medium (e.g. water).  Individual MBIs are instances of [[environmental pricing reform]].

According to Kete (2002), "policymaking appears to be in transition towards more market-oriented instruments, but it remains an open-ended experiment whether we shall successfully execute a long-term s''ocial'' transition that involves the private sector and the state in new relationships implied by the pollution prevention and economic instruments rhetoric."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Kete, "Environmental policy instruments for market and mixed-market economies" (January 1994). ''Utilities Policy'', Vol. 4, 1: pp. 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
For example, although the use of new environmental policy instruments only grew significantly in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1990s, [[David Lloyd George]] may have introduced the first market-based instrument of environmental policy in the UK when a [[Fuel tax]] was levied in 1909 during his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, A., Wurzel, R., Zito, R., and Bruckner, L. (2003). Policy innovation or 'muddling through'? 'New' environmental policy instruments in the United Kingdom. ''Environmental Politics'', 12 (1). pp. 179-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transferable permits==
A market-based transferable permit sets a maximum level of pollution (a 'cap'), but is likely to achieve that level at a lower cost than other means, and, importantly, may reduce below that level due to technological innovation.

When using a transferable-permit system, it is very important to accurately measure the initial problem and also how it changes over time. This is because it can be expensive to make adjustments (either in terms of compensation or through undermining the property rights of the permits). Permits' effectiveness can also be affected by things like market [[liquidity]], the quality of the property right, and existing [[market power]].&lt;ref name=Guerin&gt;Guerin, K. (2003). ''Property Rights and Environmental Policy: A New Zealand Perspective.''Wellington, New Zealand: NZ Treasury&lt;/ref&gt; Another important aspect of transferable permits is whether they are auctioned or allocated via [[grandfathering]].

An argument against permits is that formalising emission rights is effectively giving people a license to pollute, which is believed to be socially unacceptable. However, although valuing adverse environmental impacts may be controversial, the acceptable cost of preventing these impacts is implicit in all regulatory decisions.&lt;ref name=Guerin/&gt;

==Taxes==

A market-based tax approach determines a maximum cost for control measures. This gives polluters an incentive to reduce pollution at a lower cost than the tax rate. There is no cap; the quantity of pollution reduced depends on the chosen tax rate.

A [[tax]] approach is more flexible than permits, as the [[tax rate]] can be adjusted until it creates the most effective incentive. Taxes also have lower [[compliance costs]] than permits. However, taxes are less effective at achieving reductions in target quantities than permits. Using a tax potentially enables a [[double dividend]], by using the revenue generated by the tax to reduce other distortionary taxes through [[revenue recycling]].&lt;ref name=Guerin/&gt; There can also be conflict between objectives with a tax: less pollution means less revenue.

==Market-based vs command and control==

An alternate approach to environmental regulation is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_regulation#Environmental_regulation| command and control approach]. This is much more prescriptive than market-based instruments. Command and control regulatory instruments include emissions standards, process/equipment specifications, limits on input/output/discharges, requirements to disclose information, and audits. Command and control approaches have been criticised for restricting technology, as there is no incentive for firms to innovate.&lt;ref name=Guerin/&gt;

Market-based instruments do not prescribe that firms use specific technologies, or that all firms reduce their emissions by the same amount, which allows firms greater flexibility in their approaches to pollution management. However, command and control approaches may be beneficial as a starting point, when regulators are faced with a significant problem yet have too little information to support a market-based instrument. Command and control approaches can also be preferred when regulators are faced with a [[thin market]], where the limited potential trading pools mean the gains of a market-based instrument would not exceed the costs (a key requirement for a successful market-based approach).&lt;ref name=Guerin/&gt;

Market-based instruments may also be inappropriate in dealing with emissions with local impacts, as trading would be restricted to within that region. They may also be inappropriate for emissions with global impacts, as international cooperation may be difficult to attain.

For a variety of reasons, environmental advocates initially opposed the use of market-based instruments except under very constrained conditions.  However, after the successful use of freely traded credits in the lead phasedown in the U.S. environmental advocates recognized that trading markets has benefits for the environment as well.&lt;ref&gt;•Alan P. Loeb, "Addressing the Public's Goals for Environmental Regulation When Communicating Acid Rain Allowance Trades," The Electricity Journal, May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, beginning with the proposal of the acid rain allowance market, environmental advocates have supported the use of trading in a variety of contexts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2764">{{short description|philosophical concept related to empathy and sympathy}}
'''Mimpathy''' ({{lang-de|Nachfühlen}}, literally "after experience") is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept related to [[empathy]] and [[sympathy]]. In [[Dagobert D. Runes]]' 1942 ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', contributor Herman Hausheer defines mimpathy as the sharing of another's feelings on a matter, without necessarily experiencing feelings of sympathy.&lt;ref name="runes"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Max Scheler]] describes mimpathy, or "[[emotion]]al imitation", as the basis for sympathy, but of no help in understanding another person in and of itself. Scheler identifies four types of sympathy:
#''Compathy'', or emotional solidarity, the immediate sharing of the same emotion with another
#Genuine ''sympathy'', in which sorrow is experienced "in an act of understanding experienced as such an act", and the objective source of emotion is not shared
#''Transpathy'', or [[emotional contagion]], a state introduced in a group, "automatic and without understanding", by the emotional display of another
#''Unipathy'', or genuine emotional identification with another, an "intensified" and "involuntary" form of transpathy, which may present as a ''[[folie à deux]]''.&lt;ref name="olinick"/&gt;

Academic Karen E. Smythe, in analyzing the fiction of [[Mavis Gallant]], described mimpathy as a combination of [[mimesis]] and [[empathy]], an acting out of "self-dramas" as a means of interpreting the suffering of literary characters.&lt;ref name="smythe"/&gt;

In literature, a '''moral universe''' is the moral nature of the universe as a whole in relation to human life, or a specific moral code.

A moral universe implies that we live in a basically spiritual universe that is somehow ordered by a higher power, by invisible feelings of good and bad, a 'cosmic order' reminiscent of the early Greeks &lt;ref&gt;William Allan, ''Divine Justice and Cosmic Order in Early Greek Epic,'' The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 126, (2006), pp.1-35&lt;/ref&gt; that underpins and motivates our actions. Or a 'moral force' that means our actions must have definite effects which we carry with us. In this respect its meaning comes close to the [[Hindu]] concept of [[Karma]].

Those who reject this idea tend to believe that the universe is just physical, has no spiritual component at all, that events are random and have no deeper meaning or purpose, and that there can be no consequences of any kind to our actions and thus that we live in an amoral or nihilistic universe,&lt;ref&gt;J K Hyde, ''Concepts of Power in Kierkegaard and Nietzsche,'' UK: Ashgate, 2010, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Nietzsche]]'s "[[God is dead]]," aphorism.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Adrian Del Caro, Robert B. Pippin, ''Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Such might be the position of "anti-moral free spirits-nihilists."&lt;ref&gt;David Davidson, ''From Virgin to Dynamo: The "Amoral Woman" in European Cinema,'' Cinema Journal, Vol. 21, No. 1, Psychological Aspects (Autumn, 1981), pp.31-58&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20831">In the [[foundations of mathematics]], '''Morse–Kelley set theory''' ('''MK'''), '''Kelley–Morse set theory''' ('''KM'''), '''Morse–Tarski set theory''' ('''MT'''), '''Quine–Morse set theory''' ('''QM''') or the '''system of Quine and Morse''' is a [[first order logic|first order]] [[axiomatic set theory]] that is closely related to [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG). While von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory restricts the [[bound variable]]s in the schematic formula appearing in the [[axiom schema]] of [[axiom schema of Class Comprehension|Class Comprehension]] to range over sets alone, Morse–Kelley set theory allows these bound variables to range over [[proper class]]es as well as sets, as first suggested by Quine in 1940 for his system [[New Foundations|ML]].

Morse–Kelley set theory is named after mathematicians [[John L. Kelley]] and [[Anthony Morse]] and was first set out by {{harvtxt|Wang|1949}} and later in an appendix to Kelley's textbook ''General Topology'' (1955), a graduate level introduction to [[topology]]. Kelley said the system in his book was a variant of the systems due to [[Thoralf Skolem]] and Morse. Morse's own version appeared later in his book ''A Theory of Sets'' (1965).

While von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory is a [[conservative extension]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC, the canonical set theory) in the sense that a statement in the language of ZFC is provable in NBG if and only if it is provable in ZFC, Morse–Kelley set theory is a [[proper extension]] of ZFC. Unlike von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, where the axiom schema of Class Comprehension can be replaced with finitely many of its instances, Morse–Kelley set theory cannot be finitely axiomatized.

== MK axioms and ontology ==
[[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] and MK share a common [[ontology]]. The [[universe of discourse]] consists of [[proper class|classes]]. Classes which are members of other classes are called [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. A class which is not a set is a [[proper class]]. The primitive [[atomic sentence]]s involve membership or equality.

With the exception of Class Comprehension, the following axioms are the same as those for [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]], inessential details aside. The symbolic versions of the axioms employ the following notational devices:
* The upper case letters other than ''M'', appearing in Extensionality, Class Comprehension, and Foundation, denote variables ranging over classes. A lower case letter denotes a variable that cannot be a [[proper class]], because it appears to the left of an ∈. As MK is a one-sorted theory, this notational convention is only [[mnemonic]].
* The [[Unary operation|monadic]] [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] &lt;math&gt;\ Mx,&lt;/math&gt; whose intended reading is "the class ''x'' is a set", abbreviates &lt;math&gt;\exists W(x \in W).&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[empty set]] &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x \not \in \varnothing).&lt;/math&gt;
* The class ''V'', the [[universe (mathematics)|universal class]] having all possible sets as members, is defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall x (Mx \to x \in V).&lt;/math&gt; ''V'' is also the [[Von Neumann universe]].

'''[[Axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]:''' Classes having the same members are the same class.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall X \, \forall Y \, ( \forall z \, (z \in X \leftrightarrow z \in Y) \rightarrow X = Y).&lt;/math&gt;
A set and a class having the same extension are identical. Hence MK is not a two-sorted theory, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.

'''[[Axiom of foundation|Foundation]]:''' Each nonempty class ''A'' is [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] from at least one of its members.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A [A \not = \varnothing \rightarrow \exists b (b \in A \land \forall c (c \in b \rightarrow c \not\in A))].&lt;/math&gt;

'''Class Comprehension:''' Let φ(''x'') be any formula in the language of MK in which ''x'' is a [[free variable]] and ''Y'' is not free. φ(''x'') may contain parameters which are either sets or proper classes. More consequentially, the quantified variables in φ(''x'') may range over all classes and not just over all sets; ''this is the only way MK differs from [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]]''. Then there exists a '''class''' &lt;math&gt;Y=\{x \mid \phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; whose members are exactly those '''sets''' ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; comes out true. Formally, if ''Y'' is not free in φ:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall W_1 ... W_n \exists Y \forall x [x \in Y \leftrightarrow (\phi(x, W_1, ... W_n) \land Mx)].&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Axiom of pairing|Pairing]]:''' For any sets ''x'' and ''y'', there exists a set &lt;math&gt;z=\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; whose members are exactly ''x'' and ''y''.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \forall y \, [ (Mx \land My) \rightarrow \exists z \, (Mz \land \forall s \, [ s \in z \leftrightarrow (s = x \, \lor \, s = y)])].&lt;/math&gt;

Pairing licenses the unordered pair in terms of which the [[ordered pair]], &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, may be defined in the usual way, as &lt;math&gt;\ \{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. With ordered pairs in hand, Class Comprehension enables defining [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] and [[function (set theory)|functions]] on sets as sets of ordered pairs, making possible the next axiom:

'''[[Axiom of limitation of size|Limitation of Size]]:''' ''C'' is a [[proper class]] if and only if ''[[Von Neumann universe|V]]'' can be [[one-to-one mapping|mapped one-to-one]] into ''C''.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
\forall C [\lnot MC \leftrightarrow \exists F ( \forall x [Mx \rightarrow \exists s (s \in C \land \langle x, s \rangle \in F)] \land \\
\qquad \forall x \forall y \forall s [(\langle x, s \rangle \in F \land \langle y, s \rangle \in F) \rightarrow x = y])].
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The formal version of this axiom resembles the [[axiom schema of replacement]], and embodies the class function ''F''. The next section explains how Limitation of Size is stronger than the usual forms of the [[axiom of choice]].

'''[[Axiom of power set|Power set]]:''' Let ''p'' be a class whose members are all possible [[subset]]s of the set ''a''. Then ''p'' is a set.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a \, \forall p \, [(Ma \land \forall x \, [x \in p \leftrightarrow \forall y \, (y \in x \rightarrow y \in a)]) \rightarrow Mp].&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Axiom of union|Union]]:''' Let &lt;math&gt;s=\bigcup a&lt;/math&gt; be the sum class of the set ''a'', namely the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all members of ''a''. Then ''s'' is a set.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a \, \forall s \, [(Ma \land \forall x \, [x \in s \leftrightarrow \exists y \, (x \in y \land y \in a)]) \rightarrow Ms].&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[axiom of infinity|Infinity]]:''' There exists an inductive set ''y'', meaning that (i) the [[empty set]] is a member of ''y''; (ii) if ''x'' is a member of ''y'', then so is &lt;math&gt;x \cup \{x\}.&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\exists y[My \land \varnothing \in y \land \forall z(z \in y \rightarrow \exists x [x \in y \land \forall w (w \in x \leftrightarrow [w = z \lor w \in z])] )].&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''p'' and ''s'' in Power Set and Union are universally, not existentially, quantified, as Class Comprehension suffices to establish the existence of ''p'' and ''s''. Power Set and Union only serve to establish that ''p'' and ''s'' cannot be proper classes.

The above axioms are shared with other set theories as follows:
* [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] and [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]]: Pairing, Power Set, Union, Infinity;
* [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] (and ZFC, if quantified variables were restricted to sets): Extensionality, Foundation;
* [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]]: Limitation of Size.

== Discussion ==
Monk (1980) and Rubin (1967) are set theory texts built around MK; Rubin's [[ontology]] includes [[urelement]]s. These authors and Mendelson (1997: 287) submit that MK does what is expected of a set theory while being less cumbersome than [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] and [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]].

MK is strictly stronger than ZFC and its [[conservative extension]] NBG, the other well-known set theory with [[proper class]]es. In fact, NBG—and hence ZFC—can be proved consistent in MK. MK's strength stems from its axiom schema of Class Comprehension being [[impredicativity|impredicative]], meaning that φ(''x'') may contain quantified variables ranging over classes. The quantified variables in NBG's axiom schema of Class Comprehension are restricted to sets; hence Class Comprehension in NBG must be [[impredicativity|predicative]]. (Separation with respect to sets is still impredicative in NBG, because the quantifiers in φ(''x'') may range over all sets.) The NBG axiom schema of Class Comprehension can be replaced with finitely many of its instances; this is not possible in MK. MK is consistent relative to ZFC augmented by an axiom asserting the existence of strongly [[inaccessible cardinal]]s.

The only advantage of the [[axiom of limitation of size]] is that it implies the [[axiom of global choice]]. Limitation of Size does not appear in Rubin (1967), Monk (1980), or Mendelson (1997). Instead, these authors invoke a usual form of the local [[axiom of choice]], and an "axiom of replacement,"&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Mendelson (1997), p. 239, axiom R.&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that if the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of a class function is a set, its [[range (mathematics)|range]] is also a set. Replacement can prove everything that Limitation of Size proves, except prove some form of the [[axiom of choice]].

[[axiom of limitation of size|Limitation of Size]] plus [[axiom of infinity|''I'' being a set]] (hence the universe is nonempty) renders provable the sethood of the empty set; hence no need for an [[axiom of empty set]]. Such an axiom could be added, of course, and minor perturbations of the above axioms would necessitate this addition. The set ''I'' is not identified with the [[limit ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\omega,&lt;/math&gt; as ''I'' could be a set larger than &lt;math&gt;\omega.&lt;/math&gt; In this case, the existence of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; would follow from either form of Limitation of Size.

The class of [[von Neumann ordinal]]s can be [[well-order]]ed. It cannot be a set (under pain of paradox); hence that class is a proper class, and all proper classes have the same size as ''V''. Hence ''V'' too can be well-ordered.

MK can be confused with second-order ZFC, ZFC with [[second-order logic]] (representing second-order objects in set rather than predicate language) as its background logic. The language of second-order ZFC is similar to that of MK (although a set and a class having the same extension can no longer be identified), and their [[syntax|syntactical]] resources for practical proof are almost identical (and are identical if MK includes the strong form of Limitation of Size). But the [[semantics]] of second-order ZFC are quite different from those of MK. For example, if MK is consistent then it has a countable first-order model, while second-order ZFC has no countable models.

=== Model theory ===
ZFC, NBG, and MK each have models describable in terms of ''V'', the [[inner model|standard model]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] and the [[von Neumann universe]]. Let the [[inaccessible cardinal]] κ be a member of ''V''. Also let Def(''X'') denote the Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; definable [[subset]]s of ''X'' (see [[constructible universe]]). Then:
* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[intended interpretation|intended model]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]];
* Def(''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;) is an intended model of Mendelson's version of [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] which excludes global choice, replacing limitation of size by replacement and ordinary choice;
* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ+1&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[power set]] of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;, is an intended model of MK.

=== History ===
MK was first set out in {{harvtxt|Wang|1949}} and popularized in an appendix to [[J. L. Kelley]]'s (1955) ''General Topology'', using the axioms given in the next section. The system of Anthony Morse's (1965) ''A Theory of Sets'' is equivalent to Kelley's, but formulated in an idiosyncratic formal language rather than, as is done here, in standard [[first order logic]].  The first set theory to include [[impredicative]] class comprehension was [[W. V. Quine|Quine's]] [[New Foundations|ML]], that built on [[New Foundations]] rather than on [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''locus citandum'' for ML is the 1951 ed. of [[W. V. O. Quine|Quine's]] ''Mathematical Logic''. However, the summary of ML given in Mendelson (1997), p. 296, is easier to follow. Mendelson's axiom schema ML2 is identical to the above axiom schema of Class Comprehension.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Impredicative]] class comprehension was also proposed in [[Mostowski]] (1951) and [[David Kellogg Lewis|Lewis]] (1991).

== The axioms in Kelley's ''General topology'' ==
The axioms and definitions in this section are, but for a few inessential details, taken from the Appendix to Kelley (1955). The explanatory remarks below are not his. The Appendix states 181 theorems and definitions, and warrants careful reading as an abbreviated exposition of axiomatic set theory by a working mathematician of the first rank. Kelley introduced his axioms gradually, as needed to develop the topics listed after each instance of ''Develop'' below.

Notations appearing below and now well-known are not defined. Peculiarities of Kelley's notation include:
* He did ''not'' distinguish variables ranging over classes from those ranging over sets;
* ''domain f'' and ''range f'' denote the domain and range of the function ''f''; this peculiarity has been carefully respected below;
* His primitive logical language includes [[set builder notation|class abstract]]s of the form &lt;math&gt;\ \{x : A(x)\},&lt;/math&gt; "the class of all sets ''x'' satisfying ''A''(''x'')."

'''Definition:''' ''x'' is a ''set'' (and hence not a [[proper class]]) if, for some ''y'', &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''I. Extent:''' For each ''x'' and each ''y'', ''x=y'' if and only if for each ''z'', &lt;math&gt;z \in x&lt;/math&gt; when and only when &lt;math&gt;z \in y.&lt;/math&gt;

Identical to ''Extensionality'' above. '''I''' would be identical to the [[axiom of extensionality]] in [[ZFC]], except that the scope of '''I''' includes proper classes as well as sets.

'''II. Classification (schema):''' An axiom results if in
: For each &lt;math&gt; \beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta \in \{\alpha:A\}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;B,&lt;/math&gt;
'α' and 'β' are replaced by variables, ' ''A'' ' by a formula Æ, and ' ''B'' ' by the formula obtained from Æ by replacing each occurrence of the variable which replaced α by the variable which replaced β provided that the variable which replaced β does not appear bound in ''A''.

''Develop'': Boolean [[algebra of sets]]. Existence of the [[empty set|null class]] and of the universal class ''V''.

'''III. Subsets:'''  If ''x'' is a set, there exists a set ''y'' such that for each ''z'', if &lt;math&gt;z \subseteq x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;z \in y.&lt;/math&gt;

The import of '''III''' is that of ''Power Set'' above. Sketch of the proof of Power Set from '''III''': for any ''class'' ''z'' which is a subclass of the set ''x'', the class ''z'' is a member of the set ''y'' whose existence '''III''' asserts. Hence ''z'' is a set.

''Develop'': ''V'' is not a set. Existence of [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s. [[axiom of separation|Separation]] provable.

'''IV. Union:''' If ''x'' and ''y'' are both sets, then &lt;math&gt;x \cup y&lt;/math&gt; is a set.

The import of '''IV''' is that of ''Pairing'' above. Sketch of the proof of Pairing from '''IV''': the singleton &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; of a set ''x'' is a set because it is a subclass of the power set of ''x'' (by two applications of '''III'''). Then '''IV''' implies that &lt;math&gt;\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set if ''x'' and ''y'' are sets.

''Develop'': Unordered and [[ordered pair]]s, [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[function (set theory)|function]]s, [[domain (mathematics)|domain]], [[range (mathematics)|range]], [[function composition]].

'''V. Substitution:''' If ''f'' is a [class] function and ''domain f'' is a set, then ''range f'' is a set.

The import of '''V''' is that of the [[axiom schema of replacement]] in [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] and [[ZFC]].

'''VI. Amalgamation:''' If ''x'' is a set, then &lt;math&gt;\bigcup x&lt;/math&gt; is a set.

The import of '''VI''' is that of ''Union'' above. '''IV''' and '''VI''' may be combined into one axiom.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1955), p. 261, fn †.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Develop'': [[Cartesian product]], [[injective function|injection]], [[surjection]], [[bijection]], [[order theory]].

'''VII. Regularity:''' If &lt;math&gt;x \neq \varnothing&lt;/math&gt; there is a member ''y'' of ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;x \cap y = \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

The import of '''VII''' is that of ''Foundation'' above.

''Develop'': [[Ordinal number]]s, [[transfinite induction]].

'''VIII. Infinity:''' There exists a set ''y'', such that &lt;math&gt;\varnothing \in y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \cup \{x\} \in y&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;x \in y.&lt;/math&gt;

This axiom, or equivalents thereto, are included in ZFC and NBG. '''VIII''' asserts the unconditional existence of two sets, the [[infinite set|infinite]] inductive set ''y'', and the null set &lt;math&gt;\varnothing.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a set simply because it is a member of ''y''. Up to this point, everything that has been proved to exist is a class, and Kelley's discussion of sets was entirely hypothetical.

''Develop'':  [[Natural number]]s, '''N''' is a set, [[Peano axioms]], [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, [[real number]]s.

'''Definition:''' ''c'' is a ''choice function'' if ''c'' is a function and &lt;math&gt;c(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for each member ''x'' of ''domain c''.

'''IX. Choice:''' There exists a choice function ''c'' whose domain is &lt;math&gt;V - \{\varnothing\}.&lt;/math&gt;.

'''IX''' is very similar to the [[axiom of global choice]] derivable from ''Limitation of Size'' above.

''Develop'': [[axiom of choice#Equivalents|Equivalents]] of the axiom of choice. As is the case with [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], the development of the [[cardinal number]]s requires some form of Choice.

If the scope of all quantified variables in the above axioms is restricted to sets, all axioms except '''III''' and the schema '''IV''' are ZFC axioms. '''IV''' is provable in ZFC. Hence the Kelley treatment of '''MK''' makes very clear that all that distinguishes '''MK''' from ZFC are variables ranging over [[proper class]]es as well as sets, and the Classification schema.

It is based in part on the [[Ship of Theseus]] which, however, is standardly used to illustrate other philosophical questions, to do with problems of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref name=ONPSP&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophy Between Science and Politics|volume=38|series=Ideas in Context|first1=Nancy|last1=Cartwright|authorlink1=Nancy Cartwright (philosopher) |first2=Jordi|last2=Cat|first3=Lola|last3=Fleck|first4=Thomas E.|last4=Uebel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521041119|chapter=On Neurath's Boat|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularised by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] in ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960).

==Different versions==
Neurath used the simile in several occasions,&lt;ref name=ONPSP/&gt;&lt;ref name=antispengler&gt;{{cite book |last=Neurath |first=Otto |title=Anti-Spengler |year=1921 |doi=10.1007/978-94-010-2525-6_6 |isbn=978-90-277-0259-3 |at=Vienna Circle Collection vol. 1: ''Empiricism and Sociology'' (1973)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first being in Neurath's text ''Problems in War Economics''.

{{quote|We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom.

[[Keith Stanovich|Stanovich]], in his book ''The Robot's Rebellion'', refers to it as a '''Neurathian bootstrap''' and uses it as an analogy to the [[recursion|recursive]] nature of revising one's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, Keith E.

University Of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-77089-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A "rotten plank" on the ship, for instance, might refer to a [[meme|meme virus]] or a junk meme (i.e., a meme that is either maladaptive to the individual, or serves no beneficial purpose for the realization of an individual's life goals). It may be impossible to bring the ship to shore for repairs, therefore one may stand on planks that are not rotten in order to repair or replace the ones that are. At a later time, the planks previously used for support may be tested by standing on other planks that are not rotten:

{{quote|"We can conduct certain tests assuming that certain [[memeplex]]es (e.g., science, logic, rationality) are foundational, but at a later time we might want to bring these latter memeplexes into question too. The more comprehensively we have tested our interlocking memeplexes, the more confident we can be that we have not let a meme virus enter into our mindware..." (p. 181)}}

In this way, one might proceed to examine and revise their beliefs so as to become more rational.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2980">In [[geometry and topology]], it is a usual axiom of a [[manifold]] to be a [[Hausdorff space]]. In [[general topology]], this axiom is relaxed, and one studies '''non-Hausdorff manifolds''': spaces [[locally homeomorphic]] to [[Euclidean space]], but not necessarily Hausdorff.

==Examples==

===Line with two origins===
The most familiar non-Hausdorff manifold is the '''line with two origins''', or '''bug-eyed line'''.

This is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of two copies of the real line
:'''R''' × {''a''} and '''R''' × {''b''}
with the [[equivalence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;(x,a) \sim (x,b)\text{ if }x \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This space has a single point for each nonzero real number ''r'' and two points 0&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and 0&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;.  A local base of open neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;0_a&lt;/math&gt; in this space can be thought to consist of sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\{r\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\vert-\varepsilon&lt;r&lt;\varepsilon\}\cup\{0_a\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is any positive real number.  A similar description of a local base of open neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;0_b&lt;/math&gt; is possible. Thus, in this space all neighbourhoods of 0&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; intersect all neighbourhoods of 0&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;, so it is non-Hausdorff.

Further, the line with two origins does not have the homotopy type of a [[CW-complex]], or of any Hausdorff space.&lt;ref&gt;Gabard, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branching line===
Similar to the line with two origins is the '''branching line'''.

This is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of two copies of the real line
:'''R''' × {''a''} and '''R''' × {''b''}
with the [[equivalence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;(x,a) \sim (x,b)\text{ if }x &lt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This space has a single point for each negative real number ''r'' and two points &lt;math&gt;x_a, x_b&lt;/math&gt; for every non-negative number: it has a "fork" at zero.

===Etale space===
The [[etale space]] of a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]], such as the sheaf of continuous real functions over a manifold, is a manifold that is often non-Hausdorff. (The etale space is Hausdorff if it is a sheaf of functions with some sort of [[analytic continuation]] property.){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Quantum path integration (sum over histories)===
Mark F. Sharlow claims that functional spacetime of [[Path integration|path integral]] has a "branching" non-Hausdorff structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark F. Sharlow|title=The quantum mechanical path integral: toward a realistic interpretation|url=https://www.eskimo.com/~msharlow/path.pdf|date=2005–2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''occult''' (from the [[Latin]] word ''occultus'' "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden" or "knowledge of the [[paranormal]]", as opposed to [[fact]]s and "knowledge of the [[measurable]]", usually referred to as [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Underhill|Underhill, E.]] (1911). ''Mysticism,'' Meridian, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|Crabb, G.]] (1927). ''English synonyms explained, in alphabetical order, copious illustrations and examples drawn from the best writers.'' New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for certain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that [[Speculative reason|extends pure reason]] and the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.P. Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H. P.]] (1888). ''The Secret Doctrine.'' Whitefish, MT: [[Kessinger Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''[[esotericism|esoteric]]'' and ''arcane'' can also be used to describe the occult,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Heritage College Thesaurus |year=2004 |location=Boston |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural. 

The term ''occult sciences'' was used in the 16th century to refer to [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and natural [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]]. The term '''occultism''' emerged in 19th-century France, where it came to be associated with various French esoteric groups connected to [[Éliphas Lévi]] and [[Papus]], and in 1875 was introduced into the [[English language]] by the esotericist [[Helena Blavatsky]]. Throughout the 20th century, the term was used [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratically]] by a range of different authors, but by the 21st century was commonly employed – including by academic scholars of esotericism – to refer to a range of esoteric currents that developed in the mid-19th century and their descendants. ''Occultism'' is thus often used to categorise such esoteric traditions as [[Spiritualism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and [[New Age]].

Particularly since the late twentieth century, various authors have used '''the occult''' as a substantivized adjective. In this usage, "the occult" is a category into which varied beliefs and practices are placed if they are considered to fit into neither [[religion]] nor [[science]]. "The occult" in this sense is very broad, encompassing such phenomenon as beliefs in [[vampires]] or [[fairies]] and movements like [[Ufology]] and [[parapsychology]]. In that same period, ''occult'' and ''[[culture]]'' were combined to form the [[neologism]] '''occulture'''. Initially used in the [[industrial music]] scene, it was later given scholarly applications.

==Occult sciences==

The idea of "occult sciences" developed in the sixteenth century.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} The term usually encompassed three practices—[[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and [[natural magic]]—although sometimes various forms of divination were also included rather than being subsumed under natural magic.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} These were grouped together because, according to the historian of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]], "each one of them engaged in systematic investigation of nature and natural processes, in the context of theoretical frameworks that relied heavily on a belief in occult qualities, virtues or forces."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}}
Although there are areas of overlap between these different occult sciences, they are separate and in some cases practitioners of one would reject the others as being illegitimate.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}}

During the Enlightenment, the term "occult" increasingly came to be seen as intrinsically incompatible with the concept of "science".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} From that point on, use of the term "occult science(s)" implied a conscious polemic against mainstream science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}}

In his 1871 book ''Primitive Culture'', the anthropologist [[Edward Tylor]] used the term "occult science" as a synonym for "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanegraaff|first1=Wouter J.|title=Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism|date=2006|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004152311|page=716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occult qualities===
Occult qualities are properties that have no known rational explanation; in the [[Middle Ages]], for example, [[magnetism]] was considered an occult quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jbLWJPca_zoC&amp;pg=PA185 Religion, Science, and Worldview: Essays in Honor of Richard S. Westfall], Margaret J. Osler, Paul Lawrence Farber, [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-521-52493-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Occult Qualities and the Experimental Philosophy: Active Principles in Pre-Newtonian Matter Theory|first=John|last=Henry|date=1 December 1986|journal=History of Science|volume=24|issue=4|pages=335–381|doi=10.1177/007327538602400401}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aether (classical element)]] is another such element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=othGPNE56dMC&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq=occult+science+aether#v=onepage&amp;q=+aether&amp;f=false|title=Spirituality and the Occult: From the Renaissance to the Modern Age|first1=B. J.|last1=Gibbons|first2=Brian|last2=Gibbons|date=25 October 2018|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415244480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's contemporaries severely criticized his theory that gravity was effected through "action at a distance", as occult.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Buchdahl, "History of Science and Criteria of Choice" p. 232. In ''Historical and Philosophical Perspectives of Science'' v. 5 (ed. Roger H. Stuewer)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occultism==

[[File:Eliphas Levi.jpg|thumb|right|The French esotericist Éliphas Lévi popularised the term "occultism" in the 1850s. His reinterpretation of traditional esoteric ideas has led to him being called the origin of "the occultist current properly so-called".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}}]]

In the English-speaking world, prominent figures in the development of occultism included [[Helena Blavatsky]] and other figures associated with her [[Theosophical Society]], senior figures in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] like [[William Wynn Westcott]] and [[Samuel Liddell Mathers]], as well as other individuals such as [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], [[Emma Hardinge Britten]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], and—in the early twentieth century—[[Aleister Crowley]], [[Dion Fortune]], and [[Israel Regardie]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}}
By the end of the nineteenth century, occultist ideas had also spread into other parts of Europe, such as Germany, [[Austria-Hungary]], and Italy.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|pp=1365–1366}}

Unlike older forms of esotericism, occultism does not reject "scientific progress or modernity".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=88|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2008|2p=196}} Lévi had stressed the need to solve the conflict between science and religion, something that he believed could be achieved by turning to what he thought was the ancient wisdom found in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}}
The scholar of esotericism [[Antoine Faivre]] noted that rather than outright accepting "the triumph of scientism", occultists sought "an alternative solution", trying to integrate "scientific progress or modernity" with "a global vision that will serve to make the vacuousness of materialism more apparent".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}} Hanegraaff remarked that occultism was "essentially an attempt to adapt esotericism" to the "[[disenchantment|disenchanted world]]", a post-Enlightenment society in which growing scientific discovery had eradicated the "dimension of irreducible mystery" previously present. In doing so, he noted, occultism distanced itself from the "traditional esotericism" which accepted the premise of an "enchanted" world.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=423}} According to historian of esotericism [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], occultist groups typically seek "proofs and demonstrations by recourse to scientific tests or terminology".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=196}} 

Another feature of these occultists is that—unlike earlier esotericists—they often openly distanced themselves from [[Christianity]], in some cases (like that of Crowley) even adopting explicitly anti-Christian stances.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} This reflected how pervasive the influence of [[secularisation]] had been on all areas of European society.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} In rejecting Christianity, these occultists sometimes turned towards pre-Christian belief systems and embraced forms of [[Modern Paganism]], while others instead took influence from the religions of Asia, such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In various cases, certain occultists did both.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} Another characteristic of these occultists was the emphasis that they placed on "the spiritual realization of the individual", an idea that would strongly influence the twentieth-century [[New Age]] and [[Human Potential Movement]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} This spiritual realization was encouraged both through traditional Western 'occult sciences' like alchemy and ceremonial magic, but by the start of the twentieth century had also begun to include practices drawn from non-Western contexts, such as [[yoga]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}}

Although occultism is distinguished from earlier forms of esotericism, many occultists have also been involved in older esoteric currents. For instance, occultists like [[François-Charles Barlet]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]] were also [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophers]],{{efn|This theosophy, which is a Christian esoteric tradition adhered to by theosophers, is a distinct movement from Theosophy, the occultist religion adhered to by Theosophists, despite the shared name.}} adhering to the ideas of the early modern Christian thinker [[Jakob Bohme]], and seeking to integrate ideas from Bohmian theosophy and occultism.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=89}}

==Etymology==

The earliest known usage of the term "occultism" is in the [[French language]], as ''l'occultisme''. In this form it appears in A. de Lestrange's article on "Ésotérisme chrétien" that was published in [[Jean-Baptiste Richard de Randonvilliers]]' ''Dictionnaire des mots nouveaux'' ("Dictionary of new words") in 1842.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1364}} The French esotericist [[Éliphas Lévi]] then used the term in his influential book on [[ritual magic]], ''[[Dogme et rituel de la haute magie]]'', first published in 1856.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} His use of the term deliberately acknowledged earlier practices that, since the Renaissance, had been termed "occult sciences" or "occult philosophy".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}} It was from Lévi's usage of the term that it gained wider usage;{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2pp=1364–1365}} according to Faivre, Lévi was "the principal exponent of esotericism in Europe and the United States" at that time.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}}

The earliest use of the term "occultism" in the [[English language]] appears to be in "A Few Questions to 'Hiraf'", an 1875 article published in the American Spiritualist magazine, ''[[Spiritual Scientist]]''. The article had been written by [[Helena Blavatsky]], a Russian émigré living in the United States who founded the religion of Theosophy.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1365}}

Various twentieth-century writers on the subject used the term "occultism" in different ways. Some writers, such as the German philosopher [[Theodor W. Adorno]] in his "Theses Against Occultism", employed the term as a broad synonym for [[irrationality]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1367}} In his 1950 book ''L'occultisme'', [[Robert Amadou]] used the term as a synonym for [[Western esotericism|esotericism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1367}} an approach that the later scholar of esotericism Marco Pasi suggested left the term "superfluous".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1367}} Unlike Amadou, other writers saw "occultism" and "esotericism" as different, albeit related, phenomena. In the 1970s, the sociologist [[Edward Tiryakian]] distinguished between ''occultism'', which he used in reference to practices, techniques, and procedures, and ''esotericism'', which he defined as the religious or philosophical belief systems on which such practices are based.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1367}} This division was initially adopted by the early academic scholar of esotericism, Antoine Faivre, although he later abandoned it;{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} it has been rejected by most scholars who study esotericism.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1367}}

A different division was used by the [[Traditionalist school|Traditionalist]] author [[René Guénon]], who used ''esotericism'' to describe what he believed was the Traditionalist, inner teaching at the heart of most religions, while ''occultism'' was used pejoratively to describe new religions and movements that he disapproved of, such as [[Spiritualism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and various [[secret societies]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|pp=887–888}} Guénon's use of this terminology was adopted by later writers like [[Serge Hutin]] and [[Luc Benoist]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} As noted by Hanegraaff, Guénon's use of these terms are rooted in his Traditionalist beliefs and "cannot be accepted as scholarly valid".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}}

The term "occultism" derives from the older term "occult", much as the term "esotericism" derives from the older term "esoteric".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}} However, the historian of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] stated that it was important to distinguish between the meanings of the term "occult" and "occultism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=884}} Occultism is not a homogenous movement, and is widely diverse.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}}

Over the course of its history, the term "occultism" has been used in various different ways.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1364}} However, in contemporary uses, "occultism" commonly refers to forms of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]] that developed in the nineteenth century and their twentieth-century derivations.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} In a descriptive sense, it has been used to describe forms of esotericism which developed in nineteenth-century France, especially in the [[Martinism|Neo-Martinist]] environment.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} According to the historian of esotericism [[Antoine Faivre]], it is with the esotericist [[Éliphas Lévi]] that "the occultist current properly so-called" first appears.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}} Other prominent French esotericists involved in developing occultism included [[Papus]], [[Stanislas de Guaita]], [[Joséphin Péladan]], [[Georges-Albert Puyou de Pouvourville]], and [[Jean Bricaud]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}}

===Etic uses of the term===
{{See also|Emic and etic}}
[[File:Wouter Hanegraaff 2006 Alchemy Conference.jpg|thumb|right|In the 1990s, the Dutch scholar Wouter Hanegraaff put forward a new definition of "occultism" for scholarly uses]]

In the mid-1990s, a new definition of "occultism" was put forth by Hanegraaff.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|pp=1367–1368}} According to Hanegraaff, the term "occultism" can be used not only for the nineteenth-century groups which openly self-described using that term, but can also be used in reference to "the ''type'' of esotericism that they represent".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} 
Seeking to define "occultism" so that the term would be suitable "as an [[wikt:etic#Adjective|etic]] category" for scholars, Hanegraaff devised the following definition: "a category in the study of religions, which comprises ''all attempts by esotericists to come to terms with a disenchanted world or, alternatively, by people in general to make sense of esotericism from the perspective of a disenchanted secular world''".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=422}} Hanegraaff noted that this etic usage of the term would be independent of [[wikt:emic#Adjective|emic]] usages of the term employed by occultists and other esotericists themselves.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=422}} 

In this definition, "occultism" covers many esoteric currents that have developed from the mid-nineteenth century onward, including Spiritualism, Theosophy, the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and the [[New Age]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} Employing this etic understanding of "occultism", Hanegraaff argued that its development could begin to be seen in the work of the Swedish esotericist [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and in the [[Mesmerism|Mesmerist]] movement of the eighteenth century, although added that occultism only emerged in "fully-developed form" as Spiritualism, a movement that developed in the United States during the mid-nineteenth century.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=423}}

Pasi suggested that the use of Hanegraaff's definition might cause confusion by presenting a group of nineteenth-century esotericists who called themselves "occultists" as just one part of a broader category of esotericists whom scholars would call "occultists".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1368}}

===The Occult===

The term "occult" has also been used as a [[substantivized adjective]] as "the occult", a term that has been particularly widely used among journalists and [[sociology|sociologists]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} This term was popularised by the publication of [[Colin Wilson]]'s 1971 book ''The Occult''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}}
This term has been used as an "intellectual waste-basket" into which a wide array of beliefs and practices have been placed because they do not fit readily into the categories of [[religion]] or [[science]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} According to Hanegraaff, "the occult" is a category into which gets placed a range of beliefs from "spirits or fairies to parapsychological experiments, from UFO-abductions to Oriental mysticism, from vampire legends to channeling, and so on".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}}

===Occulture===

The neologism "occulture" was used within the [[industrial music]] scene of the late twentieth century, and was probably coined by one of its central figures, the musician and occultist [[Genesis P-Orridge]].{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=124}}
It was in this scene that the scholar of religion Christopher Partridge encountered the term.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=124}}
Partridge used the term in an academic sense. He stated that occulture was "the new spiritual environment in the West; the reservoir feeding new spiritual springs; the soil in which new spiritualities are growing".{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=4}}

'''Quantum healing'''  is a [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] mixture of ideas purported to draw on [[quantum mechanics]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[neurophysiology]] that asserts that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing. There are a number of different versions, which allude to various quantum ideas including [[wave particle duality]] and [[virtual particles]], and more generally "[[energy (esotericism)|energy]]" and [[vibration]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Alexander Dunlop |url=http://spiritualnutrition.org/quantum-healing-vibrations |title=Quantum Healing: Transforming Who You Are - Spiritual Life Coaching |publisher=Spiritualnutrition.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229175240/http://spiritualnutrition.org/quantum-healing-vibrations |archive-date=2012-12-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum healing is a form of [[alternative medicine]].

The term was coined by [[Deepak Chopra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Work of Andrew Weil and Deepak Chopra-Two Holistic Health/New Age Gurus: A Critique of the Holistic Health/New Age Movements|doi=10.1525/maq.2003.17.2.233}}&lt;/ref&gt; His discussions of quantum healing have been characterised as [[technobabble]] - "incoherent babbling strewn with scientific terms"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/05/15/scientist-why-deepak-chopra-is-driving-me-crazy/ |title=Scientist: Why Deepak Chopra is driving me crazy |last=Strauss |first=Valerie |date=2015-05-15 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-05-19 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "drives crazy people who actually understand physics"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/23/change-your-life-pseudoscience |title=This column will change your life: pseudoscience |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |date=2012-11-23 |access-date=2018-05-19 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "redefining Wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2009/12/01/deepak_chopra_redefining_wrong.html |title=Deepak Chopra: redefining "wrong" |last=Plait |first=Phil |date=2009-12-01 |work=Slate |access-date=2018-05-19 |language=en-US |issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantum healing has a number of vocal followers, but is widely regarded as being nonsensical by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/05/quantum_consciousness_physics_and_neuroscience_do_not_explain_one_another.html|title=Quantum and Consciousness Often Mean Nonsense|last=Francis|first=Matthew R.|date=2014-05-29|work=Slate|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main criticism revolves around its systematic misinterpretations of modern [[physics]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox |first=Brian |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/02/20/why-quantum-theory-is-so-misunderstood/ |title=Why Quantum Theory Is So Misunderstood - Speakeasy - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially of the fact that [[macroscopic]] objects (such as the human body or individual cells) are much too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like [[quantum interference|interference]] and [[wave function collapse]]. Most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely philosophical, omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes [[quantum electrodynamics]] possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aske-skeptics.org.uk/magic_of_quantum_physics.html |title='Magic' of Quantum Physics |publisher=Aske-skeptics.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] argues that misuse of the word "quantum", such as its use in ''quantum healing'', has a negative effect on [[society]] as it undermines genuine science and discourages people from engaging with conventional medicine.  He states that "for some scientists, the unfortunate distortion and misappropriation of scientific ideas that often accompanies their integration into popular culture is an unacceptable price to pay."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Examples of events or groups==
{{prose|date=May 2010}}
* The Jewish concept of a [[mitzvah]] is used colloquially to mean a good deed or an act of kindness. Judaism teaches that "the world is built on kindness". Kabbalistic teaching sees kindness as emerging from the first of seven Divine emotional attributes; to be effective kindness must be balanced and considered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inner.org/education/educ33.htm|title=A Kabbalistic Approach to Spiritual Growth: Part 33 – Lovingkindness and Judgment – GalEinai – Revealing the Torah's Inner Dimension|website=www.inner.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; while mercy is also for the undeserving. The [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]], [[Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] told reporters that to bring the [[Moshiach]] sooner, people should "add in acts of goodness and kindness".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/livingtorah/player_cdo/aid/490071/jewish/Acts-of-Goodness-and-Kindness.htm and more generally, http://www.chabad.org/search/keyword_cdo/kid/10740/jewish/Chessed-Acts-of-Kindness.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Caffè sospeso]]'' is a tradition in the working-class cafés of [[Naples]] where a person who has experienced good luck financially pays for two coffees, but receives and consumes only one, the second being left until a person enquires later whether a ''sospeso'' is available.
* In 1984, [[Dobbs Ferry]] Police officer Robert Cunningham, split a winning lottery ticket with Sal's Pizzeria waitress Phyllis Penzo, netting Phyllis approx. $3M. A 1994 romantic comedy, ''[[It Could Happen to You (film)|It Could Happen to You]]'' starring [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Bridget Fonda]] was made based on this event but moving the movie's location to [[New York City]].   
* In 2006, the [[Free Hugs Campaign]] was made popular by a [[music video]] on [[YouTube]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Origin histograma raw data.png|thumb|right|200px|The two columns to the right of the left-most column in this computerized table are raw data.]]
'''Raw data''', also known as '''primary data''', is [[data]] (e.g., numbers, instrument readings, figures, etc.) collected from a source. If a scientist sets up a computerized [[thermometer]] which records the temperature of a chemical mixture in a test tube every minute, the list of temperature readings for every minute, as printed out on a spreadsheet or viewed on a computer screen is "raw data".  Raw data has not been subjected to processing, "cleaning" by researchers to remove [[outlier]]s, obvious instrument reading errors or data entry errors, or any analysis (e.g., determining [[central tendency]] aspects such as the [[arithmetic mean|average]] or [[median]] result). As well, raw data has not been subject to any other manipulation by a software program or a human researcher, analyst or technician. It is also referred to as ''primary'' data. Raw data is a relative term (see [[data]]), because even once raw data has been "cleaned" and processed by one team of researchers, another team may consider this processed data to be "raw data" for another stage of research.  Raw data can be inputted to a [[computer program]] or used in manual procedures such as analyzing [[statistics]] from a [[statistical survey|survey]]. The term "raw data" can refer to the [[Binary number|binary]] data on electronic storage devices, such as hard disk drives (also referred to as "low-level data").

== Generating data ==
Data has two ways of being created or generated. The first is what is called 'captured data',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Data Revolution|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|publisher=Sage|year=2014|isbn=|location=United States|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is found through purposeful investigation or analysis. The second is called 'exhaust data',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is gathered usually by machines or terminals as a secondary function. For example, cash registers, smartphones, and speedometers serve a main function but may collect data as a secondary task. Exhaustive data is usually too large or of little use to process and becomes 'transient'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or thrown away.

==Examples==
In [[computing]], raw data may have the following attributes: it may possibly contain human, machine, or instrument errors, it may not be validated; it might be in different areen ([[colloquial]]) formats; [[Code|uncoded]] or unformatted; or some entries might be "suspect" (e.g., [[outlier]]s), requiring [[confirmation]] or [[citation]]. For example, a data input sheet might contain dates as raw data in many forms: "31st January 1999", "31/01/1999", "31/1/99", "31 Jan", or "today". Once captured, this raw data may be [[Data processing|processed]] stored as a normalized format, perhaps a [[Julian date]], to make it easier for computers and humans to interpret during later processing. Raw data (sometimes colloquially called "sourcey" data or "eggy" data, the latter a reference to the data being "uncooked", that is, "unprocessed", like a raw [[egg]]) are the data input to processing. A distinction is  made between ''data'' and ''information'', to the effect that information is the ''end'' product of ''data'' processing. Raw data that has undergone processing are sometimes referred to as "cooked" data in a colloquial sense.{{dubious|date=September 2016}}  Although raw data has the potential to be transformed into "[[information]],"  extraction, organization, analysis and formatting for presentation are required before raw data can be transformed into usable information.

For example, a [[point-of-sale terminal]] (POS terminal, a computerized [[cash register]]) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, this list of grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a [[software program]] or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a [[calculator]], this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total sales per customer or the average expenditure per day of the week by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times.  Such ''information'' could then become ''data'' for further processing, for example as part of a predictive [[marketing]] campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a [[database]], which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways.

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] (inventor of the [[World Wide Web]]) argues that sharing raw data is important for society.  [http://www.w3.org/2009/Talks/0204-ted-tbl/#(34) Inspired] by [http://blog.okfn.org/2007/11/07/give-us-the-data-raw-and-give-it-to-us-now/ a post] by [[Rufus Pollock]] of the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] his call to action is [http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html "Raw Data Now"], meaning that everyone should demand that governments and businesses share the data they collect as raw data. He points out that "data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives… because somebody takes the data and does something with it." To Berners-Lee, it is essentially from this sharing of raw data, that advances in science will emerge. Advocates of [[open data]] argue that once citizens and civil society organizations have access to data from businesses and governments, it will enable citizens and NGOs to do their ''own'' analysis of the data, which can empower people and civil society. For example, a government may claim that its policies are reducing the [[unemployment rate]], but a [[poverty]] advocacy group may be able to have its staff [[econometrics|econometricians]] do their own analysis of the raw data, which may lead this group to draw different conclusions about the data set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35216">A '''Swiss-system tournament''' is a non-eliminating [[tournament]] format which features a set number of rounds of competition, but considerably fewer than in a [[round-robin tournament]]. In a Swiss tournament, each competitor (team or individual) does not play every other. Competitors meet one-to-one in each round and are paired using a set of rules designed to ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but not the same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds. All competitors play in each round unless there is an odd number of players.

A Swiss system is used for competitions where the number of entrants is considered too large for a full round-robin to be feasible, and eliminating any competitors before the end of the tournament is undesirable.&lt;ref name="chess.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess.about.com/od/rulesofchess/a/What-Is-The-Swiss-System.htm |title=What is the Swiss System? |publisher=Chess.about.com |date=2013-11-13 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Round-robin pairings are suitable for a small number of competitors and rounds, as most or all players will play each other; the underlying assumption is that the player who has played all possible opponents and ends with the highest score must be the winner.  Knockout, or elimination, pairings rapidly reduces the number of competitors, but may not necessarily result in the best possible competitor winning, as good competitors might have a bad day or eliminate and exhaust each other if they meet in early rounds. Swiss systems intend to provide a clear winner with a limited number of rounds and a potentially unlimited number of opponents. A Swiss system draw should result in a clear winner, without having to play all opponents as in round robin, and without a single bad result terminating participation.

The first tournament of this type was a chess tournament in [[Zurich]] in 1895, hence the name "Swiss system".&lt;ref name="chess.about.com" /&gt;
Swiss systems are commonly used in [[chess]]&lt;ref name="chess.about.com" /&gt;, [[Go (game)|Go]]&lt;ref name="senseis_swisspairing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?SwissPairing |title=Swiss Pairing |publisher=Sensei's Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgo.org/standard-aga-tournament-protocols|title=Standard AGA Tournament Protocols|publisher=American Go Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogofed.org/egf/toursysrules.htm|title=EGF Tournament System Rules|publisher=European Go Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Duplicate bridge|bridge]], ''[[Scrabble]]'', [[backgammon]], and many other games.

==Pairing procedure==
The first round is either drawn at [[random]] or seeded according to some prior order, such as [[ELO rating system|rating]] (in chess) or recent performance. All participants then proceed to the next round in which winners are pitted against winners, losers are pitted against losers, and so on. In subsequent rounds, each competitor faces an opponent with the same, or almost the same, cumulative score. No player is paired up with the same opponent twice. In [[chess]] the pairing rules try to ensure that each player plays an equal number of games with white and black, alternate colors in each round being the most preferable, and a particular effort is made not to assign a player the same color three times in a row.&lt;ref name="scichess.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scichess.org/faq/swiss.html |title=Swiss System vs Round Robin |publisher=Scichess.org |accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During all but the first round, competitors are paired based on approximately how well (or poorly) they have performed so far. In the first round, competitors are paired either randomly or according to some pattern that has been found to serve a given game or sport well. If it is desired for top-ranked participants to meet in the last rounds, the pattern must start them in different brackets, just the same as is done in seeding of pre-ranked players for a single elimination tournament. In subsequent rounds, competitors are sorted according to their cumulative scores and are assigned opponents with the same or similar score up to that point. Some adjustments may be made to assure that no two players ever oppose each other twice, or to even out advantages a player may have due to chance.

The detailed pairing rules are different in different variations of Swiss system. They may be quite complicated, so to make the task easier, quicker and more accurate,  the tournament organizer often uses a computer program to do the pairing.

In chess, a specific pairing rule, called "Dutch system" by FIDE, is often implied when the term "Swiss" is used. The Monrad system for pairing is commonly used in chess in Denmark and Norway, as well as in other sports worldwide. These two systems are outlined below.

===Dutch system===
The players are divided into groups, based on their score. Within each group with the same score, players are ranked, based on rating or some other criteria. Subject to the other pairing rules, the top half is then paired with the bottom half. For instance, if there are eight players in a score group, number 1 is paired with number 5, number 2 is paired with number 6 and so on. Modifications are then made to prevent competitors from meeting each other twice, and to balance colors  (in chess).&lt;ref name="scichess.org" /&gt; Players are sorted by score groups, ranked and top half paired to bottom half.  It is suggested{{By whom|date=September 2018}} that for smaller fields score groups are not a suitable approach.

===Monrad system===
The players are first ranked based on their score, then on their starting number (which can be random or based on seeding). Then #1 meets #2, #3 meets #4 etc., with modifications made to ensure that other rules are adhered to. Players are sorted by score (not score groups) and original rank, then each player paired to the next opponent, typically excluding repeats.  This is more suitable for smaller numbers of competitors.

The Monrad system used in chess in Denmark is quite simple, with players initially ranked at random, and pairings modified only to avoid players meeting each other twice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsu.dk/dsu-dok/skakhand/2007/sh4-14-2.pdf Regulations for Monrad system as used in Denmark] (See section 4.10.1) {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian system has an optional seeding system for the first round pairings, and within a score group, the pairing algorithm endeavours to give players alternating colors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjakk.no/nsf/monradsystem_index.html Regulations for Monrad system as used in Norway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706122207/http://www.sjakk.no/nsf/monradsystem_index.html |date=2007-07-06 }} {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This pairing system is widely used in Scrabble and it's known as the King Of The Hill format. It's considered to be distinct from the Swiss pairing system.

==Final scores and tie-breaking==
There is a fixed number of rounds. After the last round, players are ranked by their score. If this is tied then a tie-break score, such as the sum of all their opponents' scores ([[Buchholz chess rating]]), can be used: see [[Tie-breaking in Swiss system tournaments]].

==Analysis, advantages, and disadvantages==
Assuming no drawn games, determining a clear winner (and, incidentally, a clear loser) would require the same number of rounds as a [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout tournament]], that is the [[binary logarithm]] of the number of players rounded up. Thus three rounds can handle eight players, four rounds can handle sixteen players and so on. If fewer than this minimum number of rounds are played, it can happen that two or more players finish the tournament with a perfect score, having won all their games but never faced each other.

Compared to a knockout tournament, a Swiss system has the advantage of not eliminating anyone: so a player who enters the tournament knows that they can play in all the rounds, regardless of how well they do. The only exception is that one player is left over when there is an odd number of players. The player left over receives a [[bye (sports)|bye]]: they do not play that round but are usually awarded the same number of points as for winning a game (e.g. 1 point for a chess tournament). The player is reintroduced in the next round and will not receive another bye.

Another advantage compared to knockout tournaments is that the final ranking gives some indication of the relative strengths of all contestants, not just the winner of the tournament. As an example, the losing finalist in a knockout tournament may not be the second best contestant; that might have been any of the contestants defeated by the eventual tournament winner in earlier rounds.

In a Swiss system tournament, sometimes a player has such a great lead that by the last round he is assured of winning the tournament even if he loses the last game. This has some disadvantages. First, a Swiss-system tournament does not always end with the exciting [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of a knockout final. Second, while the outcome of the final game has no bearing on first place, the first place player can decide who wins second or third prize. In the 1995 All-Stars tournament in Scrabble, tournament directors made the decision to pair [[David Gibson (Scrabble)|David Gibson]], who had by then clinched first place, with the highest ranked player who could not win a prize so that second and third ranked players could compete between themselves for the final placements. The Gibson Rule is optional in Scrabble tournaments as players at smaller tournaments may still have an incentive to win their last game to improve their overall rating. Players may also be Gibsonized if they have clinched a spot in the next round, and can be paired with the highest ranked player who cannot possibly qualify for the next round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.scrabbleplayers.org/wiki/images/2/20/Dirman-20140520.pdf|title=NASPA Director Manual|last=|first=|publisher=North American Word Game Players Association|year=2013|isbn=|location=Dallas, TX|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A disadvantage compared to an all-play-all tournament is that, while the players finishing near the top are typically those with the best performances, and those finishing near the bottom are those with the worst performances, the players in the middle tend to be jumbled with little meaningful order. For example, at the 2010 European Chess Championship, players scoring 5½/11 had performance ratings ranging from to 2189 to 2559; such a difference suggests that the stronger-performing player would score more than 90% against the weaker-performing one. One player with a 2441 performance rating scored two and a half points better than one performing at 2518.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chess-results.com/tnr29567.aspx?art=1&amp;rd=11&amp;lan=1&amp;turdet=YES&amp;flag=30&amp;m=-1&amp;wi=1000&amp;zeilen=99999 chess results]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Swiss system tournaments, the later rounds have a much greater bearing on the final results than the earlier rounds. In fact, it can even be an advantage to have a poor start to a Swiss system tournament because the player is then more likely to be paired against weaker opposition. Chess players colloquially refer to this as a “[[Swiss Gambit#Other uses|Swiss Gambit]]”.

The system is used for selection to the English national [[Eight-ball|pool]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.org.uk/event_home.php?type=Trials%2520Format.php_GEN&amp;heading=England%2520Trials&amp;event=england&amp;year=2016|title=ENGLISH POOL ASSOCIATION|website=www.epa.org.uk|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-four players start the tournament and after six rounds, the top player will qualify as they will be unbeaten. The remaining seven places are decided after a series of round robins and play-offs.

Compared with a [[round-robin tournament]], a Swiss can handle many players without requiring an impractical number of rounds. An [[Single-elimination tournament|elimination tournament]] is better suited to a situation in which only a limited number of games may be played at once, e.g. in [[tennis]]. In a Swiss system, all players can be playing at the same time.

==Variations of Swiss systems==

===Accelerated pairings===
The method of '''accelerated pairings''' also known as '''accelerated Swiss'''&lt;ref name="Barden1980p.150"&gt;{{citation|author=Barden, Leonard|year=1980|title=Play better CHESS with Leonard Barden|publisher=Octopus Books Limited|isbn=0-7064-0967-1|page=150|authorlink=Leonard Barden}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in some large tournaments with more than the optimal number of players for the number of rounds.  This method pairs top players more quickly than the standard method in the opening rounds&lt;ref name="Barden1980p.150"/&gt; and has the effect of reducing the number of players with perfect scores more rapidly (by approximately a factor of 2 after two rounds).&lt;ref name="Just2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=U.S. Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess| last=Just| first=Tim|author2=Burg, Daniel | year=2003| pages=130–31| publisher=McKay| isbn=0-8129-3559-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first two rounds, players who started in the top half have one point added to their score for pairing purposes only.  Then the first two rounds are paired normally, taking this ''added score'' into account.  In effect, in the first round the top quarter plays the second quarter and the third quarter plays the fourth quarter.  Most of the players in the first and third quarters should win the first round.  Assuming this is approximately the case, in effect for the second round the top eighth plays the second eighth, the second quarter plays the third quarter and the seventh eighth plays the bottom eighth.  That is, in the second round, winners in the top half play each other, losers in the bottom half play each other, and losers in the top half play winners in the bottom half (for the most part).  After two rounds, about ⅛ of the players will have a perfect score, instead of ¼.  After the second round, the standard pairing method is used (without the added point for the players who started in the top half).

As a comparison between the standard Swiss system and the accelerated pairings, consider a tournament with eight players, ranked #1 through #8.  Assume that the higher-ranked player always wins.

'''Standard Swiss system'''

 Round 1:
 #1 plays #5, #1 wins
 #2 plays #6, #2 wins
 #3 plays #7, #3 wins
 #4 plays #8, #4 wins

 Round 2:
 #1 plays #3, #1 wins
 #2 plays #4, #2 wins
 #5 plays #7, #5 wins
 #6 plays #8, #6 wins

After two rounds, the standings are:&lt;br&gt;
'''1:''' 2-0&lt;br&gt;
'''2:''' 2-0&lt;br&gt;
'''3:''' 1-1&lt;br&gt;
'''4:''' 1-1&lt;br&gt;
'''5:''' 1-1&lt;br&gt;
'''6:''' 1-1&lt;br&gt;
'''7:''' 0-2&lt;br&gt;
'''8:''' 0-2

'''Accelerated pairings'''

 Round 1:
 #1 plays #3, #1 wins
 #2 plays #4, #2 wins
 #5 plays #7, #5 wins
 #6 plays #8, #6 wins

 Round 2:
 #1 plays #2, #1 wins
 #3 plays #5, #3 wins
 #4 plays #6, #4 wins
 #7 plays #8, #7 wins

After two rounds, the standings are:&lt;br&gt;
'''1:''' 2-0 &lt;br&gt;
'''2:''' 1-1 &lt;br&gt;
'''3:''' 1-1 &lt;br&gt;
'''4:''' 1-1 &lt;br&gt;
'''5:''' 1-1 &lt;br&gt;
'''6:''' 1-1 &lt;br&gt;
'''7:''' 1-1 &lt;br&gt;
'''8:''' 0-2

Accelerated pairings do not ''guarantee'' that fewer players will have a perfect score. In round 2, if #5 and #6 score upset wins against #3 and #4, and there is a decisive result between #1 and #2, there will be three players with a perfect 2-0 score.

===Danish system===
The Danish system works in principle like a Monrad system, only without the restriction that no players can meet for a second time, so it is always #1 vs. #2, #3 vs. #4 etc.

Bridge team tournaments, if not played as "Round Robin", usually start with the Swiss system to make sure that the same teams would not play against each other frequently, but in the last one or two rounds there is a switch to the Danish system, especially to allow the first two ranked teams to battle against each other for the victory, even if they have met before during the tournament.

===Grand Prix system===
In a few tournaments which run over a long period of time, such as a tournament with one round every week for three months, the Grand Prix system can be used. A player's final score is based on his best results (e.g. best ten results out of the twelve rounds). Players are not required to play in every round, they may enter or drop out of the tournament at any time. Indeed, they may decide to play only one game if they wish to, although if a player wants to get a [[prize]] they need to play more rounds to accumulate points. The tournament therefore includes players who want to go for a prize and play several rounds as well as players who only want to play an off game. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/nascars-new-points-system-rewards-winning-012611{{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McMahon system===
A variant known as the '''[[McMahon system tournament]]''' is the established way in which [[Europe]]an [[Go (game)|Go]] tournaments are run. This differs mainly in that players have a skill ranking prior to the start of the tournament which determines their initial pairing in contrast to the basic Swiss-system approach where all players start at the same skill ranking. The McMahon system reduces the probability of a very strong team meeting a very weak team in the initial rounds. It is named for [[Lee E. McMahon]] (1931&amp;ndash;1989) of [[Bell Labs]].

===Amalfi system===
A tournament system in Italy. It is similar to the Swiss System, but doesn't split players based on their score. Before pairing any round, players are listed for decreasing score / decreasing rating, and the opponent of the first player in the list is the player following him by a number of positions equal to the number of remaining rounds, and so on for the other players. As consequence of this, the difference in rating between opponents at the first round is not so big (as for the accelerated systems), and ideally the "big match" between the first and the second one should occur at the last round, no matter how many players and rounds are in the tournament.

==Application of the Swiss system==

===Badminton===
[[International Student Badminton Tournament]]s depend on the Swiss ladder system to ensure its players get as many challenging matches as possible over the course of the [[badminton]] tournament. The tournaments are meant to promote both the sport and the social aspect of the game, hence its results are not connected to external rankings. Beforehand, players can enroll in three or four categories designed to separate national, regional and recreational players. Players of different clubs are coupled to form doubles and mixed doubles. The starting positions on each ladder (singles, doubles and mixed doubles) are random. Unlike in official matches a 1-1 draw is possible and games are usually not extended after 21 is reached in order to maximise the number of played matches.

===Hardcourt bike polo===
The Swiss-system has been used in [[Hardcourt Bike Polo]]. Currently [http://www.podiumbikepolo.com/ Podium] is the most frequently used for seeding a two-day tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For people who take swiss rounds too seriously...|url=https://leagueofbikepolo.com/forum/organizing-polo/2012/06/05/for-people-who-take-swiss-rounds-too-seriously|website=League of Bike Polo|accessdate=30 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326060242/http://leagueofbikepolo.com/forum/organizing-polo/2012/06/05/for-people-who-take-swiss-rounds-too-seriously|archive-date=2016-03-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site allows you to track games and can be viewed from mobile devices at the tournaments or across the world.

===Bridge===
The Swiss system is used in some [[Duplicate bridge|bridge]] tournament events, usually [[Duplicate bridge#Teams game|team]] matches where a team consists of four to six players (two to three pairs). In each round, one team plays against another team for several hands, with the North/South pair(s) of one team playing against the East/West pair(s) of the other team. The same hands are played at each table, and the results at the two (or more) tables are compared using the [[Bridge scoring#International Match Point scoring|International Match Point]] (IMP) scoring system. The difference between the total IMPs scored by the two teams in that round is converted by a formula to [[Contract bridge glossary#victory|Victory Points]] (VPs), with typically 20 VPs shared between the two teams, depending on the IMPs difference. In the first round, teams are usually paired randomly however pairings can be based on other criteria. In subsequent rounds, the teams are ranked in order of the number of VPs they have accumulated in previous rounds, and the top team plays the second team, the third team plays the fourth team, etc., subject to the proviso that teams do not play each other twice. In the last one or two rounds there may be a switch to the Danish system to make sure that each team plays the final match according to its actual ranking, even if this results in some teams playing against an opponent a second time.

===Chess===
In chess, each player is pitted against another player who has done as well (or as poorly) as he or she has done. The first round is either drawn at random or seeded according to rating. Players who win receive a point, those who draw receive half a point and losers receive no points. Win, lose or draw, all players proceed to the next round where winners are pitted against winners, losers are pitted against losers and so on. In subsequent rounds, players face opponents with the same (or almost the same) score. No player is paired up against the same opponent twice, however. In chess, the rules also try to ensure that each player plays an equal number of games with white and black. Alternating colors in each round is the most preferable and the same color is never repeated three times in a row. Players with the same score are ideally ranked according to rating. Then the top half is paired with the bottom half. For instance, if there are eight players in a score group, number 1 is paired with number 5, number 2 is paired with number 6 and so on. Modifications are then made to balance colors and prevent players from meeting each other twice.&lt;ref name="chess.about.com"/&gt; The first national event in the United States to use the Swiss system was in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1945; and the first Chess Olympiad using it was held in [[Haifa]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olimpbase.org/1976/1976in.html|title=OlimpBase :: 22nd Chess Olympiad, Haifa 1976, information|website=www.olimpbase.org|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chess, the terms Swiss and Monrad are both used, and denote systems with different pairing algorithms. The Monrad pairing system is commonly used in Denmark and Norway, while most of the rest of the world uses one of the Swiss systems defined by [[FIDE]]. In most other sports, only one format is used, and is known either as Monrad or Swiss.

===Curling===

[[Curling]] uses a variation called the Schenkel system.

Like a Swiss tournament, the Schenkel ensures that after the first round teams will play against teams with similar levels of success so far. That means that after the first round the pairs for the second round would be first-ranked team against the second, third against fourth, and so on.

In a true Swiss-style tournament all teams play in one group. However, in a curling arena there are a limited number of curling sheets available at any one time. Therefore, the teams are usually divided into groups, and the groups are rearranged after a round or two.

The criteria used for ranking are, in order:
* points won (2 points for victory in a game, 1 point for a tie, none for a loss)
* total ends won so far
* total stone-points scored
* stone ratio (stone-points scored minus stone-points conceded)

===Debate tabs===
[[British Parliamentary Style]] debate competitions have four rather than two teams in each debate.  The preliminary round for many such competitions, including the [[World Universities Debating Championship]], ranks teams by a modified form of Swiss tournament, usually called a '''tab'''.  "Tab" also denotes to the software used for scheduling of rounds and [[tabulation]] of results.  Teams are ranked from first to fourth in each debate and awarded from three down to zero points. Teams with similar points totals are grouped off for each successive round. Just as chess Swiss tournaments are arranged to ensure players have a balance of playing with black pieces and white pieces, so too debate tournaments attempt to provide teams with a balance of places in the speaking order (i.e. Opening Government, Opening Opposition, Closing Government, and Closing Opposition).  With four competitors rather than two, significantly greater compromise is required to balance the ideal requirements of, on the one hand, a team not meeting the same opponent twice and, on the other hand, a team having a balanced mix of places in the running order.

===Esports===
Mind Sports South Africa, the national body for [[eSports]] in [[South Africa]], uses a Swiss system for all its tournaments.{{cn|date=April 2017}} For its Swiss implementations, players receive three points for a win and only one for a draw and no player can play against another player more than once. There is the further provision that no player may play against another player from the same club in the first round as long as no one club has 40% of the entrants.

On June 1, 2016 [[Electronic Sports League|ESL]] announced &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.esl-one.com/csgo/cologne-2016/news/introducing-the-swiss-format-and-schedule-for-the-esl-one-cologne-offline-qualifier/|title=ESL One Cologne 2016|last=ESL|website=ESL One|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be using the Swiss system for its [[ESL One Cologne 2016]] offline qualifier tournament. ELEAGUE also adopted this system for the ELEAGUE Major 2017 qualifier and the [[ELEAGUE Major 2017|ELEAGUE Major]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/burbunny/status/806528477583253505|title=christina alejandre on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format was also used for the ''[[Dota 2]]'' [[Kiev Major]] tournament in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swiss Format Summary|url=http://www.thekievmajor.com/swiss-format/|website=thekievmajor.com|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]] Open Division also makes use of the Swiss system, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faceit.com/en/championship/7a5bd563-23cb-4c2a-994a-b46d85acbd46/Overwatch%20Open%20Division%20%232/rules|title=faceit Overwatch Open Division Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Hearthstone]] Global Games tournament&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/k6/K6FDG9CSI8E51523578073853.pdf|title=2018 Hearthstone Global Games Official Competition Rules|website=Battle.net|access-date=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Go===
Relatively few [[Go (game)|Go]] tournaments use the Swiss system.  Most amateur Go tournaments, at least in Europe and America, now use the [[McMahon system tournament|McMahon system]] instead. Swiss-system tournaments must start with very unequal matches in the early rounds—"slaughter pairing" is the name of one initial pattern used—if the Swiss pairing rules applied subsequently are to allow the top players to meet in the latest rounds. The McMahon system is designed to give all players games against similarly skilled players all along, and to produce final standings that more accurately reflect the true current skill levels of players.&lt;ref name="senseis_swisspairing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="senseis sonne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?SonnebornBerger |title=Sonneborn Berger |publisher=senseis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Magic: the Gathering''===
The [[DCI (Wizards of the Coast)|DCI]], the tournament sanctioning body for the card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', uses a Swiss system for most tournaments. Unlike with other Swiss implementations, players receive [[three points for a win]] and only one for a draw. After sufficient rounds to mathematically ensure that players with a record of one loss or better will be ranked in the top eight players, typically the top eight players advance to a [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] stage, with several statistics used as tie-breakers. The minimum number of players to top 8 are 16 or more, and top 4 with 8 players or more, and top 2 (if necessary) if they are 4 or more players.&lt;ref name="DCI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/TOHndBk_Feb_5_07.pdf|title=DCI Tournament Organizer Handbook|accessdate=2007-04-26|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|year=2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pokémon===
Tournaments in the Pokémon Trading Card Game and Video Game Championships use a combination of the Swiss system and single-elimination.  The tournament begins as a Swiss-system tournament.  At the end of the Swiss rounds, the top players advance to a single-elimination tournament (also known as the Top Cut).  In previous years, the Top Cut would include between 12.5 and 25 percent of the original number of participants (e.g. if there were 64 to 127 players, there would be a Top 16).

As of the 2013-2014 season, Swiss rounds in City, State, Regional, National, and World Championships are played best-of-three, with a 50-minute plus three-turn time limit.  Ties were introduced into the Swiss round portion of the tournaments in the 2013-2014 season for the first time since 2002-2003. A win is worth 3 match points, a tie is worth 1 match point, and a loss is worth 0 match points.

Top Cut rounds are played best-of-three, with a 75-minute plus three-turn time limit.

Also, the Regional and National Championships were contested as two-day Swiss tournaments, where only the top 32 players from Day One would continue in another Swiss tournament in Day Two, prior to a Top 8.

League Challenge and Pre-Release tournaments are played solely as a Swiss system.  Local tournaments may or may not have a Top Cut.

The tiebreakers are in the order of Opponents' Win Percentage, Opponents' Opponents' Win Percentage, Head to Head, and Standing of Last Opponent.  The fourth tiebreaker will always result in the tie being broken.

===Scrabble===
In some [[Scrabble]] tournaments, a system known variously as "modified Swiss", "Portland Swiss", "Fontes Swiss" or "speed pairing" is used, whereby first players are placed in groups of four, and play three rounds of round-robin play, and subsequently are paired as in Swiss pairing, but using the standings as of the second to last round, rather than the last round.  This has the advantage of allowing the tournament directors to already know who plays whom by the time given players are finished with a round, rather than making the players wait until all players have finished playing a given round before being able to start the time-consuming pairing process.

Commonly used in Australia, and now in many other countries, is a system known as "Australian Draw". Whereby each round is paired using a normal #1 plays #2, #3 plays #4, etc. except that repeat pairings within a selected range of previous games is forbidden. Often, for shorter tournaments the selected range will be since the very first round of the tournament, thus never having a repeat pairing for the entire tournament. For longer tournaments it is also common to have the first N rounds use the Australian Draw system, and followed by one or more "King Of the Hill" rounds. "King Of the Hill" is a strict #1 plays #2, #3 plays #4, etc. with no regard to previous pairings, thus unlimited repeat pairings are allowed.

Although labelled as 'Austrialian Version of Swiss Pairing' it is more akin to the King Of The Hill pairing system, than to the Swiss - Dutch system. As in chess, when the term Swiss Pairing is used, it's usually a reference to the Swiss Dutch System.

===Ultimate Frisbee===
[https://web.archive.org/web/20090420201259/http://www.windmillwindup.com/ Windmill Windup], a three-day yearly [[Ultimate Frisbee]] tournament held in Amsterdam, was the first event in ultimate to introduce the Swiss draw system into the sport in 2005. In later years, many other tournaments started using this format, like Belgium's G-spot, Wisconsin Swiss and many others.
For each round, teams earn victory points based on the score difference of their win (or loss). In this way, also a team clearly losing a game is encouraged to fight for every point in order to get more victory points. After each round, teams are ranked according to their victory points. Ties are broken by considering the sum of the current victory points of their opponents. In the next round, neighboring teams in the ranking play each other. In case they have played each other in a previous round, adjustments to the rankings are made. After five rounds of Swiss draw, the top 8 teams play three playoff rounds to determine the final placement of the teams. All other teams continue with the Swiss draw in the remaining rounds.

===Wargames===
{{ Main article|Wargaming}}
The [[International Wargames Federation]], the international body for wargames, uses a Swiss system for all its tournaments. For its Swiss implementations, players receive three points for a win and only one for a draw and no player can play against another player more than once. There is the further proviso that no player may play against another player from the same country in the first round as long as no one country has 40% of the entrants. For national championships such rule is amended to read that no player can play against a player from the same club in the first round as long as no one club has 40% of the entrants.

===''Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game''===
Konami Digital Entertainment of the United States uses proprietary software for their sanctioned and official tournaments. Konami Tournament Software (KTS) is what is supplied to the Tournament Organizers to run each tournament. The software utilized the Swiss system similarly to Magic: The Gathering--3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss. 

Konami's official tournament policy dictates how many rounds are played based on the number of participants. After the set number of rounds of Swiss are complete, there is generally a cut to advance in the tournament. This is then played as single-elimination until a winner is declared.

[[File:Grafica 2 ingles.svg|thumb|284x284px|Characteristic rays of the model]]
[[File:NUEVA (ingles).svg|thumb|284x284px|Overhead View of the Ten-Ray Model (Types of reflections)]]

The ten-ray model is a model applied to the transmissions in the urban area, to generate a model of ten rays typically four rays more are added to the  [[Six rays model|six rays model]], these are (&lt;math&gt;R3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R4&lt;/math&gt; bouncing on both sides of the wall); This incorporate paths from one to three reflections: specifically, there is the LOS ([[Line-of-sight propagation|Line of sight]]), GR (ground reflected), SW (single-wall reflected), DW (double-wall reflected), TW (triple-wall reflected), WG (wall-ground reflected) and GW (ground-wall reflected paths). Where each one of the paths bounces on both sides of the wall.

Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that the ten ray model simulates or can represent the  [[Radio propagation|propagation]] of signals through a [[Dielectric|dielectric]] canyon, in it which the rays that travel from a [[Transmitter|transmitter]]   point to a receiver point bounce many times.

As example for this model it is assume: a rectilinear free space with two walls, one upper and the other lower, from which two vertical bases are positioned at their ends, these are the transmitting and receiving [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] that it’s locate in such a way that their heights don’t surpass the limits of the top wall; Achieved this the structure acts as free space for its functioning similar to that of a dielectric canyon of signals propagation, since the rays transmitted from the transmitting antenna will collide each side of the upper and lower walls infinity of times (for this example up to 3 reflections) until reaching the receiving antenna. During the course of the rays for each reflection they suffer, part of the energy of the signal is dissipated in each reflection, normally after the third reflection of said ray its resulting component which is a retro-reflected ray is insignificant with a negligible energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wireless Communications.|last=Goldsmith|first=Andrea|publisher=Cambridge University Press, ed.|year=2005|isbn=978-0521837163|location=New York.|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Mathematical deduction ==


=== Analysis for antennas of heights different heights located in street's any point ===

For the [[mathematical modeling]] of the propagation of ten rays, One has in account a side view and this starts off modeling the two first rays (line by sight and his respective reflection), Considering that antennas have different heights, Then &lt;math&gt;h_{Tx}\neq{h_{Rx}}&lt;/math&gt;, and they have a direct distance d that separates the two antennas; The first ray is formed applying Pitágoras theorem:

: &lt;math&gt;R_0=\sqrt{d^2+(h_t-h_r)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The second ray or the reflected ray is made in a similar way to the first, but in this case the heights of the antennas to form the right angled triangle for the reflection of the height of the transmitter are added up.

: &lt;math&gt;R_0' =\sqrt{d^2+(h_t+h_r)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In the deduction of the third ray it is necessary find the angle between the direct distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and the distance of line of view &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;'''&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;'''

: &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\frac{h_t-h_r}{R_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Viewing the model with a side view, it is necessary to find a flat distance between the transmitter and receiver called  &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;d'=\sqrt{d^2-(w_{r2}-w_{t2})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we deduce the remaining height of the wall from the height of the receiver called  &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; by the similarity of triangles:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac z a =\frac{h_t}{d'}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; z =\frac{ {h_t}a }{d'}&lt;/math&gt;

By likeness of triangles we can deduce the distance from where collides the ray to wall until the perpendicular of the receiver called &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, getting:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac a d' = \frac{w_{r2}}{w_{t2}+w_{r2}} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{d'w_{r2}}{w_{t2}+w_{r2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The third ray is defined as a model of two-rays, by which is:

: &lt;math&gt;R_1=\frac{\sqrt{(h_t-h_r-z)^2+(d'-a)^2}+\sqrt{z^2+a^2}}{\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking a side view it is achieves to evidence the reflected ray that there in &lt;math&gt;R_{1}&lt;/math&gt;  and is find as following manner:

: &lt;math&gt;R_1' =\frac{\sqrt{(h_t+h_r+z)^2+(d'-a)^2}+\sqrt{(2h_r+z)^2+a^2}}{\cos\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

As exist two rays that collide once on the wall, then is find the fifth ray, equating it to the third.

: &lt;math&gt;R_2=R_1 &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, is equalized the sixth ray with the fourth ray, since they have the same characteristics.

: &lt;math&gt;R_2'=R_1'&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Grafica 3 me ingles.svg|thumb|311x311px|Side view of two transmitted beams reflected from one wall to the other side and reflected to the receiver on antennas of different heights at any point on the street.]]

To model the rays that collide with the wall twice, is used the Pythagoras theorem because of the direct distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and the sum of the distances between the receiver to each wall with double of distance of the transmitter to the wall  &lt;math&gt;w_{t2}&lt;/math&gt;, this divides on the angle formed between the direct distance and the reflected ray.

: &lt;math&gt;R_3=\frac{\sqrt{d^2+(w_{r2}+2w_{t2}+w_{r1})^2}}{\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

For the eighth ray is calculate a series of variables that allow to deduce the complete equation, which is composed by distances and heights that were found by likeness of triangles'''.'''

In first instance is take the flat distance between the wall of the second shock and the receiver:

: &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{d' w_{r1}}{w_{r2}+w_{r1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Is found the flat distance between the transmitter and the wall in the first shock.

: &lt;math&gt;h_{p2}=h_r+z_2&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y=\frac{d'w_{t2}}{w_{r2}+w_{r1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the distance between the height of the wall of the second shock with respect to the first shock, is obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;z_1=\frac{h_t(d'-(x+y))}{d'}&lt;/math&gt;

Deducing also the distance between the height of the wall of the second shock with respect to the receiver:

: &lt;math&gt;z_{2}=\frac{h_t x}{d'}&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating the height of the wall where occurs the first hit:

: &lt;math&gt;h_{p1}=h_r+z_1+z_2&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating the height of the wall where occurs the second shock:

: &lt;math&gt;h_{p2}=h_r+z_2&lt;/math&gt;

With these parameters is calculate the equation for the eighth ray:

: &lt;math&gt;R_3'=\frac{\sqrt{y^2+(h_t+h_{p1})^2}+\sqrt{(d'-(x+y))^2+(h_{p1}+h_{p2}^2}+\sqrt{x^2+(h_r+h_{p2})^2}}{\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

For the ninth ray, equation is the same as the seventh ray due to its characteristics:

: &lt;math&gt;R_4=R_3&lt;/math&gt;

For the tenth ray, the equation is the same as the eighth ray due to its reflected ray shape:

: &lt;math&gt;R_4'=R_3'&lt;/math&gt;

Is considered a signal transmitted through free space to a receiver located at a distance ''d'' from the transmitter.

Assuming there are no obstacles between the transmitter and the receiver, the signal propagates along a straight line between the two. The beam model associated with this transmission is denominated line of sight (LOS), and the signal received corresponding is called the LOS signal or beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wireless &amp; Cellular Communications Class Notes for TLEN-5510-Fall.|last=Schwengler|first=Thomas|publisher=Universidad de Colorado.|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=http://morse.colorado.edu/~tlen5510/text/classwebch3.html|quote=Chapter 3: Radio Propagation Modeling|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trajectory losses of the ten-ray model in free space is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;p_{0}(t)=\sqrt{(G_iG_R)}\frac \lambda {4\pi} \left(\frac{\exp(j2\pi R_0/{\lambda})}{R_0} + \Gamma \frac{\exp(j2\pi R_0'/{\lambda})}{R_0'}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6576">In [[multilinear algebra]], a '''reshaping''' is any bijective map between an order-''d'' [[tensor]] and an order-''k'' tensor, where&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''d''.

== Definition ==
Let ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be an ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;-dimensional vector space over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exist [[Linear map|isomorphisms of vector spaces]]

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
V_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d 
&amp; \simeq F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d} \\
&amp; \simeq F^{n_{\pi_1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_{\pi_d}} \\
&amp; \simeq F^{n_{\pi_1} n_{\pi_2}} \otimes F^{n_{\pi_3}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_{\pi_d}} \\
&amp; \simeq F^{n_{\pi_1} n_{\pi_3}} \otimes F^{n_{\pi_2}} \otimes F^{n_{\pi_4}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_{\pi_d}} \\
&amp; \,\,\,\vdots \\
&amp; \simeq F^{n_1 n_2 \ldots n_d},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi \in \mathfrak{S}_d&lt;/math&gt; is any permutation.

Via these (and other) isomorphisms, a tensor can be interpreted in several ways as an order-''k'' tensor with &lt;math&gt;k &lt; d&lt;/math&gt;. Let

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
\Pi_S : V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d &amp;\to V_{s_1} \otimes V_{s_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes V_{s_{|S|}} \\
v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_d &amp;\mapsto v_{s_1} \otimes v_{s_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes v_{s_{|S|}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

denote the projection with &lt;math&gt;
S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\} \subset [1,d]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;
S_1 \sqcup S_2 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup S_\ell = [1,d]&lt;/math&gt; be a partition. Then, the &lt;math&gt; (S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_\ell)&lt;/math&gt;-flattening of a simple tensor &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A} = v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_d&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}_{(S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_\ell)} := {} &amp; (\Pi_{S_1}\mathcal{A}) \otimes (\Pi_{S_2} \mathcal{A}) \otimes \cdots \otimes (\Pi_{S_\ell}\mathcal{A}) \\[4pt]
&amp; \in \left( \bigotimes_{s \in S_1} V_s \right) \otimes \cdots \otimes \left( \bigotimes_{s \in S_\ell} V_s \right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be interpreted as a tensor of order &lt;math&gt;
\ell &lt; d&lt;/math&gt; by ignoring the tensor product structure on &lt;math&gt;
\otimes_{s \in S_k} V_s&lt;/math&gt;. The standard way to ignore the tensor product structure consists of looking at &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A}_{(S_1,\ldots,S_\ell)}&lt;/math&gt; through an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;
\otimes_{s\in S_k} V_s \simeq F^{\prod_{s\in S_k} n_s}&lt;/math&gt;, in which case &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A}_{(S_1,\ldots,S_\ell)}&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as an element of &lt;math&gt;
F^{N_{S_1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{N_{S_\ell}}&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
N_{S_k} := \prod_{s \in S_k} n_s&lt;/math&gt;.

For general tensors &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A} \in V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d&lt;/math&gt; the above definition is extended linearly as follows. Since every tensor admits a [[tensor rank decomposition]], we can define the &lt;math&gt;
(S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_\ell)&lt;/math&gt;-flattening of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\mathcal{A} = \sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d&lt;/math&gt;

as follows:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\mathcal{A}_{(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_\ell)} := \sum_{i=1}^r \left( \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d \right)_{(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_\ell)}. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===
For example, assume that a basis of &lt;math&gt;V_k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{ v_1^k, v_2^k, \ldots, v_{n_k}^k \}&lt;/math&gt; and that the tensor is expressed with respect to this basis as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} v_{j_1}^1 \otimes v_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_{j_d}^{d}.&lt;/math&gt;Via the first isomorphism, we can represent &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d,&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{j}^k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''th standard basis vector of &lt;math&gt;F^{n_k}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking &lt;math&gt;
S_1 = [1,d]&lt;/math&gt; and a bijective map &lt;math&gt;
\mu : [1,n_1] \times \cdots \times [1,n_d] \to [1,n_1\cdots n_d] &lt;/math&gt;, we can construct an isomorphism between &lt;math&gt;
F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
F^{n_1 \cdots n_d} &lt;/math&gt; by mapping &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \mapsto \mathbf{e}_{\mu(j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d)}, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{e}_j &lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''th standard basis vector of &lt;math&gt;
F^{n_1 \cdots n_d} &lt;/math&gt;. Via this identification, we have &lt;math&gt;
A_{(S_1)} = [ a_{\mu^{-1}(i)} ]_{i=1}^{n_1 \cdots n_d} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Vectorization ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d}&lt;/math&gt; be the coordinate representation of an abstract tensor with respect to a basis.
A '''vectorization''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;
(S_1)&lt;/math&gt;-reshaping wherein &lt;math&gt;
S_1 = [1,d]&lt;/math&gt;, so that the tensor is simply interpreted as a vector in &lt;math&gt;
F^{n_1 \cdots n_d}&lt;/math&gt;. A standard choice of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is such that 

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vec}(\mathcal{A}) := \mathcal{A}_{(S_1)} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{1,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{2,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{1,2,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_d} \end{bmatrix}^T,&lt;/math&gt;

which is consistent with the way in which the colon operator in [[Matlab]] and [[GNU Octave]] reshapes a higher-order tensor into a vector.

== Flattenings == 
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d}&lt;/math&gt; be the coordinate representation of an abstract tensor with respect to a basis.
A '''standard factor-''k'' flattening''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;
(S_1, S_2)&lt;/math&gt;-reshaping in which &lt;math&gt;
S_1 = \{k\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
S_2 = [1,d] \smallsetminus S_1&lt;/math&gt;. Usually, a standard flattening is denoted by 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_{(k)} := \mathcal{A}_{(S_1,S_2)} &lt;/math&gt;

These reshapings are sometimes called '''matricizations''' or '''unfoldings''' in the literature. A standard choice of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the one that is consistent with the reshape function in [[Matlab]] and [[GNU Octave]], namely

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_{(k)} := \begin{bmatrix} 
a_{1,1,\ldots,1,1,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{2,1,\ldots,1,1,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_{k-1},1,n_{k+1},\ldots,n_d} \\
a_{1,1,\ldots,1,2,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{2,1,\ldots,1,2,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_{k-1},2,n_{k+1},\ldots,n_d} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
a_{1,1,\ldots,1,n_k,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{2,1,\ldots,1,n_k,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_{k-1},n_k,n_{k+1},\ldots,n_d}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26578">'''Thermal depolymerization''' ('''TDP''') is a [[depolymerization]] process using [[hydrous pyrolysis]] for the reduction of complex [[organic material]]s (usually [[waste]] products of various sorts, often [[biomass]] and [[plastic]]) into light [[crude oil]]. It mimics the natural [[geology|geological]] processes thought to be involved in the production of [[fossil fuel]]s. Under pressure and heat, long chain [[polymer]]s of [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[carbon]] decompose into short-chain [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]]s with a maximum length of around 18 [[carbon]]s.

==Similar processes==
Thermal depolymerisation is similar to other processes which use [[superheated water]] as a major step to produce fuels, such as direct [[Hydrothermal Liquefaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Biomass Program, direct Hydrothermal Liquefaction| work =| publisher =US Department of Energy.

These are distinct from processes using dry materials to depolymerize, such as [[pyrolysis]]. The term Thermochemical Conversion (TCC) has also been used for conversion of biomass to oils, using superheated water, although it is more usually applied to fuel production via pyrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Other commercial scale processes include the "SlurryCarb" process operated by EnerTech, which uses similar technology to decarboxylate wet solid biowaste, which can then be physically dewatered and used as a solid fuel called E-Fuel. The plant in Rialto, California was designed to process 683 tons of waste per day.   However, it failed to perform to design standards and was closed down.  The Rialto facility defaulted on its bond payments and is in the process of being liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

Thermal depolymerization is similar to the geological processes that produced the fossil fuels used today, except that the technological process occurs in a timeframe measured in hours. Until recently, the [[human]]-designed processes were not efficient enough to serve as a practical source of fuel&amp;mdash;more [[energy]] was required than was produced.

The first industrial process to obtain gas, [[diesel fuel]]s and other petroleum products through pyrolysis of coal, tar or biomass was designed and patented in the late 1920s by [[Fischer-Tropsch]]. In U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=-MlwAAAAEBAJ 2,177,557], issued in 1939, Bergstrom and Cederquist discuss a method for obtaining oil from wood in which the wood is heated under pressure in water with a significant amount of [[calcium hydroxide]] added to the mixture. In the early 1970s Herbert R. Appell and coworkers worked with hydrous pyrolysis methods, as exemplified by U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=UEU9AAAAEBAJ 3,733,255] (issued in 1973), which discusses the production of oil from sewer [[sludge]] and municipal refuse by heating the material in water, under pressure, and in the presence of [[carbon monoxide]].

An approach that exceeded [[break-even]] was developed by [[Illinois]] [[microbiology|microbiologist]] [[Paul Baskis]] in the 1980s and refined over the next 15 years  (see U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=0LYmAAAAEBAJ 5,269,947], issued in 1993). The technology was finally developed for commercial use in 1996 by [[Changing World Technologies]] (CWT). [[Brian S. Appel]] (CEO of CWT) took the technology in 2001 and expanded and changed it into what is now referred to as TCP (Thermal Conversion Process), and has applied for and obtained several patents (see, for example, published patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=KxbsAQAAEBAJ 8,003,833], issued August 23, 2011). A Thermal Depolymerization demonstration plant was completed in 1999 in [[Philadelphia]] by Thermal Depolymerization, LLC, and the first full-scale commercial plant was constructed in [[Carthage, Missouri]], about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from [[ConAgra Foods]]' massive [[Butterball]] turkey plant, where it is expected to process about 200 [[ton]]s of [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] waste into {{convert|500|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day.

==Theory and process==

In the method used by CWT, the water improves the heating process and contributes hydrogen to the reactions.

In the [[Changing World Technologies]] (CWT) process,&lt;ref&gt;The description of the operation of the process, including temperatures, pressures, and time, has been adapted from the description in Brad Lemley (May 2003). [http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ Anything Into Oil.] Discover. See also the description of the operation of the process in Appel et al., published U. S. patent application US [http://www.google.com/patents?id=VrGfAAAAEBAJ 2004/0192980], publication date September 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; the feedstock material is first ground into small chunks, and mixed with water if it is especially dry. It is then fed into a [[pressure vessel]] reaction chamber where it is heated at [[isochoric process|constant volume]] to around 250 °[[Celsius|C]]. Similar to a [[pressure cooker]] (except at much higher pressure), steam naturally raises the pressure to 600 psi (4 [[MPa]]) (near the point of [[Boiling point|saturated water]]). These conditions are held for approximately 15 minutes to fully heat the mixture, after which the pressure is rapidly released to boil off most of the water (see: [[Flash evaporation]]). The result is a mix of crude hydrocarbons and solid [[mineral]]s. The minerals are removed, and the hydrocarbons are sent to a second-stage reactor where they are heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C, further breaking down the longer hydrocarbon chains. The hydrocarbons are then sorted by [[fractional distillation]], in a process similar to conventional [[oil refining]].

The CWT company claims that 15 to 20% of feedstock energy is used to provide energy for the plant. The remaining energy is available in the converted product. Working with turkey [[offal]] as the feedstock, the process proved to have yield efficiencies of approximately 85%; in other words, the energy contained in the end products of the process is 85% of the energy contained in the inputs to the process (most notably the energy content of the feedstock, but also including electricity for pumps and natural gas or [[woodgas]] for heating). If one considers the energy content of the feedstock to be free (i.e., waste material from some other process), then 85 units of energy are made available for every 15 units of energy consumed in process heat and electricity. This means the "[[EROEI|Energy Returned on Energy Invested]]" (EROEI) is (6.67), which is comparable to other energy harvesting processes. Higher efficiencies may be possible with drier and more carbon-rich feedstocks, such as waste [[plastic]].

By comparison, the current processes{{specify|date=July 2015}} used to produce [[alcohol as fuel|ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] from [[agriculture|agricultural]] sources have EROEI in the 4.2 range, when the energy used to produce the feedstocks is accounted for (in this case, usually [[sugar cane]], [[maize|corn]], [[soybean]]s and the like). These EROEI values are not directly comparable, because these EROEI calculations include the energy cost to produce the feedstock, whereas the above EROEI calculation for thermal depolymerization process (TDP) does not.

The process breaks down almost all materials that are fed into it. TDP even efficiently breaks down many types of hazardous materials, such as [[poison]]s and difficult-to-destroy biological agents such as [[prion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Andrew A.|last2=Vogel|first2=Frédéric|last3=Lachance|first3=Russell P.|last4=Fröling|first4=Morgan|last5=Antal, Jr.|first5=Michael J.|last6=Tester|first6=Jefferson W.|title=Thermochemical biofuel production in hydrothermal media: A review of sub- and supercritical water technologies|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1|page=35|doi=10.1039/B810100K|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.3674}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=I have not heard anything about this.

===Carthage plant products===
As reported on 04/02/2006 by [[Discover (magazine)|Discover Magazine]], a [[Carthage, Missouri]] plant was producing {{convert|500|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of oil made from 270 tons of turkey entrails and 20 tons of hog lard. This represents an oil yield of 22.3 percent. The Carthage plant produces API 40+, a high value crude oil. It contains light and heavy [[naphtha]]s, a [[kerosene]], and a [[gas oil]] fraction, with essentially no heavy fuel oils, tars, asphaltenes or waxes. It can be further refined to produce No. 2 and No. 4 [[fuel oil]]s.

The fixed carbon solids produced by the TDP process have multiple uses as a filter, a fuel source and a fertilizer. It can be used as activated carbon in [[wastewater]] treatment, as a fertilizer, or as a fuel similar to [[coal]].

==Advantages==
The process can break down organic poisons, due to breaking chemical bonds and destroying the molecular shape needed for the poison's activity. It is likely to be highly effective at killing pathogens, including [[prion]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=I have not heard anything about this. PrPSc does not break down by burning and I have not heard anything about high pressure and temperature (autoclaving does not work|date=September 2011}} It can also safely remove [[heavy metals]] from the samples by converting them from their ionized or organometallic forms to their stable oxides which can be safely separated from the other products.

Along with similar processes, it is a method of recycling the energy content of organic materials without first removing the water. It can produce liquid fuel, which separates from the water physically without need for drying. Other methods to recover energy often require pre-drying (e.g. [[burning]], [[pyrolysis]]) or produce gaseous products (e.g. [[anaerobic digestion]]).

==Potential sources of waste inputs==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that in 2006 there were 251 million tons of municipal solid [[waste]], or 4.6 pounds generated per day per person in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/facts.htm Municipal Solid Waste - Basic Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this mass is considered unsuitable for oil conversion.

==Limitations==
The process only breaks long molecular chains into shorter ones, so small molecules such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]] cannot be converted to oil through this process. However, the methane in the feedstock is recovered and burned to heat the water that is an essential part of the process. In addition, the gas can be burned in a [[Cogeneration|combined heat and power plant]], consisting of a [[gas turbine]] which drives a generator to create electricity, and a heat exchanger to heat the process input water from the exhaust gas. The electricity can be sold to the power grid, for example under a [[feed-in tariff]] scheme. This also increases the overall efficiency of the process (already said to be over 85% of feedstock energy content).

Another option is to sell the methane product as [[biogas]]. For example, biogas can be compressed, much like [[compressed natural gas|natural gas]], and used to power [[Alternative fuel vehicle|motor vehicles]].

Many agricultural and animal wastes could be processed, but many of these are already used as [[fertilizer]], animal feed, and, in some cases, as feedstocks for [[paper mill]]s or as [[boiler]] fuel. [[Energy crop]]s constitute another potentially large feedstock for thermal depolymerization.

==Current status==
Reports in 2004 claimed that the Carthage facility was selling products at 10% below the price of equivalent oil, but its production costs were low enough that it produced a profit. At the time it was paying for turkey waste (see also below).

The plant then consumed 270 tons of turkey offal (the full output of the turkey processing plant) and 20 tons of egg production waste daily. In February 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Carthage plant was producing about {{convert|400|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude oil.

In April 2005 the plant was reported to be running at a loss. Further 2005 reports summarized some economic setbacks which the Carthage plant encountered since its planning stages. It was thought that concern over mad cow disease would prevent the use of turkey waste and other animal products as cattle feed, and thus this waste would be free. As it turned out, turkey waste may still be used as feed in the United States, so that the facility must purchase that feed stock at a cost of $30 to $40 per ton, adding $15 to $20 per barrel to the cost of the oil. Final cost, as of January 2005, was $80/barrel ($1.90/gal).

The above cost of production also excludes the operating cost of the thermal oxidizer and scrubber added in May 2005 in response to odor complaints (see below).

A biofuel tax credit of roughly $1 per US gallon (26 ¢/L) on production costs was not available because the oil produced did not meet the definition of "biodiesel" according to the relevant American tax legislation. The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] specifically added thermal depolymerization to a $1 renewable diesel credit, which became effective at the end of 2005, allowing a profit of $4/barrel of output oil.

===Company expansion===
The company has explored expansion in California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and is presently examining projects in Europe, where animal products cannot be used as cattle feed. TDP is also being considered as an alternative means for sewage treatment in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2004-01-22-kantor_x.htm |title=Killing germs, reducing waste, making oil: TDP might be the next big thing |accessdate=2007-02-21 |last=Kantor |first=Andrew |date= 2004-01-23 |work=[[USA Today]] |quote=The City of Philadelphia currently turns a lot of its sewage sludge into landfill. (All together now: Eww.) But working with Changing World, the city is planning a TDP project to divert that sludge — and whatever pathogens are living in it — away from the land and into oil. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smell complaints===
The pilot plant in Carthage was temporarily shut down due to smell complaints. It was soon restarted when it was discovered that few of the odors were generated by the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by the Kansas City Star, April 12, 2005. The Kansas City Star website has since archived this article: [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_dispstring=(turkey-to-oil)%20AND%20date(2005) Kansas City: Search results]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the plant agreed to install an enhanced thermal oxidizer and to upgrade its [[air scrubber]] system under a court order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ago.mo.gov/lawsuits/2005/050605rescarthage.pdf In the circuit court of Jasper country, Missouri, at Carthage]&lt;br /&gt; "The company said it has finished installation of a thermal oxidizer and upgraded odor scrubber system that were ordered as part of a consent agreement with the city and the Missouri attorney general's office." [http://www.joplinglobe.com/story.php?story_id=188739&amp;c=87 City questions RES]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the plant is located only four blocks from the tourist-attracting town center, this has strained relations with the mayor and citizens of Carthage.

According to a company spokeswoman, the plant has received complaints even on days when it is not operating. She also contended that the odors may not have been produced by their facility, which is located near several other agricultural processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;"A plant spokeswoman, Julie Gelfand, tells the Pitch that repeated odor complaints have been lodged on days when the plant wasn't in operation or when wind conditions were inconsistent with the complaints." [http://www.pitch.com/Issues/2005-11-24/news/feature_4.html Fowl &amp; Crude]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2005, the plant was ordered by the state governor to shut down once again over allegations of foul odors as reported by MSNBC.&lt;ref&gt;"A foul-smelling plant that turns turkey byproducts into fuel oil was ordered closed by the governor Wednesday until the company finds a way to clear the air." [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10636943 Turkey-oil plant closed due to foul odors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 7, 2006, the plant has begun limited test runs to validate it has resolved the odor issue.&lt;ref&gt;"An experimental plant that turns turkey byproducts into fuel oil can resume normal operations for 15 days to test whether new equipment solves a problem with bad smells that prompted the state to shut it down in December. [http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/14040813.htm Kansascity.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 24, 2006, the last lawsuit connected with the odor issue has been dismissed and the problem is acknowledged as fixed.&lt;ref&gt;"The last lawsuit left from a dispute over odors from a plant that converts turkey waste into fuel oil was dismissed Thursday after the facility fixed its odor problems."
[http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/business/15352930.htm Last lawsuit dropped in Carthage turkey plant odor case]&lt;/ref&gt; In late November, however, another complaint was filed over bad smells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belleville.com/mld/belleville/news/state/16029275.htm Belleville.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This complaint was closed on January 11 of 2007 with no fines assessed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnr.mo.gov/newsrel/nr07_012.htm News Release 012 - MoDNR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status as of February 2009===
A May 2003 article in Discover magazine stated, "Appel has lined up federal grant money to help build demonstration plants to process chicken offal and manure in Alabama and crop residuals and grease in Nevada. Also in the works are plants to process turkey waste and manure in Colorado and pork and cheese waste in Italy. He says the first generation of depolymerization centers will be up and running in 2005. By then it should be clear whether the technology is as miraculous as its backers claim."&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ Anything Into Oil.] Discover magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of August 2008, the only operational plant listed at the company's website is the initial one in Carthage, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changingworldtech.com/where/index.asp Changingworldtech.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing World Technology applied for an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] on August 12; 2008, hoping to raise $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10017027-54.html?tag=nefd.top News.Cnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unusual [[Dutch Auction]] type IPO failed possibly because CWT has lost nearly $20 million with very little revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth2tech.com/2009/02/13/changing-world-ipo-is-a-no-go/ Earth2tech.com], changing world IPO is a no go&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKN0130987720090201 UK.reuters.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

CWT, the parent company of Renewable Energy Solutions, filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. No details on plans for the Carthage plant have been released.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being''''' (hereinafter ''WMCF'') is a book by [[George Lakoff]], a [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguist]], and [[Rafael E. Núñez]], a [[psychologist]]. Published in 2000, ''WMCF'' seeks to found a [[cognitive science of mathematics]], a theory of [[embodied philosophy|embodied]] mathematics based on [[conceptual metaphor]].

==''WMCF'' definition of mathematics==
Mathematics makes up that part of the human conceptual system that is special in the following way:
:"It is precise, consistent, stable across time and human communities, symbolizable, calculable, generalizable, universally available, consistent within each of its subject matters, and effective as a general tool for description, explanation, and prediction in a vast number of everyday activities, [ranging from] sports, to building, business, technology, and science." (''WMCF'', pp. 50, 377)

Nikolay Lobachevsky said "There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world." A common type of [[conceptual blending]] process would seem to apply to the entire mathematical procession.

== Human cognition and mathematics ==
Lakoff and Núñez's avowed purpose is to begin laying the foundations for a truly scientific understanding of mathematics, one grounded in processes common to all human cognition. They find that four distinct but related processes [[metaphor]]ically structure basic arithmetic: object collection, object construction, using a measuring stick, and moving along a path.

''WMCF'' builds on earlier books by Lakoff (1987) and Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), which analyze such concepts of [[metaphor]] and image schemata from second-generation [[cognitive science]].  Some of the concepts in these earlier books, such as the interesting technical ideas in Lakoff (1987), are absent from ''WMCF''.

Lakoff and Núñez hold that mathematics results from the human cognitive apparatus and must therefore be understood in cognitive terms. ''WMCF'' advocates (and includes some examples of) a ''cognitive idea analysis'' of [[mathematics]] which analyzes mathematical ideas in terms of the human experiences, metaphors, generalizations, and other cognitive mechanisms giving rise to them. A standard mathematical education does not develop such idea analysis techniques because it does not pursue considerations of A) what structures of the mind allow it to do mathematics or B) the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

Lakoff and Núñez start by reviewing the psychological literature, concluding that human beings appear to have an innate ability, called [[subitizing]], to count, add, and subtract up to about 4 or 5. They document this conclusion by reviewing the literature, published in recent decades, describing experiments with infant subjects. For example, infants quickly become excited or curious when presented with "impossible" situations, such as having three toys appear when only two were initially present.

The authors argue that mathematics goes far beyond this very elementary level due to a large number of [[metaphor]]ical constructions. For example, the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] position that all is number, and the associated crisis of confidence that came about with the discovery of the irrationality of the [[square root of two]], arises solely from a metaphorical relation between the length of the diagonal of a square, and the possible numbers of objects.

Much of ''WMCF'' deals with the important concepts of [[infinity]] and of limit processes, seeking to explain how finite humans living in a finite world could ultimately conceive of the [[actual infinite]]. Thus much of ''WMCF'' is, in effect, a study of the [[epistemology|epistemological]] foundations of the [[calculus]]. Lakoff and Núñez conclude that while the [[potential infinite]] is not metaphorical, the actual infinite is. Moreover, they deem all manifestations of actual infinity to be instances of what they call the "Basic Metaphor of Infinity", as represented by the ever-increasing sequence 1, 2, 3, ...

''WMCF'' emphatically rejects the [[Platonism|Platonistic]] [[philosophy of mathematics]]. They emphasize that all we know and can ever know is ''human mathematics'', the mathematics arising from the human intellect. The question of whether there is a "transcendent" mathematics independent of human thought is a meaningless question, like asking if colors are transcendent of human thought—colors are only varying wavelengths of light, it is our interpretation of physical stimuli that make them colors.

''WMCF'' (p.&amp;nbsp;81) likewise criticizes the emphasis mathematicians place on the concept of [[closure (mathematics)|closure]]. Lakoff and Núñez argue that the expectation of closure is an artifact of the human mind's ability to relate fundamentally different concepts via metaphor.

''WMCF'' concerns itself mainly with proposing and establishing an alternative view of mathematics, one grounding the field in the realities of human biology and experience. It is not a work of technical mathematics or philosophy. Lakoff and Núñez are not the first to argue that conventional approaches to the philosophy of mathematics are flawed. For example, they do not seem all that familiar with the content of Davis and [[Reuben Hersh|Hersh]] (1981), even though the book warmly acknowledges Hersh's support.

Lakoff and Núñez cite [[Saunders Mac Lane]] (the inventor, with [[Samuel Eilenberg]], of [[category theory]]) in support of their position. ''[[Mathematics, Form and Function]]'' (1986), an overview of mathematics intended for philosophers, proposes that mathematical concepts are ultimately grounded in ordinary human activities, mostly interactions with the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;See especially the table in Mac Lane (1986), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators have taken some interest in what ''WMCF'' suggests about how mathematics is learned, and why students find some elementary concepts more difficult than others.

==Examples of mathematical metaphors==
[[Conceptual metaphor]]s described in ''WMCF'', in addition to the Basic Metaphor of Infinity, include:
*[[Arithmetic]] is motion along a path, object collection/construction;
*Change is motion;
*[[Set (mathematics)|Sets]] are containers, objects;
*[[continuous function|Continuity]] is gapless;
*Mathematical systems have an "essence," namely their [[axiom]]atic [[algebraic structure]];
*[[Function (mathematics)|Function]]s are sets of [[ordered pair]]s, curves in the [[Cartesian plane]];
*Geometric figures are objects in space;
*[[Logical independence]] is geometric [[orthogonal]]ity;
*[[Number]]s are sets, object collections, physical segments, points on a line;
*Recurrence is circular.
Mathematical reasoning requires [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] ranging over some [[universe of discourse]], so that we can reason about generalities rather than merely about particulars. ''WMCF'' argues that reasoning with such variables implicitly relies on what it terms the Fundamental [[Metonymy]] of Algebra.

==Example of metaphorical ambiguity==
''WMCF'' (p.&amp;nbsp;151) includes the following example of what the authors term "metaphorical ambiguity." Take the set &lt;math&gt;A = \{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}\}.&lt;/math&gt; Then recall two bits of standard terminology from [[naive set theory|elementary set theory]]:
#The [[recursively enumerable set|recursive]] construction of the [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers|ordinal natural numbers]], whereby 0 is &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n \cup \{n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
#The [[ordered pair]] (''a,b''), defined as &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}.&lt;/math&gt;
By (1), ''A'' is the set {1,2}. But (1) and (2) together say that ''A'' is also the ordered pair (0,1). Both statements cannot be correct; the [[ordered pair]] (0,1) and the unordered pair {1,2} are fully distinct concepts. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) term this situation "metaphorically ambiguous." This simple example calls into question any [[platonism|Platonistic]] foundations for mathematics.

While (1) and (2) above are admittedly canonical, especially within the consensus [[set theory]] known as the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axiomatization]], ''WMCF'' does not let on that they are but one of several definitions that have been proposed since the dawning of set theory. For example, [[Frege]], ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', and [[New Foundations]] (a body of [[axiomatic set theory]] begun by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] in 1937) define [[cardinal number|cardinals]] and [[ordinal number|ordinals]] as [[equivalence class]]es under the [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] of [[equinumerosity]] and [[ordinal number|similarity]], so that this conundrum does not arise. In Quinian set theory, ''A'' is simply an instance of the number 2. For technical reasons, defining the ordered pair as in (2) above is awkward in Quinian set theory. Two solutions have been proposed:
*A variant set-theoretic definition of the ordered pair more complicated than the usual one;
*Taking ordered pairs as primitive.

==The Romance of Mathematics==
The "Romance of Mathematics" is ''WMCF''{{'}}s light-hearted term for a perennial philosophical viewpoint about mathematics which the authors describe and then dismiss as an intellectual myth:
* Mathematics is transcendent, namely it exists independently of human beings, and structures our actual physical [[universe]] and any possible universe. Mathematics is the language of nature, and is the primary conceptual structure we would have in common with extraterrestrial aliens, if any such there be.
*[[Mathematical proof]] is the gateway to a realm of transcendent truth.
* [[Reasoning]] is [[logic]], and logic is essentially mathematical. Hence mathematics structures all possible reasoning.
* Because mathematics exists independently of human beings, and reasoning is essentially mathematical, reason itself is disembodied. Therefore, [[artificial intelligence]] is possible, at least in principle.

It is very much an open question whether ''WMCF'' will eventually prove to be the start of a new school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Hence the main value of ''WMCF'' so far may be a critical one: its critique of [[Platonism]] and romanticism in mathematics.

Many working mathematicians resist the approach and conclusions of Lakoff and Núñez. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060716051333/perso.unifr.ch/rafael.nunez/reviews.html Reviews] by mathematicians of ''WMCF'' in professional journals, while often respectful of its focus on conceptual strategies and metaphors as paths for understanding mathematics, have taken exception to some of the ''WMCF''{{'}}s philosophical arguments on the grounds that mathematical statements have lasting 'objective' meanings. For example, [[Fermat's last theorem]] means exactly what it meant when [[Fermat]] initially proposed it 1664. Other reviewers have pointed out that multiple conceptual strategies can be employed in connection with the same mathematically defined term, often by the same person (a point that is compatible with the view that we routinely understand the 'same' concept with different metaphors). The [[metaphor]] and the conceptual strategy are not the same as the formal [[definition]] which mathematicians employ. However, ''WMCF'' points out that formal definitions are built using words and symbols that have meaning only in terms of human experience.

Critiques of ''WMCF'' include the humorous:
:"It's difficult for me to conceive of a metaphor for a real number raised to a complex power, but if there is one, I'd sure like to see it." — Joseph Auslander&lt;ref name=Sutcliffe&gt;[http://www.sutcliffe.com/blog/?m=200709 What is the Nature of Mathematics?], Michael Sutcliffe, referenced February 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
and the physically informed:

:"But their analysis leaves at least a couple of questions insufficiently answered. For one thing, the authors ignore the fact that brains not only observe nature, but also are part of nature. Perhaps the math that brains invent takes the form it does because math had a hand in forming the brains in the first place (through the operation of natural laws in constraining the evolution of life). Furthermore, it's one thing to fit equations to aspects of reality that are already known. It's something else for that math to tell of phenomena never previously suspected. When Paul Dirac's equations describing electrons produced more than one solution, he surmised that nature must possess other particles, now known as antimatter. But scientists did not discover such particles until after Dirac's math told him they must exist. If math is a human invention, nature seems to know what was going to be invented."&lt;ref name=Sutcliffe/&gt;

Lakoff made his reputation by linking [[linguistics]] to [[cognitive science]] and the analysis of [[metaphor]]. Núñez, educated in [[Switzerland]], is a product of [[Jean Piaget]]'s school of [[cognitive psychology]] as a basis for logic and mathematics. Núñez has thought much about the foundations of [[real analysis]], the [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s, and the Basic Metaphor of Infinity. These topics, however, worthy though they be, form part of the superstructure of mathematics. Cognitive science should take more interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. And indeed, the authors do pay a fair bit of attention early on to [[logic]], [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]], even lingering a bit over [[group theory]]. But neither author is well-trained in [[first-order logic|logic]] (there is no index entry for "[[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]" or "quantification"), the philosophy of set theory, the [[axiomatic method]], [[metamathematics]], and [[model theory]]. Nor does ''WMCF'' say enough about the derivation of [[number system]]s (the [[Peano axioms]] go unmentioned), [[abstract algebra]], [[equivalence relation|equivalence]] and [[partial order|order]] relations, [[mereology]], [[topology]], and [[geometry]].

Lakoff and Núñez tend to dismiss the negative opinions mathematicians have expressed about ''WMCF'', because their critics do not appreciate the insights of cognitive science. Lakoff and Núñez maintain that their argument can only be understood using the discoveries of recent decades about the way human brains process language and meaning. They argue that any arguments or criticisms that are not grounded in this understanding cannot address the content of the book.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.unifr.ch/perso/nunezr/warning.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613231421/http://www.unifr.ch/perso/nunezr/warning.html |date=June 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been pointed out that it is not at all clear that ''WMCF'' establishes that the claim "intelligent alien life would have mathematical ability" is a myth. To do this, it would be required to show that intelligence and mathematical ability are separable, and this has not been done. On Earth, intelligence and mathematical ability seem to go hand in hand in all life-forms, as pointed out by [[Keith Devlin]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=The Math Instinct / Why You're a Mathematical Genius (Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats and Dogs)|year=2005|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1-56025-839-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of ''WMCF'' have not explained how this situation would (or even could) be different anywhere else.

Lakoff and Núñez also appear not to appreciate the extent to which [[intuitionist]]s and [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]]s have anticipated their attack on the Romance of (Platonic) Mathematics. [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]], the founder of the [[intuitionist]]/[[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] point of view, in his dissertation ''On the Foundation of Mathematics'', argued that mathematics was a mental construction, a free creation of the mind and totally independent of logic and language. He goes on to upbraid the formalists for building verbal structures that are studied without intuitive interpretation. Symbolic language should not be confused with mathematics; it reflects, but does not contain, mathematical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David M.|last=Burton|title=The History of Mathematics / An Introduction|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=712|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-338315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summing up==
''WMCF'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;378–79) concludes with some key points, a number of which follow. Mathematics arises from our bodies and brains, our everyday experiences, and the concerns of human societies and cultures. It is:
*The result of normal adult cognitive capacities, in particular the capacity for conceptual metaphor, and as such is a human universal. The ability to construct [[conceptual metaphor]]s is neurologically based, and enables humans to reason about one domain using the language and concepts of another domain. [[Conceptual metaphor]] is both what enabled mathematics to grow out of everyday activities, and what enables mathematics to grow by a continual process of analogy and abstraction;
*[[Symbol]]ic, thereby enormously facilitating precise calculation;
*Not transcendent, but the result of human [[evolution]] and [[culture]], to which it owes its effectiveness. During experience of the world a connection to mathematical ideas is going on within the human mind;
*A system of human concepts making extraordinary use of the ordinary tools of human cognition;
*An open-ended creation of human beings, who remain responsible for maintaining and extending it;
*One of the greatest products of the collective human imagination, and a magnificent example of the beauty, richness, complexity, diversity, and importance of human ideas.

The cognitive approach to [[formal system]]s, as described and implemented in ''WMCF'', need not be confined to mathematics, but should also prove fruitful when applied to formal logic, and to formal philosophy such as [[Edward Zalta]]'s [http://mally.stanford.edu/theory.html theory of abstract objects]. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) fruitfully employ the cognitive approach to rethink a good deal of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and the [[history of ideas]].
