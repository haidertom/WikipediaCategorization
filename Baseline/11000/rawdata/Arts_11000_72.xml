[[File:Rublev Troitsa.jpg|thumb|right|Rublev's [[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|famous icon of the Trinity]].]]
'''Andrei Rublev''' ({{lang-rus|Андре́й Рублёв|p=ɐnˈdrʲej rʊˈblʲɵf}}, also transliterated as ''Andrey Rublyov'';&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Rublev&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500001430 Getty Union Artist Name List] prefers "Rublyov", but "Rublev" is more commonly found.&lt;/ref&gt; born in the 1360s, died 29 January 1427 or 1430, or 17 October 1428 in [[Moscow]]) is considered to be one of the greatest [[Medieval art|medieval]] [[Russian culture#Visual arts|Russian]] [[Painting|painters]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[icon]]s and [[fresco]]s.

==Early life==
Little information survives about his life; even where he was born is unknown. He probably lived in the [[Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra]], near [[Moscow]], under Nikon of [[Radonezh]], who became [[hegumen]] after the death of [[Sergii Radonezhsky]] in 1392. The first mention of Rublev is in 1405, when he decorated [[icon]]s and [[fresco]]s for the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], in company with [[Theophanes the Greek]] and [[Prokhor of Gorodets]]. His name was the last of the list of masters, as the junior both by rank and by age. Theophanes was an important [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] master, who moved to Russia and is considered to have trained Rublev.

==Career==
Chronicles tell us that together with [[Daniil Chyorny|Daniil Cherni]] he painted the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir]] in 1408 as well as the [[Trinity Cathedral (Sergiyev Posad)|Trinity Cathedral]] in the [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius]] between 1425 and 1427. After Daniil's death, Andrei came to Moscow's [[Andronikov Monastery]] where he painted his last work, the frescoes of the Saviour Cathedral. He is also believed to have painted at least one of the [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in the [[Khitrovo Gospels]].

The only work authenticated as entirely his is the icon of the [[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|Trinity]] (c. 1410, currently in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]). It is based on an earlier icon known as the "Hospitality of Abraham" (illustrating {{Bibleverse||Genesis|18|HE}}). Rublev removed the figures of [[Abraham]] and [[Sarah]] from the scene, and through a subtle use of composition and symbolism changed the subject to focus on the [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] of the Trinity.

In Rublev's art two traditions are combined: the highest [[asceticism]] and the classic harmony of [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] mannerism. The characters of his paintings are always peaceful and calm. After some time his art came to be perceived as the ideal of Eastern Church painting and of Orthodox [[iconography]].

==Death and legacy==
Rublev died at Andronikov Monastery on 29 January 1430 (although 17 October 1428 is also cited).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Rublev's work influenced many artists including [[Dionisy]]. The [[Stoglavi Sobor]] (1551) promulgated Rublev's icon style as a model for church painting. Since 1959 the Andrei Rublev Museum at the [[Andronikov Monastery]] has displayed his and related art.

The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] [[canonized]] Rublev as a [[saint]] in 1988, celebrating his [[feast day]] on 29 January&lt;ref name = "SHC"&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1966, [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] made a film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', loosely based on the artist's life. This became the first (and perhaps only) film produced in the Soviet era to treat the artist as a world-historic figure and Christianity as an axiom of Russia’s historical identity,&lt;ref name=jhoberman&gt;{{cite web

The '''Brunswick Lion''' ({{lang-de|Braunschweiger Löwe}}) is a [[monument]] and the best-known [[landmark]] in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Braunschweig]] (Brunswick). It is located on the Burgplatz square in front of [[Dankwarderode Castle]] and [[Brunswick Cathedral]]. Within Brunswick it is thus commonly known as the "Castle Lion" (''Burglöwe'').

== Statue ==
=== Creation ===
[[File:Braunschweig Brunswick Ebstorfer Karte (1300).jpg|thumb|left|Brunswick and the Brunswick Lion on the [[Ebstorf Map]] (around 1300)&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Spies (Hrsg.): ''Braunschweig – Das Bild der Stadt in 900 Jahren. Geschichte und Ansichten'', Band 2: ''Braunschweigs Stadtbild'', Braunschweig 1985, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The medieval chronicler Abbot [[Albert of Stade]] mentioned "1166" as the year of origin. Nevertheless, according to recent research, the monument was created between 1164 and 1176, at the time when the [[House of Welf|Welf]] duke [[Henry the Lion]] (1129/31–1195), ruler of both [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], took his residence at Braunschweig. Newly-married with the [[Kingdom of England|English]] princess [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], he had Dankwarderode Castle built in the style of a ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'', rivalling with the nearby [[Imperial Palace of Goslar]]. The lion statue was erected in the centre of the castle complex as seigniorial symbol of his ducal authority and jurisdiction, probably also as an expression of Henry's claim to power towards the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]].

The Brunswick Lion was the first large detached [[sculpture]] of the [[Middle Ages]] north of the Alps and the first large hollow casting of a figure since [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]]. The bronze casting by an unknown artist, probably from Brunswick, weighs 880 kilogrammes, has a height of {{convert|1.78|m|ft}}, a length of {{convert|2.79|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a maximum thickness of 12 millimetres. The sculpture was originally gilded.

The Lion's design apparently is modelled on [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italian]] art of sculpture, such as the [[Capitoline Wolf]], the [[Lion of Saint Mark]], or the ancient [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]]. Henry may have been inspired during the Italian campaigns he undertook together with Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The elaborate artistic achievement and naturalistic design of the sculpture indicate the work of a versed [[goldsmith]] or [[Bellfounding|bell founder]]. 

=== History ===
[[File:Braunschweig Brunswick Loewe mit Dom im Hintergrund.jpg|thumb|In order to protect the original, a faithful replica of the original has stood on the ''Burgplatz'' since 1989]]
The Lion soon became the [[heraldry|heraldic]] animal of Braunschweig; it appeared in the city's [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] and on ducal coins. The sculpture and its pedestal were extensively restored in 1616, under the rule of Duke [[Frederick Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Frederick Ulrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], after long quarrels with the Braunschweig citizens were settled. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it was narrowly rescued from melting down when the [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalian]] government prepared for the 1812 [[French invasion of Russia|Russian Campaign]]. Another restoration was carried out by the sculptor [[Georg Ferdinand Howaldt]] in 1858. 

The Braunschweig [[Büssing]] automotive company established in 1903 adopted the Lion as a [[logo]] mounted on its busses and trucks. Taken over by [[MAN SE]] in 1972, the Büssing signet still adorns [[MAN Truck &amp; Bus|MAN commercial vehicles]].

The threat by [[strategic bombing during World War II]] prompted the city administration to replace the original sculpture by a copy already cast in 1937. Kept safe at the [[Rammelsberg]] mines in the [[Harz]] mountains, the original statue was brought back to Braunschweig by the British [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation forces]] after the war and re-installed in a festive ceremony.

Finally in 1980, the original statue was removed inside Dankwarderode Castle to protect it from further damages caused by [[air pollution]]. A specially manufactured replica has been set up at the original site.

== Legend ==
Shortly after the death of Henry the Lion in 1195, the duke became the subject of a [[folklore|folktale]], the so-called ''Heinrichssage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Brothers Grimm]] | url = http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/753/272 | title = Heinrich der Löwe |trans-title=Henry the Lion - The Brothers' Grimm version | work = [[Deutsche Sagen]] | language = German | publisher = [[Projekt Gutenberg-DE]] | accessdate = 10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale was later also turned into the opera ''[[Enrico Leone]]'' by Italian composer [[Agostino Steffani]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klassika.info/Komponisten/Steffani_Agostino/Oper/EnricoLeone/index.html Enrico Leone (Heinrich der Löwe)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Heinrichssage'' details a fictional account of Henry's [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]]. A popular part of the tale deals with the Brunswick Lion. According to legend, Henry witnessed the fight between a lion and a dragon while on pilgrimage. He joins the lion in its fight and they slay the dragon. The faithful lion then accompanies Henry on his return home. After its master's death, the lion refuses all food and dies of grief on Henry's grave. The people of Brunswick then erect the statue in the lion's honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last  = Combellack| first = C. R. B.| title = Die Sage von Heinrich dem Löwen.

[[File:Sculpture, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London - DSCF0352.JPG|thumb|Plaster cast at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London]]
Around the world, but mainly in Germany, there are several replicas of the Brunswick Lion. For example, in front of [[Ratzeburg]] Cathedral (erected in 1881), in the interior of [[Weingarten Abbey]], in front of [[Wiligrad Castle]], set up in 1913/14 by [[John Albert of Mecklenburg]] (from 1907 to 1913 ruler of the [[Duchy of Brunswick]]), disappeared after 1950, in [[Blankenburg (Harz)|Blankenburg im Harz]] in 1915 on the terrace of the Great Castle, since 1953 in the Baroque Gardens of the Little Castle and in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]]. Other replicas are located here:

The '''Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies''' (CUCS) was founded in 1981, as a joint creation between the [[University of Manitoba]] and [[St. Andrew's College (Winnipeg)|St. Andrew's College]].  The mission of the Centre is to create, preserve and communicate knowledge dealing with [[Ukrainian Canadian]] culture and scholarship.  It is located in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].

The Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies, provides undergraduate courses and interdisciplinary programs of study in areas relating to Ukrainian Canadian culture. The Centre also encourages and promotes research and scholarship in all areas relating to Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies.

The Centre offers nineteen courses in such areas as [[Ukrainian language]], Ukrainian Canadian literature and folklore, the history of [[Ukraine]] and of the Ukrainians in [[Canada]], the geography of Ukraine, the government and politics of Ukraine, [[Eastern Christianity]], [[Byzantine art]], and the Ukrainian arts in Canada. These courses can be taken singly, for general interest, as options, or as components of programs in various departments in the Faculty of Arts or in the School of Art.

For students interested in specializing in the area, the Centre offers interdisciplinary programs in Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies leading to a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree with a general major, an advanced major, or a minor in this field. The University of Manitoba is the only university in Canada which offers undergraduate degree programs in Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies.

The Centre offers courses on the University of Manitoba campus, and at off-campus locations in Winnipeg. From time to time, the Centre is also able to offer courses at other locations in Manitoba and through teleconference, as well as specialized programs during the summer.

Although the Centre does not offer graduate courses, it is possible to pursue graduate work in Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies at the M.A. and Ph.D. levels through Interdisciplinary Programs in the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the University of Manitoba. Several fellowships are available.

Individual scholars are encouraged to pursue their own research agenda within a Ukrainian Canadian context. Topics of current interest include an exploration of Ukrainian Canadian history, the occurrence of Ukrainian Canadiana within North American popular culture, explorations of Ukrainian Canadian arts including folklore, fine arts, and literature, issues in genealogy, and the study of music both popular and classical) with a Ukrainian Canadian focus.

An additional new direction is the development of an online courses on Ukrainian Canadian folklore.

The Centre, since 2002, has held a bi-annual Tarnawecky Distinguished Lecture program at the University of Manitoba. This program is intended to bring academics and experts as speakers to the University.

The acting director, since 2016, is Dr. Orest Cap.

'''Cerebral achromatopsia''' is a type of color-blindness caused by damage to the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's [[retina]]. It is often confused with congenital [[achromatopsia]]&lt;ref name=Fulton&gt;Briefing from 2008 Achromatopsia Conference by James Fulton&lt;/ref&gt; but underlying physiological deficits of the disorders are completely distinct. A similar, but distinct, deficit called '''color agnosia''' exists in which a person has intact color perception (as measured by a matching task) but has deficits in color recognition, such as knowing which color they are looking at.

==Signs and symptoms==

Patients with cerebral achromatopsia deny having any experience of color when asked and fail standard clinical assessments like the [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test|Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test]] (a test of color ordering with no naming requirements). Patients may often [[Anosognosia|not notice their loss of color vision]] and merely describe the world they see as being "drab". Most describe seeing the world in "shades of gray".&lt;ref name=Jaeger/&gt; This observation notes a key difference between cerebral and congenital achromatopsia, as those born with achromatopsia have never had an experience of color or gray.

==Pathophysiology==

Cerebral achromatopsia differs from other forms of color blindness in subtle but important ways. It is a consequence of cortical damage that arises through [[ischemia]] or [[infarction]] of a specific area in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex of humans.&lt;ref  name=Jaeger&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaeger W, Krastel H, Braun S |title=[Cerebral achromatopsia (symptoms, course, differential diagnosis and strategy of the study). I] |language=German |journal=Klin Monbl Augenheilkd |volume=193 |issue=6 |pages=627–34 |date=December 1988 |pmid=3265459 |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1050309 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This damage is almost always the result of injury or illness.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt;

===Classification===
A 2005 study examined 92 case studies since 1970 in which cerebral lesions affected color vision.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; The severity and size of the visual field affected in cerebral achromatopsiacs vary from patient to patient.

====Bilateral and hemifield====

The majority of cases in the 2005 study were the result of bilateral lesions in the ventral occipital cortex.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; It is unknown whether this was the result of bilateral lesions being more likely to produce color-loss symptoms, or if it was a sampling effect of patients with more severe brain trauma more often being admitted for treatment. In many of the cases examined, patients reported only partial loss of color vision. The locations of color vision loss can be restricted to one hemisphere or one quarter of the visual field. The term "hemiachromatopsia" has been used to denote patients who experience loss of color in only one hemisphere of the visual field. However, as applied to achromatopia resulting from brain trauma, the term is incomplete in characterizing the often-complex nature of the vision loss.

====Transient====

In still rarer cases, temporary ischemia of the associated ventral occipital cortex can result in transient achromatopsia. The condition has thus far been characterized only in stroke patients and provides further support for a color processing area.

In one case, a 78-year-old stroke victim had lost the ability to identify color, but was unaware of his deficit until doctors performed color discretion tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Arx SW, Müri RM, Heinemann D, Hess CW, Nyffeler T |title=Anosognosia for cerebral achromatopsia--a longitudinal case study |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=970–7 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19944708 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.11.018 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even when presented with this information, the patient believed he had retained his ability to perceive color even though the world around him appeared grey. He attributed this achromatism to "poor lighting" and it took several weeks for the patient to fully appreciate the extent of his disability. In addition, the characteristic comorbidity of prosopagnosia was present. After two months and frequent sessions with doctors, tests indicated his color had fully returned. The ischemia caused by lesions on the posterior cerebral arteries had subsided and follow up MRI scans indicated that blood flow had once again returned to the VOC.

===Co-occurrence with other deficits===
The most common disorder seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is [[prosopagnosia]], the inability to recognize or recall faces. In some studies, the comorbidity is seen as high as 72%.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; This significance has not been overlooked and is a subject of ongoing research. See {{section link||Difference from congenital achromatopsia}} below.

Cerebral achromatopsiacs often have poor spatial acuity.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

The most common tests perform to diagnose cerebral achromatopsia are the [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test]], the [[Ishihara plate]] test, and the color-naming test.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; Testing and diagnosis for cerebral achromatopsia is often incomplete and misdiagnosed in doctor’s offices.&lt;ref name=Fulton/&gt;

Remarkably, almost 50% of tested patients diagnosed with cerebral achromatopsia are able to perform normally on the color-naming test. However, these results are somewhat in question because of the sources from which many of these reports come.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; Only 29% of cerebral achromatopsia patients successfully pass the Ishihara plate test, which is a more accepted and more standardized test for color blindness.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt;

===Difference from congenital achromatopsia===
The most apparent distinguishing characteristic between congenital achromatopsia and cerebral achromatopsia is the sudden onset of color vision loss following a severe head injury or damage to the occipital lobe following a stroke or similar ischemic event.&lt;ref name=Jaeger/&gt;  Non-invasive imaging techniques can be the most helpful in determining whether the area of damage following a traumatic event is an correlated with color-vision processing. Simple diagnostic tools can also be used to determine whether a patient is a likely candidate for further testing, as advancing imaging procedures can often prove expensive and unnecessary.

Co-morbid factors can be valuable indicators of the likelihood of cerebral achromatoptsia. One disorder often seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is prosopagnosia, the inability to recall or recognize faces. The correlation is still the subject of ongoing research, but the most telltale clue in this association is the close proximity of brain lesions seen in prosopagnosics and cerebral achromatopsiacs without prosopagnosia.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; Figure 1 illustrates overlap of brain lesions compiled from numerous case reports of both disorders. A common area of damage associated with both disorders can be seen in the right occipital lobe.

==Treatment==

No current treatment is known for the disorder.
==History==

The number of reported cases of cerebral achromatopsia are relatively few compared with other forms of color-vision loss. In addition, the severity of the color perception deficits along with other psychological effects vary between patients.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bouvier SE, Engel SA |title=Behavioral deficits and cortical damage loci in cerebral achromatopsia |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=183–91 |date=February 2006 |pmid=15858161 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhi096 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

Based on the knowledge gained from cerebral achromatopsia case studies, current research is focusing on learning more about the cortical area involved in color processing.

A recent study provided some of the first direct evidence of color-specific processing in the ventral occipital cortex. A subject with a history of seizure activity was examined using fMRI and electrode implantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphey DK, Yoshor D, Beauchamp MS |title=Perception matches selectivity in the human anterior color center |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=216–20 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18258428 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.01.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the fMRI, researchers examined the areas of blood oxygenation in the occipital lobe as the subject viewed various color-specific stimuli. The result of the experiment was the identification of an area in the subject, slightly anterior to the lesioned area in cerebral achromatic patients, that responded to variance in color stimulation. The resolution of the MRI was a limiting factor in identifying areas corresponding to specific colors. The next portion of the study used an electrode implanted in the right hemisphere in the location identified by the fMRI scan as pertaining to color processing. It was found the electrical activity of the area increased when the subject was presented with blue stimuli. The next, and most significant finding of the study, was that when the electrode was used to present an electrical stimulus in the subject’s brain, the subject reported the perception of the color blue. Such a result is consistent with other reports of electrical stimulation in visual field maps eliciting perception of phosphines in subjects’ visual field.

The color stimulus presented is not the only factor in determining the involvement of the VOC in color processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beauchamp MS, Haxby JV, Jennings JE, DeYoe EA |title=An fMRI version of the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test reveals multiple color-selective areas in human ventral occipitotemporal cortex |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=257–63 |year=1999 |pmid=10355906 |doi=10.1093/cercor/9.3.257 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of attention and the type of object also affect the activiation of the VOC. It has been noted that this area of the occipital lobe may not be a processing center but rather a pathway that is a critical intersection of several cortical areas involved in color perception.

==Society and culture==

The disorder is often presented as evidence of our incomplete knowledge of color processing. Color vision research is a well-studied field of modern neuroscience and the underlying anatomical processing in the retina have been well categorized. The presence of another factor in the perception of color by humans illustrates the need for more research.

===The case of the colorblind painter===

The most famous instance of cerebral achromatopsia is that of "Jonathan I." immortalized in a case study by [[Oliver Sacks]] and Robert Wasserman, and published as "The Case of the Colorblind Painter".&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Oliver. "The Case of the Colorblind Painter". ''An Anthropologist on Mars''. New York: Random House, 1995. 3-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay tracks Johnathan I.'s experience with cerebral achromatopsia from the point where an injury to his occipital lobe leaves him without the ability to perceive color, through his subsequent struggles to adapt to a black, white and gray world, and finally to his acceptance and even gratitude for his condition. Especially pertinent is the analysis of how cerebral achromatopsia affects his practice as a painter and artist. Descriptions of cerebral achromatopsia's effects on his psychological health and visual perception are especially striking. For instance, in recounting Mr. I.'s descriptions of flesh and foods, the authors write:

{{quote|Mr. I. could hardly bear the changed appearances of people ("like animated gray statues") any more than he could bear his own changed appearance in the mirror: he shunned social intercourse and found sexual intercourse impossible. He saw people's flesh, his wife's flesh, his own flesh, as an abhorrent gray; "flesh-colored" now appeared "rat-colored" to him. This was so even when he closed his eyes, for his preternaturally vivid ("eidetic") visual imagery was preserved but now without color, and forced on him images, forced him to "see" but see internally with the wrongness of his achromatopsia. He found foods disgusting in their grayish, dead appearance and had to close his eyes to eat. But this did not help very much, for the mental image of a tomato was as black as its appearance.}}

The forms of '''Chinese furniture''' evolved along three distinct lineages which dates back to 1000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, G. "Chinese Domestic Furniture in Photographs and Measured Drawings" pp. XV-XXXIII, Dover Publications, Inc., 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  based on ''frame and panel'', ''yoke and rack'' (based on post and rail seen in architecture) and ''bamboo'' construction techniques.  Chinese home [[furniture]] evolved independently of Western furniture into many similar forms including chairs, tables, stools, cupboards, cabinets, beds and sofas.  Until about the 10th century CE the Chinese sat on mats or low platforms using low tables, in typical Asian style, but then gradually moved to using high tables with chairs.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese furniture is mostly in plain polished wood, but from at least the [[Song dynasty]] the most luxurious pieces often used [[lacquer]] to cover the whole or parts of the visible areas.  All the various sub-techniques of [[Lacquerware#Chinese_lacquerware|Chinese lacquerware]] can be found on furniture, and become increasingly affordable down the social scale, and so widely used, from about the [[Ming dynasty]] onwards.  [[carved lacquer]] furniture was at first only affordable by the imperial family or the extremely rich, but by the 19th century was merely very expensive, and mostly found in smaller pieces or as decorated areas on larger ones.  It was especially popular on screens, which were common in China. Lacquer inlaid with [[mother of pearl]] was especially a technique used on furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese furniture is usually light where possible, anticipating Europe by several centuries in this respect.  Practical fittings in metal such as hinges, lock plates, drawer handles and protective plates at edges or feet are used, and often given considerable emphasis, but compared to classic fine European furniture purely decorative metal mounts were rare.  From the [[Qing dynasty]] furniture made for export, mostly to Europe, became a distinct style, generally made in rather different shapes to suit the destination markets and highly decorated in lacquer and other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese furniture for sitting or lying on was very often used with cushions, but textiles and upholstery are not, until very late historical periods, incorporated into the piece itself in the Western manner.  [[Openwork]] in carved wood or other techniques is very typical for practical purposes such as chair-backs, and also for decoration.  The Ming period is regarded as the "golden age" of Chinese furniture, though very few examples of earlier pieces survive. Ming styles have largely set the style for furniture in traditional Chinese style in subsequent periods, though as in other areas of [[Chinese art]], the 18th and 19th centuries saw increasing prosperity used for sometimes excessively elaborated pieces, as wider groups in society were able to imitate court styles.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural context==
What is now considered the Chinese aesthetic had its origins in [[China]] as far back as 1500–1000 BC. The furniture present in some of the artwork from that early period shows woven mats on elevated floors, sometimes accompanied by arm rests, providing seating accompanied by low tables. In this early period both unadorned and intricately engraved and painted pieces were already developing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinese-furniture.com/c_furniture/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  High chairs, usually single ones, had existed as status symbols, effectively [[throne]]s, since at least the [[Eastern Zhou]] period (771–256 BCE), but were not used with tables at the same level.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;    

[[Buddhism]], entering China around AD 200, brought with it the idea of (the Buddha) sitting upon a raised platform instead of simply mats. The platform was adopted as an honorific seat for special guests and dignitaries or officials. Longer versions were then used for reclining as well, which eventually evolved into the bed and daybed. Taller versions evolved into higher tables as well. The folding stool also proliferated similarly, after it was adapted from designs developed by nomadic tribes to the North and West, who used them for both their convenience and light weight in many applications such as mounting horses. Later, woven hourglass-shaped stools evolved; a design still in use today throughout China.

Some of the styles now widely regarded as Chinese began appearing more prominently in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD). It is here that evidence of early versions of the round and yoke back chairs are found, generally used by the elite. By the next two Dynasties (the Northern and Southern [[Song dynasty|Song]]) the use of varying types of furniture, including chairs, benches, and stools was common throughout Chinese society.  Two particular developments were recessed legs and waisted tables. Newer and more complex designs were generally limited to official and higher class use.

It was from this basis that more modern Chinese furniture developed its distinguishing characteristics. Use of thick lacquer finish and detailed engraving and painted decoration as well as pragmatic design elements would continue to flourish. Significant foreign design influence would not be felt until increased contact with the West began in the 19th century, due to efforts on the part of the ruling elite to limit trade.

During the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties previous bans on imports were lifted, allowing for larger quantities and varieties of woods to flood in from other parts of Asia. The use of denser wood led to much finer work, including more elaborate joinery.  A Ming [[Chinese lacquerware table|Imperial table entirely covered in carved lacquer]], now in London, is one of the finest survivals of the period.

==Four categories==
Chinese furniture traditionally consisted of four distinct categories, all formed by the mid Qing dynasty, but each with its own unique characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110119040216/http://web.peopledaily.com.cn/shch/199907/20/newfiles/F108.html Traditional Categories of Chinese furnitures]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Beijing]] category (京式家具): characterized by its simple build, directly developed from Ming Dynasty furnitures.
*[[Guangzhou]] category (广式家具): incorporating western influence, fully formed in the 19th century but dating back to at least 17th century&lt;ref&gt;[https://read01.com/e4kB0.html 廣式家具與嶺南文化]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Characterized by the adoptation of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] artistic styles, use of native timbers in the Lingnan region, and the decorative mounting of marble and the shells of shellfish.
*[[Shanghai]] category (海式家具): characterized by its decrorative carving and carved lacquer.
*[[Suzhou]] category (苏式家具): opposite to the Beijing category, characterized by its elaborate decoration, developed from early Qing Dynasty furnitures.

==Material==
Classic Chinese furniture is typically made of a class of hardwoods, known collectively as "rosewood" (紅木, literally "red wood"). These woods are denser than water, fine grained, and high in oils and resins. These properties make them dimensionally stable, hardwearing, rot and insect resistant, and when new, highly fragrant. The density and toughness of the wood also allows furniture to be built without the use of glue and nail, but rather constructed from joinery and doweling alone. According to the Chinese industry standards the woods are grouped into eight classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=乡土 |date=2010-09-01 |title=红木宝贝 |publisher=CCTV1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA-l5MXU3fI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=国家标准红木分类 |date=2010-06-20 |publisher=北京秋翁堂古典家具有限公司 |url=http://www.qiuwengtang.com/index.php?_m=mod_article&amp;_a=article_content&amp;_r=_page&amp;article_id=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furniture and carving made from these woods are typically referred to, in the market, as "hongmu furniture" (紅木家具, literally "rosewood furniture"). Due to [[overlogging]] for the said furniture, most of the species are either [[Threatened species|threatened]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]].

==Construction==
[[File:Yangminshan Zhongshan Furnishings.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chinese furniture in [[Taipei]]'s [[Zhongshan Building]]]]
Construction of traditional wooden Chinese furniture is based primarily of solid wood pieces connected solely using [[woodworking joints]], and rarely using glue or metallic nails. The reason was that the nails and glues used did not stand up well to the vastly fluctuating temperatures and humid weather conditions in most of Central and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Michael Huntley demystifies the furniture making techniques of Chinese craftsmen prior to 1900 |first=Michael |last=Huntley |date=20 January 2009 |publisher=GMC Publications |journal=Wood Worker's Institute |url=http://s1074.photobucket.com/user/mrconstantinela/media/ttjvj-ujp7f_zpsceo6lbix.jpg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the oily and resinous woods used in Chinese furniture generally do not glue well, even when pre-cleaned with modern industrial solvents.

Platform construction is based on box designs and uses frame-and-panel construction in simple form during earlier periods evolving into more and more modified forms in later periods.  While earlier pieces show full frame-and-panel construction techniques, different parts of the construction were modified through the centuries to produce diverse looking pieces which still share the same basic construction.  First the panel, originally complete, is subject to cut-out sections, followed by further reduction to what may appear to be simply decorative brackets.  Further refinement of the same pattern lead the shape of the decorative brackets being incorporated into the shape of the surrounding frame and simultaneously the two mitered vertical pieces comprising a corner become one solid piece. Pieces start to have small cross-pieces attached to the bottom of the feet rather than a frame that is equal on all sides and finally, with evolution of the complex woodworking joints that allow it, the cross-pieces are removed entirely, leaving a modern table with 3-way mitered corners.  Unlike European-derived styles, table designs based on this style will nearly always contain a frame-in-panel top, the panel serving as the tabletop center and the frame sometimes also serving as what would be rails on a European table. Cabinets in this style have a top that does not protrude beyond the sides or front. The critical element in almost all pieces of this type is the mitered joints, especially the 3-way mitered joining of the leg and two horizontal pieces at each corner.

The Yoke and Rack construction differs critically in the way that the legs of the piece are joined to the horizontal portion (be it tabletop, seat or cabinet carcass) using a type of wedged mortise-and-tenon joint where the end grain of the leg is visible as a circle in the frame of the tabletop. The cross-pieces (stretchers in the western equivalent) are joined through mortise-and-tenon joinery as well. The legs and stretchers are commonly round rather than square or curvilinear. The simplest pieces are simply four splayed legs attached to a solid top, but more complicated  pieces contain decorative brackets, drawers and metal latches. Cabinets in this style typically have an overhanging top similar to western-style cabinetry.

Bamboo construction style, although historically rooted in pieces made from bamboo, later saw many pieces made from hardwood with patterning to imitate the look of bamboo, or simply in the style of previous pieces made from bamboo. The construction is more similar to the Yoke and Rack style with some apparent crossover.

{{Denmark culture}}

'''Danish art''' is the visual arts produced in [[Denmark]] or by Danish artists. It goes back thousands of years with significant artifacts from the 2nd millennium BC, such as the [[Trundholm sun chariot]].  For many early periods, it is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  Art from what is today [[Denmark]] forms part of the art of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], and then [[Norse art|Norse]] and [[Viking art]].  Danish medieval painting is almost entirely known from [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]] such as those from the 16th-century artist known as the [[Elmelunde Master]].

The Reformation greatly disrupted Danish artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requirements of the court and aristocracy were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the 18th century that large numbers of Danes were trained in contemporary styles. For an extended period of time thereafter art in Denmark either was imported from Germany and the Netherlands or Danish artists studied abroad and produced work that was seldom inspired by Denmark itself. From the late 18th century on, the situation changed radically. Beginning with the [[Danish Golden Age]], a distinct tradition of Danish art began and has continued to flourish until today.  Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Danish art has a big production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Denmark has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Danish Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Denmark has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in Viking art, and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

==Nordic Bronze Age==
[[File:Gundestrupkarret1.jpg|thumb|The Gundestrup cauldron]]
[[Lur]]s are a distinctive type of giant curving Bronze Age horn, of which 35 of the 53 known examples have been found in bogs in Denmark, very often in pairs.  They are normally made of bronze, and often decorated.

A possibly alien find in Denmark is the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], a richly decorated [[Silversmithery|silver vessel]], thought to date to the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic-art/101803/112224/Gundestrup-Caldron-a-Celtic-ritual-vessel-1st-century-BC Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in 1891 in a [[peat bog]] near the hamlet of Gundestrup in north-eastern Jutland. The silversmithing of the plates is very skilled. The bowl, 70&amp;nbsp;cm across, was beaten from a single ingot.{{cn|date=December 2016}}  Now in the [[National Museum of Denmark]], it is the largest known example of European silver work from the period. The style and workmanship suggest [[Thracian]] origin, while the imagery seems [[Celtic art|Celtic]], so it may not reflect local styles.

==Norse art==
The [[Germanic Iron Age]] period of about 400-800 AD is represented by the [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]], now known only from drawings since they were stolen and melted down in 1802, and significant deposits from [[weapons sacrifice]] such as that at [[Illerup Ådal]], where 15,000 items were found, deposited during the period 200-500.

Danish sites have given their names to two of the six main styles of Viking or [[Norse art]], [[Jelling style]] (10th century) and its successor [[Mammen style]] (10-11th centuries), though the other styles are also represented in Denmark.  Only one Danish [[ship burial]] is known, from Ladbyskibet.  The images on the [[runestone]]s at [[Jelling stones|Jelling]] are probably the best known Danish works of the period.  Although little of their original paint remains today, copies of the largest stone in the [[National Museum of Denmark]] and in the museum at Jelling have been redecorated in vivid colours based on the fragments of paint which remained on the original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emu.dk/gsk/fag/his/historie-kanon/jellingsten.html Jellingstenen - en del af historiekanonen.

==Renaissance to the 18th century==
[[File:Landschaft mit Nordlicht.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape with Northern Lights - Attempt to Paint the Aurora Borealis'', 1790s, by [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]].]]
Danish [[panel painting]] and painted [[wood-carving]] of the late Middle Ages was mostly by, or heavily influenced by, the prevailing North German styles, especially those of [[Hamburg]] and other [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities.  At the [[Protestant Reformation]] religious painting virtually ceased, and for a long period the most notable portraits of the royal family were made by foreign artists, such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s portrait of [[Christina of Denmark]]. [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s portrait of her father [[Christian II of Denmark]], painted in [[Brussels]] in 1521, has not survived, though portraits of him by other foreign artists have.

The establishment of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1754 followed the general European pattern, and was intended to develop a national school and reduce the need to import artists from other countries.  After a period of development its pupils were indeed to lead the creation of a distinct Danish style.  After an architect, the third and fifth Director was [[Johannes Wiedewelt]] (1772–1777) and from (1780-1789), a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] sculptor trained in Italy and France, who had followed his father as court sculptor, and is remembered for his memorials and garden decorations including the monument of [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederick V]] in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] and the Naval Monument in Holmens Cemetery.  The first painter to lead it was the Swedish-born [[Carl Gustaf Pilo]] (c. 1711 – 1793), a portraitist and history painter in the grand style, and the next [[Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard]] (1743–1809), himself an ex-student, who developed a [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] style.  Leading Danish artists teaching at the Academy included [[Christian August Lorentzen]] and [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]], also later Director.  Unlike in England, for example, most leading Danish artists for at least the next century trained at the Academy and often returned to teach there, and the tension between [[academic art]] and other styles is much less a feature of Danish art history than that of France, England or other countries.
[[File:Thorvaldsens Ganymedes.jpg|thumb|''Ganymede and the Eagle'' by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]],  1817]]

A student of Abildgaard's period at the Academy was [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] (1770–1844), by far the most famous Danish sculptor, who along with the Italian [[Canova]] was recognised across Europe as the leading Neoclassical sculptor.  Among his works are the colossal series of statues of [[Jesus|Christ]] and the twelve [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] for the rebuilding of [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Vor Frue Kirke]] in Copenhagen. Motifs for his works (reliefs, statues, and busts) were drawn mostly from [[Greek mythology]], but he also created portraits of important personalities, as in his [[tomb monument]] for [[Pope Pius VII]] in [[St Peter's Basilica, Rome]]. His works can be seen in many European countries, but there is a very large collection at the [http://www.thorvaldsensmuseum.dk/ Thorvaldsen Museum] in Copenhagen.  He was based in Rome for many years, and played an important role in encouraging young Danish artists spending time in the city. Another important Neoclassicist produced by the Academy was the painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]], whose later career was all spent in Italy or Germany.

The establishment in 1775 of the [[Royal Copenhagen]] [[Porcelain]] Factory was another royal initiative, typical of monarchies in the period, though the business has outlasted the great majority of such factories, and survives today as part of a larger group, which also includes the [[Kosta Glasbruk]] glass company, founded in 1742 by two army officers, and the [[Orrefors Glasbruk]] (founded 1898), all known internationally.

==The Golden Age==
{{main|Danish Golden Age}}
[[File:C W Eckersberg 1841 - Kvinde foran et spejl.jpg|thumb|[[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]], ''Woman in front of a Mirror'', 1841. French Neo-Classicism transmuted into [[Biedermeier]] style.]]
Around the beginning of the 19th century the [[Golden Age of Danish Painting]] emerged to form a distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the 19th century.  It has a style drawing on [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], especially its [[landscape painting]],&lt;ref&gt;Dutch paintings, and landscapes, dominated in the 18th century Danish collections that we have records of. North, 308-9 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XGui9XJ3ObIC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=Danish+Golden+Age+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=a43wSteONozIyQTslY38AQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour.  The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends.  Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) and the Danish-trained leader of German Romantic painting [[Caspar David Friedrich]] was important in spreading its influence in Germany.

A crucial figure was [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]], who had studied in Paris with [[Jacques-Louis David]] and was further influenced towards [[Neo-Classicism]] by Thorwaldsen.  Eckersberg taught at the Academy from 1818 to 1853, becoming director from 1827 to 1828, and was an important influence on the following generation, in which landscape painting came to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/eckersberginfo.shtm Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg.

*[[Wilhelm Bendz]] (1804–1832), remembered for his many technically accomplished portraits of fellow artists such as [[Ditlev Blunck]] and Christen Christensen, a scene from the Academy's anatomy class, as well as the group portraits "A Tobacco Party" and "Artist in the Evening at Finck's Coffee House in Munich";
*[[Constantin Hansen]] (1804–1880), deeply interested in [[literature]] and [[mythology]], and inspired by [[Niels Laurits Høyen]], he developed national [[history painting|historical painting]] based on [[Norse mythology]] and painted many portraits, including the historical The Constitutional Assembly (''Den grundlovgivende Rigsforsamling'');
*[[Christen Købke]] (1810–1848), influenced by [[Niels Laurits Høyen]], an art historian who promoted a nationalistic approach calling for artists to search for subject matter in the folk life of their country instead of searching for themes in other countries such as Italy;
*[[Wilhelm Marstrand]] (1810–1873), a vastly productive artist who mastered a remarkable variety of genres, remembered especially for a number of his works which have become familiar signposts of Danish history and culture: scenes from the drawing-rooms and streets of Copenhagen during his younger days; the festivity and public life captured in Rome; the many representative portraits of citizens and innovators; even the monumentalist commissions for universities and the monarchy;
*[[Martinus Rørbye]] (1803–1848), remembered for his [[genre painting]]s of Copenhagen, for his landscapes and for his [[architectural painting]]s, as well as for the many sketches he made during his travels to countries rarely explored at the time.
Among other artists, [[C.A. Jensen]] (1792–1870) specialized almost exclusively in portraits.

At the end of the period painting style, especially in landscape art, became caught up in the political issue of the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]], a vital matter for Danes, but notoriously impenetrable for most others in Europe.

==Later 19th century==
[[File:FrdrksbrgBySkovgaard.jpg|thumb|right|[[P.C. Skovgaard]]: Frederiksborg Palace]]
Danish painting continued many of the characteristics of the Golden Age, but gradually moved closer to styles of the rest of Europe, especially Germany.  Artists include:
*[[Jørgen Roed]] (1808–1888), who painted many portraits as well as a number of altarpieces and religious paintings, including ''Jesu Korsfæstelse'' (Crucifixion of Jesus) for the restored church at [[Frederiksborg Palace]];
[[File:Gethsemane Carl Bloch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Heinrich Bloch|Carl Bloch]], ''Gethsemane'']]
*[[Johan Lundbye]] (1818–1848), remembered for his animal paintings and landscapes, especially those of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Sealand]] including the large ''Kystparti ved Isefjord'' (Coast View by Isefjord);
*[[P.C. Skovgaard]] (1817–1875), primarily known for his landscape paintings, for the special role he played in portraying Denmark’s nature, helping to develop a unique Danish art form, and his growing interest in portraying atmosphere and light.
[[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]] (1819–1881) was born in [[Żoliborz]] (Jolibord) a [[borough]] of [[Warsaw]] but moved to Denmark when she married Danish sculptor [[Jens Adolf Jerichau]] in 1846. She is best known for her portraits and was commissioned by the [[Danish Royal Family]] to paint their portraits to the annoyance and jealousy of local artists. The mild eroticism of a few of her paintings was looked upon unfavourably by many at the time but she remained aloof, perhaps reassured by the fact that some of her husband's sculptures were erotic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ellery Berg, (1884), ''The Drama, Painting, Poetry, and Song'', P.F. Collier, New York. digitized by Google.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Heinrich Bloch]] (1834–1890) was a rare Danish [[history painter]], mostly of Biblical subjects, who developed his [[academic art|academic]] style in Italy before returning to Copenhagen in 1866. He was commissioned to produce 23 paintings for the Chapel at [[Frederiksborg Palace]] consisting of scenes from the life of [[Christ]] which have become very popular as illustrations. For over 40 years [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has made much use of Carl Bloch's paintings, especially those from the Frederiksborg Palace collection, in its church buildings and printed media.

[[Edvard Eriksen]] (1876–1959) is best known as the sculptor of the bronze ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|Little Mermaid]]'' statue in [[Copenhagen]]. Based on the story by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], he completed the work in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=edvarderiksen Edvard Christian Johannes Eriksen.

In 1871, [[Holger Drachmann]] (1846–1908) and [[Karl Madsen]] (1855–1938) visited [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]] where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia's most successful [[Skagen Painters|artists' colonies]]. They were soon joined by [[P.S. Krøyer]] (1851–1909), [[Carl Locher]] (1851–1915), [[Laurits Tuxen]] (1853–1927), the Norwegian [[Christian Skredsvig]] (1854–1924) and [[Michael Ancher|Michael]] (1849–1927) and [[Anna Ancher]] (1859–1935). All participated in painting the natural surroundings and local people. The symbolist [[Jens Ferdinand Willumsen]] (1863–1958) also visited the Skagen community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/skagen Art Encyclopedia: Skagen.] Retrieved 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A little later, at the very beginning of the 20th century, a similar phenomenon developed on the island of [[Funen]] with the encouragement of [[Johannes Larsen]] (1867–1961) and the inspiration of [[Theodor Philipsen]]. ''Fynboerne'' or the [[Funen Painters]] included: [[Peter Hansen (painter)|Peter Hansen]], [[Fritz Syberg]], [[Jens Birkholm]], [[Karl Schou]], [[Harald Giersing]], [[Anna Syberg]], [[Christine Swane]] and [[Alhed Larsen]].

[[Paul Gustave Fischer]] (1860–1934) was a romantic impressionistic painter specialising in city street scenes and bright bathing compositions.

[[Vilhelm Hammershøi]] (1864–1916) was considered something of an enigma in his lifetime but is now remembered mainly for his subdued paintings of interiors, usually empty spaces (as in ''[[Dust Motes Dancing in Sunbeams]]'') but occasionally with a solitary figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityam.com/index.php?news=16058 The weird soul of Danish painting from City A.M.] Retrieved 6 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fodboldspillere. Sofus header..jpg|thumb|Harald Giersing: ''Fodboldspillere. Sofus header'' (Soccer players. Sofus heads), 1917]]
Danish [[expressionism|expressionist]] landscape painting developed between the world wars with [[Jens Søndergaard]] and [[Oluf Høst]] as its main representatives. In parallel, younger artists such as [[Niels Lergaard]], [[Lauritz Hartz]] and [[Karl Bovin]] adopted the light French colours and formalism of [[modernism]], founding the [[Corner painters|Corner group of artists]] in 1932. Around the same time, [[Edvard Weie]], the Swedish artist [[Karl Isakson]], [[Olaf Rude]], [[Kræsten Iversen]], [[Oluf Høst]] and [[Niels Lergaard]] were attracted by the natural beauty of the Baltic islands of [[Bornholm]] and the much smaller [[Christiansø]]. Together they initiated the so-called [[Bornholm school of painters|Bornholm School]] providing the basis of the permanent exhibition at the [[Bornholm Art Museum]] near [[Gudhjem]].  Painters of nature and everyday life such as [[Erik Hoppe]] and [[Knud Agger]] initiated the highly successful [[Grønningen]] association which provided a platform for exhibitions in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Visual-Arts/1900-1945/Expressionism/ Expressionism from denmark.dk.] Retrieved 9 December 2008.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234141/http://denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Visual-Arts/1900-1945/Expressionism/ |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigurd Swane]] (1879–1973) was initially influenced by the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] in Paris when he began a series of paintings of woodlands rich in greens, yellows and blues.

[[Danish design]] became of international importance in the decades after World War II, especially in furniture, where it pioneered a style sometimes known as [[Danish modern]], the forerunner of the general [[Scandinavian Design]] style popularized by [[IKEA]].  Important designers include [[Finn Juhl]] (1912–1989), [[Hans Wegner]] (1914–2007) and [[Arne Jacobsen]] (1902–1971).

The [[Statens Museum for Kunst|National Museum of Art]] and the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek|Glyptotek]], both in Copenhagen, contain treasures of Danish and international art.

*[[Richard Winther]] (1926–2007) a talented Danish artist, started his long career in the arts aged 10.  He worked on themes exploring mediums such as painting, photography, and ceramics.  He is considered as one of the founders of the Linien II movement, part of concrete art at the time.  Several {{who|date=October 2011}} known artists today have been greatly influenced by Richard Winther.  Many of his paintings were done on canvas and [[masonite]], but in an effort to simplify his art he not only diminished the number of colors he used but also switched to paint on cardboard. He was not shy about revisiting a theme and many years later amended some of his works.  Also several of his works are presented on both sides of the same cardboard. He used photographic cameras to compose art and when he was not satisfied with the capabilities of the machines, he started making his own designs.  He is known for his 360 degree cameras, instruments which are objects of art in themselves. Among the many prizes he was awarded, were the Eckersberg Medal (1971), Thorvaldsen Medal (1997) and the Prince Eugen Medal.
*[[Per Kirkeby]] (born 1938) has produced an impressive body of [[neo-expressionism|neo-expressionistic]] artwork on [[masonite]], canvas, blackboards and paper as well as various sculptures and even architecture.

===Margrethe II's tapestries===
On the occasion of her 50th birthday in 1990, [[Queen Margrethe II]] decided to use a gift from industry of 13 million Danish crowns to produce a series of tapestries tracing the history of Denmark from the beginnings to the present day. Woven by the historic [[Gobelins Manufactory|Manufacture des Gobelins]] in Paris, the tapestries were based on full-sized sketches by the versatile Danish artist [[Bjørn Nørgaard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjoernnoergaard.dk/gobeliner/index_eng.html Tapestries for the Queen of Denmark.

[[Image:Guy Rose - The Blue Kimono.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Guy Rose]]. ''The Blue Kimono''. His work has been termed Decorative Impressionism.]]

'''Decorative Impressionism''' is an art historical term that is credited to the art writer Christian Brinton, who first used it in 1911{{where|date=May 2016}}. Brinton titled an article on the American expatriate painter [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]], one of the members of the famous Giverny Colony of American Impressionists, "The Decorative Impressionist."

However, use of the term has been revived in recent decades by the influential and prolific art historian [[William H. Gerdts]] to describe the figurative works of not only Frieseke, but some of his Giverny compatriots including [[Richard E. Miller]], [[Louis Ritman]] and Robert Reid. The same term has been applied to other Giverny school painters who painted the figure including [[Guy Rose]], [[Karl Anderson (artist)|Karl Anderson]] and [[Karl Albert Buehr]]. Decorative Impressionism describes a way of painting the human figure that attempts to reconcile academic techniques with Impressionist and Post-Impressionist influences.

The works of these artists tend to be either high-key outdoor depictions of women in languid poses, or interior scenes with the figures illuminated by natural light from windows. Many of these highly decorative paintings have a recognizable influence from Japanese art or [[Japonisme]], with the strong use of patterns in the backgrounds. The work of the originators of first Decorative Impressionists was popular from about 1905 until the mid-1920s, but the style continued until at least the middle of the 20th century through the work of some of the students of the Giverny painters and, the style has been revived in recent years by some contemporary figurative painters.

==Giverny==

While American artists had been painting in the small village of [[Giverny]] since the 1880s, the group of painters who developed the characteristic style known as Decorative Impressionism settled in Normandy after the turn of the 20th Century. They came to a similar way of working because their academic training was similar; they were aware and interested in the developments of [[French Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]]; and wanted to adopt some elements from these movements into their own work. Each of them had their own way of working, their own degree of solidity on their figures and their own style of brushwork, but they were all joined together by the beauty of their subjects and their decorative approach.

[[File:Frederick Carl Frieseke - Femme dans un jardin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick Frieseke]]. ''Lady in a Garden''.]]

[[Frederick Frieseke]] was a Michigan born and Chicago-trained artist who had studied in Paris. The American expatriate settled in Giverny in 1906 where he painted female figures in outdoor settings, often using a pastel palette. Influenced by Renoir, Frieseke's canvasses were carefully designed and he often juxtaposed one pattern against another. [[Richard Edward Miller]] was raised and trained in St. Louis, Missouri and he studied in France at the [[Académie Julian]] briefly before his first large figurative works paintings were accepted in the Paris Salon. His early works featured well-drawn figures with more loosely rendered backgrounds, but after he settled in Giverny, his work became brighter and he developed a style where his figures were well modeled, but the backgrounds were often patterns of small brush strokes. [[Image:Miller Girl-with-Guitar550.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard E. Miller]]. ''Girl with a Guitar (Daydreams)'' (1916-17).]]

The California-born artist Guy Rose studied in San Francisco and Paris, coming first under the influence of the Naturalist School and then French Impressionism. He is often described as the most French of the California Impressionists and he visited Giverny before finally settling their with his wife Ethel in 1904. Rose was both a landscape and figurative painter and in Giverny, he painted female figures in outdoor light, keeping the draftsmanship he learned in Paris for the figures and using a more Impressionist style for the setting.

[[Lawton S. Parker]] was an artist and teacher who traveled frequently between the United States and Europe and he settled in Giverny in 1903. Even though Parker shared a Giverny garden with Frieseke, he is not credited with painting figures in garden settings extensively until about 1909. Then, he painted the same sorts of subjects as his Giverny companions. [[Edmund Greacen]] was a New Yorker and he arrived in Giverny in 1907 where he painted a series of garden and domestic subjects in a painterly manner, with a clear French influence. The Chicago-trained painter Karl Anderson was only in Giverny a short time, but it changed the direction of his career and he will always be identified with the French village because he adopted the same subjects and a similar way of working.

[[Image:Reid Robert Lewis Girl with Flowers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]]. ''Girl with Flowers''.]]

In December 1910, six of the Giverny painters - Frieseke, Miller, Parker, Rose, Graecen and Anderson were given a show at the Madison Gallery in New York which termed them "The Giverny Group" and one of the reviews called them "Impressionists of the very best sort." The German-born Chicago painter Karl Albert Buehr came to Giverny about 1909 and spent summers there until 1912. In Giverny, he turned to painting women in outdoor light, leaving behind the darker tonalities and landscape subjects of his earlier work. Buehr too became associated with Giverny and with French Impressionism and he passed his confidence in the Impressionist palette to his many students.

A younger artist, [[Louis Ritman]], was Russian born and Chicago-trained and he came to Giverny in 1911 and spent the next eighteen summers there, even during World War I, when most of the Americans had left for home. Ritman was highly influenced by Frieseke and he painted women in interior and outdoor settings, usually approaching the figure with some delicacy and handing the background in a manner reminiscent of French Impressionism.

Another American painter whose work clearly falls under the description of "Decorative Impressionism" is [[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]]. Although Reid was not part of the Giverny Colony, he was Paris-trained and at the same time it was active, he was working out his own solution of how to reconcile his academic training with a decorative aspect. His solution was different from the Giverny painters. He used boldly decorative compositions, full of cool tones, that had a distinct organic influence that made them reminiscent of [[Art Nouveau]].

==A second generation==

[[Image:lukits orientalharmony550.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodore Lukits]]. ''Oriental Harmony'' (1918).]]

Because several members of the Giverny Colony were teachers and mentors to a number of other American painters, their style of painting lived on through the works of their students. Two of these artists, the Chicago trained painters [[Theodore Lukits]] and [[Christian von Schneidau]] both ended up in California, where American Impressionism remained popular for a longer time than anywhere else. Both Lukits and Von Schneidau were students of the Giverny Impressionist Karl Albert Buehr, at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where they both excelled and won traveling scholarships. Both were also students of Richard E. Miller. Lukits studied with Miller in St. Louis, when he was a young prodigy and von Schenidau studied with him in the art colony of [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] where Miller lived until his death. 

Lukits was already doing large, decorative works with well modeled figures and highly patterned backgrounds in Chicago in 1918 and 1919 and he continued the practice in California, with many works of Asian subjects like the silent film actor [[Sōjin Kamiyama]] and portraits like "Mrs. Ray Milland" (1942). Theodore Lukits used the term "Decorative Portraits" himself in describing such works, so the alignment with Brinton's original thesis is clear. Like Miller's work, the artist painted the figure quite realistically, but created the background with more decorative elements. Von Schneidau did several large, very decorative portraits that were exhibited widely in the 1920s and reproduced including "5'O'clock (Mrs. Elwood Riggs)" and "Mary Pickford (Reading the Sundial).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9487">In [[geometry]], the ''demiregular tilings'' are a set of Euclidean [[tessellation]]s made from 2 or more [[regular polygon]] faces. Different authors have listed different sets of tilings. A more systematic approach looking at [[symmetry orbit]]s are the [[2-uniform tiling]]s of which there are 20. Some of the demiregular ones are actually [[3-uniform tiling]]s.

Critchlow identifies 14 demi-regular tessellations, with 7 being 2-uniform, and 7 being 3-uniform.

He codes letter names for the vertex types, with superscripts to distinguish face orders. He recognizes A, B, C, D, F, and J can't be a part of continuous coverings of the whole plane.

[[File:Its a bore.jpg|thumb|A cigarette advertisement on a billboard turned into a ''détournement'' by defacing the cowboy image and modifying the text, probably including "Marlboro," to read "It's a bore."]]
A '''détournement''' ({{IPA-fr|detuʁnəmɑ̃|lang}}), meaning "rerouting, hijacking" in [[French language|French]], is a technique developed in the 1950s by the [[Letterist International]],&lt;ref name="nues8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sami.is.free.fr/Oeuvres/debord_wolman_mode_emploi_detournement.html |title=Mode d'emploi du détournement |last1=Debord |first1=Guy-Ernest |last2=Wolman |first2=Gil J. |date=May 1956 |language=French |publisher=biblioteque-virtuelle |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later adapted by the [[Situationist International]] (SI),&lt;ref name="ReportManifesto57"&gt;''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI58"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline///si/is1.html |journal=Situationist International |number=1 |title=Definitions |date=June 1958 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was defined in the SI's inaugural 1958 journal as "[t]he integration of present or past artistic productions into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of those means. In a more elementary sense, ''détournement'' within the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method which reveals the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres."&lt;ref name="SI58" /&gt;&lt;ref name="si58french"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ubumexico.centro.org.mx/text/si/Internationale_situationniste_1.pdf |journal=internationale situationiste |title=Définitions |language=French |quote=Intégration de productions actuelles ou passées des arts dans une construction supérieure du milieu. Dans ce sens il ne peut y avoir de peinture ou de musique situationniste, mais un usage situationniste de ces moyens. Dans un sens plus primitif, le détournement à l'intérieur des sphères culturelles anciennes est une méthode de propagande, qui témoigne de l'usure et de la perte d'importance de ces sphères. |page=13 |number=1 |date=June 1958 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It has been defined elsewhere as "turning expressions of the capitalist system and its [[media culture]] against itself"&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"&gt;Douglas B. Holt: Cultural Strategy Using Innovative Ideologies to Build Breakthrough Brands, Oxford University Press 2010, p.252&lt;/ref&gt;—as when slogans and logos are turned against their advertisers or the political status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kaste [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=141526467 ''Exploring Occupy Wall Street's 'Adbuster' Origins''], ''NPR'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Détournement was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called [[situationist prank]] that was reprised by the [[punk movement]] in the late 1970s&lt;ref name="Marrone05"&gt;Marrone, Gianfranco (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0jluoyGktKsC&amp;pg=PT43 ''Sensi alterati: droghe, musica, immagini''], p.45, quote: "...gioco al complotto, alla manipolazione dei media, alla beffa, alla "grande truffa," o al ''detournement'' – inventato dai situazionisti e ripreso dai punk – che appunto del situazionismo sono talvolta concreti continuatori. Pensiamo in questo senso al fin troppo noto caso, esagerato dai media, ma paradigmatico, del manager dei Sex Pistols, [[Malcolm McLaren]], a partire dal quale, nell'estate del 1977, si scatenò, con grande scandalo, il lancio del gruppo dei Pistols in pieno Giubileo della regina, e l'interesse della stampa per la nascente scena punk. Tuttavia, anche in questo caso non si tratta, come invece è stato spesso sostenuto, di freddo "gioco a tavolino", di cinismo, di furbo lancio di un prodotto da parte di chi aveva studiato i media e lavorava sulla guerriglia semiologica (cfr. Fabbri P. 2002, p.40), di una tattica che sarebbe poi stata facilmente sfruttata e fatta propria da quel momento in avanti dall'industria culturale ''mainstream''."&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired the [[culture jamming]] movement in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt;

Its opposite is [[recuperation (politics)|recuperation]], in which radical ideas or the social image of people who are viewed negatively are twisted, commodified, and absorbed in a more socially acceptable context.

==Definition==
In general it can be defined as a variation on previous work, in which the newly created work has a meaning that is antagonistic or antithetical to the original. The original media work that is ''détourned''&lt;!-- must check if détourned is syntactically correct --&gt; must be somewhat familiar to the target audience, so that it can appreciate the opposition of the new message. The artist or commentator making the variation can reuse only some of the characteristic elements of the originating work.

Détournement is similar to [[satire|satirical]] [[parody]], but employs more direct reuse or faithful [[mimicry]] of the original works rather than constructing a new work which merely alludes strongly to the original.  It may be contrasted with [[recuperation (sociology)|recuperation]], in which originally subversive works and ideas are themselves [[cultural appropriation|appropriated]] by mainstream media.

One could view détournement as forming the opposite side of the coin to '[[recuperation (politics)|recuperation]]' (where radical ideas and images become safe and commodified), in that images produced by the spectacle get altered and subverted so that rather than supporting the ''status quo'', their meaning becomes changed in order to put across a more radical or oppositional message.

[[Guy Debord]] and [[Gil J Wolman]] categorized détourned elements into two types: ''minor détournements'' and ''deceptive détournements''. Minor détournements are détournements of elements that in themselves are of no real importance such as a snapshot, a press clipping, an everyday object which draw all their meaning from being placed in a new context. Deceptive détournements are when already significant elements such as a major political or philosophical text, great artwork or work of literature take on new meanings or scope by being placed in a new context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/detourn.htm A User's Guide To Détournement May 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

Détournement is the integration of past or present artistic production into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of these means. In a more primitive sense, détournement with the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method that testifies to the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres.&lt;ref name="SI58" /&gt;&lt;ref name="si58french"/&gt;

== Examples after the Situationist International ==
In the United States, [[Frank Discussion]] is widely known for his use of détournement in his works dating from the late 1970s through the present, particularly with the [[Feederz]]. The use of détournement by [[Barbara Kruger]] familiarised many with the technique, and it was extensively and effectively used as part of the early [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|HIV/AIDS activism]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Crimp, Douglas.  ''AIDS Demographics''. Bay Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of contemporary detournement include [[Adbusters]]' "[[subvertising|subvertisements]]" and other instances of [[culture jamming]], as well as poems composed collaboratively by [[Marlene Mountain]], [[Paul Conneally]], and others, in which quotations from such famous sources as the [[Ten Commandments]] and quotations by [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]] are combined with haiku-like phrases to produce a larger work intended to subvert the original source.  The comic artist [[Brad Neely]]'s reinterpretation of [[Harry Potter]], ''[[Wizard People, Dear Reader|Wizard People]],'' took Warner Brother's first Harry Potter film, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|The Sorcerer's Stone]],'' and substituted the original soundtrack with a narration that casts the hero as a [[Nietzschean]] [[Übermensch|superman]].

The concept of détournement has had a popular influence amongst contemporary radicals, and the technique can be seen in action in the present day when looking at the work of [[Culture Jammer]]s including the [[Cacophony Society]], [[Billboard Liberation Front]], [[monochrom]], Occupy Movements&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JD8jNCQ2gw Détournement of Bronzed Historical Icons adorns imaginary John Harvard with a Guy Fawkes mask]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adbusters]], whose 'subvertisements' 'detourn' [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] adverts, for example. In this case, the original advertisement's imagery is altered in order to draw attention to said company's policy of shifting their production base to cheap-labour third-world '[[free trade zone]]s'. However, the line between 'recuperation' and 'détournement' can become thin (or at least very fuzzy) at times, as [[Naomi Klein]] points out in her book ''[[No Logo]]''. Here she details how [[corporation]]s such as Nike, [[Pepsi]] or Diesel have approached Culture Jammers and Adbusters and offered them lucrative contracts in return for partaking in 'ironic' promotional campaigns. She points out further irony by drawing attention to merchandising produced in order to promote Adbusters' [[Buy Nothing Day]], an example of the recuperation of détournement if ever there was one.

Klein's arguments about irony [[wikt:reify|reifying]] rather than breaking down power structures are echoed by [[Slavoj Žižek]]. Žižek argues that the kind of distance opened up by détournement is the condition of possibility for ideology to operate: by attacking and distancing oneself from the sign-systems of capital, the subject creates a fantasy of transgression that "covers up" his/her actual complicity with capitalism as an overarching system. In contrast, scholars are very fond of pointing out the differences between [[hypergraphics]], 'detournement', the [[postmodern]] idea of [[cultural appropriation|appropriation]] and the [[Neoist]] use of [[plagiarism]] as the use of different and similar techniques used for different and similar means, effects and causes.

The [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] has a long history of aggressive détournement of extreme political ideologies, as do several [[industrial music|industrial music groups]], such as [[Die Krupps]], [[Nitzer Ebb]], [[KMFDM]], and [[Front 242]].

[[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] uses détournement and [[culture jamming]] extensively in his work, particularly in the British television series ''[[The Day Today]]'' and ''[[Brass Eye]]''.

The [[Istanbul]]-based platform InEnArt, on the occasion of the [[Istanbul Biennial|13th Istanbul Biennial]] 2013, launched  a forum titled Urban Voices focusing on phenomena that are turning expressions of the system and its media culture against itself. The authors of InEnArt are regularly publishing different phenomenas of détournement and invite the online community to participate by uploading similar examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Public Space as a Political Forum|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?page_id=11121|work=InEnArt|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Educational entertainment''' (also referred to by the [[portmanteau]] [[neologism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/edutainment |title=Definition of "Edutainment" |access-date=2015-02-14 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214122205/http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/edutainment |archive-date=2015-02-14 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''edutainment'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/edutainment |title=edutainment |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |access-date=2012-10-16 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113084132/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/edutainment |archive-date=2012-11-13 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is media designed to [[education|educate]] through [[entertainment]]. Most often it includes content intended to teach but has incidental entertainment value. It has been used by academia, corporations, governments, and other entities in various countries to disseminate information in classrooms and/or via television, radio, and other media to influence viewers' opinions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rapeepisarn |first1=K. |last2=Wong |first2=K.

== History ==

=== Concept ===
Interest in combining education with entertainment, especially in order to make learning more enjoyable, has existed for hundreds of years, with the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] being movements in which this combination was presented to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Edutainment or Education: Education Possibilities of Didactic Games in Science Education|format=pdf|date=September 2007|location=Brno, Czech Republic|url=http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|access-date=12 April 2017|editor=Němec, J.|pages=55–64|conference=ICCP Brno Conference|last1=Trna|first1=Josef|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817210858/http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Amos Comenius|Komenský]] in particular is affiliated with the “school as play” concept, which proposes [[pedagogy]] with dramatic or delightful elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Poor Richard Almanack 1739.jpg|link=[[:File:Poor Richard Almanack 1739]].jpg|left|thumb|213x213px|''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'']]
[[Poor Richard's Almanack|''Poor Richard’s Almanack'']] demonstrates early implementation of edutainment, with [[Benjamin Franklin]] combining entertaining and educational content, such as puzzles and rules of conduct, into an instructional entity for colonists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|title=Turning to Education for Fun|last=Beato|first=Greg|date=2015-03-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-12|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105130008/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|archivedate=2017-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later development of the concept of edutainment can be tied to [[Walt Disney]], with his first educational short film, [[Tommy Tucker's Tooth|''Tommy Tucker’s Tooth'']], being commissioned and shot in 1922 for the Deneer Dental Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Diane Disney (1957). ''The Story of Walt Disney''. NY: Henry Holt and Co. p. 79. {{ISBN|978-0-7868-5562-9}}. As cited in Shale, Richard (1982). ''Donald Duck Joins Up: The Walt Disney Studio During World War II''. Ann Arbor, Michigan: UMI Research Press. p. 15.{{ISBN|9780835713108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the [[United States|U.S.]] into [[World War II]] also had a major impact on the popularity of educational entertainment, as a relationship between Disney and the U.S. government formed; Disney was able to experiment with educational and nonfiction films in a way that continued even after the war,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Donald Duck Joins Up: The Walt Disney Studio During World War II|last=Shale|first=Richard|publisher=UMI Research Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8357-1310-8|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=67, 109, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; with series such as ''[[True-Life Adventures]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Walt and the Promise of Progress City|last=Gennawey|first=Sam|publisher=Ayefour Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-0-615-54024-5|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walt Disney's Disneyland|''Disneyland'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newell|first=Catherine L.|title=The Strange Case of Dr. von Braun and Mr. Disney: Frontierland, Tomorrowland, and America’s Final Frontier|journal=The Journal of Religion and Popular Culture|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=416–429|doi=10.3138/jrpc.25.3.416|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the transcript of an interview with [[Alexander P. de Seversky]] from The Walt Disney Archives, of which its date and interviewer is unknown,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; the following quotation is found:{{Quote|text=It is a new kind of entertainment that goes far beyond simply "amusing" its audience.

With dramatic action it exposes the basic ideas that will rid the mind of confusion and clarify the war thinking of the public.|sign=Walt Disney|source=Interview with Alexander de Seversky}}Since the 1970s, various groups in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Latin America have used edutainment to address health and social issues such as [[substance abuse]], [[immunization]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and [[cancer]]. Initiatives in major universities, such as [[Johns Hopkins University]]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|last2=Michael J.|first2=Cody|last3=Rogers|first3=Everett M.|last4=Sabido|first4=Miguel|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-1-135-62456-9|location=|pages=7, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], [[NGOs]] such as PCI-Media Impact, and government agencies such as the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC)&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/|title=Entertainment Education {{!}} Gateway to Health Communication {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120135351/https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/ToolsTemplates/EntertainmentEd/|archivedate=2017-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have produced edutainment content.

Modern forms of edutainment include television productions, film, museum exhibits, and computer software which use entertainment to attract and maintain an audience, while incorporating deliberate educational content or messages. It is also apparent that educational elements are becoming implemented into traditionally recreational realms, such as vacations and games.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Terminology ===
The term edutainment was used as early as 1954 by [[Walt Disney]] to describe the ''[[True Life Adventures]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DISNEY|first=WALT|date=1954-01-01|title=EDUCATIONAL VALUES IN FACTUAL NATURE PICTURES|jstor=42922993|journal=Educational Horizons|volume=33|issue=2|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noun]] ''edutainment'' is a [[Neologism|neologistic]] [[portmanteau]] used by Robert Heyman in 1973 while producing documentaries for the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Marta Rey-López et al. A Model for Personalized Learning. In: Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems. Springer. Berlin. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by Dr. Chris Daniels in 1975 to encapsulate the theme of his Millennium Project. This project later became known as The Elysian World Project.&lt;ref name="elysianworld2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elysianworld.com|title=Elysian World|publisher=elysianworld.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217052758/http://elysianworld.com/|archivedate=December 17, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offshoot word "Edutainer" has been used by Craig Sim Webb since before the turn of the millennium to describe an individual who offers edutainment presentations and performances.&lt;ref name="edutainer2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutainer.ca|title=Inspirational speakers – Professional Inspirational Speaker, Performer, Songwriter &amp; Author|publisher=edutainer.ca|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027001013/http://edutainer.ca/|archivedate=October 27, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==

=== Audio and video ===
''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' are examples of shows that use [[music]] and video to teach topics like math, science, and history. Using music to aid memory dates back to the passing of ancient oral traditions, including the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Much of what edutainment can offer through audio and video especially, is accessible over the internet on platforms such as [[YouTube]], with such channels as ''[[Vsauce]]'', ''[[CGP Grey]]'', ''[[MinutePhysics]]'', ''Meet Arnold, ''[[Veritasium]]'', and ''[[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]]''.

[[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]] is a band that incorporates audio and footage from the [[British Film Institute]] into their music and performances, and this partnership helps the British Film Institute showcase its material; their album ''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|Inform—Educate—Entertain]]''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|,]] which covers topics such as the climbing of [[Mount Everest]] and [[highway safety]], demonstrates the connection between the concept of edutainment and their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|title=The Archival Delights of Public Service Broadcasting|date=2015-02-24|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-04-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422133120/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|archivedate=2017-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film and television ===
{{Main|Educational television}}

Motion pictures with educational content appeared as early as 1943, such as ''[[Private Snafu]]'', and can still be seen in films such as ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. After [[World War II]], educational entertainment shifted towards television. Television programs can be divided into three main categories: those with primarily educational intentions, those with a high degree of both education and entertainment, and entertainment shows with incidental or occasional educational value.

Mexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s a form of edutainment via [[telenovelas]], "soap operas for social change". The "Sabido  method" has been adopted in many other countries subsequently, including India, Peru, Kenya, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Rosin, "Life Lessons: How Soap Operas Can Change the World", ''The New Yorker'', June 5, 2006, pp. 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, the government in the 1970s successfully used a telenovela to promote family planning to curb the country's high birthrate.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga, "'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world." ''Sexuality Research and Social Policy''. September 2007, vol. 4,, no. 3 pp. 19-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third season of the television show ''MTV Shuga'' was analyzed by researchers and then published online in 2017 in terms of its effects related to its goal of educating African youth about [[Sexual Health|sexual health]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV]], and secondarily, [[Gender based violence|gender-based violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|title=MTV Shuga Soap Opera Turns Edutainment into a Tool to Fight HIV and Gender-Based Violence|last=|first=|date=2017-02-27|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422212033/http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|archive-date=2017-04-22|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]], those in the treatment group who watched the show for six months were “almost twice as likely” to get tested at HIV testing centers; mixed results were found in regards to the show’s effects on gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|title=EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF MTV SHUGA: CHANGING SOCIAL NORMS AND BEHAVIORS WITH ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION|last=Banerjee|first=Abhijit|last2=La Ferrara|first2=Eliana|date=2017|website=World Bank|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174725/http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-15|dead-url=no|access-date=|last3=Orozco|first3=Victor|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article [["Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning"]] Walt Disney believed in education through the entertainment of film and television. He is known as the master of communications who brought both entertainment and education into the world in distinctive ways. His creation of mickey mouse and his adventures taught his audience that life is not always so simple, there will be obstacles that will stand in your way. Mickey mouse's is unpolished and imperfect which make him so realistic to his audience. In many of his stories we see him battle and adventure which he overcomes teach a value in life for viewers, keep going in life. Disney achieved and educational characteristic in his work through the picture series of live animals in their natural habitat by which some film techniques added to the drama of the series. This series was one that satisfied Walt Disney the most as it obtained both the qualities of entertainment and education, which was the characteristics of this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1491447|title=Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning|first=Ralph S.|last=Izard|date=12 May 1967|publisher=|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|volume=45|issue=1|pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
Educating the public about health issues is a focus for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, several initiatives have used educational entertainment principles to highlight specific conditions or wider healthcare issues. Examples include In Memory about dementia,&lt;ref name="HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY"&gt;{{cite web|title=HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY|url=https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|website=Bedrock|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022823/https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millefeuille about psoriasis&lt;ref name="Millefeuille"&gt;{{cite web|title=Millefeuille|url=http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|website=Millefeuille|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030657/http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and This is Axiom about the challenges facing the UK's National Health Service.&lt;ref name="This is Axiom"&gt;{{cite web|title=This is Axiom|url=http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|website=This is Axiom|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020639/http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Games ===
{{Main|Educational game}}

Games fulfill a number of educational purposes. Some games may be explicitly designed with education in mind, while others may have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games, including [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and video games, may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are designed to teach people about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.

According to Paraskeva (2010), at least 68% of American households play video games. Many recent research articles postulate education and gaming can be joined to provide academic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paraskeva | first1 = F. | last2 = Mysirlaki | first2 = S. | last3 = Papgianni | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Multiplayer online games as educational tools: Facing new challenges in learning | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131509002413 | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 498–505 | doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Van Eck (2006), there are three reasons why games are considered learning tools: 1. Ongoing research that has included the last 20 years of educational findings have proven that digital games can be educational; 2. The new generation of today wants "multiple streams of information" (p.&amp;nbsp;1), which includes quick and frequent interaction that allows inductive reasoning; and 3. The mere popularity of games has created a billion-dollar industry. The idea of playing a game assumes the person is engaging in that activity by choice. The activity should have some value of "fun". This does not mean that the person is engaging in the activity only for leisure pursuits; it can also include the desire to learn a skill, connect with other gamers (social community), and spend time in a chosen activity. The activity needs to remain one of choice for the gamer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Eck|first=R.|year=2006|title=Digital game-based learning: It's not just the digital natives who are restless...|publisher=Educase Review|volume=41|issue=2|pages=1–16|url=http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229182518/http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|archivedate=2016-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim (2008) supports the use of off-the-shelf games with [[Metacognition|meta-cognitive]] strategies to provide an increase in students' cognitive performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, B., Park, H., &amp; Baek, Y. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers and Education, 52, 800-810&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio and podcasts ===

[[Radio]] can serve as an effective vehicle for educational entertainment. The British radio soap opera ''[[The Archers]]'' has for decades been systematically educating its audience on agricultural matters; likewise, the [[Tanzania]]n radio soap opera ''Twende na Wakati'' ("Let's Go With the Times") was written primarily to promote [[family planning]].

Likewise, [[podcast]]s have begun to exemplify the concept of edutainment, with some radio programs also becoming available in this digital format. Not only are there are series with educational elements that are listened to recreationally, but there are also [[Uses of podcasting#Education and academia|podcasts used as an educational tool]]. Lessons based on podcasts have increased in popularity, with [[Teacherspayteachers.com|''TeachersPayTeachers'']] finding that lesson plans relating to podcasts rose in downloads by 21 percent and 650 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, which corresponded with the release of ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|title=Using 'Serial' to Get Students to Read More|last=Godsey|first=Michael|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209125945/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|archivedate=2017-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toys ===
{{Main|Educational toy}}

Toys are perhaps the earliest "edutainment" objects a person encounters, as many toys have also an educational aspect beside their [[aesthetic]] appeal. They can teach children literacy, numerical, conceptual or motor skills. Many toys (e.g., a miniature [[piano]]) are simply colorful, scaled-down versions of more complex objects, and thus can base children in skills and benefits associated with the latter. It is up to grown-ups to guide children to the toy's proper use in order to make the most out of it.

Toys are often employed in the context of [[mimicry]] and [[roleplay]] to partially experience personalities or situations not otherwise possible, very akin to [[simulation]] in video games. They can be used as primitive means to nurture an [[instinct]] or a [[character trait]] in children. Often, toys work simultaneously the other way, providing children with the means to ''express'' those things: a doll may be used by a girl to mimic her mother or express [[motherhood]] as much as to explore it.

Even for toys that don't possess explicit educational value, a thoughtful parent or teacher can turn a static [[figurine]], for example, into an object of interest, by pointing out its features or costumes, or referring to its history or science (e.g., a figurine of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] may be a starting point for exploring American history; a [[Santa Claus]] may be used to explore the roots of Christmas; a toy [[astronaut]] to explore science...), which can be done in conjunction with a more-explicitly "edutaining" object, such as a [[picture book]]. Most children are naturally inquisitive (possibly why they sometimes break their toys; simply to know what is inside or how it moves or what produces that sound), and caregivers should not waste this opportunity.

Even ''grown-ups'' can learn through toys about children: what are their [[Aptitude|talents]] or interests; if they are more [[extrovert]] or [[introvert]]; indeed if they dislike toys and prefer social activities or sport, and thus capitalize on the children's abilities and correct what is wrong or lacking.

Some toys are of considerable appeal and benefit to both children and adults, such as [[Lego]] or [[Rubik's Cube]], as their design and implementation can range from the simple to the sophisticated.

=== Hip hop culture ===
The term "edutainment" was first made popular amongst the hip hop community by [[KRS-One]] (a.k.a. The Teacha) thanks to his [[Boogie Down Productions]] [[Edutainment (album)|album by the same name]].

The term has since been borrowed to describe hip hop culture's innate pedagogical aesthetics. Examples of this include how Hip Hop uniquely combines both thought and action (see [[Paulo Freire]]'s use of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] in ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'') and values both Eurocentric values of rational thought and Afrocentric epistemology of kinetic, affective and emotional ways of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New York|pages=72|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is in the transmission of technical and historical knowledge, the manner in which Hip Hop practitioners learn and exchange by sharing moments of performance together through ''building'' or ''building sessions.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New-York|pages=76–77|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporations ===
The concept of educational entertainment is being used for building learning programs for organizations. High technology is used to make the programs entertaining and educational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-Content: Technologies and Perspectives for the European Market|last=Nagy|first=Atilla|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2006|isbn=3-540-25093-X|location=|pages=79–96|chapter=The Impact of E-Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, [[PowerPoint]] presentations may become more entertaining with the addition of flashy animations or graphics. An article in a satirical newspaper, ''[[The Onion]]'', poked fun at the concept of embellishing boring presentations with attention-catching effects.&lt;ref name="Onion2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|title=Wow Factor Added To Corporate Presentation &amp;#124; The Onion – America's Finest News Source|publisher=theonion.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106232425/http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|archivedate=November 6, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictional marketing executive in the article noted the previous lack of excitement in the presentation, saying "When we first finished the PowerPoint, the content was all there, but it still lacked that certain something."&lt;ref name="Onion2" /&gt;

=== Theme parks ===
{{Main|Amusement park#Educational theme parks}}
[[File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT.jpg|link=[[:File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT]].jpg|thumb|[[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]], an attraction at [[Epcot]]]]
Theme parks are a specific kind of setting in which the combination of entertaining and educational elements can be prevalent. [[Epcot]] at [[Walt Disney World]], which is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], is highly based on edutainment; the park features attractions that teach about the past, conservation, imagination, future technologies, and the world. The park's dedication plaque, written by [[Marty Sklar]] and Erwin Okun, states the following: “May [[EPCOT Center]] entertain, inform and inspire. And above all, may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in man’s ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dream It! Do It!: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms|last=Sklar|first=Marty|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4231-7406-6|location=|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offerings and promotions at [[SeaWorld]] associated with the educational topics of [[marine biology]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]], and animal rescue efforts are increasing at their current locations and in plans for the upcoming [[SeaWorld Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi theme park]], which is likely due to activism for animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld Shifts to Educational Entertainment, Adds Virtual-Reality Ride; Theme-park moves further away from controversial orca shows|last=Hufford|first=Austen|date=27 September 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal (Online)|access-date=|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld writes a new chapter with first killer whale-free park|last=Lindsay|first=Rowena|date=14 December 2016|work=The Christian Science Monitor|access-date=|location=Boston, Mass.|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable theme parks that incorporate educational elements and topics are [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], [[Holy Land Experience]], [[Dinosaur World (theme parks)|Dinosaur World]], [[Busch Gardens]], and [[Puy du Fou]].

=== Museums and public access areas ===

Edutainment is also a growing [[paradigm]] within the [[Science museum|science center]] and [[children's museum]] community in the United States, as well as in many other locations such as the [[zoo]] or a [[botanical garden]]. Educational locations such as these are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to reach the surrounding public and get them interested in areas such as the fine arts, science, literature, and history. Additionally, [[field trip]] visits to these educational places provide participants with interactional stimulus to learn about the content offered there. Since people are used to flashy, polished entertainment venues like movie theaters and theme parks, they demand similar experiences at science centers or museums. Consequently, interactive experiences, such as games and [[mobile app]]s, are implemented in museums in order to more effectively help people learn about what they are seeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ART; TAP AND TOUR; Museums are quietly adapting to the app-happy 'selfie culture'|last=Gelt|first=Jessica|date=25 October 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museums are also embracing the ability to use storytelling to engage people, especially those who are young, in hopes to increase attendance; all the while, though, it is possible for the focus and purpose of museums to be diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ARENA --- The Museum of The Future --- From 3-D headsets to holograms, new technologies are revolutionizing exhibits; is it entertainment or education?|last=Gamerman|first=Ellen|date=16 October 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=|location=New York, N.Y.|edition= Eastern|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a museum or a zoo can be seen as just another business competing for entertainment dollars from the public, rather than as an institution that serves the public welfare through education or historical preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=High Tech Heretic|last=Stoll|first=Clifford|publisher=Doubleday|year=1999|isbn=0-385-48975-7|location=|pages=485–499|doi=|id=|coauthors=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects in the classroom ==
{{Main|Entertainment in education}}Much research has been done in association with edutainment and its effectiveness in its various forms. Particularly, the effects of the implementation of the concept of edutainment in the classroom setting have been studied on multiple occasions. The concept of [[flipped classroom]]s, in association with edutainment, was studied by Retta Guy and Gerald Marquis (2016), in which students were assigned [[video lesson]]s and podcasts as opposed to projects prior to class; it was found that these students outperformed those in traditional classrooms, found the actual time in class to prompt more interaction, and thought the class to be more enjoyable, although there was a noticeable period of adaption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=Retta|last2=Marquis|first2=Gerald|date=2016|title=The Flipped Classroom: A Comparison of Student Performance Using Instructional Videos and Podcasts Versus the Lecture-Based Model of Instruction|url=|journal=Issues in Informing Science &amp; Information Technology|volume= 13|pages= 1–13|issn=1547-5840|doi=10.28945/3461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Ruby Lynch-Arroyo and Joyce Asing-Cashman (2016), ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', which is an example of edutainment in the form of a television show, was integrated into the education of [[Pre-service teacher education|preservice]] mathematics teachers. The subsequent results exemplified the potential for edutainment to promote [[critical thinking]], increased engagement, and [[growth mindset]]s.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Arroyo|first=Ruby|last2=Asing-Cashman|first2=Joyce|date=2016|title=Using Edutainment to Facilitate Mathematical Thinking and Learning: An Exploratory Study|url=http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|journal=Journal of Mathematics Education|volume=9|pages= 37–52|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817203754/http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Craig D. Cox, ''et al''. (2017) conducted a study in which a mini-series that combined educational and entertaining elements was developed and presented to pharmacy [[preceptor]]s; it was effective in increasing the confidence of the participants and was an honorable mention for the [[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy]] Innovations in Teaching Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Craig D.|last2=Cheon|first2=Jongpil|last3=Crooks|first3=Steven M.|last4=Lee|first4=Jaehoon|date=2017|title=Use of Entertainment Elements in an Online Video Mini-Series to Train Pharmacy Preceptors|url=|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume= 81|issue=1|pages= 1–13|issn=0002-9459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system that incorporated the concept of edutainment through the use of games has also been studied in association with [[Disability|disabled]] students by Amal Dandashi, ''et al''. (2015), and it was found that the system had a positive impact in terms of scores, coordination, communication, and memorization skills; after replaying, higher scores were often achieved as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dandashi|first=Amal|last2=Karkar|first2=Abdel Ghani|last3=Saad|first3=Sawsan|last4=Barhoumi|first4=Zaara|last5=Al-Jaam|first5=Jihad|last6=Saddik|first6=Abdulmotaleb El|date=2015-01-01|title=Enhancing the Cognitive and Learning Skills of Children with Intellectual Disability through Physical Activity and Edutainment Games|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1155/2015/165165|journal=International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|doi=10.1155/2015/165165|page=165165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for podcasts and narration specifically, according to a study conducted by Trish L. Varao Sousa, Jonathan S. A. Carriere, and Daniel Smilek (2013) with student participants, these forms may not be particularly helpful, as their use can result in both less information actually internalized and less engagement overall when compared to other "reading encounters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varao Sousa|first=Trish L.|last2=Carriere|first2=Jonathan S.

== Criticism ==
Debate regarding the value of educational entertainment and its implementation has been had for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|title=That's Edutainment|last=Rozen|first=Joel|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323160117/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|archivedate=2016-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feedback received by Walt Disney for his ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series represents the views of some skeptics of the concept of edutainment. For example, the use of music along with the footage of animals, such as the circumstance in which "The courtship of tarantulas was set to a tango, while the movements of two scorpions were showcased with square dance music in the background" was criticized at the time; the purpose of the music was to enhance the footage, but some people took issue with this humanization. Additionally, without approval, some of the film crew of ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'' prompted unnatural behavior in lemmings that would be filmed, which then generated a negative response.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|title=Walt and the True-Life Adventures|last=admin|date=2012-02-09|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419053222/http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|archivedate=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television show that demonstrates the concept of edutainment, has also specifically been subject to criticism. For instance, in an article published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in May 1971, [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] criticizes the promotion of "Right Answers" in the television show without actual action being taken by the children, and also argues that it is nonsensical and perplexing to have adults convey to children that everything that is to be discovered is logical and easy to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|title=Big Bird, Meet Dick and Jane|last=Holt|first=John|date=May 1971|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523172022/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|archive-date=2016-05-23|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that the concept of edutainment hurts the actual value of education has been prevalent as well. The book entitled ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' by theorist [[Neil Postman]] demonstrates this notion, as it is claimed that areas of study have been “transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business.”&lt;ref&gt;Neil., Postman, (1986-01-01). {{oclc|14271773}} ''Amusing ourselves to death : public discourse in the age of show business''.

Retrieved 2017-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Museum professionals especially have faced this dilemma, as in study conducted by Pierre Balloffet, François H. Courvoisier, and Joëlle Lagier (2014), museum professionals did not have severe negative opinions of the incorporation of educational entertainment, but individuals nevertheless had varying viewpoints on "the appropriateness or potential risks of edutainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balloffet|first=Pierre|last2=Courvoisier|first2=François H.|last3=Lagier|first3=Joelle|date=2014|title=From Museum to Amusement Park: The Opportunities and Risks of Edutainment|url=|journal=International Journal of Arts Management|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female [[street art]]ists have become a common phenomenon in [[Egypt]], especially after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|revolution of 2011]]. This kind of art became a way to address many women-related issues in Egypt that are not merely related to political developments, such as the status of women in society and sexual harassment. Notable female artists include Aya Tarek and Hend Kheera, while collaborations include Women on Walls and NooNeswa among others.

==Background==

===Voices in Street Art===
The public nature of street art provides a forum for those who are silenced by cultural or political oppression to be heard. Typically well planned and designed, street art is often created to send a message about a specific issue or topic. In a 2014 Al Jazeera article, Women on Walls founder Mia Grondahl states "Street art is all about "strengthening the people, being with the people, listening to the people." &lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;

  |last=Wolf|first=Mat
  |title=Egypt's graffiti artists make their mark
  |work=Al Jazeera
  |date=6 May 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban life is centered within the confines of the city's buildings, and the existence of street art makes witnessing the statements behind it unavoidable. As stated by Angie Balata, "Everyone who sees it receives the same message — even those who don't necessarily want to receive it."&lt;ref name=Observers&gt;
{{cite web

  |accessdate=2 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In societies where certain groups are not given equal footing in social and political settings, this alternative form of speech is an outlet for those voices.

===Street art and the revolution===
Before the revolution of 2011 in Egypt, street art was not a common presence. There were only a few artists using public space as a canvas prior to 2011. Before this time, street art was seen as a suspicious activity and could be stopped legally.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;

  |publisher=jadaliyya.com
  |date=25 January 2013
  |accessdate=2 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political revolution in Egypt was focused on overthrowing former president Hosni Mubarek. Street art at this time gave men and women a way to speak out against the military ruling. Since the end of the revolution, street art has continued to be a way for artists to protest.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;&lt;ref name=suzee&gt;

  |accessdate=2 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple common themes speak out against the Muslim Brotherhood and gender inequality.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt;

Street art, beginning with the Egyptian revolution, has even given way to collaborations such as Women on Walls (WOW) who focus specifically on women's rights statistics. One artist said, "If you want to tell people something in Egypt, you've got to tell them in the street." Art has become the way to voice an opinion in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;

==Women in street art==
Traditionally, Muslim women have been confined to the home and to private space, while public space has belonged to men.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street art gives women a voice in the public space that they have often been denied. Groups such as Noon El Neswa, NooNewsa, and Women on Walls have been running campaigns to claim a position for women in the public by bringing both women's artists and women's issues to the streets.&lt;ref name=ElNabawi&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nawara Belal, a member of NooNewsa, stated, "Women are not comfortable in public spaces. We must feel that we belong there, that it's our zone."&lt;ref name=Fecteau/&gt; In addition to groups there are many individual female artists operating in Egypt. Until recently, there were very few women or women-related issues depicted in street art, or, if there were, the women were depicted in an insulting way.&lt;ref name=Barakat/&gt;&lt;ref name=ElNabawi/&gt; Now, women in Egypt are using art that features women not only to comment on politics in Egypt, but also to address and raise awareness about issues directly affecting their lives. Common themes amongst these artists include the status of women in Egypt, gender disparities, and the high rates of sexual assault in the country.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barakat/&gt;

==Important artists and collaborations==
===Aya Tarek===
According to the well-known Arab blogger, "Suzee in the City," '''Aya Tarek''' is an Alexandrian street artist; one of the first recognized Egyptian street artists.&lt;ref name=suzee/&gt; She began her street artwork before the Egyptian revolution and refers to the street art as "an open gallery."&lt;ref name=LeilZahra&gt;

===Hend Kheera===
Well known Egyptian street artist, '''Hend Kheera''' was an active participant in the first months of the Egyptian revolution.&lt;ref name=Peirandrei&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her work Kheera questions the social norms in Egypt, discusses her personal experiences as a woman, and contributes to anti-sexual harassment campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;

  |title=Hend Kheera
  |publisher=WomenOnWalls
  |date=20 September 2014
  |accessdate=7 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Kheera sympathized with the idea that street art has a strong voice, claiming "You write on a wall in the street to speak to people. In my opinion, a wall is more powerful than any media channel, for example, because you can't ignore it…By making graffiti in the streets [you] make people aware of what's happening."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women on Walls===
'''WOW''', began by Mia Grondahl and Angie Balata, focuses specifically on women's rights statistics and women's empowerment. They work with political, economical, social, and cultural topics. It began as a very small campaign and now has more than 60 artists working in both Egypt and Jordan.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NooNewsa===
This group focuses on changing the attitude toward women in Egypt, through projects such as Graffiti Harimi (Female Graffiti), which aims to break social taboos. '''NooNewsa''' is dedicated to making women feel comfortable in public space. They want to give the people positive images of women and often use well-known female figures as subjects in their art.&lt;ref name=Fecteau/&gt;

The '''flag of Derbyshire''' is the [[flag]] of the [[Counties of England|English county]] of [[Derbyshire]]. Introduced unofficially in 2006, the flag has subsequently been registered at the [[Flag Institute]] and added to their UK Flags Register.

== History ==
The introduction of the flag came about as a result of a feature on Andy Whittaker's breakfast show on [[BBC Radio Derby]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/articles/2006/07/24/andy_whittaker_derbyshire_flag_preview_feature.shtml Derbyshire flag - the search begins] ''BBC Derby website'', 25 July 2006. Retrieved 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Smith, a listener who had noticed the prominent use of [[Saint Piran's Flag]] while visiting [[Cornwall]] wanted to know whether Derbyshire had an equivalent symbol. As no flag to represent the county existed, a campaign to design one with the aid of listeners' suggestions was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/08_august/03/flag.shtml Flag up your favourite design with Radio Derby] ''BBC Press Office'', 3 August 2006. Retrieved 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The finished flag, designed by Martin Enright from [[Derby]], was unveiled on 22 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/articles/2006/09/21/derbyshire_flag_revealed_andy_whittaker_feature.shtml Revealed - the Derbyshire Flag] ''BBC Derby website'', 22 September 2006. Retrieved 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Ceremonies to mark the first unfurling of the flag were held on the day  at various locations around the county, including Derby, [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]], [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]] and [[Buxton]].

== Design ==

The flag features a green cross on a blue background. These colours were chosen to represent Derbyshire's green countryside and its rivers and reservoirs, respectively. In the centre of the flag is a [[Tudor rose]], which has been the county badge since the 1470s. The rose is gold in colour rather than the more usual red and white, partly to differentiate from the emblems of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]; it is also supposed to symbolise quality.

'''Geekfest''' is the name of a series of [[free party|free, all-ages concerts]] organized by [[California]] indie label [[S.P.A.M. Records]] during the 1990s. The first Geekfest was held in June 1996 on the shoreline at Point Molate in [[Richmond, California]]. This site, a former [[Navy]] fuel depot at the foot of the [[Richmond-San Rafael Bridge]], became the default location for dozens of Geekfests, though other locations were eventually used.

==Background==
   
In the mid-1990s, local ordinances and economic considerations led to difficult times for [[San Francisco Bay Area]] bands whose members were under 21. Several bars and nightclubs were driven out by the bustling [[dot-com economy]]. Others, fearful of losing their liquor licenses, stopped allowing minors to attend or perform on their stages. By 1996, there was only one all-ages music venue in the East Bay - [[924 Gilman Street]]. 

With the rise of [[Green Day]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], and other former underground bands making [[punk rock]] a commodity, Gilman had become an insular community, rejecting those who did not fit an increasingly narrow definition of punk. Though Gilman was not by design exclusively punk rock (they were and are explicitly devoted to independent music and arts), a combination of internal politics and aesthetic tastes of the Gilman staff kept other types of music off the stage. [[S.P.A.M. Records]] grew out of the efforts of underage musicians and artists from [[Pinole, California]] frustrated with this situation. The fringe Gilman band [[The Hope Bombs]] encouraged the S.P.A.M. crew, most notably by letting them jump on stage at Hope Bombs shows to play as "The Bob Weirdos" (whose shows consisted of crazed songs like "Help I'm On Fire" which actually involved setting singer John Geek on fire). But this support was the exception and the bands were generally deprived of any meaningful access to the Gilman audience. 

S.P.A.M. Co-founder John Geek (now vocalist for punk band [[Fleshies]]) alluded to this in an interview:

''"Along with Dan and Corbett of [[Bobby Joe and the Children MacNuggits]] (and joined soon by [[Robert Eggplant]] and Dylan McPuke), I started the S.P.A.M. Records Collective in 1995 because no one else would put out our shit or let us play."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/armthepit/interviews_06.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+12:37:10 Interview], Paul Ickes, August 17, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The S.P.A.M. bands, most notably Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits, had been rejected by the punk scene for what, to their minds, were superficial differences in dress and musical style. Label co-founder Corbett Redford (singer for Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits) said "''We were all living in Pinole and we couldn't play Gilman because they said we weren't punk. We couldn't take out an ad in [[Maximum RocknRoll|MRR]] because they said we weren't punk. ... We were thrashfunk and silly folk I suppose.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastbayexpress.com/Issues/2001-12-05/music/planet.html Interview], [[East Bay Express]], December 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; They decided, in a [[DIY]] spirit, to create their own venue, one where nobody would be rejected for having the wrong fashion sense.

The name "Geekfest" was chosen partly because the S.P.A.M. collective saw themselves as [[geeks]]; they realized their [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] made them unpopular at parties, but made no effort to change. Their rejection by the punk scene was viewed as just another chapter in a long history of being uncool; but, as John Geek says, "''Our pride in maladjustment ran too damn deep.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://carmelitasings.tribe.net/thread/ae74eaf9-a6c3-4047-97ab-f48653accdfe "No", John Geek] [[Maximum Rock 'N' Roll]], April, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== First Geekfest ==

First, S.P.A.M. founder John Geek set up a hotline, (510) BAD-SMUT, to disseminate information. In many ways, Geekfest applied the guerrilla tactics of [[rave]]s to live music. Photocopied [[Flyer (pamphlet)|handbills]] listed a telephone number, but not the location of the event, to try to prevent the shows being shut down by law enforcement.

Most production, planning, stage management, cooking and facilitation was done by a core group of people from Pinole. Events were also stage managed and cooked for by the same crew. Planning for most events was eventually held at 924 Gilman as more people joined in as the show became larger. 

Point Molate was selected as a location partly because it was already in use one Sunday a month for free outdoor "Sunset raves". It was far from any residential area, beneath a large bridge, and under confused jurisdiction as a Navy [[Superfund]] site. Technically, it was in Richmond, which had one of the nation's highest murder rates at the time. Local law enforcement, it seemed, was otherwise occupied.

Politically, the concept of Geekfest took an [[anarchist]] bent. It addressed issues of public land use, the role of the audience in art (since much of the time, the audience consisted of the other bands playing that day), and issues of hierarchy in a supposedly [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] punk scene.  

Approximately 12 bands played the first show, most of who were made up of minors and bands who shared S.P.A.M.'s sense of humor and disenfranchisement. S.P.A.M. members rented a gas-powered generator, and hired a local sound engineer to work the [[Jury rig|jury-rigged]] [[Public address|P.A.]]. In an illegal and ill-advised attempt to recoup their losses, S.P.A.M. sold cheese-filled hot dogs and cans of beer to the approximately 30 attendees. The concert lasted from about 1 p.m. until sunset (most proceeds were later spent on burritos).

== Successive Geekfests ==

S.P.A.M. continued putting on Geekfests, usually about one per month during the summer months and occasionally during the winter, when they could find a suitable indoor location.
The locations and the bands varied widely (though many bands had repeat performances), but the shows were always free and all-ages.

This concept of inclusion was central to the Geekfest concept, and extended to the booking policy. As word spread about the festivals, bands began calling to ask for shows, and sending promotional packages to the label's P.O. box. S.P.A.M. avoided listening to demo tapes they received, booking bands on a "[[first-come, first-served]]" basis. This was done to remove the bias of musical taste that S.P.A.M. blamed for their own exclusion from Gilman. As a result, the bands were often unskilled, untalented, or conversely, so polished and professional that they seemed wildly inappropriate at a no-frills, guerrilla concert. Geekfest organizers observed the conflicts that arose between different musical subcultures with a bemused detachment.

The length of the concerts (sometimes 8 hours or more) and the inconsistent quality of the acts made Geekfest less like a traditional concert and more like a weird carnival. Since the schedule was never listed, it was difficult for people to show up to see one band in particular. People tended to stay for most of the day and began to come as much for the playful atmosphere as for the bands.

Several Geekfest organizers, including Dan Abbott, Shawn Martin, and Dylan McPuke, were affiliated with the [[Amtgard]] [[live action role-playing game]] (Who coincidentally brought amtgard to Berekely, Ca), and brought homemade foam-padded swords for attendees to battle with during concerts. From then on, random foam sword battles were an integral part of Geekfest. Between bands, organizers held costume contests, [[raffle]]s, and trivia games,  and videogame tournaments: usually with a nod to traditionally geeky themes like [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]], [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], or [[Atari]] games.

Gradually, Geekfest attracted a community of disparate individuals, and become something of a scene itself. Several bands made inroads into the Gilman scene, and several Geekfests were eventually held within the Gilman club itself.

Geekfest's esoteric aesthetic also became popular among organizers within the [http://www.cannabisactionnetwork.org/ Cannabis Action Network] (CAN), which allowed S.P.A.M. Records to book second-stage performances at their annual 420 festivals, including at least one at the [[Maritime Hall]] in San Francisco on April 20, 2001([http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7064487741052385235&amp;q=geekfest video]).

== Geekfest and Libertatia ==

In 1997, the Geeks (as S.P.A.M./Geekfest organizers had come to be known) decided to celebrate the first anniversary of Geekfest by having a three-day [[camping|campout]]. After a frenzied search for an appropriate site, the Geeks found [[Lake Ladoga]], part of East Park Reservoir near Maxwell, California. It was hot, dusty, and inhospitable land under jurisdiction of the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), and the lake was a man-made body used for irrigation of nearby farms. The water was noticeably filthy, but the 107 °F heat made it a welcome respite regardless. Organizers arranged the stage so that attendees could watch the bands from the relative comfort of the lake. The attendance was estimated at around 150-200 people. Drug use was rampant, mostly [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], with ubiquitous drinking during the daytime. Organizers, using kitchen equipment borrowed from [[Food Not Bombs]], fed everyone two free meals a day: gruel in the morning, spaghetti at night.

BLM supervisor Bill Bird objected to the concert, but was overruled by the [[Sheriff]] and local merchants, who were happy for the increased business.  According to the Official Program and Event Schedule, the bands were:  The Mac Swanky Trio, Stark Raving Brad, Defile, Subincision, Harbinger, Visitor 42, The Blue Sky Smokers, Blah,Blah,Blah, Adjective Noun, Skitzo, 976, Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits, Lapis Lazuli, NME, Impact, Stinky Puffs, The Keeners, Ubzub, Soda Pop F*ck You, Pork and the Spork, Magic Pinecone Band, Shatousky, Banana Hammock, Hungry Hungry Hippeaux, My Sunny Disposition, The Enemies, Orka Pickles, Soundcurrent, White Trash Debutantes, Supernovice, The Frught Lupes Human Ass Orkestra, The Human Beans, Astrolloyd, Glamazon, Moxie, Erik Core, Sixence, Tone Def, Suckerfish, Wet Nap, The pilgrims, Inslight Weights and Fetish.  In the end, nearly 40 bands performed at the Geekfest Anniversary, and the Geeks immediately began planning the next year's festival.

In the intervening year, S.P.A.M. organizers had found a kindred spirit, show promoter and artist Marcus Da Anarchist, who organized "Pyrate Punx Picnics" out of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|Mission District]]. S.P.A.M. and the Pyrate Punx collaborated on the next campout, dubbing it "Pirates vs. Geeks". John Geek and Marcus each booked half the bands.

For the third anniversary, the Pirates and Geeks resumed an uneasy alliance, organizing a week-long [[Libertatia]], after the anarchist pirate utopia on [[Madagascar]] founded by [[Captain Mission]] during the 18th century. It was also referred to as the "Week of Geek". As it had been before, it was free and all-ages, and organizers fed the roughly 400 attendees two meals a day. Although 100 bands were booked, only 82 showed up to perform. Still, each day of entertainment lasted from approximately noon until 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. Several Bay Area journalists also attended, and the event received coverage in local press&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/1999-06-23/news/columns2_1.html "Night Crawler"], [[SF Weekly]], June 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Libertatia festivals were noted enthusiastically by local weeklies&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.eastbayexpress.com/Issues/2001-06-08/music/hardplace.html "Rock in a Hard Place"], [[East Bay Express]], June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The demise of S.P.A.M. Records in 2003 (closely linked to the breakup of flagship band Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits in 2001) spelled the end of Geekfests, though the Pyrate Punx continue to organize Libertatia annually.

'''Imatto-canna''' (also written ''Imatto canna'' or ''Jamatto canna'') was a false [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[syllabary]] reported by the German traveller [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] in his book ''Amoenitatum exoticarum politico-physico-medicarum fasciculi V.'' (1712).

[[File:Japanese alphabet by Engelbert Kaempfer 1690-1693.jpg|thumb|left|"[[Japanese writing system|Japanese alphabet]]", including "Iamato-canna" by [[Engelbert Kaempfer]], 1690-1693.]]
He wrote that [[Japan]] had three syllabaries: ''firo-canna'' ([[hiragana]]) and ''catta-canna'' ([[katakana]]), both used by commons, and ''imatto-canna'', used by nobles.  However, the ''imatto-canna'' he believed to exist were just variant forms of hiragana called [[hentaigana]]. Being ''hentaigana'', they did not make up a cohesive or independent writing system, and were in often free variation with other ''hiragana'' characters. The only other Japanese syllabary besides hiragana and katakana is their precursor [[man'yōgana]], use of which had died out well before 1712.

''Imatto-canna'' was probably his transliteration of the word ''[[Yamato_people#Etymology|yamato]]-gana'', which actually means [[kana]] in general, both hiragana and katakana.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4891">'''Jacqueline Lichtenstein''' (1947) is a French philosopher, art historian, and professor of aesthetics and the philosophy of art at the [[University of Paris IV - Paris-Sorbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris-sorbonne.fr/IMG/pdf/Jacqueline_LICHTENSTEIN.pdf Jacqueline LICHTENSTEIN - Université Paris-Sorbonne pdf] "Jacqueline Lichtenstein. Professeur des universités, 17° section. UFR philosophie-Sociologie. Directrice adjointe de l'UFR de Philosophie-Sociologie ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franceculture.fr/plateformes-jacqueline-lichtenstein Jacqueline Lichtenstein - France Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work focuses on 17th- and 18th-century art, and the ways in which people think, talk, and theorize about art. Another theme of her work is the shift, since the 17th century, in how people think about the amateur.

== Career ==

Lichtenstein has taught at the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Paris X-Nanterre, and at the University of Paris IV - Paris-Sorbonne, among other places. She has published numerous articles in French and American journals.

She is the joint director of a philosophy and sociology training and research unit at University Paris IV-Sorbonne, where she coordinates a master’s program in aesthetics and philosophy of art. She is also in charge of the series "Essays on art and philosophy" (Aesthetics and philosophy of art), founded by [[Henri Gouhier]] in 1949 and published by [[Editions Vrin]].

== The eloquence of color ==

A central theme of Lichtenstein's work is the reception of color by various disciplines, such as philosophy, art, sociology, and ethics. A focal point for her analysis is the antagonistic relationship between color and the notion of the design or plan of a work (in 17th-century French, the ''dessein'' of the work, etymologically related to ''dessin'', drawing).

Philosophically suspect due to its material character, morally culpable because of its seductive luster, color, in Lichtenstein's view, has long been deemed aesthetically dangerous, the source of a pleasure and a beauty that does not, at first blush, seem connected with the True and the Good. This is, she argues, one aspect of an ongoing conflict between reason and the universe of sensible forms. Painting not being reducible to drawing, it is a source of disunity and disorder in our systems of knowledge, one which elicits an experience of "lack" (''insuffisance'').

The history of this conflict, she argues, begins in Platonic thought, which condemns color and rhetoric equally. The arts of speech and those of imagery are thus definitively linked. A central later figure is [[Roger de Piles]], the leader of the [[Rubenist]]s, the partisans of color (''coloris''). The Rubenists broke with the Platonic tradition and defended illusion, makeup, and seduction. They shifted, Lichtenstein maintains, the focus to those feminine aspects of representation, that is the suspected and cursed elements. They made these the essence of painting.

From that point onward, painting was linked with the linguistically inexpressible. Only the gaze may be spoken of, not the picture itself. This, argues Lichtenstein, was the birth of aesthetics, in the sense that the word was to take on in the 17th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63998">'''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]''' is a monthly action-adventure series created by American author [[Don Pendleton]]. Every other month the series is complimented by the release of a SuperBolan, titles that are twice the length of a standard Executioner novel. Following the exploits of Mack Bolan and his war against organized crime and international terrorism, both series collectively run 586 installments (423 Executioner titles, 163 SuperBolan titles).&lt;ref&gt;As of February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green Lycurgus Cup.jpg|thumb|Photographed front-lit with flash, the cup appears in the green colour it has without light coming through the glass]]

The '''Lycurgus Cup''' is a 4th-century [[Roman glass]] [[cage cup]] made of a [[dichroic glass]], which shows a different colour depending on whether or not light is passing through it; red when lit from behind and green when lit from in front.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Highlights; Freestone, 270-273; see also  [http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~photspec/Press_files/NewsnViews_Leonhardt.pdf this pdf with good images under both lights]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only complete Roman glass object made from this type of glass,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lycurgus_cup.aspx British Museum - The Lycurgus Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; and the one exhibiting the most impressive change in colour;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271&lt;/ref&gt; it has been described as "the most spectacular glass of the period, fittingly decorated, which we know to have existed".&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup is also a very rare example of a complete Roman cage-cup, or ''diatretum'', where the glass has been painstakingly cut and ground back to leave only a decorative "cage" at the original surface-level.  Many parts of the cage have been completely undercut.  Most cage-cups have a cage with a geometric abstract design, but here there is a composition with figures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=1380 Corning Museum of Glass], Cage cups;Freestone, 270&lt;/ref&gt; showing the mythical King [[Lycurgus (Thrace)|Lycurgus]], who (depending on the version) tried to kill Ambrosia, a follower of the god [[Dionysus]] (Bacchus to the Romans). She was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and restrained him, eventually killing him. Dionysus and two followers are shown taunting the king.  The cup is the "only well-preserved figural example" of a cage cup.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 342&lt;/ref&gt;

==The glass==
The dichroic effect is achieved by making the glass with tiny proportions of [[nanoparticle]]s of gold and silver dispersed in [[colloid]]al form throughout the glass material.  The process used remains unclear, and it is likely that it was not well understood or controlled by the makers, and was probably discovered by accidental "contamination" with minutely ground gold and silver dust. The glass-makers may not even have known that gold was involved, as the quantities involved are so tiny; they may have come from a small proportion of gold in any silver added (most Roman silver contains small proportions of gold), or from traces of gold or [[gold leaf]] left by accident in the workshop, as residue on tools, or from other work.  The very few other surviving fragments of Roman dichroic glass vary considerably in their two colours.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 275; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij5xe1V9Kw4C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Dichroic+Lycurgus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S0rFUo6FEZKihgfJz4CoAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dichroic%20Lycurgus&amp;f=false "Gold particles for imaging and Radiotherapy"], 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corning Inc.|Corning Glass Works]] has reproduced a [[Glass blank|blank]] of a material of similar chemical composition and internal structure, which displays under reflected and transmitted light the same "Lycurgus effect" of green to red colour change as the Lycurgus cup material does.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 273, fig 6 a &amp; 6b&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cranberry glass]] or gold ruby glass is somewhat similar and far more common, manufactured with colloidal gold, but this only ever shows a red colour.

To a conventionally composed Roman glass flux 330 parts per million of silver and 40 of gold were added: "These particles were precipitated as colloids and form a silver-gold alloy.  When viewed in reflected light the minute metallic particles are just coarse enough to reflect enough of the light without eliminating the transmission.  In transmitted light the fine particles scatter the blue end of the spectrum more effectively than the red end, resulting in red transmission, and this is the colour observed.  Since it is impossible that the Roman artisans managed to add these incredibly low levels of silver and gold to the volume of the glass used to make the vessel deliberately, the levels were probably added at higher levels to a larger volume of glass-melt, and increasingly diluted by adding more glass."&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63; see also Freestone, 272-273; originally published in Barber&lt;/ref&gt;  The particles are only about 70 [[nanometer]]s across,&lt;ref&gt;Barber&lt;/ref&gt; and embedded in the glass, so they cannot be seen by optical microscopy, and a [[transmission electron microscope]] is needed instead.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, 34; see also Henderson, 63&lt;/ref&gt;  At this size they approach the size of the wavelengths of visible light, and a [[surface plasmon resonance]] effect takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of the cup is mostly smooth, but behind the main figures the glass has been hollowed out, well beyond even the main outer surface, so that they are of similar thickness to the main outer surface, giving an even colour when light passes through. This is a feature unique among surviving cups; Harden suggests they were an "afterthought".&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248&lt;/ref&gt;  An area around the torso of Lycurgus is a rather different colour from the rest of the glass; perhaps an accident of manufacture, but one exploited by the glass-cutter "so that he could make Lycurgus's rage glow even more strongly".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 342; Freestone, 274&lt;/ref&gt;  After the very lengthy cutting stage the fine polished appearance was achieved by a process called "flame polishing" that risked the complete loss of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248; Williams, 342, though Freeman, 274 reports "groups of regular fine parallel striations", and suggests the polishing was all done mechanically.&lt;/ref&gt;  A suggestion in 1995 that in fact this and other cage cups used a mixture of moulding and cutting has met with little acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;By the glass historian Rosalinde Lierke (see also [[Hedwig glass]]). [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBBkBJN_lJMC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Lycurgus+Cup&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MZSGTNbcNpa6jAfuw6H9Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lycurgus%20Cup&amp;f=false ''Roman glass in the Corning Museum of Glass''], David Whitehouse, Corning Museum of Glass; Freestone, 273-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Byzantine - The "Rubens Vase" - Walters 42562.jpg|thumb|left|The Rubens Vase, an [[agate]] [[hardstone carving]] of c. A.D. 400]]
Like the British Museum's other spectacular work in Roman glass, the [[cameo glass]] [[Portland Vase]], the cup represents to some extent the extension of skills developed by cutters of [[engraved gem]]s, or the larger [[hardstone carving]] of vessels in semi-precious stones, which were luxury arts with enormous prestige in ancient Rome.  No carved gemstone vessels directly comparable to either work are known, but the general taste behind these extreme exhibitions of glass-making skill is one formed by objects in natural stones like the [[Coupe des Ptolémées]] or the [[Rubens Vase]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, 92; see also Freestone, 273-274; for the Rubens Vase, see [http://art.thewalters.org/viewwoa.aspx?id=10284 the Walters Art Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was not until the first full studies of the cup in 1950 that it was established for certain that the material was glass and not a gemstone, which had previously been in question.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems likely that as many as three separate workshops or factories will have been involved in the whole process, perhaps not in the same part of the Empire.  The glass may have been initially made in a large block of standard clear glass, perhaps in Egypt or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which both exported great quantities of glass for forming, and sometimes colouring, elsewhere.  The thick "blank" dichroic vessel was probably made by one specialist workshop and passed to another consisting of specialist cutters.  This would certainly have been a rare and highly expensive object, and the secrets of its manufacture, possibly not well understood even by its makers, seem only to have been used for about a century.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 275&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various small losses, of which the face of the panther is the most significant, and the cup is cracked; the British Museum has never removed the metal rim for this reason.  The base or foot of the cup is damaged, and the original form of the base uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 245&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], in New York has a fragment measuring 2 3/16 x 3 in. (56 x 76&amp;nbsp;mm) of a satyr from a dichroic cage cup that turns from olive green to "reddish amber".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/all/objectview.aspx?OID=130013048 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Brit Mus room 41 Lycurgus cup no lighting.JPG|thumb|left|The satyr with the rock, in the new 2014 display]]
The figure of Lycurgus, bound by the vine and naked apart from boots,&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 245, for all the iconography. Lycurgus is normally depicted naked, or very nearly so.&lt;/ref&gt; is flanked on the left by a crouching Ambrosia, at a considerably smaller scale. Behind her one of Dionysus's [[satyr]]s (shown with a normal human form) stands on one foot as he prepares to hurl a large rock at Lycurgus.  In his other hand he holds a ''pedum'' or shepherd's crook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extremecraft.typepad.com/extreme_craft/2008/03/roman-knows.html photograph here in green] and [http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MXhw69CipdpzgXlez5u3Wg here in red] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712072805/http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MXhw69CipdpzgXlez5u3Wg |date=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To the right of Lycurgus comes first a figure of [[Pan (god)|Pan]],&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=1066684&amp;objectid=61219 British Museum image of Pan]. The Pan figure is only illustrated at Harden, 247, out of the print sources seen.&lt;/ref&gt; then at his feet a rather canine-looking [[Panthera|panther]], the traditional companion of Dionysus, whose face is missing but was presumably snapping at the king, and then the god himself, taunting him with his right arm extended in an angry gesture.  Dionysus carries a [[thyrsus]], the special staff of the god and his followers, and his dress has an Eastern, perhaps Indian, flavour, reflecting what the Ancient Greeks generally believed (perhaps wrongly) about the origins of his cult.  The calf section of one leg has been lost.  A streamer hanging behind him from his thyrsus overlaps the raised foot of the satyr with the rock, completing the circle of the cup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=1066672&amp;objectid=61219 British Museum database image]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that this not very common scene was a reference to the defeat in 324 by the Emperor [[Constantine I]] of his co-emperor [[Licinius]], who was killed in 325 after a period under close guard.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Highlights&lt;/ref&gt;  Another suggestion is that the colour change from green to red was understood as evoking the ripening of red grapes, so that there was a particular suitability in depicting a scene with the god of wine.  The cup may have been intended for use at Bacchic cult celebrations,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 275&lt;/ref&gt; still very much a feature of Roman religious life around 300.  A letter supposedly from the Emperor [[Hadrian]] (d. 138) to his brother-in-law [[Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus|Servianus]], quoted in a biography in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', records the gift of two dichroic cups, which the 4th century author had seen: "I have sent you particoloured cups that change colour, presented to me by the priest of a temple. They are specially dedicated to you and my sister. I would like you to use them at banquets on feast days."&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 275; the biography was of [[Julius Saturninus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other depictions of the story tend to either depict Lycurgus attacking Ambrosia, often with a double-headed axe, while her companions rush to her aid, or Lycurgus alone, entangled in the vine.  The closest parallel to the scene on the cup is one of the [[apse]] mosaics in the [[triconch]] ''[[triclinium]]'' at the [[Villa Romana del Casale|Villa del Casale]], [[Piazza Armerina]], which may also refer to Licinius.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248, and those in next note&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a mosaic at [[Antioch on the Orontes]], and a group on a 2nd-century [[sarcophagus]] at the [[Villa Parisi]] in [[Frascati]].&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271; [https://books.google.com/books?id=U7Uu_Dq8oY4C&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Lycurgus+Piazza+Armerina&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lMVEm2Uuwk&amp;sig=nvPkUDffwsdEcuOlWmo368YQ7z4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AO2HTPzpNYzd4Aa1nojSBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lycurgus%20Piazza%20Armerina&amp;f=false More on the mosaics]; see next note for a link to an image.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a floor-mosaic from [[Vienne]], now in the museum at [[Saint-Romain-en-Gal]], with Lycurgus alone inside the vine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.green-man-of-cercles.org/articles/men_among_vines.pdf PDF on classical precedents for Romanesque figures entwined with vines]; fig. 7 is the Vienne mosaic, fig. 9 a partial view of the Piazza Armerini mosaic. [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DionysosWrath.html#Lykourgos Four other depictions of Lycurgus] can be seen here.&lt;/ref&gt; The preceding scene of Lycurgus attacking Ambrosia, is on a floor-mosaic at [[Brading Roman Villa]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/88938785@N00/280125516/ Brading mosaic]&lt;/ref&gt;  Of this and similar mosaics, Martin Henig says: "In cases such as this, we are not concerned with simple, popular paganism but with recondite knowledge. This is the sort of esoteric religion which the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus|Praetextatus]], [[Macrobius]] and [[Proclus]] relished. The religious thought behind these floors is probably deeper and more complex than contemporary Christianity and many of the keys to understanding it have been lost."&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 153&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup was probably designed for drinking from at feasts, or more specifically Bacchic cult celebrations,&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248&lt;/ref&gt; where the lack of a foot, also a feature found in other cage-cups, may mean it was passed around, as elaborate cups often were in medieval cultures. Alternatively other cage cups were almost certainly used, suspended, as [[oil lamp]]s, where the dichroic effect of this cup would show to advantage.

==History==
[[File:Lycurgus Cup red BM MME1958.12-2.1.jpg|thumb|A view showing parts in both colours, and the variation in the red.]]
The cup was "perhaps made in [[Alexandria]]" or Rome in about 290-325 AD, and measures {{convert|16.5|x|13.2|cm|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 342; the British Museum Highlights has "4th century AD. Probably made in Rome". The dimensions are also from Williams and the Highlights; the Collection database has {{convert|15.88|cm|1|abbr=on}} for the height, perhaps a difference arising from the remounting of the foot.&lt;/ref&gt;   From its excellent condition it is probable that, like several other luxury Roman objects, it has always been preserved above ground; most often such objects ended up in the relatively secure environment of a [[church treasury]].  Alternatively it might, like several other cage cups, have been recovered from a [[sarcophagus]].  The present [[gilt-bronze]] rim and foot were added in about 1800,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 342, who says "gilt-bronze"; The BM database says "[[silver-gilt]]".&lt;/ref&gt;  suggesting it was one of the many objects taken from church treasuries during the period of the [[French Revolution]] and [[French Revolutionary Wars]].  The foot continues the theme of the cup with open-work vine leaves, and the rim has leaf forms that lengthen and shorten to match the scenes in glass.  In 1958 the foot was removed by British Museum conservators, and not rejoined to the cup until 1973.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum database, where there are also photographs with the foot removed.&lt;/ref&gt;  There may well have been earlier mounts.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271&lt;/ref&gt;

The early history of the cup is unknown, and it is first mentioned in print in 1845, when a French writer said he had seen it "some years ago, in the hands of M. Dubois".&lt;ref&gt;"il y a quelques années, entre les mains de M. Dubois", Harden, 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is probably shortly before it was acquired by the [[Rothschild family]].&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 247&lt;/ref&gt;  Certainly [[Lionel de Rothschild]] owned it by 1857, when the touring [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] saw it in his collection and described it as "barbaric and debased".&lt;ref&gt;Reist, Inge (ed.), "Le Gout Rothschild", in ''British Models of Art Collecting and the American Response: Reflections Across the Pond
The Histories of Material Culture and Collecting, 1700–1950'', p. 104, 2014, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., {{ISBN|147243806X}}, 9781472438065, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdJIBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1862 Lionel lent it to an exhibition at what is now the [[V&amp;A Museum]], after which it virtually fell from scholarly view until 1950.  In 1958 [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Victor, Lord Rothschild]] sold it to the British Museum for £20,000, £2,000 of which was donated by the [[Art Fund]] (then the NACF).&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 246; [http://www.artfund.org/artwork/3433/the-lycurgus-cup Art Fund website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup forms part of the museum's Department of Prehistory and Europe rather than the Greece and Rome Department, and was previously on display, lit from behind, in Room 50.  In 2015 it was on display with the new display of the Rothschild donation of the [[Waddesdon Bequest]] in Room 2A, with a changing internal lighting source that shows the colour change very effectively, though only one side of the cup can be seen.  By October 2015 it was back in the re-opened Room 41.

While Room 41, where it was then displayed, was closed for refurbishment, from November 2012 to August 2013 it was on display with other British Museum pieces at The [[Art Institute of Chicago]]'s Jaharis Galleries of Greek, Roman and Byzantine Art,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/weekend/16382786-421/story.html Chicago Sun-Times]&lt;/ref&gt; where it was very effectively displayed in a free-standing case, lit from above with changing light so that the colour change was clearly visible.&lt;ref&gt;See videos on external links&lt;/ref&gt;  It is considered able to travel to important exhibitions and in 2008 was exhibited in "Reflecting Antiquity, Modern Glass Inspired by Ancient Rome" at the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]], in 2003 at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in London in "'Saved! 100 Years of the National Art Collections Fund", and in 1987 in "Glass of the Caesars" in the British Museum, [[Cologne]], [[Milan]], and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Database; Harden p. XI; see also Corning link above.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The NYC Arts Cypher services all of [[New York City]], but it is located in the [[Stapleton, Staten Island|Stapleton]] neighborhood of Staten Island on Broad Street.

== Aftermath of Hurricane Sandy ==
Due to [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012, the center was unable to host their annual Halloween fundraiser, which raised questions of whether the center would be able to continue to keep its doors open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NY1 Report|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6tP0WFS0Jo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center was able to come together and hosted “I Heart NYC Arts Cypher” on Valentine's Day 2013 to offset the loss from Hurricane Sandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Show Your Love at the "I Heart NYC Arts Cypher" Benefit Fundraiser|url=http://www.prlog.org/12080229-show-your-love-at-the-heart-nyc-arts-cypher-benefit-fundraiser.html|work=PRLog|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opera''' ({{IPA-it|ˈɔːpera|lang}}; English plural: ''operas''; Italian plural: ''opere'' {{IPA-it|ˈɔːpere|}}) is a form of [[theatre]] in which [[music]] has a leading role and the parts are taken by [[Singing|singers]].&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions of opera: "dramatic performance or composition of which music is an essential part, branch of art concerned with this" (''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''); "any dramatic work that can be sung (or at times declaimed or spoken) in a place for performance, set to original music for singers (usually in costume) and instrumentalists" (Amanda Holden, ''Viking Opera Guide''); "musical work for the stage with singing characters, originated in early years of 17th century" (''[[Pears Cyclopaedia]]'', 1983 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a "work" (the literal translation of "opera") is typically a collaboration between a [[composer]] and a [[libretto|librettist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wagner]] and [[Arrigo Boito]] are notable creators who combined both roles.&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporates a number of the [[performing arts]], such as [[acting]], [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[costume]], and sometimes [[dance]] or [[ballet]]. The performance is typically given in an [[opera house]], accompanied by an [[orchestra]] or smaller [[musical ensemble]], which since the early 19th century has been led by a [[conducting|conductor]].

Opera is a key part of the [[Western culture#Music|Western]] [[classical music]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Comparable art forms from various other parts of the world, many of them ancient in origin, are also sometimes called "opera" by analogy, usually prefaced with an adjective indicating the region (for example, [[Chinese opera]]). These independent traditions are not derivative of Western opera but are rather distinct forms of [[musical theatre]]. Opera is also not the only type of Western musical theatre: in the ancient world, [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]] featured singing and instrumental accompaniment; and in modern times, other forms such as the [[musical theatre|musical]] have appeared.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include [[:Category:Opera genres|numerous genres]], including some that include spoken dialogue such as [[musical theater]], ''[[Singspiel]]'' and ''[[Opéra comique]]''. In traditional [[number opera]], singers employ two styles of singing: [[recitative]], a speech-inflected style&lt;ref name="Apel, p. 718"&gt;[[#Apel1969|Apel]], p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt; and self-contained [[aria]]s. The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous [[Gesamtkunstwerk|music drama]].

[[Origins of opera|Opera originated]] in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly [[Lost work|lost]] ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: [[Heinrich Schütz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as [[George Frideric Handel]]. [[Opera seria]] was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] reacted against its artificiality with his "reform" operas in the 1760s. The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian [[comic opera]]s, especially ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' (''Le nozze di Figaro''), ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', as well as ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (''The Abduction from the Seraglio''), and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (''Die Zauberflöte''), landmarks in the German tradition.

The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the [[bel canto]] style, with [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini]] all creating works that are still performed. It also saw the advent of [[Grand Opera]] typified by the works of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]. The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in Italy and [[Richard Wagner]] in Germany. The popularity of opera continued through the [[verismo]] era in Italy and contemporary [[French opera]] through to [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Richard Strauss]] in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in [[Russian opera|Russia]] and [[Bohemia]]. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as [[atonality]] and [[serialism]] ([[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]), [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]] ([[Igor Stravinsky]]), and [[Minimalism]] ([[Philip Glass]] and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]). With the rise of [[sound recording|recording technology]], singers such as [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Maria Callas]] became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these mediums. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live [[high-definition video]] transmissions of their performances in [[Movie theatre|cinemas]] all over the world. Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are [[Live streaming|live streamed]].

==Operatic terminology==

The words of an opera are known as the [[libretto]] (literally "small book"). Some composers, notably Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]]. Traditional opera, often referred to as "[[number opera]]", consists of two modes of singing: [[recitative]], the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech,&lt;ref name="Apel, p. 718"/&gt; and [[aria]] (an "air" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Vocal duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as [[singspiel]], [[opéra comique]], [[operetta]], and [[semi-opera]], the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as [[arioso]]. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail [[#Operatic voices|below]].&lt;ref&gt;General information in this section comes from the relevant articles in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', by. P.Scholes (10th ed., 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; During both the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms, each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble: ''secco'' (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by ''[[basso continuo]]'', which was usually a [[harpsichord]] and a cello; or ''accompagnato'' (also known as ''strumentato'') in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. Over the 18th century, arias were increasingly accompanied by the orchestra. By the 19th century, ''accompagnato'' had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Wagner revolutionized opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what Wagner termed "endless melody". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' have bucked the trend. The changing role of the orchestra in opera is described in more detail [[#Changing role of the orchestra|below]].

==History==

===Origins===
{{Main article|Origins of opera}}
[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claudio Monteverdi]]]]
The Italian word ''opera'' means "work", both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin ''opera'', a singular noun meaning "work" and also the plural of the noun ''[[:wikt:opus|opus]]''. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the Italian word was first used in the sense "composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed., s.v. "[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/131729 opera]".&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dafne]]'' by [[Jacopo Peri]] was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanists]] who gathered as the "[[Florentine Camerata|Camerata de' Bardi]]". Significantly, ''Dafne'' was an attempt to revive the classical [[Tragedy|Greek drama]], part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the [[Renaissance]]. The members of the Camerata considered that the "chorus" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of "restoring" this situation. ''Dafne,'' however, is lost. A later work by Peri, ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'', dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', composed for the court of [[Mantua]] in 1607.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 1; articles on Peri and Monteverdi in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mantua court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzagas]], employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the [[concerto delle donne]] (till 1598), but also one of the first actual "opera singers"; [[Madama Europa]].&lt;ref&gt;Karin Pendle Women and music 2001 p. 65 "From 1587–1600 a Jewish singer cited only as Madama Europa was in the pay of the Duke of Mantua,"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian opera===
{{Main article|Italian opera}}

====Baroque era====
[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Vivaldi]],  in 1723]]

[[File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Musical Fête - 1747.png|thumb|[[Teatro Argentina]] ([[Giovanni Paolo Panini|Panini]], 1747, [[Musée du Louvre]])]]

Opera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a "season" ([[Carnival]]) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'', for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower [[Francesco Cavalli]] helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the [[Arcadian academy|Arcadian Academy]], which came to be associated with the poet [[Metastasio]], whose [[Libretto|libretti]] helped crystallize the genre of [[opera seria]], which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called [[opera buffa]].
Before such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an "opera-within-an-opera." One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public [[opera house]]s. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the [[commedia dell'arte]], a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of "intermezzi", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.

''Opera seria'' was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of ''secco'' recitative interspersed with long ''da capo'' arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of ''opera seria'' the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the high-pitched male [[castrato]] voice, which was produced by [[castration]] of the singer before [[puberty]], which prevented a boy's [[larynx]] from being transformed at puberty. Castrati such as [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]], as well as female [[soprano]]s such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], became in great demand throughout Europe as ''opera seria'' ruled the stage in every country except France.  Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] found himself composing the likes of ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'' and ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] as well, for example in the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who wrote in Vienna near the century's close. Leading Italian-born composers of [[opera seria]] include [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Nicola Porpora|Porpora]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Opera seria]] had its weaknesses and critics. The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. [[Francesco Algarotti]]'s ''Essay on the Opera'' (1755) proved to be an inspiration for [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s reforms. He advocated that ''opera seria'' had to return to basics and that all the various elements—music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging—must be subservient to the overriding drama. In 1765 [[Melchior Grimm]] published "{{Lang|fr|Poème lyrique}}", an influential article for the [[Encyclopédie]] on [[lyric poetry|lyric]] and opera [[libretto]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/musdico/Grimm/167991 Larousse ''Dictionnaire de la musique'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music and the Origins of Language: Theories from the French Enlightenment|first= Downing A|last= Thomas|page= 148|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0zct2C3-jaAC&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die%20Grimm%20article&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die%20Grimm%20article&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0521473071|date= 1995-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JgrFMhZy3aAC&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;f=false|title=Lully Studies|first=John Hajdu|last=Heyer|date=7 December 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0521621830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SqdTxG3jUNMC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;f=false|title=A History of Western Musical Aesthetics|first=Edward A.|last=Lippman|date=26 November 1992|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0803279513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/music/research/proj/esf/pos/sem1.aspx|title=King's College London –  Seminar 1|website=www.kcl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several composers of the period, including [[Niccolò Jommelli]] and [[Tommaso Traetta]], attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a "beautiful simplicity". This is evident in his first reform opera, ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout.

Gluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart, and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comic operas with libretti by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], notably ''[[Le Nozze di Figaro]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart's contribution to ''opera seria'' was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as ''[[Idomeneo]]'' and ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Music: the Classical Era'', ed. [[Neal Zaslaw]] (Macmillan, 1989); entries on Gluck and Mozart in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bel canto, Verdi and verismo====
[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi, by [[Giovanni Boldini]], 1886]]
The [[bel canto]] opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]], [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]] and many others. Literally "beautiful singing", ''bel canto'' opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control. Examples of famous operas in the bel canto style include Rossini's ''[[The Barber of Seville|Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' and ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', as well as Bellini's ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' and Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''.

Following the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], beginning with his biblical opera ''[[Nabucco]]''. This opera, and the ones that would follow in Verdi's career, revolutionized Italian opera, changing it from merely a display of vocal fireworks, with Rossini's and Donizetti's works, to dramatic story-telling. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of [[Italian nationalism]] in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement for a unified Italy. In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]''. The first of these, ''Rigoletto'', proved the most daring and revolutionary. In it, Verdi blurs the distinction between the aria and recitative as it never before was, leading the opera to be "an unending string of duets". ''La traviata'' was also novel. It tells the story of courtesan, and is often cited as one of the first "realistic" operas,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} because rather than featuring great kings and figures from literature, it focuses on the tragedies of ordinary life and society. After these, he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French [[Grand Opera]], ''[[Don Carlos]]'', and ending his career with two [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare-inspired]] works, ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century. These final two works showed Verdi at his most masterfully orchestrated, and are both incredibly influential, and modern. In ''Falstaff'', Verdi sets the preeminent standard for the form and style that would dominate opera throughout the twentieth century. Rather than long, suspended melodies, ''Falstaff'' contains many little motifs and mottos, that, rather than being expanded upon, are introduced and subsequently dropped, only to be brought up again later. These motifs never are expanded upon, and just as the audience expects a character to launch into a long melody, a new character speaks, introducing a new phrase. This fashion of opera directed opera from Verdi, onward, exercising tremendous influence on his successors [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Richard Strauss]], and [[Benjamin Britten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardstrauss.at/strauss-and-wagner.html|title=Strauss and Wagner – Various articles – Richard Strauss|website=www.richardstrauss.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Verdi, the sentimental "realistic" melodrama of [[verismo]] appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' that came to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', and ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. Later Italian composers, such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono|Nono]], have experimented with [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 5, 8 and 9.

===German-language opera===
{{Main article|German opera}}
[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel Die Sternenhalle der Königin der Nacht Bühnenbild Zauberflöte Mozart.tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Queen of the Night in an 1815 production of Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'']]
The first German opera was ''[[Dafne (Opitz-Schütz)|Dafne]]'', composed by [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1627, but the music score has not survived. Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop in spite of this influence. In 1644, [[Sigmund Theophil Staden|Sigmund Staden]] produced the first ''[[Singspiel]]'', ''[[Seelewig]]'', a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am Gänsemarkt in [[Hamburg]] presented German operas by [[Reinhard Keiser|Keiser]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as [[Carl Heinrich Graun|Graun]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse|Hasse]] and later [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and it was not until the arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Music: the Classical Era'' ed. [[Neal Zaslaw]] (Macmillan, 1989), pp. 242–47, 258–60;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' pp. 58–63, 98–103. Articles on Hasse, Graun and Hiller in ''Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RichardWagner.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Richard Wagner]]
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''Singspiele'', ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (1782) and ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (1791) were an important breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition was developed in the 19th century by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] with his ''[[Fidelio]]'', inspired by the climate of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] established [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian [[bel canto]]. His ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include [[Heinrich Marschner|Marschner]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Albert Lortzing|Lortzing]], but the most significant figure was undoubtedly [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].
[[File:Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods p 180.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Brünnhilde throws herself on Siegfried's funeral pyre in Wagner's ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'']]
Wagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (a "complete work of art"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring [[Theme (music)|themes]] often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama, of which prototypes can be heard in his earlier operas such as ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Der fliegende Holländer]]'', ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as [[tonality]], in his quest for greater expressivity. In his mature music dramas, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'', he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of "endless melody". Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] or [[Arthurian]] legend. Finally, Wagner built [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|his own opera house]] at [[Bayreuth]] with part of the patronage from [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.

Opera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, [[Richard Strauss]] accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and the dark tragedy ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', where Mozart and Viennese [[waltz]]es became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Erich Korngold]], [[Franz Schreker]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Kurt Weill]] and the Italian-born [[Ferruccio Busoni]]. The operatic innovations of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his successors are discussed in the section on [[#Modernism|modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–3, 6, 8 and 9, and ''The Oxford Companion to Music''; more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century, the Austrian composer [[Johann Strauss II]], an admirer of the [[French language|French]]-language [[operetta]]s composed by [[Jacques Offenbach]], composed several German-language operettas, the most famous of which was ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', which is still regularly performed today.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]]. [http://www.musicals101.com/operetta.htm A History of The Musical: European Operetta 1850–1880]. Musicals101.com&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, rather than copying the style of Offenbach, the operettas of Strauss II had distinctly [[Vienna|Viennese]] flavor to them, which have cemented the Strauss II's place as one of the most renowned operetta composers of all time.

In rivalry with imported Italian opera productions, a separate French tradition was founded by the Italian [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] at the court of [[King Louis XIV]]. Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an [[Académie Royale de Musique|Academy of Music]] and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'', Lully and his librettist [[Philippe Quinault|Quinault]] created ''[[tragédie en musique]]'', a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive [[recitative]] which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], who composed five ''[[tragédie en musique|tragédies en musique]]'' as well as numerous works in other genres such as [[opéra-ballet]], all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. Despite the popularity of Italian [[opera seria]] throughout much of Europe during the Baroque period, Italian opera never gained much of a foothold in France, where its own national operatic tradition was more popular instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l_b2vIXHsUkC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=Italian+opera+not+popular+in+france#v=onepage&amp;q=Italian%20opera%20not%20popular%20in%20france&amp;f=false |title=A Short History of Opera |isbn=978-0231119580 |accessdate=11 April 2014|last1=Grout |first1=Donald Jay |last2=Grout |first2=Donald |last3=Williams |first3=Hermine Weigel |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rameau's death, the German [[Gluck]] was persuaded to produce six operas for the [[Paris|Parisian stage]] in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: ''[[opéra comique]]''. This was the equivalent of the German [[singspiel]], where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny|Monsigny]], [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor]] and, above all, [[André Grétry|Grétry]]. During the [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] period, composers such as [[Méhul]] and [[Cherubini]], who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly "comic" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g. [[François Joseph Gossec|Gossec's]] ''Le triomphe de la République'' (1793).
[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2012 - Carmen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Magdalena Kožená]] and [[Jonas Kaufmann]] in a scene from ''[[Carmen]]'', [[Salzburg Festival]] 2012]]

By the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian [[bel canto]], especially after the arrival of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] in Paris. Rossini's ''[[Guillaume Tell]]'' helped found the new genre of [[Grand Opera]], a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]. Meyerbeer's works, such as ''[[Les Huguenots]]'', emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter ''opéra comique'' also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of [[Boïeldieu]], [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Ferdinand Hérold|Hérold]] and [[Adolphe Adam|Adam]]. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer [[Hector Berlioz]] struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece ''[[Les Troyens]]'', the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.

In the second half of the 19th century, [[Jacques Offenbach]] created [[operetta]] with witty and cynical works such as ''[[Orphée aux enfers]]'', as well as the opera ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]''; [[Charles Gounod]] scored a massive success with ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''; and [[Georges Bizet]] composed ''[[Carmen]]'', which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of [[Romanticism]] and realism, became the most popular of all opéra comiques. [[Jules Massenet]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Léo Delibes]] all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory, examples being Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'', Saint-Saëns' ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson et Dalila]]'' and Delibes' ''[[Lakmé]]''.  Their operas formed another genre, the Opera Lyrique, combined opera comique and grand opera. It is less grandiose than grand opera, but without the spoken dialogue of opera comique.  At the same time, the influence of [[Richard Wagner]] was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner's music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from [[Claude Debussy]]. As in Wagner's works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy's unique opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' (1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely un-Wagnerian.

Other notable 20th-century names include [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]] and [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]]. [[Francis Poulenc]] is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carmélites]]'') have gained a foothold in the international repertory. [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s lengthy sacred drama ''[[Saint François d'Assise]]'' (1983) has also attracted widespread attention.&lt;ref&gt;General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–4, 8 and 9; and ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' (10th ed., 1968); more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===English-language opera===

In England, opera's antecedent was the 17th-century ''jig''. This was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play. It was frequently [[libel]]lous and scandalous and consisted in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect, jigs anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French [[masque]] was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with even more lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery than had been seen before. [[Inigo Jones]] became the quintessential designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Lovers Made Men'' (1617), "the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo".&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite&gt;[http://www.webrarian.co.uk/ivanhoe/ivan01.html From Webrarian.com's] ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' site.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of the [[English Commonwealth]] closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the [[dramatist]] Sir [[William Davenant]] produced ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]''. Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by ''[[The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru]]'' (1658) and ''[[The History of Sir Francis Drake]]'' (1659). These pieces were encouraged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] because they were critical of Spain. With the [[English Restoration]], foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''[[Psyche (Locke)|Psyche]]'', patterned on the 1671 'comédie-ballet' of the same name produced by [[Molière]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. [[William Davenant]] produced ''The Tempest'' in the same year, which was the first musical adaption of a [[Shakespeare]] play (composed by Locke and Johnson).&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite /&gt; About 1683, [[John Blow]] composed ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'', often thought of as the first true English-language opera.

Blow's immediate successor was the better known [[Henry Purcell]]. Despite the success of his masterwork ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead, he usually worked within the constraints of the [[semi-opera]] format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as [[Shakespeare]] in Purcell's ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'' (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in ''The Prophetess'' (1690) and ''Bonduca'' (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator [[John Dryden]]) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.

[[File:Thomas Augustine Arne.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Arne]]]]
Following Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to [[Thomas Arne]], both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being ''[[Thomas and Sally]]'' in 1760. His opera ''[[Artaxerxes (opera)|Artaxerxes]]'' (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown [[opera seria]] in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, ''Love in a Village'' (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. [[Charles Burney]] wrote that Arne introduced "a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated".
[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Mikado]]'' (Lithograph)]]
Besides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was [[George Frideric Handel]], whose ''opera serias'' filled the London operatic stages for decades and influenced most home-grown composers, like [[John Frederick Lampe]], who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including in the work of [[Michael William Balfe]], and the operas of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Mozart, Beethoven, and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.

The only exceptions were [[ballad opera]]s, such as [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728), musical [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], European [[operetta]]s, and late [[Victorian era]] [[light opera]]s, notably the [[Savoy Operas]] of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], all of which types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876),&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite /&gt; but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of "English" opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s. London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' agreed, describing ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' as "a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage".&lt;ref&gt;The ''Daily Telegraph''{{'}}s review of ''Yeomen'' stated, "The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly. ...we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage." (quoted at p. 312 in Allen, Reginald (1975). ''The First Night Gilbert and Sullivan''. London: Chappell &amp; Co. Ltd.).&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan produced a few light operas in the 1890s that were of a more serious nature than those in the G&amp;S series, including ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' and ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', but ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts—a record until Broadway's ''[[La bohème]]'') survives as his only [[Grand Opera]].

In the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and in particular [[Benjamin Britten]], who in a series of works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. More recently [[Harrison Birtwistle|Sir Harrison Birtwistle]] has emerged as one of Britain's most significant contemporary composers from his first opera ''[[Punch and Judy (opera)|Punch and Judy]]'' to his most recent critical success in [[The Minotaur (opera)|The Minotaur]]. In the first decade of the 21st century, the librettist of an early Birtwistle opera, [[Michael Nyman]], has been focusing on composing operas, including ''[[Facing Goya]]'', ''[[Man and Boy: Dada]]'', and ''[[Love Counts]]''. Today composers such as [[Thomas Adès]] continue to export English opera abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1, 3 and 9. ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Blow, Purcell and Britten.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 20th century, American composers like [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], [[Douglas Moore]], and [[Carlisle Floyd]] began to contribute English-language operas infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by composers such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Mark Adamo]], [[John Corigliano]], [[Robert Moran]], [[John Coolidge Adams]], [[André Previn]] and [[Jake Heggie]].

===Russian opera===
{{Main article|Russian opera}}
[[File:Feodor Chaliapin as Ivan Susanin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Feodor Chaliapin]] as [[Ivan Susanin]] in [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'']]
Opera was brought to Russia in the 1730s by the [[Italian opera]]tic [[wikt:troupe|troupes]] and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian Imperial Court and [[aristocracy]]. Many foreign composers such as [[Baldassare Galuppi]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Giuseppe Sarti]], and [[Domenico Cimarosa]] (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the [[Italian language]]. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Dmitry Bortniansky]] were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in Russian was ''[[Tsefal i Prokris]]'' by the Italian composer [[Francesco Araja]] (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers [[Vasily Pashkevich]], [[Yevstigney Fomin]] and [[Alexey Verstovsky]].

However, the real birth of [[Russian opera]] came with [[Mikhail Glinka]] and his two great operas ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' (1836) and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842). After him, in the 19th century in Russia, there were written such operatic masterpieces as ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]'' by [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], ''[[Prince Igor]]'' by [[Alexander Borodin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], and ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'' and ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian [[nationalism]] across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general [[Slavophilism]] movement.

In the 20th century, the [[tradition]]s of Russian opera were developed by many composers including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in his works ''[[The Miserly Knight]]'' and ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninoff)|Francesca da Rimini]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]] in ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|Le Rossignol]]'', ''[[Mavra]]'', ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'', and ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]] in ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'', ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'', ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]'', ''[[Betrothal in a Monastery]]'', and ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]''; as well as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', [[Edison Denisov]] in ''[[L'écume des jours (opera)|L'écume des jours]]'', and [[Alfred Schnittke]] in ''[[Life with an Idiot]]'' and ''[[Historia von D. Johann Fausten (opera)|Historia von D. Johann Fausten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard: Russia in 'The New Grove Dictionary of Opera', ed. Stanley Sadie (London, 1992); ''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other national operas===
[[File:Prodana Nevesta Cover 1919.JPG|thumb|Score of Smetana's ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'']]
Spain also produced its own distinctive form of opera, known as [[zarzuela]], which had two separate flowerings: one from the mid-17th century through the mid-18th century, and another beginning around 1850. During the late 18th century up until the mid-19th century, Italian opera was immensely popular in Spain, supplanting the native form.

Czech composers also developed a thriving national opera movement of their own in the 19th century, starting with [[Bedřich Smetana]], who wrote eight operas including the internationally popular ''[[The Bartered Bride]]''. [[Antonín Dvořák]], most famous for ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]'', wrote 13 operas; and [[Leoš Janáček]] gained international recognition in the 20th century for his innovative works including ''[[Jenůfa]]'', ''[[The Cunning Little Vixen]]'', and ''[[Káťa Kabanová]]''.

In Russian Eastern Europe, several national operas began to emerge. Ukrainian opera was developed by [[Semen Hulak-Artemovsky]] (1813–1873) whose most famous work ''[[Zaporozhets za Dunayem]]'' (A Cossack Beyond the Danube) is regularly performed around the world. Other Ukrainian opera composers include [[Mykola Lysenko]] (''[[Taras Bulba (opera)|Taras Bulba]]'' and ''[[Natalka Poltavka (opera)|Natalka Poltavka]]''), [[Heorhiy Maiboroda]], and [[Yuliy Meitus]]. At the turn of the century, a distinct national opera movement also began to emerge in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] under the leadership [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], who fused local [[folk song]]s and stories with 19th-century [[Romantic music|Romantic]] classical themes.

[[File:Erkel Ferenc Györgyi Alajos.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ferenc Erkel]], the father of Hungarian opera]]
The key figure of Hungarian national opera in the 19th century was [[Ferenc Erkel]], whose works mostly dealt with historical themes. Among his most often performed operas are ''[[Hunyadi László (opera)|Hunyadi László]]'' and ''[[Bánk bán]]''. The most famous modern Hungarian opera is [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]''.

[[Stanisław Moniuszko]]'s opera ''[[The Haunted Manor|Straszny Dwór]]'' (in English ''The Haunted Manor'') (1861–64) represents a nineteenth-century peak of [[Polish opera|Polish national opera]].&lt;ref&gt;See the chapter on "Russian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian Opera to 1900" by John Tyrrell in ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, other operas created by Polish composers included ''[[King Roger]]'' by [[Karol Szymanowski]] and ''[[Ubu Rex]]'' by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].

The first known opera from [[Turkey]] (the [[Ottoman Empire]]) was ''[[Arshak II (opera)|Arshak II]]'', which was an Armenian opera composed by an ethnic Armenian composer [[Tigran Tchoukhajian]] in 1868 and partially performed in 1873. It was fully staged in 1945 in Armenia.

The first years of the [[Soviet Union]] saw the emergence of new national operas, such as the ''[[Koroğlu (opera)|Koroğlu]]'' (1937) by the [[Azerbaijan]]i composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]]. The first [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] opera, ''Ai-Churek'', premiered in Moscow at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] on 26 May 1939, during Kyrgyz Art Decade. It was composed by [[Vladimir Vlasov]], [[Abdylas Maldybaev]] and [[Vladimir Fere]]. The libretto was written by Joomart Bokonbaev, Jusup Turusbekov, and Kybanychbek Malikov. The opera is based on the Kyrgyz heroic epic ''[[Epic of Manas|Manas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Abazov, Rafis (2007).

In Latin America, opera started as a result of European colonisation. The first opera ever written in the Americas was ''[[La púrpura de la rosa]]'', by [[Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco]], although ''[[Partenope (Zumaya)|Partenope]]'', by the Mexican [[Manuel de Zumaya]], was the first opera written from a composer born in Latin America (music now lost). The first Brazilian opera for a libretto in Portuguese was ''A Noite de São João'', by [[Elias Álvares Lobo]]. However, [[Antonio Carlos Gomes]] is generally regarded as the most outstanding Brazilian composer, having a relative success in Italy with its Brazilian-themed operas with Italian librettos, such as ''[[Il Guarany]]''. Opera in Argentina developed in the 20th century after the inauguration of [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires—with the opera ''[[Aurora (opera)|Aurora]]'', by [[Ettore Panizza]], being heavily influenced by the Italian tradition, due to immigration. Other important composers from Argentina include [[Felipe Boero]] and [[Alberto Ginastera]].

===Contemporary, recent, and modernist trends===

====Modernism====
Perhaps the most obvious stylistic manifestation of modernism in opera is the development of [[atonality]]. The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with [[Richard Wagner]], and in particular the [[Tristan chord]]. Composers such as [[Richard Strauss]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Giacomo Puccini]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, [[Paul Hindemith]], Benjamin Britten and [[Hans Pfitzner]] pushed Wagnerian harmony further with a more extreme use of chromaticism and greater use of dissonance. Another aspect of modernist opera is the shift away from long, suspended melodies, to short quick mottos, as first illustrated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in his ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''. Composers such as Strauss, Britten, Shostakovich and Stravinsky adopted and expanded upon this style.

[[File:Schiele - Bildnis des Komponisten Arnold Schönberg . 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Arnold Schoenberg in 1917; portrait by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
Operatic modernism truly began in the operas of two Viennese composers, [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his student [[Alban Berg]], both composers and advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), [[dodecaphony]]. Schoenberg's early musico-dramatic works, ''[[Erwartung]]'' (1909, premiered in 1924) and ''[[Die glückliche Hand]]'' display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used [[Sprechstimme]].

The two operas of Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg, ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925) and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (incomplete at his death in 1935) share many of the same characteristics as described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg's theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques.
[[File:Igor Stravinsky Essays.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky in 1921]]
Composers thus influenced include the Englishman [[Benjamin Britten]], the German [[Hans Werner Henze]], and the Russian [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. ([[Philip Glass]] also makes use of atonality, though his style is generally described as [[minimalist music|minimalist]], usually thought of as another 20th-century development.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover/periods/modern/minimalism-guide/|title=Minimalist music: where to start|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Most readers will find it startling to hear Glass associated with atonality.--&gt;

However, operatic modernism's use of atonality also sparked a backlash in the form of [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. An early leader of this movement was [[Ferruccio Busoni]], who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical [[number opera]] ''[[Arlecchino (opera)|Arlecchino]]'' (first performed in 1917).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Walton, "Neo-classical opera" in [[#Cooke2005|Cooke]], p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Also among the vanguard was the Russian [[Igor Stravinsky]]. After composing music for the [[Diaghilev]]-produced ballets ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' (1927).  Stravinsky had already turned away from the modernist trends of his early ballets to produce small-scale works that do not fully qualify as opera, yet certainly contain many operatic elements, including ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (1916: "a burlesque in song and dance") and ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'' (1918: "to be read, played, and danced"; in both cases the descriptions and instructions are those of the composer). In the latter, the actors declaim portions of speech to a specified rhythm over instrumental accompaniment, peculiarly similar to the older German genre of ''[[Melodrama]]''.  Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (1914), and ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore [[serialism|serialist technique]] and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style [[diatonic]] number opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many{{who|date=October 2012}}&lt;!-- if references had a page number it might be possible to replace weaslely phrase with a concrete example --&gt; other composers.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 8; ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Schoenberg, Berg and Stravinsky; Malcolm MacDonald ''Schoenberg'' (Dent,1976); Francis Routh, ''Stravinsky'' (Dent, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other trends====
A common trend throughout the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, is the use of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private patronage of the arts decreased throughout the 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; [[Mark Adamo]]'s two-act realization of ''[[Little Women (opera)|Little Women]]'' is scored for 18 instrumentalists.

Another feature of late 20th-century opera is the emergence of contemporary historical operas, in contrast to the tradition of basing operas on more distant history, the re-telling of contemporary fictional stories or plays, or on myth or legend. ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'', ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]'', and ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'' by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], ''[[Dead Man Walking (opera)|Dead Man Walking]]'' by [[Jake Heggie]], and ''[[Anna Nicole]]'' by [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]] exemplify the dramatisation onstage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive at the time of the premiere performance.

The Metropolitan Opera in the US reports that the average age of its audience is now 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/met-backtracks-on-drop-in-average-audience-age/ | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel J. | last=Wakin | title=Met Backtracks on Drop in Average Audience Age | date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for [[classical music]] since the last decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;General reference for this section: ''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/about/education/student.aspx |title=Information about Metropolitan Opera Company student discounts |publisher=Metoperafamily.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller companies in the US have a more fragile existence, and they usually depend on a "patchwork quilt" of support from state and local governments, local businesses, and fundraisers. Nevertheless, some smaller companies have found ways of drawing new audiences. [[Opera Carolina]] offer discounts and happy hour events to the 21- to 40-year-old demographic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operayoungprofessionals.org/ Opera Carolina discount information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221220758/http://www.operayoungprofessionals.org/ |date=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to radio and television broadcasts of opera performances, which have had some success in gaining new audiences, broadcasts of live performances in HD to movie theatres have shown the potential to reach new audiences. Since 2006, the Met has broadcast live performances to several hundred movie screens all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/broadcast/hd_events_alternates.aspx|title = On Air &amp; On Line: 2007–08 HD Season|accessdate = 10 April 2008|year = 2007|publisher = The Metropolitan Opera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====From musicals back towards opera====
By the late 1930s, some [[musical theatre|musicals]] began to be written with a more operatic structure. These works include complex polyphonic ensembles and reflect musical developments of their times. ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935), influenced by jazz styles, and ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' (1956), with its sweeping, lyrical passages and farcical parodies of opera, both opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] but became accepted as part of the opera repertory. Popular [[Musical theatre|musicals]] such as ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and others tell dramatic stories through complex music and in the 2010s they are sometimes seen in opera houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/dec/17/classicalmusicandopera1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Clements | title=Sweeney Todd, Royal Opera House, London | date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' (1952) is quasi-operatic and has been revived by the [[New York City Opera]]. Other [[rock musical|rock influenced musicals]], such as ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1971), ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1980), ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996), ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'' (2006), and ''[[Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812]]'' (2012) employ various operatic conventions, such as [[through composed|through composition]], recitative instead of dialogue, and [[leitmotif]]s.

===Acoustic enhancement in opera===
A subtle type of sound electronic reinforcement called [[acoustic enhancement]] is used in some modern concert halls and theatres where operas are performed. Although none of the major opera houses "...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre", many use a [[sound reinforcement system]] for acoustic enhancement and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, child singers, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in ''[[Tosca]]'' or thunder effects in Wagnerian operas).&lt;ref&gt;Kai Harada, [http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 "Opera's Dirty Little Secret"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031082324/http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 |date=31 October 2013 }}, ''Entertainment Design'', 1 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operatic voices==
Operatic vocal technique evolved, in a time before electronic amplification, to allow singers to produce enough volume to be heard over an orchestra, without the instrumentalists having to substantially compromise their volume.

===Vocal classifications===
Singers and the roles they play are classified by [[voice type]], based on the [[tessitura]], [[vocal weight|agility, power]] and [[timbre]] of their voices. Male singers can be classified by [[vocal range]] as [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[bass-baritone]], [[baritone]], [[tenor]] and [[countertenor]], and female singers as [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]]. (Men sometimes sing in the "female" vocal ranges, in which case they are termed [[sopranist]] or [[countertenor]]. The [[countertenor]] is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for [[castrati]]—men neutered at a young age specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by [[vocal weight|size]]—for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, [[coloratura]], [[soubrette]], [[spinto]], or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.

Yet another sub-classification can be made according to acting skills or requirements, for example the ''[[Basso Buffo]]'' who often must be a specialist in [[Patter song|patter]] as well as a comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the ''[[Fach]]'' system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken [[drama]] were often put on by the same [[repertory]] company.

A particular singer's voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age. Two French voice types, ''premiere dugazon'' and ''deuxieme dugazon'', were named after successive stages in the career of [[Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre]] (Mme. Dugazon). Other terms originating in the star casting system of the [[Paris Opera#See also|Parisian theatres]] are ''[[Jean-Blaise Martin|baryton-martin]]'' and [[soprano]] ''[[Cornélie Falcon|falcon]]''.

===Historical use of voice parts===
:''The following is only intended as a brief overview. For the main articles, see [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[countertenor]] and [[castrato]]''.

The soprano voice has typically been used as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since the latter half of the 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a [[castrato]]. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high [[A (musical note)|A]] ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], for example, only wrote one role extending to a high [[C (musical note)|C]]), though the castrato [[Farinelli]] was alleged to possess a top [[D (musical note)|D]] (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' to such heavyweight roles as Brangäne in Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; there is quite a lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing "witches, bitches, and [[breeches role|britches]]" roles. In recent years many of the "trouser roles" from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.

The tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the ''bel canto'' era, such as [[Donizetti]]'s sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during ''[[La fille du régiment]]''. With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal heft for his protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as ''Heldentenor''; this heroic voice had its more Italianate counterpart in such roles as Calaf in Puccini's ''Turandot''. Basses have a long history in opera, having been used in ''opera seria'' in supporting roles, and sometimes for comic relief (as well as providing a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the comedy of Leporello in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' to the nobility of Wotan in [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Wagner's ''Ring Cycle,'']] to the conflicted King Phillip of Verdi's ''[[Don Carlos]]''. In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone, which also varies in weight from say, Guglielmo in Mozart's ''Così fan tutte'' to Posa in Verdi's ''Don Carlos''; the actual designation "baritone" was not standard until the mid-19th century.

===Famous singers===
[[File:Senesino portrait edited.jpg|thumb|upright|The castrato [[Senesino]], c. 1720]]
Early performances of opera were too infrequent for singers to make a living exclusively from the style, but with the birth of commercial opera in the mid-17th century, professional performers began to emerge. The role of the male hero was usually entrusted to a [[castrato]], and by the 18th century, when Italian opera was performed throughout Europe, leading castrati who possessed extraordinary vocal virtuosity, such as [[Senesino]] and [[Farinelli]], became international stars. The career of the first major female star (or [[prima donna]]), [[Anna Renzi]], dates to the mid-17th century. In the 18th century, a number of Italian sopranos gained international renown and often engaged in fierce rivalry, as was the case with [[Faustina Bordoni]] and [[Francesca Cuzzoni]], who started a fist fight with one another during a performance of a Handel opera. The French disliked castrati, preferring their male heroes to be sung by an [[haute-contre]] (a high tenor), of which [[Joseph Legros]] (1739–1793) was a leading example.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (ed. Parker, 1994), Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;

Though opera patronage has decreased in the last century in favor of other arts and media (such as musicals, cinema, radio, television and recordings), mass media and the advent of recording have supported the popularity of many famous singers including [[Maria Callas]], [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Amelita Galli-Curci]], [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Juan Arvizu]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mexican+musicians+in+California+and+the+United+States%2C+1910-50.-a0155283831 ''The Free Library – Mexican Musicians in California and the United States 1910–50 – Two Mexican Tenors'' – Juan Arvizu opera tenor in thefreelibrary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lzmTAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:sZtJSSJbdm4C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9sOe62dXZAhXPct8KHYJeCmcQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Juan%20Arvizu&amp;f=false ''Agustin Lara: A Cultural Biography'' – "Juan Arvizu Biography" – operatic tenor] Andrew Grant Wood.

==Changing role of the orchestra==
Before the 1700s, Italian operas used a small [[string orchestra]], but it rarely played to accompany the singers. Opera solos during this period were accompanied by the [[basso continuo]] group, which consisted of the [[harpsichord]], "plucked instruments" such as [[lute]] and a bass instrument.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"&gt;John Spitzer. (2009). Orchestra and voice in eighteenth-century Italian opera. In: Anthony R. DelDonna and Pierpaolo Polzonetti (eds.) [[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Eighteenth-Century Opera]]. pp. 112–39. [Online]. Cambridge Companions to Music. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The string orchestra typically only played when the singer was not singing, such as during a singer's "...entrances and exits, between vocal numbers, [or] for [accompanying] dancing". Another role for the orchestra during this period was playing an orchestral [[ritornello]] to mark the end of a singer's solo.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"/&gt; During the early 1700s, some composers began to use the string orchestra to mark certain aria or recitatives "...as special"; by 1720, most arias were accompanied by orchestra. Opera composers such as [[Domenico Sarro]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Giambattista Pergolesi]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Johann Adolf Hasse]] added new instruments to the opera orchestra and gave the instruments new roles. They added wind instruments to the strings and used orchestral instruments to play instrumental solos, as a way to mark certain arias as special.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"/&gt;
[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006329 030 Orchester im Orchestergraben.jpg|thumb|right|German opera orchestra from the early 1950s]]
The orchestra has also provided an instrumental [[overture]] before the singers come onstage since the 1600s. [[Jacopo Peri|Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' opens with a brief instrumental [[ritornello]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) opens with a [[toccata]], in this case a fanfare for muted [[trumpet]]s. The [[French overture]] as found in [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s operas&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, George Gow, and James R. Anthony. 2001. "French Overture". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; consist of a slow introduction in a marked "dotted rhythm", followed by a lively movement in [[fugato]] style. The overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose. This overture style was also used in English opera, most notably in [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''. [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas such as [[Giulio Cesare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8fHja-D-FvsC&amp;dq=Giulio+Cesare+French+overture&amp;q=Giulio+Cesare+French+overture#v=snippet&amp;q=Giulio%20Cesare%20French%20overture&amp;f=false |last= Burrows |first = Donald|date = 2012|page = 178|title = Handel|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 978-0199737369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, a distinct form called "overture" arose in the 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2001"&gt;Fisher, Stephen C. 2001. "Italian Overture." ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses three generally [[homophony|homophonic]] [[Movement (music)|movements]]: fast–slow–fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was short, and could be in a contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the [[gigue]] or [[minuet]], and returned to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement may incorporate fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called "sonatina form" ([[sonata form]] without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2001"/&gt;

In Italian opera after about 1800, the "overture" became known as the ''sinfonia''.&lt;ref name=FISH&gt;Fisher, Stephen C. 1998. "Sinfonia". ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', four volumes, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]]. London: Macmillan Publishers, Inc. {{ISBN|0333734327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher also notes the term ''Sinfonia avanti l'opera'' (literally, the "symphony before the opera") was "an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work".&lt;ref name=FISH/&gt; In 19th-century opera, in some operas, the overture, ''Vorspiel'', ''Einleitung'', Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, was the portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises; a specific, rigid form was no longer required for the overture.

The role of the orchestra in accompanying the singers changed over the 19th century, as the Classical style transitioned to the Romantic era. In general, orchestras got bigger, new instruments were added, such as additional percussion instruments (e.g., bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, etc.). The [[orchestration]] of orchestra parts also developed over the 19th century. In Wagnerian operas, the forefronting of the orchestra went beyond the overture. In Wagnerian operas such as ''[[Tristan]]'', the orchestra often played the recurrent musical themes or [[leitmotif]]s, a role which gave a prominence to the orchestra which "...elevated its status to that of a [[prima donna]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Christopher John |date=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era |url= |location= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |page=772 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner's operas were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity, adding more brass instruments and huge ensemble sizes: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s.

As the role of the orchestra and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did the role of leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the [[concertmaster]], would lead the orchestra while sitting. Over time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of [[music director]] became termed the [[conducting|conductor]], and a podium was used to make it easier for all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the [[orchestra pit]] and the singers up on stage.

==Language and translation issues==
Since the days of Handel and Mozart, many composers have favored Italian as the language for the libretto of their operas. From the Bel Canto era to Verdi, composers would sometimes supervise versions of their operas in both Italian and French. Because of this, operas such as ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' or ''[[Don Carlos]]'' are today deemed canonical in both their French and Italian versions.&lt;ref&gt;de Acha, Rafael. [http://seenandheard-international.com/2013/09/don-carlos-in-french/ "Don Carlo or Don Carlos? In Italian or in French?"] (Seen and Heard International, 24 September 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Till the mid 1950s, it was acceptable to produce operas in translations even if these had not been authorized by the composer or the original librettists. For example, opera houses in Italy routinely staged Wagner in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/whose-language-is-opera-the-audiences-or-the-composers/news-story/b8b5ea7dfc230f1eda72a2eb329d1daa|title=Whose language is opera: the audience's or the composer's?|author=[[Lyndon Terracini]]|date=11 April 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After WWII, opera scholarship improved, artists refocused on the original versions, and translations fell out of favor. Knowledge of European languages, especially Italian, French, and German, is today an important part of the training for professional singers."The biggest chunk of operatic training is in linguistics and musicianship," explains mezzo-soprano [[Dolora Zajick]]. "[I have to understand] not only what I'm singing, but what everyone else is singing. I sing Italian, Czech, Russian, French, German, English."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2014/03/19/291410969/dolora-zajick-singing-is-connected-to-the-body "For Opera Powerhouse Dolora Zajick, 'Singing Is Connected To The Body'"] (Fresh Air, 19 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called [[surtitles]]) began to appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally condemned as a distraction,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Tommasini|Tommasini, Anthony]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/arts/music/06tomm.html "So That's What the Fat Lady Sang"] (''The New York Times'', 6 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's [[proscenium]] arch, or individual seat screens where spectators can choose from more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a [[RAI]] broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse is much harder to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.

Today, operas are only rarely performed in translation. Exceptions include the [[English National Opera]], the [[Opera Theater of St. Louis]], [[Opera Theater of Pittsburgh]], and Opera South East,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operasoutheast.org.uk/all-past-productions.html "Opera South East's past productions back to 1980...

A milestone for opera broadcasting in the U.S. was achieved on December 24, 1951, with the live broadcast of ''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]'', an opera in one act by [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]. It was the first opera specifically composed for television in America.&lt;ref name=Telegraphobit&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/news/2007/02/02/db0201.xml Obituary: Gian Carlo Menotti], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 2 February 2007. Accessed 11 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another milestone occurred in Italy in 1992 when ''[[Tosca]]'' was broadcast live from its original Roman settings and times of the day:  The first act came from the 16th-century Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle at noon on Saturday; the 16th-century Palazzo Farnese was the setting for the second at 8:15 P.M.; and on Sunday at 6 A.M., the third act was broadcast from Castel Sant'Angelo. The production was transmitted via satellite to 105 countries.&lt;ref name="O'Connor 1 January 1993"&gt;{{cite news

The emergence of the Internet has also affected the way in which audiences consume opera. In 2009 the British [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] offered for the first time an online digital video download of its complete 2007 production of ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.

{{italic title}}
'''''Paris Street; Rainy Day''''' ({{lang-fr|Rue de Paris, temps de pluie}}) is a large 1877 oil painting by the French artist [[Gustave Caillebotte]] (1848–1894), and is his best known work.&lt;ref name="h624"&gt;Hagen, 624&lt;/ref&gt; It shows a number of individuals walking through the Place de Dublin, then known as the Carrefour de Moscou, at an intersection to the east of the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] in north Paris. Although Caillebotte was a friend and patron of many of the impressionist painters, and this work is part of that school, it differs in its realism and reliance on line rather than broad brush strokes.

Caillebotte's interest in photography is evident. The figures in the foreground appear "out of focus", those in the mid-distance (the carriage and the pedestrians in the intersection) have sharp edges, while the features in the background become progressively indistinct. The severe cropping of some figures –particularly the man to the far right– further suggests the influence of photography.

The painting was first shown at the Third [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] Exhibition of 1877. It is currently owned by the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/20684 Paris Street; Rainy Day, 1877]. Art Institute of Chicago. Retrieved 29 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art Institute of Chicago|AIC]] curator Gloria Groom described the work as "the great picture of urban life in the late 19th century."&lt;ref&gt;Hedy Weiss. "Gustave Who?" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. 12 February 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Paris Street; Rainy Day Detail 1.png|thumb|240px|Detail]]
The tone of the light indicates that the painting is set on a wintery afternoon,&lt;ref name="w174"&gt;Weinber, 174&lt;/ref&gt; and the two main figures walk underneath an umbrella.  They are dressed in the height of contemporary Parisian fashion. She wears a hat, veil, diamond earring, demure brown dress, and a fur lined coat, described in 1877 as "modern – or should I say, the latest fashion". The man wears a moustache, [[overcoat|topcoat]], [[frock coat]],&lt;ref name="h627"&gt;Hagen, 627&lt;/ref&gt; top hat, bow tie, starched white shirt, buttoned waistcoat and an open long coat with collar turned up. They are unambiguously middle class, yet some working class figures may be seen in the background; a maid in a doorway, the decorator carrying a ladder, cut-off by the umbrella above him.&lt;ref name="h626"&gt;Hagen, 626&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b19"&gt;Broude, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Caillebotte juxtaposes the figures and the perspective in a playful manner, with one man appearing to jump from the wheel of a carriage; another pair of legs appear below the rim of an umbrella.

[[File:Gustave Caillebotte, 1877 - Rue de Paris, jour de pluie (étude).jpg|left|thumb|300px|Study for ''Paris Street; Rainy Day'']]
The painting does not present a convivial mood. The figures seem mostly isolated, and their expressions are largely downcast. They appear to hurry rather than stroll through the streets, absorbed in their own thoughts. The umbrellas shield them, in the words of Rose-Marie Hagen, "not just from the rain, but, also it seems, from other passers by".&lt;ref name="h626" /&gt; Characteristic of the positioning of the figures, the heads and eyes of the main couple are faced away from the man approaching them from their right. Hagen believes that given their close quarters, they will both be unable to comfortably step out of the man's way, but also their averted gaze applies equally to the viewer, who looks from a perspective equal to us.&lt;ref name="h625"&gt;Hagen, 625&lt;/ref&gt; Caillebotte reproduces the effect of a camera lens in that the points at the center of the image seem to bulge. He also recreates the focusing effect of the camera in the way that it sharpens certain subjects of an image, but not others. The same purpose is seen in the overall clarity of the image. The foreground is in focus, but slightly smudged; the middle ground has sharp, clear edges and well defined subjects, and the background fades into the distance, becoming more and more blurry the farther back the eye travels. He makes the middle ground section more clear, mimicking the effect of a camera.

The figures appear to have walked into the painting, as though Caillebotte was taking a snapshot of people going about their day; in fact, he spent months carefully placing them within the pictorial space.&lt;ref name="h626" /&gt; The painting is highly linear;&lt;ref name="b18"&gt;Broude, 18&lt;/ref&gt; its focus draws the viewer's eye to the vantage point at the center of the buildings in the background. The strong vertical of the central green lamp post divides the painting; a horizontal alignment breaks the painting into quarters; the gaslight at the center of the picture throws shadows on the wet cobblestones, and divides the composition in two. Cobblestones dominate one full quarter of the canvas.&lt;ref name="h626" /&gt;

==Setting==
[[File:Place de Dublin, Paris May 2010.jpg|thumb|320px|2010 photograph of the [[Place de Dublin]]]]
''Paris Street; Rainy Day'' gives a view from the eastern side of the {{ill|Rue de Turin|fr|Rue de Turin (Paris)}}, looking north toward the [[Place de Dublin]]. The neoclassical buildings reflect the construction works of [[Baron Haussmann]]. The view shown is spacious, and details a broad view of a number of streets. Although the [[ashlar]] facades of the buildings might today seem uniform, at the time they would have been modern and fresh – in Caillebotte's youth the area was a hill just beyond the city edge just beginning to be developed as a residential center for the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name="h625"&gt;Hagen, 625&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Three roads are visible on the northern side of the square: the {{ill|rue de Moscou|fr|Rue de Moscou (Paris)}} (left), the {{ill|rue Clapeyron|fr}} (center), and a continuation of the rue de Turin (right), which runs from the foreground and into the background. The square is crossed by the {{ill|rue de Saint-Pétersbourg|fr}}, suggested by the line of the buildings to the left and a break in the buildings to the right.&lt;ref name="h625"&gt;Hagen, 625&lt;/ref&gt; The point of view of the roads and the buildings portrayed allows Caillebotte to use [[two-point perspective]].

==Reception and provenance==
[[Émile Zola]], often a critic of Caillebotte,  praised this work in an article "Notes parisiennes: Une exposition: les peintres impressionnistes" published in ''Le Sémaphore de Marseille'' in 1877.

As with many of Caillebotte's paintings, it remained with the family until the mid twentieth century. It was acquired by [[Walter P. Chrysler Jr.]] in 1955, who in turn sold it to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/5wEUCOlEf-EaVQ?projectId=art-project#!asset-viewer:l.id=5wEUCOlEf-EaVQ&amp;projectId=art-project&amp;urlStub=Paris%20Street%3B%20Rainy%20Day Paris Street; Rainy Day1877], Google Art Project&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Passy, Bridges of Paris''''', also called '''''Les ponts de Paris (Passy)''''', or '''''Paysage à Passy''''', is a painting created in 1912 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. The work was exhibited at the Salon de la [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]], Rouen, 1912 (titled ''Passy''); the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Galerie La Boétie, Paris, 1912 (titled ''Passy''); Manes Moderni Umeni, Vystava, Prague, 1914 (titled ''Paysage à Passy''); and Galerie [[Der Sturm]], Berlin, July, 1914.

''Passy'' was one of a small group of works chosen to be reproduced in the seminal treatise ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written by Albert Gleizes and [[Jean Metzinger]] in 1912 and published by Eugène Figuière the same year. Executed in a highly personal [[Cubism|Cubist]] style with multiple viewpoints and planar faceting, this is one of a number of paintings from 1912-13 involving the theme of the bridge in an urban landscape.

In opposition to classical perspective as a mode of representation, Gleizes employed a new spatial model based in part on the pictorial space of the mathematician [[Jules Henri Poincaré|Henri Poincaré]].

This painting, in the collection of the Museum Moderner Kunst ([[mumok]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mumok.at/en/les-ponts-de-paris-passy Museum Moderner Kunst (mumok), Albert Gleizes, Les Ponts de Paris (Passy)]&lt;/ref&gt; Vienna, probably refers to the spirit of solidarity among the newly formed "Artists of Passy", during a time when factions had begun to develop within [[Cubism]].

The works represents an upscale ''cartier de Paris'' known as Passy located in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris]], one of the most wealthy districts of the French capital, and traditionally the home of well-known personalities, including [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] during the nine years that he lived in France, [[William Kissam Vanderbilt]], and the artist [[Jacques-Emile Blanche]].

''Les Artistes de Passy'' was a divers grouping of [[avant-garde]] artistes (painters, sculptors and poets), including several who previously held meetings in 1910 at the rue Visconti studio of Henri Le Fauconnier. Their first diner (''Premier dîner des Artistes de Passy'') presided over by [[Paul Fort]] was held at the [[Maison de Balzac|house of Balzac]], rue Raynouard, in the presence of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[André Mare]], [[Francis Picabia]], Henry Valensi, and [[Jacques Villon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larousse.fr/archives/grande-encyclopedie/page/3910 ''Cubisme, 1912", Archives, Grande Encyclopédie Larousse]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Gleizes chose to Passy as the subject of this painting.

Instead of depicting a bowl of fruit or a man playing a guitar under the influence of African art, Gleizes turns toward a [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] model of geometry as a source of inspiration for ''Passy''. This work signified the rejection of [[Euclidean geometry]] and its correlate; the quantitative measurement of spatial depth governing [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] invented during the Renaissance, an unquestioned principle of academic painting that had persisted to date.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanishing points have been abolished. A perspectival grid is gone. Forms are not clearly delineated. Colors are synthetic and limited, not overpowering. Light and reflected light do not come from a consistent unidirectional source. There is no precisely clear relationship between structures (e.g., buildings, bridges) based on overlapping or on diminished scale with distance to show [[depth of field]] as objects recede from the foreground. Here Gleizes brakes all the rules. Perhaps for this reason ''Passy'' was chosen as an example of ''new painting'' for publication in their manifesto; ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]''.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001, Albert Gleizes, ''Passy (Ponts de Paris)'', reproduced Fig. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Antliff and Leighten write of ''Passy (Ponts de Paris)'' in ''Cubism and Culture'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of this [academic] spatial model, Cubists turned to new models of geometry and the 'fourth dimension' as inspiration for the works like Gleizes's ''Passy'' (Ponts de Paris) of 1912, which he and Metzinger reproduced in their tract ''Du Cubisme'' as exemplary of art expressing their ideas. This urban landscape synthesized the river, trees, clouds, buildings, steel bridges and smoke of the modern city. Partially geometrized forms—such as the green arc of tree on the upper left or arched doors and windows on the rectangular buildings in the center—are subjectively evoked through limited colour range; shifting perspectives, signified by long vertical and diagonal bands cutting off the edges of objects contained within them; and shifting relative scales of objects, such as the two steel bridge spans. [...] the Cubists justified this novel approach to pictorial space in part on the basis of the mathematician [[Jules Henri Poincaré|Henri Poincaré]]'s theory of 'conventionalism'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The existence of a fourth dimension, according to Poincaré, could not be ruled out by observation alone. "If the number of dimensions comes from the way in which we are made", Poincaré hypothesized, "there might be thinking beings living in our world, but made differently from us, who would think that space has more or less than three dimensions."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the characteristic property of space, that of having three dimensions, is only a property of our distribution board, a property residing, so to speak, in the human intelligence. The destruction of some of these connections that is to say of these associations of ideas, would be sufficient to give us a different distribution board, and that might be enough to endow space with a fourth dimension. (Poincaré, 1897)&lt;ref name="Henri Poincaré"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/poincare.htm Henri Poincaré, ''The Relativity of Space'', from ''Science &amp; Method'', 1897]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Poincaré stressed the importance of understanding the ''relativity of space''. Space is in reality amorphous, according to Poincaré, only things that occupy space give it a form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One part of space is not by itself and in the absolute sense of the word equal to another part of space, for if it is so for us, it will not be so for the inhabitants of the universe B, and they have precisely as much right to reject our opinion as we have to condemn theirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have shown elsewhere what are the consequences of these facts from the point of view of the idea that we should construct non-Euclidean and other analogous geometries. (Poincaré, 1897)&lt;ref name="Henri Poincaré" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consistent with the view of Poincaré, Euclidean geometry represented one configuration among many equally valid geometric models that Gleizes could have chosen. With this newfound liberty, he was free to transform ''Passy'' in accord with his own subjectivity. This radical break from classical conventions was not without its parallel in Nietzschean free will and freedom of expression. In an essay on the Cubism of Metzinger published September 1911, Gleizes wrote of his compatriot as a disciple of the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who 'invents his own truth' by destroying 'old values'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, L'Art et ses représentants. ''Jean Metzinger'', Revue Indépendante, Paris, September, 1911, pp.&amp;nbsp;161–172&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the classical Euclidean notion of 'fixed' absolute space explicitly informed the fictive 'moment' of absolute time, the Cubists jettisoned the idea of placing the observer at a privileged spatial position at a fixed moment in time. Now, according to the theoretical deliberations of Gleizes and Metzinger, artists were free to move around the subject matter, depicting multiple views 'simultaneously', whereby several successive moments in time could be captured and projected onto the canvas at once. In the process, the 'total image' produced over a period of time was more complete than a single instantaneous view.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

The intervention of memory in the process of representation was an important criterion for Henri Poincaré (as it would be too for the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], [[Symbolism (arts)|post-Symbolist]] writers and Gleizes himself):

:Besides, we have to make a representation, not of a complexus of simultaneous sensations, but of a complexus of successive sensations, following one another in a determined order, and it is for this reason that I said just now that the intervention of memory is necessary. (Poincaré, 1897)&lt;ref name="Henri Poincaré" /&gt;

"Absolute space exists no longer" writes Poincaré; "there is only space relative to a certain initial position of the body".

&lt;blockquote&gt;We define a point by the succession of movements we require to make to reach it, starting from a certain initial position of the body. The axes are accordingly attached to this initial position of the body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But the position I call initial may be arbitrarily chosen from among all the positions my body has successively occupied. If a more or less unconscious memory of these successive positions is necessary for the genesis of the notion of space, this memory can go back more or less into the past. Hence results a certain indeterminateness in the very definition of space, and it is precisely this indeterminateness which constitutes its relativity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Memory would play an important role in ''Les Ponts de Paris (Passy)'', as it did in Gleizes' ''[[Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon (Gleizes)|Le Chemin (Paysage à Meudon)]]'', ''[[Portrait of Jacques Nayral (Gleizes)|Portrait of Jacques Nayral]]'', painted in 1911, ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|Man on a Balcony]]'' of 1912, and ''[[Portrait de l’éditeur Eugène Figuière (Gleizes)|Portrait de l’éditeur Eugène Figuière]]'', of 1913: Both the content and form in these paintings were the result of mind associations as he completed the works from ''memory''; something that would play a crucial role in the works of other Cubists, such as [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

==Cubist factions==
Disparate inspirations during a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] phase had already yielded several related methods of expressing the geometric experience (what Gleizes and Metzinger would soon attribute to ''mobile perspective''). Cubism was in the eye of the beholder; it could be seen as a process, a system, a state of mind, an inspired attitude that would develop a new symbolic structure, a reflection of the changing world.

Despite their similarities, works produced by divers artists were neither homogeneous nor isotropic. This venture was essentially nonlinear. Cubism was omnidirectional, growing like a tree with many branches. The progression of each artist was unique. Even when paths would cross, artists would not necessarily fall under one another's influence. Despite a growing awareness, a 'collective consciousness' based on a nonacademic passion for structure and mobility, and despite the sense of group unity that would attain a maxima circa 1912, deep-seated differences arose sporadically, often fueled by critics and dealers.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

In ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum curator and art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] writes of ''Passy'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A synthesis of the modern city with its smoke, river and steel bridges, this work probably refers also to the spirit of solidarity among the newly formed "Artists of Passy". In this sense it indicates an awareness of factions within Cubism. (Robbins, 1964)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, 1964"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The participation of many artists, in addition to Metzinger, Gleizes and the Duchamp brothers, in the formation of the association ''Les Artistes de Passy'' in October 1912 was an attempt to transform the Passy district of Paris into yet another art-centre; a further sign of a growing emphasis on communal activity that would culminate in the [[Section d'Or]] exhibition.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism"&gt;[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Les Artistes de Passy'' was a further sign too, as Robbins points out, of the growing rift that separated the Salon Cubists (Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and others) from the Gallery Cubists (Picasso and Braque). There was a distinct difference between the Salon Cubists and [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]]’s Cubists. The latter had mostly been seen by a small group of artists and connoisseurs in a small private gallery, generating only modest reviews in the press, while the impact of the Salon group in the printed press and general public was enormous. Kahnweiler had exclusivity contracts with his artists and sold only to a small circle of collectors from his small "boutique" (Gleizes' term) comparatively hidden behind [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]]. Works of the Salon Cubists were seen by tens of thousands of spectators during well-publicized, conspicuous and prominent events such as the [[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Salon des Indépendants]]. Picasso and Barque were kept away from the Salons by Kahnweiler for fear of ridicule and for financial reasons (exclusivity guaranteed commission).&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51056.html Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, ''Tea Time (Woman with a Teaspoon)'', 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt;

:Metzinger's ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]'' "was far more famous than any painting that Picasso and Braque had made up until this time; because Picasso and Braque, by not showing at the Salons, have actually removed themselves from the public... For most people, the idea of Cubism was actually associated with an artist like Metzinger, far more than Picasso." (Michael Taylor, 2010, Curator Philadelphia Museum of Art)&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1913, Bouteille, clarinette, violon, journal, verre.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1913, Bouteille, clarinette, violon, journal, verre, 55 x 45 cm. This painting from the collection of [[Wilhelm Uhde]] was confiscated by the French state and sold at the Hôtel Drouot in 1921]]
While financial support from Kahnweiler's gallery sales gave Picasso and Braque the freedom to experiment in relative privacy,&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; the highly publicized Salon Cubists were free to experiment in public and sell works directly from their studios and Salons.

The immense Cubist manifestation called ''Salon de la Section d'Or'' of 1912 (an exhibition organized by Metzinger, Gleizes and the Duchamp brothers) took place at the centrally located ''Galerie de la Boétie'' in a prominent gallery district of Paris. This gallery showing by Salon Cubists may have been seen as a threat by Kahnweiler, since it marked the beginning of decades of personal attacks targeting artists not associated with his gallery.

At stake, beyond commercial speculation and financial profit, were the questions of when Cubism began, who led the way in its development, what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist. By marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne, Kahnweiler's attempted to focus attention on Picasso and Braque, those who played a leading if independent role in the development of this new mode of expression.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; To some extent Kahnweiler had succeeded in his endeavor, prompting historians such as Douglas Cooper to coin the term ‘true’ Cubism to describe the work of Picasso and Braque. The implied value judgement was intentional.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

This restricted view of Cubism has since been replaced by more contemporary alternative interpretations of Cubism, more complex and heteroclite; formed to some degree in response to the more publicized Salon Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of the Gallery Cubists to be considered merely secondary to them.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Salon Cubists produced a different kinds of Cubism. It is not clear to what extent these Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, ‘passage’ and multiple perspective. They could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of Picasso and Braque, guided by their own understanding of Cézanne. The works produced by these other Cubists exhibited at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézannian range of subjects chosen by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale allegoric and modern-life subjects. "Aimed at a large Salon public", writes art historian Christopher Green, "these works made clear use of Cubist techniques of faceting and multiple perspective for expressive effect in order to preserve the eloquence of subjects that were richly endowed with literary and philosophical connotations". The Salon Cubists were attuned to the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s notion of ‘duration’, according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuous forward movement in time, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. In ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related this sense of time to ''multiple perspective''. "The one major innovation that one can be sure was made independently by the Salon Cubists, that of ‘simultaneity’, came of a conviction also rooted in their understanding of Bergson that the divisions of space and time should be comprehensively challenged." Green continues: "The conjunction of such subject-matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early [[Futurism|Futurist]] paintings by [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Gino Severini]] and [[Carlo Carrà]]; these Italian works, though themselves made in response to early Cubism, led the way in the application of techniques of simultaneity in 1911–12".&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'What is necessary', writes Gleizes, 'is to take everything up again from the foundations and to start out from the unquestionable reality of two currents which, unaware of each other, were finally enfolded under a single heading, the movement that was called 'Cubism'. You can then avoid confusion if, right from the start, you make the distinctions that must, in all honesty, be acknowledged. The history of the 'Bâteau Lavoir' belongs to those who were part of that particular grouping. Personally, I only know what has been said about this history; I do not know the details, nor did my comrades of the other group Metzinger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger... But what I do know well, because I lived it and remember it perfectly, is the origin of our relations and their development to 1914, passing by the notorious Room 41 of the ''Indépendants'' of 1911, which provoked the 'involuntary scandal' out of which Cubism really emerged and spread in Paris, in France and through the world... (Albert Gleizes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/gltexts/picasso Gleizes, on Picasso and Braque (1911-1953), An anthology, Extract No. 1, Albert Gleizes, Les Méjades, to Mme &amp;#91;-&amp;#93;, n.d. &amp;#91;1953&amp;#93;, First published in French, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, 1997], Preface and translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes continues in an unpublished 1917 paper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Speculators with their own interests and the idiocy [''sottise''] of painters who played their game created a legend which up to now has never openly been challenged. It proclaimed that the entire movement of plastic art of our time had been thrown into confusion by the discoveries above-mentioned. Their inventor was made into the pivot of the movement which was being built. Everything came from him, he had foreseen everything and outside his genius the rest was nothing but pastiche and followers. The truth, however, is that it was the appearance of a ''group'' that gave the twist of the helm to the new aspirations. It was not the work of an isolated figure who presided over the mystery of a boutique, who surrounded himself with thick veils and acted on some sniffer dogs [''flaireurs''] and dupes, but rather the brutal appearance in broad daylight of a coherent group [''ensemble homogène''] who did not claim to be displaying masterpieces but wanted to witness a fervent discipline, a new order. [...] On one side, the talk was all of the moderns and the negroes, on the other it was of the cathedrals and the solidity [''sureté''] of David and Ingres.

'''''Portrait of Ms Ruby May, Standing''''' is an [[oil on canvas]] painting made in 2012 by the British visual artist Leena McCall, portraying her friend Ruby May.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 7 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Luke|title=Painting Pulled From Exhibition Because of "Disgusting" Pubic Hair|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/art-culture/painting-pulled-gallery-disgusting-pubic-hair/|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=[[Vocativ]]|date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The painting depicts May, a tattooed black-haired woman, smoking a pipe. May is coolly scrutinizing the viewer, her other hand on her hip, with her trousers unbuttoned such that her [[pubic hair]] is visible. McCall's intention in painting May was to explore "how women choose to express their sexual identity beyond the [[male gaze]]".&lt;ref name="Independent 8 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|title=‘Pornographic and disgusting’ painting removed from top London exhibition – because it features a woman’s pubic hair|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/pornographic-and-disgusting-painting-removed-from-top-london-exhibition--because-it-features-a-womans-pubic-hair-9592705.html|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The painting received public attention after the [[Mall Galleries]] removed it from the [[Society of Women Artists]]'s annual exhibition in 2014, after which it was replaced with another nude portrait. According to a statement by the Galleries, this was done because of "a number of complaints regarding the depiction of the subject and taking account of its location en route for children to our learning centre", and, according to McCall, because the painting had been deemed "disgusting" and "pornographic". Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Rowan Pelling]] interpreted this reaction as implying that "the minute a woman is alive and free to move, an active agent of her own sexuality, she is a menace to society", whereas Mall Galleries viewers appeared to feel more comfortable with a nude woman who is a "more passive and unthreatening recipient of the wandering viewer's gaze".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 7 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pelling|first1=Rowan|title=How is this painting 'pornographic' and 'disgusting'?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/07/painting-pornographic-pubic-hair-outrage|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the removal of the work, McCall started a [[Twitter]] campaign with the [[hashtag]] #eroticcensorship.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 7 July 2014" /&gt;

'''''Portrait of Phillis Wheatley''''' is an engraving by [[Scipio Moorhead]]. It is in a private collection. The painting was used as the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] for poet [[Phillis Wheatley]]'s poetry collection ''[[Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral]]'', first published in 1773. Wheatley was the United States' first professional [[African-American]] woman poet and the first African-American woman whose writings were published. She is also the third woman in the United States, regardless of ethnicity, to have her written work published. The painting is also the major, recognized work of Moorhead, the first significant African American painter in the country. It is unknown if an original painting exists, however, copies of the engraving reside in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[Library of Congress]].

==Description==
The painting depicts a young African American woman, Phillis Wheatley, sitting at a desk. She has a thoughtful look on her face, with her left hand poised against her chin, as if thinking about what she will write next with the [[quill]] in right hand. Her right hand sits atop a piece of paper. On the desk, is also ink and a small book. She wears a bonnet and a [[apron]] over her dress. 

==History==

Phillis Wheatley failed to have her book published in the United States, therefore, she had her book published in London. To verify that she was indeed, African American, the publisher asked that she provide a portrait for the work.&lt;ref name="Patton1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharon F.

'''Presbyterian Association of Musicians (PAM)''' is a national organization of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] for people who are involved in the areas of Reformed [[Christian worship]], [[Church music]], and liturgical arts.  The national offices for this 1,600 member organization are located in Louisville at the National Office of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].  "Members of the Presbyterian Association of Musicians (PAM) include choir directors, organists, ministers, and other persons interested in the quality and integrity of music in the worship experience."  &lt;ref&gt;Presbyterian Church Office of the General Assembly, ''Book Of Order'', G-14.0741 Organized Associations, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
PAM's origins are rooted in the Montreat Worship and Music Conference which was created to provide professional support for Presbyterian musicians.  The [[Presbyterian Church USA#Governing bodies|Presbyterian General Assembly]] asked the Board of Christian Education to make a recommendation to create opportunities to educate church musicians.  On August 2, 1956 the first conference was held at the [[Montreat Conference Center]].  The purpose was to give "comprehensive and practical help to all people concerned with better church music."&lt;ref&gt;Snydor, James, ''1981 Silver Anniversary Year of Montreat Conference on Worship and Music'', March, 1981 PAM Newsletter.&lt;/ref&gt;

After fourteen years of the Montreat Worship and Music Conference, the Board of Christian Education was unable to continue financial support of the conference.  An ad hoc committee was formed to create an association for the musicians.  On July 26, 1970 the Presbyterian Association of Musicians was formed to support of the Montreat Worship and Music Conference.

==Worship and music conferences==
The week-long '''Montreat Worship and Music Conference''' is held at [[Montreat Conference Center]] and is repeated the following week.  This intergenerational conference offers a wide variety of classes and ensembles that provide musical, liturgical and theological instruction.

The '''Mo-Ranch/Presbyterian Association of Musicians Conference (MoPAM)''' is the union of two worship and music conferences.  The annual week-long [[Mo Ranch]] conference merged with the PAM West conference in 2009 to create an annual worship and music conference at Mo Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moranch.com/index.php?c=12&amp;sn=123&amp;conf=12&amp;csn=92]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116042336/http://www.moranch.com/index.php?c=12&amp;sn=123&amp;conf=12&amp;csn=92 |date=January 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAM has held biennial '''National Gatherings''' for church professionals since 2005 in partnership with Presbyterian Seminaries.  These gatherings, typically held in February, are two-three day conferences focusing on topics that are of importance to church musicians, pastors and educators who are working in the church.  The gatherings are open to all church professionals.

==Presbyterian hymnal==
The 2004 [[Presbyterian Church USA#Governing bodies|Presbyterian General Assembly]] gave authorization to the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation, the Presbyterian Association of Musicians, and the Office of Theology and Worship to begin research into the feasibility of a new Presbyterian hymnal. The results of this feasibility study were to be reported to the 217th General Assembly in 2006 which granted authorization for the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation to research, develop, and produce a new hymnal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presbyterianhymnal.org/aboutTheProject.html|title=The Presbyterian Hymnal Project|publisher=Presbyterianhymnal.org|accessdate=31 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912123813/http://www.presbyterianhymnal.org/aboutTheProject.html|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Private press''' is a term used in the field of [[book collecting]] to describe a [[printing press]] operated as an artistic or craft-based endeavor, rather than as a purely commercial venture. The term is also used in the [[Gramophone record|record]] collecting field to describe records released in small runs by individuals, as opposed to records released by record labels.

== Private press movement ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The term "private press" is often used to refer to a movement in book production which flourished around the turn of the 20th century under the influence of the scholar-artisans [[William Morris]], Sir [[Emery Walker]] and their followers. The movement is often considered to have begun with the founding of Morris' [[Kelmscott Press]] in 1890, following a lecture on printing given by Walker at the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] in November 1888. Those involved in the movement created books by traditional printing and binding methods, with an emphasis on the book as a work of art and manual skill, as well as a medium for the transmission of information. Morris was greatly influenced by medieval printed books and the 'Kelmscott style' had a great, and not always positive, influence on later private presses and commercial book-design. The movement was an offshoot of the Arts and Crafts movement, and represented a rejection of the cheap mechanised book-production methods which developed in the Victorian era. The books were made with high-quality materials (handmade paper, traditional inks and, in some cases, specially designed typefaces), and were often bound by hand. Careful consideration was given to format, page design, type, illustration and binding, in order to produce a unified whole. The movement dwindled during the worldwide depression of the 1930s, as the market for luxury goods evaporated. Since the 1950s, there has been a resurgence of interest, especially among artists, in the experimental use of [[letterpress printing]], paper-making and hand-bookbinding in producing small editions of 'artists' books', and among amateur (and a few professional) enthusiasts for traditional printing methods and for the production 'values' of the private press movement.

In [[New Zealand]] university private presses have been significant in the private press movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vangioni|first1=Peter|title=Pressed Letters: Fine Printing in New Zealand since 1975, 30 August – 24 September 2012|date=2012|publisher=Christchurch Art Gallery|location=Christchurch, NZ |url= http://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/media/uploads/2012_11/Pressed_Letters_booklet.pdf |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private presses are active at three New Zealand universities: Auckland ([[Holloway Press]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Holloway Press|url=http://www.hollowaypress.auckland.ac.nz/|website=The University of Auckland |publisher=The University of Auckland|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Victoria (Wai-te-ata Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wai-te-Ata Press|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/wtapress/|website=Victoria University of Wellington |publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Otago (Otakou Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Otakou Press|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/exhibitions/burns/otakou.html|website=University of Otago Library, Special Collections Exhibitions|publisher=University of Otago|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the [[music industry]], a '''road manager''' is a person who works with small to mid-sized [[Concert#Concert tour|tours]] (in terms of personnel involved, based on size of the production). Job responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

*advancing show dates
*making travel and hotel arrangements (for all group members)
*hiring [[Road crew|backline techs]] or recommending techs to be hired (depending on authority given by [[Talent manager|artist management]])
*coordinating artist media obligations (normally while on tour, but could be anytime)
*ensuring [[Rider (theater)|artist rider]] requirements are met
*collecting payments due to the artist at show time (or signing off on amount due to be sent via wire, depending on arrangements made by artist management)
*making vendor payments (or submission of amounts due to vendors to artist management)
*handling personnel issues
*distributing [[per diem]] (depending on per diem schedule approved by artist management)

Road managers can be confused with [[tour manager]]s. Generally speaking, though, tour managers work with upper-mid to large scale tours and are often granted a much greater degree of authority in tour operations.

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' is a [[fresco]] by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], executed in 1480 and located in the [[church of Ognissanti]], [[Florence]].

The work was commissioned by the [[Amerigo Vespucci|Vespucci]] family together with a ''[[St. Augustine (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]]. Both depicted two Doctors of the Church in their studies, with a number of objects which should mark their role as precursors of [[humanism]]. They decorated the area next to the choir, which was demolished in the 18th century. In that occasion the two frescoes were removed and placed in the nave. Part of the annexed frame and the inscriptions were lost.

==Description==

While Botticelli adopted a more expressive composition in his ''[[Saint Augustine]]'' (inspired by [[Andrea del Castagno]]'s works), Ghirlandaio created a more serene and conventional figure, concentrating instead on the [[still life]] of the objects exposed on the writing desk and the shelves behind [[Saint Jerome|Jerome]]. In this, he was perhaps inspired by northern European models, such as  [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (van Eyck)|Saint Jerome in His Study]]'' which was in the collections of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].

Jerome is portrayed with his head resting on one hand, while writing with the other. This was the same posture chosen by Jan van Eyck. The open books and the cartouches, with [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters, correspond to his activity as translator of the [[Bible]]. On the writing desk is the date (MCCCCLXXX), as well as a sealed letter, glasses, two inkwells (with drops of ink near them), scissors and a candle holder. The desk is covered by an oriental carpet, a luxurious object often depicted by Ghirlandaio, and perhaps also inspired by [[Flemish painting|Netherlandish painters]]. The objects on the shelves include a [[cardinal hat]], two pharmacist vases, a cylindrical case,  a necklace, a purse, some fruit, two transparent glass bottles and an hourglass.

The light comes from the upper right corner, producing a well defined shadow of the saint on the drapery behind him; but also from the foreground, illuminating the objects on the desk.

'''Santa María de Melque''' is a church in the border municipality of San Martín de Montalbán in the province of [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]] (in [[Spain]]), 30&amp;nbsp;km south of the capital, and equidistant from the towns of [[La Puebla de Montalbán]] and Gálvez, between the brook Ripas and the river Torcón, a tributary of the river [[Tagus]].

Of the entire complex, recently restored, the church stands out, exemplary [[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]]-[[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]], as the most important religious monument of the [[Early Middle Ages]] in Spain.

Currently, the church, which occupies the center of the complex, and the center of interpretation which has been installed in the adjoining rooms, also restored, can be visited. The scenery that is observed from '''Santa María''' is also characteristic of the area.

==History==
[[File:Santa María de Melque (Toledo) 01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Inside of the church.]]

'''Santa María de Melque''' came into being as a monastic collection in the 7th and 8th centuries inside of what was the capital of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Construction commenced in the 7th century, coinciding with the end of the Visigothic kingdom, and probably came to a halt with the arrival of the Arabs, to be continued later.

There was originally a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement on that location, with five dams across the two brooks that surround the small, rocky hill. Next the monastery was built with the buildings organized around the church.

The Muslim conquest of the Iberian peninsula did not immediately end with this monastic nucleus, because there are testimonies of the survival of a Mozarabic community that later disappeared. Its constructions were used as urban nucleus and its church was fortified with the construction of a tower on the dome of the church, tower that is still preserved. Water from rain and from the gullys was detained by means of dams placed both sides of the complex.

With the conquest of Toledo by King [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] in 1085, the temple recovered its liturgical function without losing its military function. The anthropomorphic tombs located to the east and the remains of barbicans that remain are testimonies of this historic period.

==Architecture==
[[File:Planta SMdM.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Plan of the church.]]

It was constructed in 8th century and it's the first one-half monument better preserved of the Spanish [[High Middle Ages]]. Its constructive technique is the architecture's direct inheritance late roman.
However, the lack of decorative elements preserved (filigrees of stucco in the transverse arches of the crossing) that still can be seen in the background of the southern arm of the crossing suggests that Melque could be at first a mausoleum, destined to burial of a distinguished personage from Toledo's [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. The church was later redesigned on at least two occasions.

The [[Knights Templar]] turned the church into defensive tower, like a ''turris'' as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used to. This tower over the dome base has been recently dismounted. It had a porch with three openings which no longer exists.

The plant is cruciform, with a central apse: the two lateral apses were added later. It keeps in good condition its different naves, some side chapels and a parlor with very pronounced horseshoe arches. And a niche probably for the founder of the temple.

The presbytery is large correspondingly to a monastic community with Round arches at both sides. Also is preserved a moorish tower over the vault.

It was made with enormous unmortared blocks which look like the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]]. The molduration is calculated in [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman cubits]], similar to the [[San Pedro of Arisgotas]] molduration, also in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].

This church has contributions of clearly Visigothic style with new solutions that the mozarabs contribute, and besides memories of the Roman style:
* '''Visigothic contributions''': the horseshoe arch that supports the apse's vault, surpassing 1/3 of the radium. The set unprovided of remains sculptured, of Visigothic tradition. The [[arcosolium]].
* '''Mozarabic contributions''': central horseshoe arches of surpassing 1/2 of the radium. Arches of the windows in 2/3. Strange semicircular pilasters of the inside that neither may be considered semi-detached.
* '''Innovations''': the circular reduction of the corners in its 4 facades and the vertical crack at both sides, having the appearance of pseudo columns. It looks like the columns placed at the corners of the lantern towers of Romanesque Norman style. It's an unprecedented solution.
* '''Roman style''': The enormous granite blocks, the molduration in [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman cubits]], its plant is comparable to [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] in [[Ravenna]] ([[Italy]]).

The '''''St. Jerome in Penance''''' is a painting by the [[Italian Renaissance]] [[List of Italian painters|painter]] [[Filippo Lippi]], dating to c. 1439. It is housed in the [[Staatliches Lindenau Museum|Lindenau-Museum]] of [[Altenburg]], [[Germany]]. The work could be identified with the ''St. Jerome Penitent'' of which Lippi asked payment in a letter issued to [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] in 1439.

The painting is one of the first known example on the subject of [[St. Jerome]] doing penance. It is a small panel, divided into two different scenes: in the upper part is St. Jerome with the wooden cross, the stone to strike his breast and the [[lectern]] lying on the rock. In the lower part, with a chronological step, is the episode of the saint with the lion having a thorn in the paw. The unfriendly landscape is a metaphor of the hermit style of life.

'''St Lawrence's Church''' is a [[Church of England]] church in the parish of [[West Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]], England. It sits on top of West Wycombe Hill in a prominent position overlooking the West Wycombe Road, and surrounding villages. West Wycombe Hill is managed by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]],&lt;ref name=NationalTrust&gt;{{cite web|title=West Wycombe Village and Hill - National Trust page|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/west-wycombe-village-and-hill/|website=Nationaltrust.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the church and graveyard are owned by the [[Church of England]]. The church resides in the Chilterns [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. St Lawrence Church and the mausoleum both occupy similar positions on top of West Wycombe Hill, and the Church tower is visible for many miles around. The top of the tower is the highest point in the Southern Chilterns and on a clear day it is possible to see West London.  

==History==
The medieval church served the lost medieval village of Haveringdon and of this building the 14th century chancel and tower remain, though heavily remodelled. The [[listed building|Grade I listed church]]&lt;ref name="Grade I building listing"&gt;{{NHLE|desc= Church of St Lawrence|grade= I|num=1125117|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was gradually rebuilt in its current form by [[Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet and Baron Le Despenser]]. In the 1750s the medieval west tower was raised to make it an eye-catcher from West Wycombe Estate, West Wycombe House and also from the West Wycombe road as one exits towards the West. It was topped by a great golden ball, possibly inspired by the [[Dogana da Mar|Dogana]], Venice.  The ball reputed to be a meeting place for the Hellfire Club – it could seat 10, and was described by the author [[John Wilkes]] as “the best globe tavern I was ever in.”  It has been suggested that Sir Francis Dashwood used a [[heliograph]] to signal through a porthole in the golden ball to his friend, [[John Norris (1721–1786)]], who had erected a tower, now known as the [[Camberley Obelisk]], near his home at [[Hawley, Hampshire]], 21 miles to the south.&lt;ref name="dashwood-1987" /&gt; Between 1761 and 1763 the nave was rebuilt and medieval chancel was remodelled.  

The nave as remodelled by Dashwood has the appearance of a “very superb Egyptian hall” in a Vitruvian sense and is derived from [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]]’s prints of the ancient Temple of the Sun, [[Palmyra]].  It has five bays five and is lined with engaged Corinthian columns under a continuous entablature, the pillars decorated to emulate porphrey.  The design of the [[Trompe-l'œil]] ceiling in the nave is taken directly from one of Wood's engravings.  There is more Trompe-l'œil painting on the walls of the remodelled medieval chancel and in the centre of the chancel ceiling is a painting of the Last Supper after Rembrant.  All the painting is by Giovanni Borgnis.  Throughout there is spectacular [[Rococo]] plasterwork and Dashwood provided fine new woodwork for the church, including Mahogany stalls for the clergy. 

The architect of all this work is likely to have been John Donowell who was working for Sir Francis Dashwood at West Wycombe Park.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Bells==
There are eight bells in the tower: the treble and second by Mears &amp; Stainbank, 1923; the third by [[Lester and Pack]], 1756; the fourth by Henry Knight, 1621; the fifth by Joseph Carter, 1581; the sixth by Henry Knight, 1620; the seventh by [[Lester and Pack]], 1762; and the tenor by Thomas Mears, 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=West+Wycombe&amp;Submit=+Go+&amp;DoveID=WEST+WYCOM|title=Dove Details|website=Dove.cccbr.org.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golden ball==
The golden ball can be seen for miles around and is a recognised symbol of [[West Wycombe]] village. It is made from a wooden frame covered in gold leaf, 8 feet in diameter, and contains seating for up to six people.&lt;ref name=Lacey2006&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacey|first=Nigel|title=A Guide to St Lawrence's Church and West Wycombe Village|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dashwood-1987"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Dashwood | first=Francis | title=The Dashwoods of West Wycombe | publisher=Aurum | year=1987 | isbn=9780948149771 | page=220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were rumours that the [[Hellfire Club]], founded by [[Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer|Sir Francis Dashwood]] (1708–1781), met inside the golden ball,&lt;ref name=Lacey2006 /&gt; but there is no evidence for that. It is no longer possible for the public to enter the ball.  

==Churchyard==
The churchyard contains eleven [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth war graves]], six from [[World War I]] and five from [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/36418/WEST%20WYCOMBE%20(ST.%20LAWRENCE)%20CHURCHYARD] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
St Lawrence Church has been used as a backdrop and as part of important scenery elements in various popular TV shows and films such as ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' and major blockbusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/14351351.Could_Brad_Pitt_be_coming_to_Wycombe_next_week_/|title=Could Brad Pitt be coming to Wycombe next week?|website=Bucksfreepress.co.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Lawrence Church can be seen in the film ''[[Bridget Jones's Baby]]'', which came out in the UK in 2016. It forms part of the opening scene in the 23 March trailer release.

It is also featured throughout the music video by [[Paloma Faith]] for her song "[[Picking Up the Pieces (Paloma Faith song)|Picking Up the Pieces]]" which has over 12,000,000 views on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijel4Vcqd9g|title=Paloma Faith - Picking Up the Pieces|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=20 November 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4315">'''Survivance''' is a critical term in [[Native American studies]].

==History==
Survivance was originally a legal term, but fell out of use in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See OED&lt;/ref&gt; The word was subsequently utilized in the 20th century by francophone Canadians as "[[La Survivance]]," and also employed by the French theorist [[Jacques Derrida]] to denote a spectral existence that would be neither life nor death.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Calbi, ''Spectral Shakespeares: Media Adaptations in the Twenty-First Century'' (London: Palgrave, 2013), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
It was first employed in the context of [[Native American Studies]] by the [[Anishinaabe]] cultural theorist [[Gerald Vizenor]], in his book ''[[Manifest Manners]]: Narratives on Postindian Survivance''. There he explains that "Survivance is an active sense of [[Metaphysics of presence|presence]], the continuance of native stories, not a mere reaction, or a survivable name. Native survivance stories are renunciations of dominance, tragedy and victimry".&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Vizenor, ''Manifest Manners: Narratives on Postindian Survivance'' (Lincoln: Nebraska, 1999), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Vizenor makes the term, which is deliberately imprecise, the cornerstone of his analysis of contemporary Native American literature, culture and politics. Several critics (e.g. Alan Velie) have analysed the term as a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of "survival and endurance," and others (e.g. Jace Weaver) have read it as a portmanteau of "survival + resistance," but there does not seem to be any evidence that Vizenor had such a specific combination in mind.  Rather, by changing the suffix from -''al'' to -''ance'', he insists on an active survival, in which contemporary Native American peoples go beyond merely subsisting in the ruins of tribal cultures to actively inheriting and refashioning those cultures for the postmodern age.  The [[Cherokee]]-descent poet [[Diane Glancy]] demonstrates the ways that an imprecise term can inspire creativity by reconfiguring it: "Poetry is rebound. A turn of writing. (Sur)vivance: Sur - a survival outside survival. Vivance - the vitality of it."&lt;ref&gt;Diane Glancy, "The Naked Spot: A Journey toward Survivance", in ''Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence'', ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vizenor frequently defines "survivance" in opposition to "victimry," as some commentators note.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Alan Velie, "N. Scott Momaday's ''[[House Made of Dawn]] and Myths of the Victim'', in ''The Native American Renaissance: Literary Imagination and Achievement'', ed. A Robert Lee and Alan Velie (Norman: Oklahoma UP, 2014), p. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Kroeber]] writes that Vizenor's "work aims to repair a peculiarly vicious consequence of genocidal attacks on native of the Americas: an inducing in them of their destroyers' view that they are mere survivors. By accepting this white definition of themselves as victims, natives complete psychologically the not-quite-entirely-successful physical genocide."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kroeber, "Why It's a Good Thing Gerald Vizenor is not an Indian," in ''Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence'', ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Joe Lockard calls it "the condition of self-reliant or communal survival without the social or personal indulgence of victimization."&lt;ref&gt;Joe Lockard, "Facing the Windiigoo," in ''Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence'', ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

The word has become a [[term of art]] in contemporary Native American studies, used far beyond the context of Vizenor's own work.  It is now also an interactive video game,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://survivance.org/|title = Survivance|website = Survivance|access-date = 2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in captions for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]],&lt;ref&gt;Sonya Atalay, "No Sense of the Struggle: Creating a Context for Survivance at the NMAI," ''The American Indian Quarterly'' 30.3&amp;4 (2006) 597-618.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being employed numerous times in titles of books and academic articles.

==History==

Six female art students and their teacher founded The Art League of Northern Virginia in 1954. The League's stated purpose was to foster art and arts appreciation, sponsor lectures, encourage study and hold exhibitions. In 1967, the organization was incorporated as a nonprofit, and in the years immediately following, the League removed rules limiting members to residents of Northern Virginia and shortened its name to The Art League, Inc.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;A History of The Art League, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The League's mission states, "By nurturing the artist, we enrich the community. The Art League develops the artist through education, exhibition, and a stimulating, supportive environment while sharing the experience of the visual arts with the community." &lt;ref name="The Art League"&gt;[http://www.theartleague.org/content/about The Art League]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art League played a critical role in the transformation of the City-owned, former U.S. Naval Torpedo Station into the Torpedo Factory Art Center.&lt;ref name="torpedo"&gt;Torpedo Factory Art Center. [http://www.torpedofactory.org/history.htm] Retrieved 8 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Art League president and Virginia Delegate [[Marian Van Landingham]] proposed a project that would renovate the building into working studio spaces for artists.&lt;ref&gt;National Women's History Project [http://nwhp.org/whm/landingham_bio.php] Retrieved 23 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; With the lease on its Cameron Street space expiring, The Art League was looking for a new location.&lt;ref&gt;Hagee, Chuck.

Retrieved 2012-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; After the renovation of the new art center, the League rented one-fifth of the space for its gallery and school.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

{{See also|Torpedo Factory Art Center}}

Today, the gallery, offices, supply store, and some classrooms of The Art League are housed in the Torpedo Factory Art Center.

Continued growth led to the hiring of the first paid executive director, Cora Rupp, in 1981, along with other employees. In 2012, longtime executive director Linda Hafer retired, and Suzanne Bethel became the new executive director.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==School==

The Art League School offers classes and workshops for students of all skill levels and ages, in nearly all of the fine visual arts. Classes and workshops are offered year-round in drawing, watercolor, painting, printmaking, photography, ceramics, sculpture, jewelry, fiber art, and clay animation, in addition to art travel workshops to domestic and international locations. Nearly 7,000 students enroll each year, filling over 10,000 seats in classes. All classes and workshops are taught by professional artist instructors, many from DC-area colleges and universities. Classes are noncredit and are open to all. After the school's founding in 1967, classes were credited with improving the quality of art in The Art League's Gallery, with ''Washingtonian Magazine'' writing, "the single most important thing The Art League has done to improve its image is to recruit a workshop faculty that includes some of the brightest luminaries on the art horizon."

Classes are held in the Torpedo Factory Art Center as well as the Madison Annex building. The Art League closed its Duke Street Annex in September 2012 and moved into an expanded classroom space on Madison Street.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==Gallery==
[[File:Art league gallery 2011.jpg|thumb|The Art League Gallery in December 2011.]]
The Art League Gallery, located on the first floor of the Torpedo Factory Art Center, provides exhibit opportunities to more than 1,000 artists of all media and skill levels. Membership is open to any emerging or professional artist. Exhibits in the gallery rotate on a monthly basis. Each exhibit is juried by an outside professional not associated with The Art League.&lt;ref name="torpedo 2"&gt;Torpedo Factory Art Center. [http://www.torpedofactory.org/galleries/artleague.htm] Retrieved 8 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery holds approximately 14 member exhibits each year, including both all-media, un-themed exhibits and themed, focused exhibits. The Gallery also presents approximately nine solo artist exhibits each year. The Bin Gallery includes works by artists who have been juried into three or more member exhibits during the previous fiscal year. Special exhibits, events, and collaborations are also periodically featured. The Gallery maintains a library of art and art history books and offers lectures, critiques, juror talks, demonstrations, workshops, and tours. [[File:Art league patrons show 2012.jpg|thumb|Patrons check out from the 2012 Patrons' Show.]]

Every winter, Art League members donate original works of art to be raffled off in the annual Patrons' Show Fundraiser, which sells about 600 tickets each year. The art is hung [[Salon (Paris)|salon]]-style in the gallery, with ticket-holders selecting a piece when their number is called.&lt;ref&gt;"The Art League's 42nd Annual Patrons' Show."

==Outreach==

In 2003, in partnership with the Alexandria Court Service Unit, The Art League established a mentoring program for at-risk girls in Alexandria, called A Space Of Her Own (SOHO).&lt;ref&gt;Vargas, Theresa. "Space of Her Own, an Alexandria Mentoring Program, Gives Girls Room Makeovers." ''The Washington Post''. 31 May 2009. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/30/AR2009053002027.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The SOHO program engages at-risk, low-income, 5th-grade girls in a year of personal growth centered on art. Each participating girl is paired with an adult, female mentor to partake in art lessons taught by an Art League instructor.  These sessions become the catalyst to discuss larger life concerns, decision-making, and emotional issues. At the completion of the program, the teams remodel each of the girls' bedrooms, incorporating all of their artwork, to give each girl a "space of her own.".&lt;ref name="pcah"&gt;City of Alexandria Press Release.

'''''The Dam''''' (in French:''Le barrage'') is a painting by Luxembourg artist [[Dominique Lang]] from 1913.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063622/LUX_280_006.html |title=Le barrage, Dominique Lang |website=europeana.eu |language=fr |access-date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description ==
The 80.5 x 67&amp;nbsp;cm. picture is part of the collection of the [[National Museum of History and Art]] in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

==Analysis==
Dominique Lang was the only representative of Luxembourg in the first exhibition of the [[Impressionists]] in Paris.

After completing his education at the [[Royal_Academy_of_Fine_Arts_(Antwerp)|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Antwerp in 1900, he began to paint in a [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist style]]. After 1912 - 1913, he began using more refined technique and painted many landscapes in rural areas, where he lived. ''The Dam'' was  shown at the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]], 1914, where he received good feedback on the work and creativity. He managed to recreate the refraction of sunlight into the colors of the rainbow. His sense of nature and authenticity continued the tradition of [[Claude Monet]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. His landscapes evoke the world without industrialization.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

'''''The Feast of Venus''''' is a painting by Flemish painter  [[Rubens]], now in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna. It is a fanciful depiction of the Roman festival [[Veneralia]] celebrated in honor of [[Venus Verticordia]].

==Influences==
[[File:Worship of Venus (Peter Paul Rubens) - Nationalmuseum - 17602.tif|thumb|left|Rubens. The Worship of Venus (after Titian). c. 1630s. Nationalmuseum, Stockholm.]]
===Titian and Philostratus===
Rubens thought highly of [[Titian]] and made a copy of the Venetian master's ''[[The Worship of Venus]]'' which remained in Rubens' private collection until his death.{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=159}} Titian's work, in turn, was based on the ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'' of the [[sophist]] [[Philostratus of Lemnos]]. The ''Imagines'' consisted of a series of descriptions of ancient paintings presumably decorating a third-century villa near Naples.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=94}} In the description entitled ''[[Cupid|Cupids]]'' (''[[Erotes]]''), Philostratus portrays a "swarm" of cupids in a fragrant garden gathering [[Apple#Greek mythology|apples]], kissing the apples and throwing them back and forth, engaging in archery using themselves as targets since the arrows are arrows of love, wrestling, and chasing a [[Rabbits and hares in art#Antiquity|hare]] (a symbol of fertility). While the cupids are cavorting, nymphs are attending to a statue of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] that is garnished with a silver mirror, gilded sandals, and golden brooches.{{sfn|Philostratus the Elder|Philostratus the Younger|Callistratus|1931|pp=21-29}} Both Titian and Rubens in his copy depict most of this activity in great detail.

===Ovid===
The fourth book (April){{sfn|Ovid|}} of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' also served as inspiration for Rubens' ''The Feast of Venus''.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=160}} A portion of the poem describes a women's festival held on April 1 to honor both Venus Verticordia and [[Fortuna Virilis]]. Per Ovid, the festival includes the washing and decoration of a statue of Venus, ritual bathing under boughs of [[Myrtus#In myth and ritual|myrtle]], and offerings of incense to Fortuna Virilis so that the goddess may hide physical blemishes from the eyes of men.{{sfn|Ovid|}} The work, not always corroborated by other sources, portrays a somewhat conflicted account of the festival that blurs distinctions between class and the rite's purpose.{{sfn|Pasco-Pranger|2006|p=147}} Primarily, the cult was intended to turn a woman's heart from lust (''[[Lust|libidine]]'') to chastity (''[[pudicitia]]''){{sfn|Pasco-Pranger|2006|p=145}} so that she may retain her "beauty, virtue and good repute."{{sfn|Ovid|}} However, in addition to brides and mothers, Ovid includes "you who must not wear the [[Fillet (clothing)|headbands]] and [[Stola|long robes]]".{{sfn|Ovid|}} This is a euphemistic reference to prostitutes (''[[Meretrix|meretrices]]'') who were not allowed to wear the hairstyle and clothes of a respectable matron. Instead, they wore a short tunic and [[toga]]. Prostitutes were not being asked to embrace chastity, so their participation must have served other purposes.{{sfn|Pasco-Pranger|2006|p=149}}

==Composition==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Venus Feast (detail) - WGA20317.jpg|thumb|Detail of dancing nymphs and satyrs. The nymph on the far left was modeled by Rubens' wife Helena.]]
Rubens combined key elements of ''Imagines'' and ''Fasti'' along with details of his own invention to create a spirited allegory of conjugal bliss where "voluptuous sensuality is joined and enhanced by the propriety of marriage."{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=162}}

A statue of Venus Verticordia in a ''[[Capitoline Venus|pudica]]'' pose is the focal point of the work. She is surrounded by attendants who, in turn, are encircled by dancing and cavorting cupids, [[satyr|satyrs]], [[nymph|nymphs]], and [[maenad|maenads]]. Rubens includes all three of Ovid's classes of women in his work. The well-clothed matrons are shown performing rites. One washes the statue while the other, in an attitude of prayer, offers incense from a flaming tripod to Fortuna Virilis. The sea of dancing cupids has momentarily parted to allow two eager brides bearing dolls as offerings to rush to the goddess. The prostitutes are also present. Naked except for fluttering draperies, they stand at the foot of Venus. One clutches a comb while holding up a mirror so that the goddess can view herself.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Fehl|1972|pp=160-161}} The temple of Venus is shown in the background behind a grotto in which a stream of water cascades into an overflowing basin. Rubens does not depict any of the celebrants ritually bathing as described by Ovid, but the basin in the grotto alludes to that practice.{{sfn|Fehl|1972|pp=160-161}}

Rubens, like Titian, filled his canvas with a swarm of frisky cupids. Rubens applied his own distinct details to the [[Putto|amoretti]], however. Some of them are depicted as females without wings. Art historian [[Philipp Fehl]] has postulated the amorous couple in the right foreground accompanied by two pairs of doves represents [[Cupid and Psyche]], highlighting how marriage enriches love.{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=162}} Another winged cupid lowers a wreath of roses over the head of Venus in accordance with Ovid: "Now she’s given fresh flowers, and new-sprung roses."{{sfn|Ovid|}}{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=161}} The remainder of the cupids who are not dancing are collecting the apples of Venus as described by Philostratus as well as sheaves of wheat and clusters of grapes. The wheat and grapes are attributes of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Bacchus]] respectively and the gods they represent are shown as seated statues over the grotto. This detail adds to the lustful nature of Rubens' portrayal since a well-known adage immortalized in a play by [[Terence]] states: ''[[sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus]]'' (without food and wine, love grows cold).{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=161}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=95}}

The frolicking nymphs and satyrs in front of the grotto are a [[Bacchanalia|bacchanalian]] representation of pure erotic desire. Rubens used his young wife [[Helena Fourment]] as the model for the nymph on the far left. She is being held aloft by a leering satyr as she lewdly clutches his horns and stares out of the canvas with a knowing look.{{sfn|Chapman|2017|pp=461-462}}

'''''The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon''''' is a painting by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], started in 1881. The massive painting measures 279&amp;nbsp;cm × 650&amp;nbsp;cm, and is widely considered to be Burne-Jones's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartwolf.com/news/burne-jones-avalon.htm | title=Burne Jones's last painting to be exhibited in the UK for the first time in over 40 years| publisher=[[Tate Gallery]] | accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WW42&gt;Waters, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was originally commissioned from Burne-Jones by his patron [[George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle]], to hang on a wall in the library of [[Naworth Castle]]. Howard shared Burne-Jones's affection for the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] and left the choice of topic to the artist.&lt;ref name=M118&gt;Mancoff, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Burne-Jones started working on it in 1881 and continued for 17 years. Within this period, he also designed the stage set for the play ''King Arthur'' by [[J. Comyns Carr]] that premiered in London in January 1895.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;Wildman, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1880s brought the deaths of Burne-Jones's close friends. As they died, the artist experienced mounting isolation and painful awareness of his own mortality.&lt;ref name=M113&gt;Mancoff, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Immersed in his work, Burne-Jones identified himself with Arthur and even adopted Arthur's pose when he himself slept.&lt;ref name=WW42/&gt; By 1885, the association with Arthur reached the point where Burne-Jones had to ask Howard to cancel or revise his original commission, replacing the grand scene with a smaller painting focused on the departed king. Howard agreed to cancellation and never requested his downpayment back. Nevertheless, Burne-Jones returned to the original grand painting, and worked on it for the remaining thirteen years of his life.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; ''Arthur'' became increasingly autobiographical for the artist as he withdrew into himself; "above all the picture is about silence."&lt;ref name=WW42/&gt;

{{quote|How is it you are in ''Avalon'', where I have striven to be with all my might — and how did you get there and how does Arthur the King? ...|Edward Burne-Jones, a letter to a friend in ''[[Avallon]]'', France, 1886&lt;ref name=M117&gt;Mancoff, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Burne-Jones Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon v2.jpg|left|thumb|500px|''The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon'', complete painting.]]

A popular opinion holds that Burne-Jones modelled Arthur's appearance after [[William Morris]], the last survivor of a once-strong progressive art circle, and that Morris's physical decline was a major inspiration for the painting. However, Debra Mancoff argues that there is no record of Morris posing as Arthur and that the king's image was completed when Morris was in vigorous health.&lt;ref name=M119&gt;Mancoff, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris died in 1896; Burne-Jones lived for two more years and died before the painting was complete. Just one day before his death Burne-Jones continued work on ''Arthur''.&lt;ref name=WW42/&gt; Towards the end of his life he wrote, "I need nothing but my hands and my brain to fashion myself a world to live in that nothing can disturb. In my own land I am king of it." His widow described ''Arthur'' as a "task of love to which [the artist] put no limit of time or labor."&lt;ref name=M118/&gt;

Following the artist's death, the painting in its frame with Latin inscription passed to a neighbour of Burne-Jones's, whose descendants, John and Penryn Monck, sold the work at auction at [[Christie's]] on 26 April 1963 where it was bought by [[Luis A. Ferré]], a politician and founder of the [[Ponce Museum of Art]] who would later become [[Governor of Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; Burne-Jones was out of fashion at this time so its export was allowed despite some objections.

''The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon'' is owned by the Ponce Museum of Art in [[Puerto Rico]].  However, it was shown for a short time at the [[Tate Britain]] in London while the Ponce museum underwent restoration in 2009&amp;ndash;10.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;

The painting was on view at the [http://www.museodelprado.es/ Prado Museum] in Madrid: ''The Sleeping Beauty. Victorian Painting from The Museo de Arte de Ponce'' (2 February 2009 - 31 May 2009).

The '''Tooth Fairy''' is a [[fantasy]] figure of early childhood in [[Western world|Western]] and Western-influenced cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, John R.; McKee, Judy S.; Jernigan, Louise F., ''Psychological Reports'', Vol. 46 (3, Pt. 1), June 1980. "Children's belief in Santa Claus, Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy". pp. 691–694.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[folklore]] states that when children lose one of their [[Deciduous teeth|baby teeth]], they should place it underneath their pillow and the Tooth Fairy will visit while they sleep, replacing the lost tooth with a small payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Linda S.|title=Encyclopedia of American folklore|year=2007|publisher=Facts on file Inc|location=NY, NY, United States of America|isbn=0-8160-5699-4|pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of leaving a tooth under a pillow for the Tooth Fairy to collect is practiced in various countries.

==Origins==
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
In [[Northern Europe]], there was a tradition of ''tand-fé'' or tooth fee, which was paid when a child lost their first tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Cleasby |authorlink1=Richard Cleasby |first2=Gudbrand |last2=Vigfússon |authorlink2=Guðbrandur Vigfússon |title= An Icelandic-English Dictionary |edition= 2 |work=[[William Craigie|William A. Craigie]] |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press ]]|year= 1957}} [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kurisuto/germanic/oi_cleasbyvigfusson_about.html s.v. ''tannfé'' first edition available on ''An Icelandic-English Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is recorded in writings as early as the [[Edda]]s, which are the earliest written record of [[Norsemen|Norse]] and Northern European traditions.

The reward left varies by country, the family's economic status, amounts the child's peers report receiving and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patcas, Hubertus JM van Waes, Moritz M Daum and Markus A Landolt. ''Medical Journal of Australia'', Vol. 207, 2017. "Tooth Fairy guilty of favouritism!". pp 482-486.{{cite web|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2017/207/11/tooth-fairy-guilty-favouritism|title=tooth-fairy-guilty-favouritism=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Helen, Joy Cullen. ''Australian Journal of Early Childhood'', Vol. 28, 2003. "The Tooth Fairy Comes, or Is It Just Your Mum and Dad?: A Child's Construction of Knowledge". pp 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2013 survey by [[Visa Inc.]] found that American children receive $3.70 per tooth on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57600762/tooth-fairy-inflation-flies-high|title=Tooth Fairy inflation flies high|date=30 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tooth fairy leaving less money|publisher=UPI Quirks in the News|date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], other [[superstition]]s arose surrounding children's teeth. In [[England]], for example, children were instructed to burn their baby teeth in order to save the child from hardship in the afterlife. Children who didn't consign their baby teeth to the fire would spend eternity searching for them in the afterlife. The [[Vikings]], it is said, paid children for their teeth. In the Norse culture, children's teeth and other articles belonging to children were said to bring good luck in battle, and Scandinavian warriors hung children's teeth on a string around their necks. Fear of witches was another reason to bury or burn teeth. In medieval Europe, it was thought that if a witch were to get hold of one's teeth, it could lead to them having total power over him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recess.ufl.edu/transcripts/2005/0823.shtml|title=Legends of the Tooth Fairy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern incarnation of these traditions into an actual Tooth Fairy has been dated to 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | Tooth fairy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tooth%20fairy "Tooth fairy,"] [[Merriam-Webster]].com, 2015 (viewed 15 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; or 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Heidi|title=8 Popular Tooth Myths Debunked|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/8-popular-tooth-myths-debunked-8#slide-8|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=[[Popular Mechanics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is an earlier reference to the tooth fairy in a 1908 "Household Hints" item in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'':
{{quotation|"Tooth Fairy.
Many a refractory child will allow a loose tooth to be removed if he knows about the Tooth Fairy.  If he takes his little tooth and puts it under the pillow when he goes to bed the Tooth Fairy will come in the night and take it away, and in its place will leave some little gift.  It is a nice plan for mothers to visit the 5 cent counter and lay in a supply of articles to be used on such occasions.

==Appearance==
Unlike [[Santa Claus]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Easter Bunny]], there are few details of the Tooth Fairy's appearance that are consistent in various versions of the myth. A 1984 study conducted by [[Rosemary Wells]] revealed that most, 74 percent of those surveyed, believed the Tooth Fairy to be female, while 12 percent believed the Tooth Fairy to be neither male nor female and 8 percent believed the Tooth Fairy could be either male or female.&lt;ref name="Toledo Blade"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FkdSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vQIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3809,192140&amp;dq=tooth-fairy&amp;hl=en|title=Tooth Fairy Lore Extracted|date=2 February 1984|work=[[Toledo Blade]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about her findings regarding the Tooth Fairy's appearance, Wells explained - "You've got your basic Tinkerbell-type Tooth Fairy with the wings, wand, a little older and whatnot. Then you have some people who think of the tooth fairy as a man, or a bunny rabbit or a mouse."&lt;ref name="The Milwaukee Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4zcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6626,6866738&amp;dq=tooth-fairy&amp;hl=en|title=The tooth fairy: friend or foe?|date=31 July 1991|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One review of published children's books and popular artwork found the Tooth Fairy to also be depicted as a child with wings, a [[pixie]], a [[dragon]], a blue mother-figure, a flying [[ballerina]], two little old men, a dental hygienist, a potbellied flying man smoking a cigar, a bat, a bear and others. Unlike the well-established imagining of Santa Claus, differences in renderings of the Tooth Fairy are not as upsetting to children.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;
 
===Depiction on coins and currency===
Starting in 2011, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] began selling special sets for newborn babies, birthdays, wedding anniversaries, "Oh Canada" and the Tooth Fairy. The Tooth Fairy quarters, which were issued only in 2011 and 2012, were packaged separately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=2012%20CANADA%20Tooth%20Fairy%20Gift%20Sett%20Special%20quarter%20reverse%20Mint%20sealed%20&amp;_itemId=200712964004 2012 CANADA Tooth Fairy Gift Sett Special quarter reverse Mint sealed | eBay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief==
{{See also|Paternalistic deception}}
Belief in the Tooth Fairy is viewed in two very different ways. On the one hand, children believing is seen as part of the trusting nature of childhood. Conversely, belief in the Tooth Fairy is frequently used to label adults as being too trusting and ready to believe anything.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;[[Rosemary Wells|Wells, Rosemary]]. "The Making of an Icon: The Tooth Fairy in North American Folklore and Popular Culture" in ''The Good People: New Fairylore Essays''. Peter Narváez ed., 1997. pp 426-446. [[University Press of Kentucky]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While parents are often unsure of themselves when promoting the fiction of the Tooth Fairy, the majority of children report positive outcomes. Upon learning the Tooth Fairy is not real, 75% of children reported liking the custom; 20% were neutral and 3% were not in favor and said they did not intend to continue the practice.

Parents tend to view the myth as providing comfort for children in the loss of their tooth.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt; Research finds that belief in the Tooth Fairy may provide such comfort to a child experiencing fear or pain resulting from the loss of a tooth.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Cindy Dell. "Flight Toward Maturity: The Tooth Fairy" in ''Flights of Fancy, Leaps of Faith: Children's Myths in Contemporary America''. [[University of Chicago Press]], 1995. pp 355-364.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers especially seem to value a child's belief as a sign that their "baby" is still a child and is not "growing up too soon".&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt; By encouraging belief in a fictional character, parents allow themselves to be comforted that their child still believes in fantasy and is not yet "grown up".&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;

Children often discover the Tooth Fairy is imaginary as part of the 5- to 7-year shift, often connecting this to other gift-bearing imaginary figures (such as [[Santa Claus]] and the [[Easter Bunny]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sameroff, Arnold and Susan C. Mcdonough. ''Phi Delta Kappan'', Vol. 76, 1994, "Educational implications of developmental transitions: revisiting the 5- to 7-year shift".&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Vicki Lansky]] advises parents to tell their children early that the tooth fairy pays a whole lot more for a perfect tooth than for a decayed one. According to Lansky, some families leave a note with the payment, praising the child for good dental habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansky|first=Vicki|title=Practical parenting tips|publisher=Unicorn books|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7806-005-1|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research findings suggest a possible relationship between a child's continued belief in the Tooth Fairy (and other fictional characters) and [[false memory syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Principe1, Gabrielle F. and Eric Smith. ''Applied Cognitive Psychology'', Volume 22, Issue 5, pages 625–642, July 2008. "The tooth, the whole tooth and nothing but the tooth: how belief in the Tooth Fairy can engender false memories".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
The [[Ratoncito Pérez]] (or Ratón Pérez, "Pérez Mouse" in English) is a figure popular in Spanish and Hispanic American cultures, similar to the Tooth Fairy, originating in Madrid in 1894. As is traditional in some English-speaking countries, when a child loses a tooth it is customary for him or her to place it under the pillow, so that Ratoncito Pérez will exchange it for a gift. The tradition is almost universal in Spanish cultures, but takes different forms in different areas. He is known as "Ratoncito Pérez" in Spanish speaking countries, with the exception of some regions of Mexico, Peru and Chile, where he is called "el Ratón de los Dientes" (The Tooth Mouse), and in Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay and Colombia, he is known simply as "El Ratón Pérez". The [[Ratoncito Pérez]] was used by [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] marketing in Venezuela&lt;ref name="Producto"&gt;[http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html ¡Producto Registrado!: Agosto 1998: Centuria Dental] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020074258/http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html |date=20 October 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} 

In [[Italy]], the Tooth Fairy is also often replaced by a small mouse, named ''Topolino''.

In [[France]] and French-speaking [[Belgium]], this character is called ''la petite souris'' ("[[The Little Mouse|the little mouse]]"). From parts of [[Lowland Scotland]] comes a tradition similar to the fairy mouse: a white fairy rat who purchases children's teeth with coins.

In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], and specially in [[Biscay]], there is ''Mari Teilatukoa'' (Mary from the roof), who lives in the roof of the [[baserri]] and catches the teeth thrown by the children.

In some [[Asia|Asian countries]], such as [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], when a child loses a tooth, it is customary for him or her to throw it onto the roof if it came from the lower jaw, or into the space beneath the floor if it came from the upper jaw. While doing this, the child shouts a request for the tooth to be replaced with the tooth of a mouse. This tradition is based on the fact that the teeth of mice grow for their entire lives, a characteristic of all rodents. In some cultures in India, children bury their teeth in the soil near big trees.

In [[Japan]], a different variation calls for lost upper teeth to be thrown straight down to the ground and lower teeth straight up into the air; the idea is that incoming teeth will grow in straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beeler|first=Selby B.|title=Throw Your Tooth on the Roof: Tooth Traditions from Around the World|year=1998|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]]|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-6181-5238-4|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Middle Eastern countries (including [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]), there is a tradition of throwing a baby tooth up into the sky to the sun or to [[Allah]]. This tradition may originate in a pre-Islamic offering, and dates back to at least the 13th century. It is also mentioned by [[Izz bin Hibat Allah Al Hadid]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Hamdani&gt;Al Hamdani, Muwaffak and Wenzel, Marian.

'''Union Street''' is a major street in the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. It runs between [[Blackfriars Road]] to the west and [[Borough High Street]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-se1.co.uk/street/union-street Union Street], London SE1 community website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londontown.com/LondonStreets/union_street_9be.html London guide to Union Street, SE1], LondonTown.com.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southwark Bridge Road]] crosses in the middle.

== History ==
The eastern part of the street was laid out under a 1774 Act passed for making a new workhouse and for "making a carriage way from the … High Street, through the Greyhound Inn, into Queen Street, and for improving the passage from thence into Gravel Lane, leading towards the Black Friars Bridge Road, in the parish of Christ Church."&lt;ref&gt;Sir Howard Roberts and Walter H. Godfrey (editors), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65324 Union Street], ''Survey of London: volume 22: Bankside (the parishes of St. Saviour and Christchurch Southwark)'', Chapter 12, pages 84–86, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782 the Union Hall was opened as the Surrey Magistrates Court in the borough, the JPs having previously sat at the Town Hall in the High Street. The façade of the Hall was retained on the new structure on the site in 2005.

In 1813, Queen Street and Duke Street were renamed Union Street. In 1908 Charlotte Street, at the western end of Union Street, was also renamed to be part of the street yet it clearly has a dislocated junction with it, exacerbated by it starting under the railway viaduct.

A fire at an oil and paint shop in Union Street in April 1885 resulted in the death of [[Alice Ayres]], whose bravery in saving her three nieces captured the public imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Ayres - A Secular Saint|url=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/03/alice_ayres_a_secular_saint.html|publisher=St Margarets Community Website|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Cross Burial Ground was a burial ground at the northeast corner of Union Street and Red Cross Way.

The street was called Union Street because it marks the boundary between the two local parishes in the area.

==Amenities==
The [[Union Theatre (London)|Union Theatre]] is a leading fringe venue on the north side of the street. On the south side is [[Jerwood Space]], an arts venue, located in the former Orange Street School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerwoodspace.co.uk/ Jerwood Space].&lt;/ref&gt; Other art galleries include the [[RKB Gallery]], dedicated to artworks on paper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rkburt.com/gallery/ RKB Gallery], R. K. Burt UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-se1.co.uk/places/rkb-gallery RKB Gallery], London SE1 community website.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Union Gallery]], a contemporary art gallery under the railway arches on the north side, that moved to Teesdale Road in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-se1.co.uk/places/union-gallery Union Gallery], London SE1 community website&lt;/ref&gt;

Public houses on the street include the Charles Dickens and the Lord Nelson, named after two famous Englishmen. Dickens lodged in [[Lant Street]] not far away as a child.

==Transport==
[[Southwark tube station|Southwark Underground station]] is at the western end. [[Southwark Street]] runs in parallel to the north. The road forms part of the B300, linking with [[The Cut (London)|The Cut]] to the west. To the east is Newcomen Street.

'''''Urban Light''''' (2008) is a large-scale [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] [[sculpture]] by [[Chris Burden]] located at the Wilshire Boulevard entrance to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]. The 2008 installation consists of restored street lamps from the 1920s and 1930s. Most of them once lit the streets of Southern California.&lt;ref name=LATimesYourScene&gt;{{cite news|title=Your Scene: Chris Burden's 'Urban Light' sculpture at LACMA|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/25/entertainment/la-et-urban-light-as-icon-20110125|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freudenheim|first=Susan|title=A glow in the dark: Chris Burden's collection of restored lamps will put LACMA in 'Urban Light.'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/30/entertainment/et-burden30|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Urban Light'' is composed of 202 street lamps arranged in a near grid. The lamps mostly came from the streets of Southern California, including Hollywood, Glendale, and Anaheim, with some from Portland, Oregon. There are 16 different streetlight models represented, many of which were commissioned for particular neighborhoods and streets.&lt;ref&gt;Mandelkern, India (February 20, 2018) [https://unframed.lacma.org/2018/02/20/great-streetlight-scavenger-hunt "The Great Streetlight Scavenger Hunt"] Unframed. Retrieved 5-24-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadway Rose, the largest and most ornate of the models, is represented by six lamps. The style was found in [[downtown Los Angeles]]; a few can still be seen on Sixth Avenue between Olive and Flower Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mandelkern|first1=India|title=Urban Light: A Field Guide|date=February 9, 2018|publisher=LACMA|location=Los Angeles|pages=24|edition=1|url=https://www.thelacmastore.org/products/chris-burdens-urban-light-a-field-guide|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture's glass globes are of three general shapes: round, acorn, and cone. The 309 LED bulbs are solar powered and switch on from dusk until dawn, governed by an [[astronomical timer]].&lt;ref name="LACMA-CBurden"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.lacma.org/node/214966|title=LACMA collections: Chris Burden|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Los Angeles County Art Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-lacma-urban-light-20180214-htmlstory.html|title='Urban Light': Everything you didn't know about L.A.'s beloved landmark|last=Vankin|first=Deborah|date=February 14, 2018|website=latimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Susan Freudenheim described the restored lamps as displaying "elaborate floral and geometric patterns" at the base, with "fluted shafts and glass globes that cap them...meticulously cleaned, painted and refurbished to create an exuberant glow."&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Urban_Light_By_Day.jpg|thumb|left|left|''Urban Light'' by daylight as seen from Wilshire Blvd.]]
Burden viewed his sculpture as a formal entry way to the museum on [[Wilshire Boulevard]]: "I've been driving by these buildings for 40 years, and it's always bugged me how this institution turned its back on the city."&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;

Burden first began collecting street lamps in December 2000 without a specific work in mind, and continued collecting them for the next seven years. He purchased his first two lamps at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] Flea Market at $800 each after they were pointed out by curator [[Paul Schimmel (curator)|Paul Schimmel]]'s son Max. The vendor, Jeff Levine, had been restoring the lamps by salvaging parts and later sold Burden more of his collection. Burden purchased others from contractor and collector Anna Justice, who was instrumental in the restoration of sandblasting, recasting missing parts, rewiring to code, and then painting a uniform grey. As Burden's collection grew, the ground around his [[Topanga Canyon]] studio became littered with parts, which the artist referred to as "lamp carcasses".&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;&lt;ref name=LACMA-CBurden /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unframed.lacma.org/2018/02/06/story-urban-light|title=The Story of Urban Light (including a December 2008 conversation between Michael Govan and Chris Burden)|last=|first=|date=|website=unframed.lacma.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 2003, Burden discussed installing a hundred of the lamps at the [[Gagosian Gallery]] in New York, but the gallery eventually balked at the cost. While he later sent 14 lamps to an exhibition in London, his goal was to keep as much of his then 150-piece collection together as possible. To that end, he invited visitors to view the street lamps outside his studio, where he had installed them in dense rows on two sides of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chris Burden: Extreme Measures|last=Philips|first=Lisa|last2=Johanna Burton|publisher=New Museum, New York and Skira Rizzoli Publications|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=208–209|quote=|display-authors=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prospective purchasers in mid-2006 was The [[Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien|MAK Museum for Applied Art]] in Vienna and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, represented by its new director, [[Michael Govan]]. He visited the studio at twilight, and from the driveway, saw the lights lit and concluded that the installation would be a perfect fit. Govan was followed by Andrew M. Gordon, a [[Goldman Sachs]] executive who would later become chairman of the museum's board. Gordon approved the purchase through his family foundation for an undisclosed price.&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;

''Urban Light'' was preceded by [[Sheila Klein]]'s ''[[Vermonica]]'' (1993)'','' which placed 25 Los Angeles street lamps in a parking lot at the corner of Vermont Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-haddad/meet-las-original-urban-l_b_7528372.html|title=Meet L.A.'s Original 'Urban Light'|date=June 8, 2015|publisher=The Huffington Post|issue=|agency=|ref=|last1=Haddad|first1=Paul|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The ''Urban Light'' installation took place amid changes to the LACMA campus, which included a new building, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, and two new open spaces. The sculpture dominates one of them, a [[forecourt]] located between Wilshire Boulevard and LACMA's entry pavilion.&lt;ref name="HawthorneReview" /&gt;

''Los Angeles Times'' critic Christopher Hawthorne gave the arrangement a mixed review, describing ''Urban Light'' as "a kind of pop temple, deftly straddling the lines between art and architecture and between seriousness and irony." "It's also a joy to walk through, but there's no getting around the fact that it turns what might have been an actual public square along Wilshire—a space defined from day to day by the people using it—into an outdoor room for one sizable and very insistent piece of art."&lt;ref name="HawthorneReview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawthorne|first=Christopher|title=ARCHITECTURE REVIEW; County museum's expansion reflects two clashing visions; The new building is Eli Broad's realm, while LACMA's director applies his influence elsewhere|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/07/entertainment/et-bcamarch7|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hawthorne also argued that ''Urban Light'' was the first of four large-scale installations at LACMA in which Michael Govan challenged and undermined "the polite axial symmetry of the master plan he inherited from" architect [[Renzo Piano]] and his patrons.  Those installations also include Tony Smith's black aluminum sculpture, called "Smoke", that fills the atrium of the Ahmanson Building, a palm garden by [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]] installed along the edge of the Resnick Pavilion, and, just north, [[Michael Heizer]]'s ''[[Levitated Mass]]''.&lt;ref name="LA Times Large scale art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawthorne|first=Christopher|title=Critic's Notebook: Art on an architectural scale at LACMA|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-rock-notebook-20120708,0,1083093.story|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although ''Urban Light'' fills what had been Renzo Piano's planned "public square" space, it nevertheless succeeded where the empty public space dismally failed.  K. M. Williamson, social ecologist and director of [[Public Art in Public Places]], saw ''Urban Light'' as not reducing the plaza space but instead fundamentally redefining it and enlivening it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apalosangeles.org/public-art-in-public-places-l-a-s-iconic-urban-light/|title=L.A.'s Iconic "Urban Light": August is Art Appreciation Month - What if it was also Public Space Planning Appreciation Month?"|last=Williamson|first=K. M.|date=August 15, 2014|website=American Planning Association {{!}} Los Angeles|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Govan believed that ''Urban Light'' imparted a "feeling of walking through an ancient temple", one that echos the Greco-Roman temple facades of many East Coast museums. Those facades "are really faux; they’re neoclassical,...and here [Burden has] assembled an honest-to-goodness Los Angeles temple made of local materials, in our time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  ,

==Cultural status==
Since its 2008 installation, ''Urban Light'' has become an extremely popular attraction.  According to Public Art in Public Places, ''Urban Light'' has become the most visited, photographed and well-known public artwork in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/urban-light/vgGacTHf37eEwQ|title=Urban Light - Chris Burden 2008|last=Public Art in Public Places|first=|date=2016|website=Google Arts &amp; Culture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Director [[Ivan Reitman]] was one of the first filmmakers to incorporate the public artwork in a motion picture, using the location for a scene in his film ''[[No Strings Attached (film)|No Strings Attached]]''. Echoing Burden's own view,&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt; he called the artwork "an extraordinary beacon" that "lights up a desperate part of Wilshire that felt almost abandoned at night." ''Urban Light'' was featured in the [[Tori Amos]] video ''Maybe California'' and the film ''[[Valentine's Day (2010 film)|Valentine's Day]]''. The work appeared in a [[Guinness]] commercial and in a ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article featuring cast members of the television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', as well as in numerous amateur photos posted online. LACMA itself has featured the work as part of its own promotional efforts, including a 3D public service announcement preceding the film ''[[Megamind]]''.&lt;ref name=LATimes-sceens&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=Jori|title='Urban Light' lights up the screen|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/25/entertainment/la-et-urban-light-as-icon-20110125|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the sculpture was used in a dance scene in VH1's [[Hit the Floor (TV series)|''Hit the Floor'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Dance9Tiffany/status/473676624366665728|title = Tiffany Maher feed: 'A night I will never forget ~ @hitthefloor #devilgirls @LACMA @VH1'|date = June 2, 2014|website = Twitter|publisher = |last = Maher|first = Tiffany}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first known selfie taken at the sculpture was shot four days after the work opened and was posted to [[Flickr]]. The sculpture has its own hashtag: #urbanlight. While not rented out as a wedding site, ''Urban Light'' has been the setting for many vows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''Video-Enhanced Grave Marker''' ('''VEGM''') is a Western-style [[headstone|tombstone]] equipped with [[weatherproof]]ed [[video]] playback that can be initiated by [[remote control]].

The VEGM, invented by Robert Barrows of [[San Mateo, California]], would allow its owner to record messages to be played to any visitor to the site with a [[remote control]].&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB111283344036700294|title=Having a Say in Your Epitaph: The Challenge of High-Tech Tombstones|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=7 April 2005|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stones would be equipped with weatherproofed video playback and recording devices plus [[computer storage]] and a [[computer monitor|monitor]] placed within a weather-proofed, hollowed-out headstone. {{As of|2005|alt=As of May 2005}}, Barrows  estimated that the costs of the VEGMs might start at about  [[United States dollar|USD$]]8000 to $10,000.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

{{US patent|7089495}} was issued on The Video Enhanced Gravemarker on August 8, 2006.  Barrows commented soon after its invention: "I envision being able to walk through a cemetery using a remote control, clicking on graves and what all the people buried there have to say. They can say all the things they didn't have the opportunity or guts to say when they were alive."&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

To prevent [[noise pollution]], the audio can also be transmitted to [[wireless headset]]s, made available by the cemetery's office.

Though '''women artists''' have been involved in the making of art throughout history, their work, when compared to that of their male counterparts, is often both overlooked and undervalued. Prevailing stereotypes about the sexes have caused certain media, such as [[Textile arts|textile]] or [[fiber art]]s, to be primarily associated with women, despite having once been categories both men and women participated in. Additionally, art forms that have gained this distinction are, as in the case of both textile and fabric arts, demoted to categories like "[[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]]", rather than [[fine art]].&lt;ref name="moca"&gt;Aktins, Robert. [http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=14 "Feminist art."] ''Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.'' 1997 (retrieved 23 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in art have been faced with challenges due to gender biases in the mainstream fine art world.&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; They have often encountered difficulties in training, travelling and trading their work, as well as gaining recognition. Beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s, [[feminist]] artists and art historians created a [[Feminist art movement]] that overtly addresses the role of women in the art world and explores the role of women in [[art history]]&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; and in society.

==Prehistoric era==
There are no records of who the artists of the prehistoric eras were, but studies of many early ethnographers and cultural anthropologists indicate that women often were the principal artisans in [[Neolithic]] cultures, in which they created pottery, textiles, baskets, painted surfaces and jewelry. Collaboration on large projects was typical. Extrapolation to the artwork and skills of the [[Paleolithic]] era suggests that these cultures followed similar patterns. [[Cave painting]]s of this era often have human hand prints, 75% of which are identifiable as women's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art/ "Were the First Artists Mostly Women?"]  "National Geographic", October 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

"For about three thousand years, the women – and only the women – of [[History of Mithila|Mithila]] have been making devotional paintings of the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. It is no exaggeration, then, to say that this art is the expression of the most genuine aspect of Indian civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Vequaud, Ives, ''Women Painters of Mithila'', Thames and Hudson, Ltd., London, 1977 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Europe and the Middle East===
The earliest records of western cultures rarely mention specific individuals, although women are depicted in all of the art and some are shown laboring as artists. Ancient references by [[Homer]], [[Cicero]], and [[Virgil]] mention the prominent roles of women in textiles, poetry, music, and other cultural activities, without discussion of individual artists. Among the earliest European historical records concerning individual artists is that of [[Pliny the Elder]], who wrote about a number of Greek women who were painters, including [[Helena of Egypt]], daughter of Timon of Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/elliott/art/67.html Women in Art] retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html The Ancient Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026153755/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html |date=2010-10-26 }} Retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics posit that ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'' might not have been the work of [[Philoxenus of Cythera|Philoxenus]], but of Helena of Egypt.

===Medieval period===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Artists from the [[Medieval]] period include [[Claricia]], [[Diemudus]], [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], [[Guda]], [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations.

There were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; ''[[Opus Anglicanum]]'' or English embroidery was already famous across Europe – a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production. One of the most famous embroideries of the Medieval period is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which was embroidered with [[wool]] and is 230 feet long. Its images narrate the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. In the 14th century, a royal workshop is documented, based at the [[Tower of London]], and there may have been other earlier arrangements. Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], a 10th-century Spanish nun; [[Guda]], a 12th-century German nun; and [[Claricia]], a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them.

In many parts of Europe, with the [[Gregorian Reforms]] of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan [[Scandinavia]] (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female [[runemaster]], [[Gunnborga]], worked in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Upplands runinskrifter 1, s. 307 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, however, under the [[Ottonian Dynasty]], convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote ''The Divine Works of a Simple Man'', ''The Meritorious Life'', sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, ''[[Scivias]]'' ''(Know the Ways of the Lord)'', which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the ''[[Scivias]]'', as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegarde experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision.

The 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The [[Wife of Bath]] in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan [[guild]]s. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating ''Opus Anglicanum'', or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of [[Maître Honoré]] and the daughter of [[Jean le Noir (illuminator)|Jean le Noir]]. By the 13th century most [[illuminated manuscript]]s were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to [[printing]], and of book illustration to the [[printmaking]] techniques of [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]], where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists.

This is the first period in Western history in which a number of secular female artists gained international reputations. The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift was a move toward [[humanism]], a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women. In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important; significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, ''On Famous Women'' and ''The City of Women'', illustrate this cultural change. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], a 14th-century humanist, wrote ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (Latin for ''[[On Famous Women]]'') (1335–59), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of [[Thamar]] (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of ''On Famous Women'', Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. [[Christine de Pizan]], a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.

The most notable of these was ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' or ''[[The Courtier]]'' by 16th-century Italian humanist [[Baldassare Castiglione]]. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as [[Lavinia Fontana]] and [[Caterina van Hemessen]] began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the [[Academic art|Academy]], and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training. Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions.

Although many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include [[Caterina dei Virgi]], [[Antonia Uccello]], and [[Suor Barbara Ragnoni]]. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter [[Lavinia Fontana]], the miniature portraitist [[Levina Teerlinc]], and the portrait painter [[Caterina van Hemessen]]. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in [[Bruges]] show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators).

Artists from the [[Baroque]] era include: [[Mary Beale]], [[Élisabeth Sophie Chéron]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Katharina Pepijn]], [[Catharina Peeters]], [[Johanna Vergouwen]], [[Isabel de Cisneros]], [[Giovanna Garzoni]]&lt;ref name="3 women artists in Italy"&gt;[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/art/women-artist-3.asp 3 women artists in Italy] Retrieved June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], [[Louise Moillon]], [[Josefa de Óbidos|Josefa de Ayala]] better known as Josefa de Óbidos, [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Van de Passe family|Magdalena de Passe]], [[Clara Peeters]], Maria Virginia Borghese (daughter of art collector [[Olimpia Aldobrandini]]),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Sheila, [http://www.medici.org/highlights/canvas-commoners Canvas is for Commoners], Highlights from the Mediceo del Principato, medici.org, 2008-3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luisa Roldán]] known as La Roldana, [[Rachel Ruysch]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Francisca-Catherina van Thielen]] and [[Elisabetta Sirani]]. As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] is an excellent example of this. She was trained by her father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. [[Luisa Roldán]] was trained in her father's ([[Pedro Roldán]]) sculpture workshop.

Women artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as [[Elisabetta Sirani]] created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses.  One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemesia Gentileschi's ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining her own destiny. While other artists, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and the more traditional woman, [[Fede Galizia]], depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. [[Still life]] emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included [[Clara Peeters]], a painter of ''banketje'' or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], the internationally renowned flower painter; and [[Rachel Ruysch]], a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including [[Giovanna Garzoni]], who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and [[Louise Moillon]], whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.

In many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style.  The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was [[history painting]], especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. [[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun]] used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, ''Peace Bringing Back Plenty'', which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint.  She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;Heller, Nancy G., ''Women Artists: An Illustrated History'', Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-89659-748-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, two women, [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Mary Moser]], were founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London in 1768.  Kauffmann helped [[Maria Cosway]] enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'' by Johan Zoffany now in The [[Royal Collection]]. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=400747| title = The Royal Academicians| last = Zoffany| first = Johan| authorlink = Johann Zoffany| year = 1771–1772| work = | publisher = [[Royal Collection|The Royal Collection]]|accessdate = March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis in [[Academic art]] on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists.  After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until [[Laura Knight]] in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].

==19th century==

=== Painters === 

Women artists of the early part of the 19th century include [[Marie-Denise Villers]], who specialized in portraiture; [[Constance Mayer]], who painted portraits and allegories; [[Marie Ellenrieder]], who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the [[Nazarenes (artists)|Nazarene]] style.

In the second half of the century, [[Emma Sandys]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman]], [[Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale]], and [[Maria Zambaco]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/biography/p012261.htm Maria Zambaco] Retrieved June 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; were women artists of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement. Also influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites were [[Evelyn De Morgan]] and the activist and painter [[Barbara Bodichon]].

Impressionist painters [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Marie Bracquemond]], and the [[United States|Americans]], [[Mary Cassatt]] and [[Lucy Bacon]], became involved in the French [[Impressionist]] movement of the 1860s and 1870s. American Impressionist [[Lilla Cabot Perry]] was influenced by her studies with [[Monet]] and by [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century. [[Cecilia Beaux]] was an American portrait painter who also studied in France. [[Olga Boznańska]] is considered the best-known of all Polish women artists, and was stylistically associated with Impressionism.  

[[Rosa Bonheur]] was the best-known female artist of her time, internationally renowned for her paintings of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Elizabeth Weed (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTb9d7vZhA0C&amp;pg=PA50 The Question of Gender: Joan W. Scott's Critical Feminism]''. Indiana University Press. p. 50. {{ISBN|0253223245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Thompson]] (Lady Butler), perhaps inspired by her life-classes of armoured figures at the [[Royal College of Art|Government School]], was one of the first women to become famous for large history paintings, specializing in scenes of military action, usually with many horses, most famously ''[[Scotland Forever!]]'', showing a cavalry charge at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].

[[Kitty Lange Kielland]] was a Norwegian landscape painter.

[[Elizabeth Jane Gardner]] was an American academic painter who was the first American woman to exhibit at the [[Paris Salon]]. In 1872 she became the first woman to ever win a gold medal at the Salon. 

In 1894, [[Suzanne Valadon]] was the first woman admitted to the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in France. [[Anna Boch]] was a [[post-impressionist]] painter, as was [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], who exhibited at the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and then in 1894 as part of the [[Société des artistes français]] in Paris. 

===Photography===

[[Julia Margaret Cameron]] and [[Gertrude Kasebier]] became well known in the new medium of [[photography]], where there were no traditional restrictions, and no established training, to hold them back. 

=== Sculpture ===
[[Camille Claudel]], [[Edmonia Lewis]] and [[Enid Yandell]].

In the late 19th century, [[Edmonia Lewis]], an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]-[[Ojibwe]]-[[Haitian Americans|Haitian American]] artist from New York began her art studies at [[Oberlin College]]. Her sculpting career began in 1863. She established a studio in [[Rome, Italy]] and exhibited her marble sculptures through Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonialewis.com/chronology.htm "Biography – Chronology of Mary Edmonia Lewis."] ''Edmonia Lewis.''

===Female education in the 19th century===

During the century, access to academies and formal art training expanded more for women in Europe and North America. The British Government School of Design, which later became the [[Royal College of Art]], admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a "Female School" which was treated somewhat differently, with "life"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour. 

The Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the [[Slade School of Art]] from the 1870s, were more liberal.  By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities. The Society of Female Artists (now called ''The [[Society of Women Artists]]'') was established in 1855 in London and has staged annual exhibitions since 1857, when 358 works were shown by 149 women, some using a pseudonym.&lt;ref name=society&gt;[http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/History.html "History"], ''The Society of Women Artists''.

[[Hilma af Klint]] (1862–1944) was a pioneer abstract painter, working long before her abstract expressionist male counterparts. She was Swedish and regularly exhibited her paintings dealing with realism, but the abstract works were not shown until 20 years after her death, at her request. She considered herself to be a spiritualist and mystic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuchman|first1=Maurice|title=The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting, 1890–1985|publisher=Abbeville Pr|isbn=0896596699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] (1865–1933) was a Scottish artist whose works helped define the "Glasgow Style" of the 1890s and early 20th century. She often collaborated with her husband, the architect and designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], in works that had influence in Europe. She exhibited with Mackintosh at the 1900 [[Vienna Secession]], where her work is thought to have had an influence on the Secessionists such as [[Gustav Klimt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/features/item/margaret-macdonald|title=Margaret Macdonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] (1878–1962) was an early American modernist in New York City. She made significant contributions to modern American art through her work at the Art Students League and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Studio Club]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm'' by Clint B.

Among the other women artists prominent in the [[Russian avant-garde]] were [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]]. [[Sonia Delaunay]] and her husband were the founders of [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

In the [[Art Deco]] era, [[Hildreth Meiere]] made large-scale mosaics and was the first woman honored with the Fine Arts Medal of the American Institute of Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Architects Directory|year=1962|publisher=R.R.

She became known for her paintings, featuring flowers, bones, and landscapes of [[New Mexico]]. In 1927, [[Dod Procter]]'s painting ''Morning'' was voted Picture of the Year in the [[Royal Academy]] Summer Exhibition, and bought by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for the [[Tate]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography|year=2003|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0618252107|page=1241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity resulted in its showing in New York and a two-year tour of Britain.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=12241&amp;searchid=10053 "Dod Procter"], [[Tate]].

[[Dorothea Lange]] documented the Depression. [[Margaret Bourke-White]] created the industrial photographs that were featured on the cover and in the lead article of the first ''Life Magazine''. [[Diane Arbus]] based her photography on outsiders to mainstream society. [[Graciela Iturbide]]'s works dealt with Mexican life and feminism, while [[Tina Modotti]] produced "revolutionary icons" from [[Mexico]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sarah M., ''Tina Modootti: Photographs'', Harry N. Abrams Inc., Publishers, 1995 p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annie Leibovitz]]'s photographic work was of [[rock and roll]] and other celebrity figures. 

Mary Carroll Nelson founded the [[Society of Layerists in MultiMedia|Society of Layerists in Multi-Media]] (SLMM), whose artist members follow in the tradition of [[Emil Bisttram]] and the Transcendental Painting Group, as well as [[Morris Graves]] of the Pacific Northwest Visionary Art School. In the 1970s, [[Judy Chicago]] created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', a very important work of [[feminist art]]. [[Helen Frankenthaler]] was an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] painter and she was influenced by [[Jackson Pollock]]. [[Lee Krasner]] was also an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] artist and married to Pollock and a student of [[Hans Hofmann]]. [[Elaine de Kooning]] was a student and later the wife of [[Willem de Kooning]], she was an [[New York Figurative Expressionism|abstract figurative painter]]. [[Anne Ryan]] was a collagist. [[Jane Frank]], also a student of [[Hans Hofmann]], worked with [[mixed media]] on canvas. In Canada, [[Marcelle Ferron]] was an exponent of [[Les Automatistes|automatism]].

From the 1960s on, [[feminism]] led to a great increase in interest in women artists and their academic study. Notable contributions have been made by the [[art historian]]s [[Germaine Greer]], [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Griselda Pollock]] and others. Some [[art historian]]s such as [[Daphne Haldin]] have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Drummond Charig | first= Frankie | date= 4 April 2016 | title= Daphne Haldin’s Archive and the 'Dictionary of Women Artists' | url=  http://www.britishartstudies.ac.uk/issues/issue-index/issue-2/still-invisible#018 | journal= British Art Studies | publisher= [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale Center for British Art]] | issue= 2 | doi=10.17658/issn.2058-5462/issue-02/still-invisible/018 | access-date=  28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures like Artemesia Gentileschi and Frida Kahlo emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist [[cultural icon|icons]]. The [[Guerilla Girls]], an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were "the conscience of the art world." They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change. In 1996, [[Catherine de Zegher]] curated an exhibition of 37 great women artists from the twentieth century. The exhibition, ''Inside the Visible'', that travelled from the ICA in Boston to the National Museum for Women in the Arts in Washington, the Whitechapel in London and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, included artists' works from the 1930s through the 1990s featuring [[Claude Cahun]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Charlotte Salomon]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Nancy Spero]], [[Francesca Woodman]], [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Mona Hatoum]] among others.

In 1993, [[Rachel Whiteread]] was the first woman to win the [[Tate]] Gallery's [[Turner Prize]]. [[Gillian Wearing]] won the prize in 1997, when there was an all-woman shortlist, the other nominees being [[Christine Borland]], [[Angela Bulloch]] and [[Cornelia Parker]]. In 1999, [[Tracey Emin]] gained considerable media coverage for her entry ''[[My Bed]]'', but did not win. In 2006 the prize was awarded to abstract painter, [[Tomma Abts]]. In 2001, a conference called "Women Artists at the Millennium" was organized at [[Princeton University]]. A book by that name was published in 2006, featuring major art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]] analysing prominent women artists such as [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Sally Mann]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Rosemarie Trockel]]. Internationally prominent [[contemporary artists]] who are women also include [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Jaroslava Brychtova]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Lee Bul]], [[Sophie Calle]], [[Janet Cardiff]], [[Li Chevalier]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Runa Islam]], [[Chantal Joffe]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Karen Kilimnik]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Shazia Sikander]], [[Lorna Simpson]], [[Lisa Steele]], [[Stella Vine]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Rebecca Warren]], [[Bettina Werner]] and [[Susan Dorothea White]]. &lt;!--DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST--&gt;

[[Japan]]ese artist [[Yayoi Kusama]]'s paintings, collages, soft sculptures, performance art and environmental installations all share an obsession with repetition, pattern, and accumulation. Her work shows some attributes of [[feminism]], [[minimalism]], [[surrealism]], [[Outsider Art|Art Brut]], [[pop art]], and [[abstract expressionism]], and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She describes herself as an "obsessive artist". In November 2008, Christie's auction house New York sold her 1959 painting ''No. 2'' for $5,100,000, the record price in 2008 for a work by a living female artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/15/artmarkets | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=New York art sales: 'I knew it was too good to last' | date=2008-11-15 | first=Anthony | last=Haden-Guest}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–2011, [[Pompidou Centre]] in Paris presented its curators' choice of contemporary women artists in a three-volume's exhibition named ''elles@Centrepompidou''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212114941/http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-12|title=Communiqué présentation 3e rotation de l’exposition "elles" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum showed works of major women artists from its own collection. 2010 saw [[Eileen Cooper]] elected as the first ever woman 'Keeper of the Royal Academy'. 1995 saw Dame [[Elizabeth Blackadder]] in the 300-year history made 'Her Majesty's painter and limber in Scotland, she was awarded the OBE in 1982.

An interesting genre of women's art is women's environmental art. As of December 2013, the [[Women Environmental Artists Directory]] listed 307 women environmental artists, such as [[Marina DeBris]], [[Vernita Nemec]] and [[Betty Beaumont]]. DeBris uses beach trash to raise awareness of beach and ocean pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=staff|title=Our Town, Central|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/-145278-ocprint--.html|publisher=Orange County Register|accessdate= December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to educate children about beach trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OC... and Sculpture by the Sea!|url=http://www.sutherland-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/news/oc-by-the-sea|publisher=Sutherland Public School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemec recently used junk mail to demonstrate the complexity of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vernita Nemec Segments of Endless Junkmail|url=http://artdaily.com/news/19141/Vernita-Nemec-Segments-of-Endless-Junkmail|publisher=Artdaily.org, The First Art Newspaper on the Net|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaumont has been described as a pioneer of environmental art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Alumni Awards|url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/alumni-friends/distinguished-alumni-award/alumni-2006/|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses art to challenge our beliefs and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Camouflaged Cells Betty Beaumont|journal=Newfound Journal|date=Winter 2011|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://www.newfoundjournal.org/archives/volume-2/issue-1/photography-beaumont/|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misrepresentation in art history==

[[Image:Villers Young Woman Drawing.jpg|thumb|[[Marie-Denise Villers]], ''Young Woman Drawing'' 1801, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
Women artists have often been mis-characterized in historical accounts, both intentionally and unintentionally; such misrepresentations have often been dictated by the socio-political mores of the given era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/19wa/hd_19wa.htm|title=Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France – Essay – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |first= Nicole|last=Myers|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of issues that lie behind this, including:
* Scarcity of biographical information
* Anonymity – Women artists were often most active in artistic expressions that were not typically signed. During the Early Medieval period, manuscript illumination was a pursuit of monks and nuns alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC Nuns as Artists: The Visual Culture of a Medieval Convent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035602/http://books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC |date=2014-10-19 }}, Jeffrey F. Hamburger, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Painters' Guild]]s – In the Medieval and Renaissance periods, many women worked in the workshop system. These women worked under the auspices of a male workshop head, very often the artist's father. Until the twelfth century there is no record of a workshop headed by a woman, when a widow would be allowed to assume her husband's former position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prak|first1=Maarten R.|title=Craft Guilds in Early Modern Low Countries: Work, Power and Representation|date=2006|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=0754653390|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[guild]] rules forbade women from attaining the various ranks leading to master,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting: Its Stylistic and Thematic Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035605/http://books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ |date=2014-10-19 }}, Wayne Franits, Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-10237-2}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC Dutch Painting 1600–1800] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035608/http://books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC |date=2014-10-19 }} Pelican history of art, {{ISSN|0553-4755}}, Yale University Press, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; so they remained "unofficial" in their status.
* Naming Conventions – the [[Family name|convention whereby women take their husbands' last names]] impedes research on female articles, especially in cases in which a work of unknown origin was signed only with a first initial and last name. Even the simplest biographical statements may be misleading. For example, one might say that [[Jane Frank]] was born in 1918, but in reality she was [[Jane Schenthal]] at birth – Jane "Frank" didn't exist until over twenty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Phoebe B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=izcwMwEACAAJ "The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank"]  [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/ow/3569fb46ba6eb6ea.html World Cat] ([[A.S.

* Mistaken identity and incorrect attribution – In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, work by women was often reassigned.

The painting was attributed to [[Jacques-Louis David]] at one time, but was later realized to be Villers' work.
