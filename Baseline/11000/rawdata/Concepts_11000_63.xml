      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7090">'''''Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism''''' is a 2017 book about [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorism]] co-authored by Mark Hamm, a criminologist at [[Indiana State University]] and Ramon Spaaij, a sociologist at [[Victoria University, Australia]].

According to a  review in [[Times Higher Education]] that described ''Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism'' as an "genuinely indispensable study of today’s steadily increasing terrorist threat," the book's "pivotal contention" that the radicalization of lone wolf terrorists exhibits discernible patterns that include   
“the integration of personal and political grievances; an affinity with online sympathizers and/or extremist groups," and "triggering events that, oftentimes, cause a dramatic change in behavior”.&lt;ref name="FeldmanReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feldman|first1=Matthew|title=The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism (book review)|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-the-age-of-lone-wolf-terrorism-mark-s-hamm-and-ramon-spaaij-columbia-university-press#survey-answer|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hamm and Spaaij  constructed a database funded by the United States Department of Justice in which they identified 124 instances of [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorist]] attacks in the United States between 1940 and 2016; the list includes "about" 30 planned attacks that are known not to have been carrier out, or that have been identified as FBI [[sting operation]]s, or as hoaxes.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Worth|first1=Katie|title=Lone Wolf Attacks Are Becoming More Common — And More Deadly|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/lone-wolf-attacks-are-becoming-more-common-and-more-deadly/|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=PBS Frontline|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Hamm and Spaaij defined lone wolf terrorism narrowly; they required an attacker to be politically motivated, this excluded, for example, mass shooters such as Adam Lanza, whose motive appeared to be entirely personal.  And they had to have acted entirely alone, excluding cases like the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]] carried out by a married couple, and the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], carried out by a pair of brothers.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BojaniOne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bojani|first1=Fatima|title=America’s lone-wolf terrorists are unpredictable in almost every regard—except one|url=https://qz.com/807997/lone-wolf-terrorists-gun-control-us/|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=Quartz|date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MillettReview&gt; Kris Millett (2017): Hamm &amp; Spaaij

The tightness of this definition was widely criticized.&lt;ref name=MisReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=SinaiReview/&gt;&lt;ref name="BojaniOne"/&gt; 

==Findings==
Hamm and Spaaij use data they compiled, and examinations of the lone wolf phenomenon by other researches to reach a series of conclusions.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BojaniOne"/&gt;

They conclude that lone wolf terrorist attacks are becoming more common in the United States, and that casualty tolls, both of injuries and of deaths, has risen steadily over the decades since 1940, and risen sharply in the 2010s.  They note that the lone wolf terrorist who killed the highest number of victims was [[Joseph Paul Franklin]] who carried out a series of attacks in which he targeted [[Black people|black]] and [[Jewish]] Americans.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt; They also show that in recent years lone wolves have more frequently targeted uniformed police and military personnel.&lt;ref name=MillettReview/&gt;

They conclude that although as of 2018, [[white supremacist]] ideologies continue to account for the largest share of attacks, but that [[jihadist]] motivation has risen rapidly.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;

They conclude that lone wolf terrorists are usually  unemployed, single, white males with a criminal record who tend to be older, to have less education, and more likely to have a record of mental illness than other violent criminals.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;  In particularly, they demonstrate that in recent years such recent attacks have followed incidents in which the lone wolf uses physical  violence against women.

Their data demonstrates that although explosives and guns were the most common weapons used by lone wolves from the 1940s through the 1980s, the use of guns has skyrocketed and they are now the weapon most commonly employed by lone wolf terrorists.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BojaniOne"/&gt;

They show that most lone wolves tell someone that they intend to carry out an attack.  From the 1940s through the end of the century 84% of lone wolves did so, since 76% have done so.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;

==Criticism of law enforcement==
Hamm and Spaaij single out FBI sting operations for special criticism.  Book reviewer Kris Millett praises their "devastatingly effective" use of data to "argue that those captured in the sting operations did not display the personal characteristics common to the radicalisation of lone wolf terrorists."&lt;ref name=MillettReview/&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewer James Mills criticizes Hamm and Spaaij for using narrow criteria that eliminate lone wolf pairs such as [[Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik]] and the [[Tsarnaev brothers]] from inclusion on their list, even those they meet the definition in all other ways.  Mills also criticized their argument that lone wolf terrorism is  preventable since “violent radicalization is a social process involving behavior that can be observed, comprehended and modeled,” arguing that the influences on human action are complex and not easily modeled and predicted, while praising the author's date gathering.&lt;ref name=MisReview&gt; Mis, James, Mark. S. Hamm, and Ramón Spaaij. PRISM 7, no. 3 (2018): 134-35. https://www.jstor.org/stable/26470541&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Joshua Sinai points out that lone wolves may regard themselves as members of terrorist organizations on the grounds that they are carrying out orders broadcast on the internet by the leaders of such organizations, and argues that, pace Hamm and Spaaij, FBI "sting" operations have been effective in preventing terrorism, but praises the author's six-part model (p. 159 in book,) of personal and political grievance, affinity with online sympathizers 
or an extremist group, enabler, broadcasting intent, triggering event, and engaging in terrorism (p. 159).&lt;ref name=SinaiReview&gt; Sinai, Joshua, Mark S. Hamm, and Ramon Spaaij. Perspectives on Terrorism 11, no. 3 (2017): 81. http://www.jstor.org/stable/26297850.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Association Najdeh''' (AN) ('''جمعية النجدة الاجتماعية''' in Arabic, Arabic najdeh="relief" or "aid") is an [[NGO]] involved with [[Community development|development]] and [[educational]] projects in [[Palestinian refugee camps]] in [[Lebanon]]. It operates more exactly in and around the [[refugee camps]]. It defends the [[Palestinian refugee]] women who are often victims of [[discrimination]]s and also participates in different campaigns, in coalitions of local and international organizations, for the right to work in Lebanon and the right of return to [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].

==History==
The association Najdeh was founded in 1976 by a group of independent Lebanese women and men to secure immediate income to [[Palestinian refugee]] women in particular after the movement of Palestinian family to the camp of Tel-Za'atar. An initial work of embroidery was organized and generated an income, then a day-care center and a workplace for the women was created. Finally, in 1978, the Najdeh association was registered to the Ministry of the Interior as the independent Lebanese social and non-governmental organization ([[NGO]]) with headquarters in [[Beirut]]. Between 2005 in 2006, the association Najdeh elaborated a Code of conduct, intended to strengthen the role of the [[civil society]] institutions. It opposes to the proposition in 2006, of an Islamic constitution in [[Burj el-Barajneh]] camp, by institutions with Islamic trend. It has been recently mobilized during the conflict in [[Nahr el-Bared]] camps of May, 2007 to bring relief and assistance to residents of the camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emro.who.int/lebanon/crisis/Lebanon_Crisis_Health_Cluster_Bulletin_15%20August%2007.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108034055/http://www.emro.who.int/lebanon/crisis/Lebanon_Crisis_Health_Cluster_Bulletin_15%20August%2007.pdf |date=November 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association Najdeh organized [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] in all the regions of the Lebanon, on April 30, 2009, for "the right to work campaign of the Palestinian refugees in the Lebanon", in particular with Palestinian-Lebanese coalition's commissions, after having published a report on the contribution of the [[Palestinian refugees]] to the Lebanese economy, in January, 2009, thanks to funding from aid agencies (Diakonia and Christian Aid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutterpoetry.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/palestinians-pump-up-lebanese-economy-study/ |title=Palestinians pump up Lebanese economy – study &amp;#124; Gutter Poetry in the Arab World |publisher=Gutterpoetry.wordpress.com |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The main purpose of the association Najdeh is to empower women in the Palestinian community because they are a most severely disadvantage component of the [[Palestinian refugee]] community. The improvement of the role of the women in the Palestinian community also concerns their economic, social and educational role.

==Profile==
The association Najdeh organs consists of: a General assembly, an Administrative Bureau elected by this Assembly, members of the Executive Board assigned by this Administrative Bureau.
The General assembly is 70% of women and 30% of men. The administrative board has progressed over the last few years from only female members to a fifty-fifty female/male division (6 members). The staff is primarily women and members of the [[Palestinian refugee]] community. Eighty percent of the beneficiaries are women and Palestinians, while the remaining 20% are men and individuals of other nationalities.
The association Najdeh operates on 26 centers in and around [[refugee camps]]. Its programs focus directly on the women and include: [[vocational training]] Program, Popular Education and Tutorial Program, Mother and Child Program, Social Affairs, [[Domestic Violence]] Program, [[microcredit]] Project, and Embroidery.
It also defends the rights of the Palestinians by activities of raising awareness on subjects such as the health of the reproduction, the rights of the woman and the rights of the child. The programs of the association would touch up to 10 000 refugees, in all [[palestinian refugee camps]], including camps [[Burj el-Barajneh]], [[Nahr el-Bared]], [[Shatila refugee camp|Shatila]], [[Beddawi]], etc.

==Core values==
The association Najdeh has personal core values that it intend to promote: a community committed to the Palestinian [[nation]], a belief in the importance of [[human rights]], of [[social justice]] and of [[gender equality]]. As a member of the [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]](HAP International) since August 2009, she believes in the values of PAHs based on transparency and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hapinternational.org/members/our-members.aspx]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618121714/http://www.hapinternational.org/members/our-members.aspx |date=June 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The association Najdeh has several sources of funding. The [[donations]] are a big part, their origins are multiple: mainly funds from donor organizations and individuals from [[Europe]], and from some partners present in [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The other sources of income are: incomes from the production of embroidery, fees for students in professional training program and those for program of women and children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8047">In [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], the [[Sanskrit]] term '''Bīja''' ({{lang|sa|बीज}}) ([[Japanese language|Jp]]. 種子 shuji) ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] 种子 zhǒng zǐ), literally [[seed]], is used as a metaphor for the origin or cause of things and cognate with [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]]. 
[[File:Om siddham2.png|thumb|right|100px|The Om bija in [[Esoteric Buddhism]]]]

==Buddhist theory of karmic seeds==
Various schools of Buddhist thought held that karmic effects arose out of seeds that were latent in an individual's [[mindstream]] or psycho-physical continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA:
A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert Gethin describes the theory thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I perform an action motivated by greed, it plants a 'seed' in the series of [[Dharma#Buddhism|dharmas]] [phenomena] that is my mind. Such a seed is not a thing in itself - a dharma but merely the modification or 'perfuming' of the subsequent flow of dharmas consequent upon the action. In the course of time this modification matures and issues in a particular result, in the same way as a seed does not produce its fruit immediately, but only after the 'modifications' of the shoot, stem, leaf, and flower.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin, Rupert. The Foundations of Buddhism, page 222.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Sautrantika]] school held such a theory as did the [[Mahasamghikas]] and the early Mahasisakas.&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte; Pruden. Karmasiddhiprakarana, 1987, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sautrantika Sthavira Srilata held a conception of "subsidiary element" (''anudhatu'' or *''purvanudhatu'') which also corresponds to this theory of seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA:
A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The seed theory was defended by the Buddhist philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] in his [[Abhidharmakosha]] who mentions that is the view of the “old teachers” (''purvacarya'').&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA:
A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also present in the ''Viniscayasamgrahani'' of the [[Yogacarabhumi]].&lt;ref&gt;Kritzer, Robert. SAUTRANTIKA IN THE ABHIDHARMAKOSABHASYA&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bashyam Vasubandhu connects the Sautrantika theory of seeds with the notion of the latent defilements or [[anusaya]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Sautrantikas define [[anusaya]]s as [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]] in the state of seeds and say that they are not separate [[dravya]]s (substances). Anusayas are dormant, i.e., not actualized, while paryavasthanas (active defilements) are awakened.&lt;ref&gt;Kritzer, Robert. SAUTRANTIKA IN THE ABHIDHARMAKOSABHASYA, page 364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, the ''Nyayanusara'' of Sanghabhadra states that the theory had different terms to refer to "seeds":

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are certain masters who give different names to these seeds, each according to his own understanding. Some call them subsidiary elements (''anudhatu''), others call them impressions (''vasana''); still others call them capability (''samarthya''), non-disappearance (''avipranasa''), or accumulation (''upacaya'').&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA:
A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theory is considerably extended in the [[Consciousness-only]] teachings of the [[Yogacara]] school of Buddhism. According to this theory, all experiences and actions produce ''bīja'' as impressions, stored in the [[alaya]] (storehouse) consciousness.  The external world is produced when the seeds "perfume" this consciousness.

==In Tantra==
In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism and [[Hinduism]], the term ''bīja'' is used for mystical "seed syllables" contained within [[mantra]]s.  These seeds do not have precise meanings, but are thought to carry connections to spiritual principles.  The best-known ''bīja'' syllable is [[Om]], first found in the Hindu scriptures the [[Upanishads]].

Khanna (2003: p.&amp;nbsp;21) links mantras and [[yantra]]s to [[thoughtform]]s:

{{quote|Mantras, the Sanskrit syllables inscribed on yantras, are essentially 'thought forms' representing divinities or cosmic powers, which exert their influence by means of sound-vibrations.|&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Madhu (2003). ''Yantra:  The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity. '' Inner Traditions.  {{ISBN|0-89281-132-3}}  &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-89281-132-8}}. p.21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some tantric traditions, the Bija of the '[[Varnamala (disambiguation)|Varnamala]]' (Sanskrit; English: "garland of letters"; which may be rendered as alphabet) are understood as aniconic representations and sound embodiments of the [[matrikas]] (a group of goddesses).

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the seed syllables corresponding to the [[Three Vajras]] are: a white ''oṃ'' (enlightened body), a red ''āḥ'' (enlightened speech) and a blue ''hūṃ'' (enlightened mind).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rinpoche|first=Pabongka|title=Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment|publisher=Wisdom Books|year=1997|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bön]] tradition of Tibet, it's a little different: a white ''āḥ'', a red ''oṃ'' and a blue ''hūṃ''.

Bijas are often the vehicle of [[esoteric transmission]] of [[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]] to a '[[tertön]]' (Tibetan; English: "revealer of terma"), such as that experienced by [[Dudjom Lingpa]].&lt;ref&gt;*Lingpa, Dudjom; Tulku, Chagdud; Norbu, Padma Drimed; Barron, Richard (Lama Chökyi Nyima, translator); Fairclough, Susanne (translator) (1994, 2002 revised). ''Buddhahood without meditation: a visionary account known as 'Refining one's perception' (Nang-jang)'' (English; Tibetan: ''ran bźin rdzogs pa chen po'i ranźal mnon du byed pa'i gdams pa zab gsan sñin po''). Revised Edition. Junction City, CA, USA: Padma Publishing. {{ISBN|1-881847-33-0}} p.xx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross cultural correlates==
[[Guruwari]] of the [[Indigenous Australian]] peoples is an interesting cross cultural correlate and may be cognate.{{check|date=August 2017}}&lt;!-- Highly suspect claim --&gt;  See also [[gankyil]] of the [[Vajrayana]] tradition which is cognate with [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]].  In the respected fieldwork published in ''Aboriginal Men of High Degree'', [[A.P. Elkin]] cites what he in his professional opinion is evidence that traders from [[Indonesia]] brought fleeting contact of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] to areas near modern-day [[Dampier, Western Australia|Dampier]].&lt;ref name=Elkin&gt;[[Elkin, A.P.]]. ''Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition''. 1973. [[Inner Traditions]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditions of [[Mantrayana]] were also evident in Indonesia, e.g. [[Candi Sukuh]]. And it is in the Vajrayana and Mantrayana traditions of [[esoteric transmission]] where bija take precedence. Indeed, bija defines Mantrayana. Elkin interpreted a link between [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] culture and Buddhist ideas such as [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name=Elkin/&gt; He argued this link could have been brought through contact with Macassan traders.&lt;ref name=Elkin/&gt; There was also speculation due to reports of [[China|Chinese]] relics appearing in northern Australia dating to the 15th century, although it may have been brought much later through trade rather than earlier exploration. Elkin cited linguistic commonalities of certain far northern Australian indigenous words and lexical items and ancient southern Indian [[Dravidian languages]]. There are also documented analogues and marked similarities in their kinship systems.{{check|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13063">'''Physical causal closure''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory about the nature of causation in the [[Physical property|physical]] realm with significant ramifications in the study of [[metaphysics]] and [[Philosophy of mind|the mind]]. In a strongly stated version, physical causal closure says that "all physical states have ''pure'' physical causes" — [[Jaegwon Kim]],&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; or that "physical effects have ''only'' physical causes" — Agustin Vincente, p.&amp;nbsp;150.&lt;ref name=Vicente /&gt;

Those who accept the theory tend, in general although not exclusively, to the physicalist view that all entities that exist are physical entities.  As Karl Popper says, "The physicalist principle of closedness of the physical ... is of decisive importance and I take it as the characteristic principle of physicalism or materialism."&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;

==Definition==
Physical causal closure has stronger and weaker formulations.&lt;ref name=Montero/&gt;

The stronger formulations assert that "No physical event has a cause outside the physical domain." — Jaegwon Kim.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt; That is, they assert that for physical events, causes ''other'' than physical causes do not exist. (Physical events that are not causally ''determined'' may be said to have their objective ''chances of occurrence'' determined by physical causes.)&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt;

Weaker forms of the theory state that "Every physical event has a physical cause." — Barbara Montero,&lt;ref name=Montero/&gt; or that "Every physical effect (that is, caused event) has physical sufficient causes" — Agustin Vincente,&lt;ref name=Vicente /&gt; (According to Vincente, a number of caveats have to be observed, among which is the postulate that "physical entities" are entities postulated by a true theory of physics, a theory of which we are ignorant today, and that such a true theory "will not include mental (or in general, dubious) concepts" (Note 5, p.&amp;nbsp;168).&lt;ref name=Vicente /&gt;) or that "if we trace the causal ancestry of a physical event we need never go outside the physical domain." — Jaegwon Kim.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt;  Weaker forms of physical causal closure are synonymous with the ''causal completeness'',&lt;ref name="VelmansSchneider2008"/&gt; the notion that "Every physical effect that has a sufficient cause has a sufficient physical cause."&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt; That is, weaker forms allow that ''in addition'' to physical causes, there may be other kinds of causes for physical events.

The notion of [[Reduction (philosophy)|reductionism]] supplements physical causal closure with the claim that ''all'' events ultimately can be reduced to physical events. Under these circumstances, mental events are a subset of physical events and caused by them.&lt;ref name=Kim2/&gt;

==Importance==
Physical causal closure is especially important when considering [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]] theories of [[mind]]. If no physical event has a cause outside the physical realm, it would follow that non-physical [[mental events]] would be causally impotent in the physical world. However, as Kim has agreed, it seems intuitively problematic to strip mental events of their causal power.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt; Only epiphenomenalists would agree that mental events do not have causal power, but [[epiphenomenalism]] is objectionable to many philosophers. One way of maintaining the causal powers of mental events is to assert [[Anomalous monism|token identity]] [[non-reductive physicalism]]—that [[mental property|mental properties]] [[supervenience|supervene]] on neurological properties. That is, there can be no change in the mental without a corresponding change in the physical. Yet this implies that mental events can have two causes (physical and mental), a situation which apparently results in [[overdetermination]] (redundant causes), and denies the strong physical causal closure.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt; Kim argues that if the strong physical causal closure argument is correct, the only way to maintain mental causation is to assert [[Type physicalism|type identity]] [[reductive physicalism]]—that mental properties are neurological properties.&lt;ref name=Kim2/&gt;

==Criticism==

The validity of the physical causal closure has long been debated.&lt;ref name=Libet/&gt; In modern times, it has been pointed out that science is based on removing the subject from investigations, and by seeking objectivity. This outsider status for the observer, a third-person perspective, is said by some philosophers to have automatically severed science from the ability to examine subjective issues like consciousness and free will.&lt;ref name=Hong/&gt;&lt;ref name=NagelT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mohrhoff/&gt; A different attack upon the physical causal closure discussed by Hodgson is to claim science itself does not support the physical causal closure.&lt;ref name=Hodgson/&gt; Some philosophers have criticized the argument for the physical causal closure by supporting [[teleology]] and mental-to-physical causation via a ''soul''.&lt;ref name=Goetz/&gt;

===Ignoring phenomena===
There seem ''prima facie'' to be irreducible purpose-based (or teleological) explanations of some natural phenomena. For instance, the movement of a writer's fingers on the keyboard and a reader's eyes across the screen is irreducibly explained in reference to the ''goal'' of writing an intelligible sentence or of learning about the physical causal closure arguments, respectively. On the face of it, an exclusively non-teleological (descriptive) account of the neurological and biological features of hand movement and eye movement misses the point. To say, "I am moving my fingers ''because'' my brain signals are triggering muscle motion in my arms" is true, but does not exhaustively explain all the causes. Both are causes. In Aristotelian terms, a neurological account explains the efficient cause, while the purpose-based account explains the final cause.&lt;ref name=Falcon/&gt;

The physical causal closure thesis challenges this account. It attempts to reduce all teleological final (and formal) causes to efficient causes. Goetz and Taliaferro urge that this challenge is unjustified, partly because it would imply that the ''real'' cause of arguing for the physical causal closure is neurobiological activity in the brain, not (as we know it is) the purpose-based attempt to understand the world and explain it to others.

===Fallacious===
One way of clarifying the physical causal closure argument is to add a premise specifying that there are no irreducible teleological causes. This, of course, is the attempted conclusion of the argument. Putting the conclusion as one of the premises of the argument is formally valid, but fallacious (begging the question). It is no more sound than the argument that "I believe in the Bible because it is the written word of God through his prophets. Obviously, God would not lie to his prophets. After all, the Bible says so."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Trivial===
Another way of clarifying the physical causal closure argument is to specify that "Every physical effect [that has a physical cause] has a physical cause." But this is a tautology, and therefore true but trivial, like the statement "Every angel that has wings is an angel that has wings" or "Every white male who is bald is a bald white male."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Colette Dowling 1989.jpg|thumb|Colette Dowling in 1989]]
The '''Cinderella complex''' was first described by [[Colette Dowling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cinderella Complex: Women's Hidden Fear of Independence |author=Colette Dowling |date=1981 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-73334-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote a book on women's fear of [[independence]] – an unconscious desire to be taken care of by others. The complex is said to become more apparent as a person grows older. &lt;ref&gt;Weaver, R. (2017). Psychology Behind the Cinderella Complex. Retrieved January 27, 2017, from http://www.empowher.com/mental-health/content/psychology-behind-cinderella-complex?page=0,1&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex is named after the [[fairy tale]] character [[Cinderella]]. It is based on the idea of femininity portrayed in that story, where a woman is beautiful, graceful, polite, supportive, hardworking, independent, and maligned by the females of her society, but she is not capable of changing her situations with her own actions and must be helped by an outside force, usually a male (i.e., the [[Prince Charming|Prince]]).

==Criticism==
This [[phenomenon]]  or [[syndrome]] becomes particularly significant with regard to the question of why women may choose to stay in dysfunctional relationships.&lt;ref&gt;THE CINDERELLA SYNDROME. (1981, March 21). Retrieved January 27, 2017, from https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/magazine/the-cinderella-syndrome.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense==
Others point to [[Ronald Fairbairn]]'s concept of mature dependency,&lt;ref name=v120&gt;[[Judith Viorst]] (2010) ''Necessary Losses''. Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|1439134863}}. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; to challenge cultural disparagement of dependency in favor of an ideal of isolated independence.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips (1994) ''On Flirtation''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0674634403}}. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carol Gilligan]]'s championship of a web of connections as a feminist goal,&lt;ref name=v120/&gt; rather than the solitary male hero, is also invoked to defend the Cinderella complex's tendency to define the self in terms of a mate/settled relationship.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Corsini (1999) ''A Dictionary of Psychology''. Psychology Press. {{ISBN|158391028X}}. p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

In the movie ''[[Tootsie]]'', [[Teri Garr]] tells [[Dustin Hoffman]] during their break-up at the end of the movie, "I read the Cinderella Complex, I know I'm responsible for my own orgasm! I don't care, I just don't like being lied to!" &lt;ref name="tootsie"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=[[Sydney Pollack]] (Director) | date=Dec 1, 1982 | title=Tootsie | medium=Motion picture | location=Manhattan, NY | publisher=Warner Bros, Columbia Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'' episode 4 "[[Revenge and Remorse (The Guilty Alibi)|Revenge and Remorse]]", [[Joyce Brothers]] gets advice from the shoe shine man Johnny about how to treat the Cinderella Complex: "Tell them to get in touch with their unconscious feelings and to share in the growth process with their partner"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13074">'''Code reuse''', also called '''software reuse''', is the use of existing [[software]], or software knowledge, to build new software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frakes |first=W.B. |author2=Kyo Kang |date=July 2005 |title=Software Reuse Research: Status and Future |journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=529–536 |doi=10.1109/TSE.2005.85 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/660a/9612cdc5baf70c82fa1db291ded7bef39546.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  following the [[reusability|reusability principles]].

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
[[Ad hoc]] code reuse has been practiced from the earliest days of [[computer programming|programming]]. Programmers have always reused sections of code, templates, functions, and procedures. Software reuse as a recognized area of study in software engineering, however, dates only from 1968 when [[Douglas McIlroy]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]] proposed basing the software industry on reusable components.

Code reuse aims to save time and resources and reduce redundancy by taking advantage of assets that have already been created in some form within the software product development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lombard Hill Group|title=What Is Software Reuse?|url=http://lombardhill.com/what_reuse.htm|website=lombardhill.com|publisher=Lombard Hill Group|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key idea in reuse is that parts of a [[computer program]] written at one time can be or should be used in the construction of other programs written at a later time.

Code reuse may imply the creation of a separately maintained version of the reusable assets.  While code is the most common resource selected for reuse, other assets generated during the development cycle may offer opportunities for reuse: software components, test suites, designs, documentation, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lombard Hill Group|title=What Is Software Reuse?|url=http://lombardhill.com/what_reuse.htm|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Library (computing)|software library]] is a good example of code reuse. Programmers may decide to create internal abstractions so that certain parts of their program can be reused, or may create custom libraries for their own use. Some characteristics that make software more easily reusable are [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]], [[loose coupling]], high [[Cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]], [[information hiding]] and [[separation of concerns]].

For newly written code to use a piece of existing code, some kind of interface, or means of communication, must be defined. These commonly include a "call" or use of a [[subroutine]], [[Object (computer science)|object]], [[Class (computer science)|class]], or [[Prototype-based programming|prototype]]. In organizations, such practices are formalized and standardized by [[domain engineering]], also known as [[Product Family Engineering|software product line]] engineering.

The general practice of using a prior version of an extant program as a starting point for the next version, is also a form of code reuse.

Some so-called code "reuse" involves simply copying some or all of the code from an existing program into a new one. While organizations can realize [[time to market]] benefits for a new product with this approach, they can subsequently be saddled with many of the same [[code duplication]] problems caused by [[cut and paste programming]].

Many researchers have worked to make reuse faster, easier, more systematic, and an integral part of the normal process of programming. These are some of the main goals behind the invention of [[object-oriented programming]], which became one of the most common forms of formalized reuse. A somewhat later invention is [[generic programming]].

Another, newer means is to use software "[[Source code generation|generator]]s", programs which can create new programs of a certain type, based on a set of parameters that users choose. Fields of study about such systems are [[generative programming]] and [[metaprogramming]].

==Types of reuse==
Concerning motivation and driving factors, reuse can be:
* Opportunistic – While getting ready to begin a project, the team realizes that there are existing components that they can reuse.
* Planned – A team strategically designs components so that they'll be reusable in future projects.

Reuse can be categorized further:

* Internal reuse – A team reuses its own components. This may be a business decision, since the team may want to control a component critical to the project.
* External reuse – A team may choose to license a third-party component. Licensing a third-party component typically costs the team 1 to 20 percent of what it would cost to develop internally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McConnell |first=Steve |title=Rapid Development: Taming Wild Software Schedules |year=1996 |isbn=978-1-55615-900-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team must also consider the time it takes to find, learn and integrate the component.

Concerning form or structure of reuse, code can be:&lt;ref name="sharednow.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Colombo |first=F. |year=2011 |title=It's not just reuse |work=SharedNow.blogspot |url=http://sharednow.blogspot.com/2011/05/its-not-just-reuse.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Referenced – The client code contains a reference to reused code, and thus they have distinct life cycles and can have distinct versions.
* Forked – The client code contains a local or private copy of the reused code, and thus they share a single life cycle and a single version.

Fork-reuse is often discouraged because it's a form of code duplication, which requires that every bug is corrected in each copy, and enhancements made to reused code need to be manually merged in every copy or they become out-of-date. However, fork-reuse can have benefits such as isolation, flexibility to change the reused code, easier packaging, deployment and version management.&lt;ref name="sharednow.blogspot.com"/&gt;

==Systematic==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Systematic software reuse is a strategy for increasing productivity and improving quality of the software industry. Although it is simple in concept, successful software reuse implementation is difficult in practice. A reason put forward for this is the dependence of software reuse on the context in which it is implemented. Some problematic issues that needs to be addressed related to systematic software reuse are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Champman |first=M. |last2=Van der Merwe |first2=Alta |year=2008 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1456662 |title=Contemplating Systematic Software Reuse in a Small Project-centric Company |booktitle=Proceeding SAICSIT '08 Proceedings of the 2008 annual research conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT research in developing countries: riding the wave of technology |doi=10.1145/1456659.1456662 |isbn=978-1-60558-286-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*a clear and well-defined product vision is an essential foundation to an [[Software product line|SPL]].
*an evolutionary implementation strategy would be a more pragmatic strategy for the company.
*there exist a need for continuous management support and leadership to ensure success.
*an appropriate organisational structure is needed to support SPL engineering.
*the change of mindset from a project-centric company to a product-oriented company is essential.

==Examples==

===Software libraries===

A very common example of code reuse is the technique of using a [[Library (computer science)|software library]]. Many common operations, such as converting information among different well-known formats, accessing external storage, interfacing with external programs, or manipulating information (numbers, words, names, locations, dates, etc.) in common ways, are needed by many different programs. Authors of new programs can use the code in a software library to perform these tasks, instead of "re-inventing the wheel", by writing fully new code directly in a program to perform an operation. Library implementations often have the benefit of being well-tested, and covering unusual or arcane cases. Disadvantages include the inability to tweak details which may affect performance or the desired output, and the time and cost of acquiring, learning, and configuring the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Code_reuse|title=Code reuse|access-date={{TODAY}}|work=DocForge|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710143019/http://docforge.com/wiki/Code_reuse|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design patterns===

{{main article|Design pattern (computer science)}}

A design pattern is a general solution to a recurring problem. Design patterns are more conceptual than tangible and can be modified to fit the exact need. However, abstract classes and interfaces can be reused to implement certain patterns.

===Frameworks===

{{main article|Software framework}}

Developers generally reuse large pieces of software via third-party applications and frameworks. Though frameworks are usually domain-specific and applicable only to families of applications{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.

===Higher-order function===
{{main article|Higher-order function}}
In [[functional programming]] higher-order functions can be used in many cases where design patterns or frameworks were formerly used.

===Retrocomputing===

[[Retrocomputing]] encompasses reuse of code, simply because retro programs are being run on older computers, or [[emulator]]s for them.

===Computer security===
In [[computer security]] code-reuse is employed as a software exploit method.&lt;ref name=Bletsch11&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = North Carolina State University| last = Bletsch| first = Tyler | title = Code-reuse Attacks: New Frontiers and Defenses| date = 2011 |isbn=978-1-124-75297-6 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2338075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When an attacker is not able to directly input code to modify the control flow of a program, for example in presence of code injection defenses such as [[W^X|W⊕X]], he or she can redirect the control flow to code sequences existing in memory.

Examples of code-reuse attacks are [[return-to-libc attack]], [[return-oriented programming]], and jump-oriented programming.&lt;ref name=Bletsch11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = ACM| pages = 30–40| last1 = Bletsch| first1 = Tyler| last2 = Jiang| first2 = Xuxian| last3 = Freeh| first3 = Vince W| last4 = Liang| first4 = Zhenkai| title = Jump-oriented programming: a new class of code-reuse attack| booktitle = Proceedings of the 6th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security | date = 2011 |doi=10.1145/1966913.1966919 |url=https://web.comp.nus.edu.sg/~liangzk/papers/asiaccs11.pdf |isbn=978-1-4503-0564-8 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===

{{main article|Software component}}

A component, in an object-oriented extent, represents a set of collaborative classes (or only one class) and its interfaces. The interfaces are responsible for enabling the replacement of components. Reusable components can also be isolated and synchronized between SCM repositories using component source code management technologies ([https://github.com/teambit/bit CSCM]). 

===Outside computers===
The whole concept of "code reuse" can also encompass engineering applications outside software. For instance, [[Solid modeling|parametric modeling]] in [[computer-aided design]] allows for creating reusable designs. [[Standardization]] results in creation of interoperable parts that can be then reused in many contexts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Criticism ==
Code reuse results in [[Coupling (computer programming)|dependency]] on the component being reused. [[Rob Pike]] opined that "A little copying is better than a little dependency". When he joined Google, the company was putting heavy emphasis on code reuse. He believes that Google's [[codebase]] still suffers from results of that former policy in terms of compilation speed and maintainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Go Programming Language|title=Go Proverbs – Rob Pike – Gopherfest – November 18, 2015|date=2015-12-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[engineering]], a '''corner case''' (or '''pathological case''') involves a problem or situation that occurs only outside of normal operating [[parameter]]s—specifically one that manifests itself when multiple environmental variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme levels, even though each parameter is within the specified range for that parameter.

For example, a loudspeaker might distort audio, but only when played at maximum volume, maximum [[Bass (sound)|bass]], and in a [[Humidity|high-humidity]] environment. Or a [[Server (computing)|computer server]] may be unreliable, but only with the maximum complement of 64 [[Microprocessor|processors]], 512 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[Computer memory|memory]], and 10,000 signed-on [[User (computing)|users]].

Contrast a corner case with an [[edge case]], the latter an issue that occurs only at a (single) maximum or minimum parameter. For example, a speaker may distort audio at maximum volume, even in the absence of other extreme settings or conditions.

Corner cases form part of an [[engineer]]'s lexicon—especially an engineer involved in testing or [[debugging]] a complex system. Corner cases are often harder and more expensive to reproduce, test, and optimize because they require maximal configurations in multiple dimensions. They are frequently less-tested, given the belief that few product users will, in practice, exercise the product at multiple simultaneous maximum settings. Expert users of systems therefore routinely find corner case anomalies, and in many of these, errors.

The term "corner case" comes about by physical analogy with "edge case" as an extension of the "[[flight envelope]]" metaphor to a set of testing conditions whose boundaries are determined by the 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; combinations of extreme (minimum and maximum) values for the number ''n'' of variables being tested, ''i.e.'', the total [[parameter space]] for those variables. Where an edge case involves pushing one variable to a minimum or maximum, putting users at the "edge" of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], a corner case involves doing so with multiple variables, which would put users at a "corner" of a multidimensional configuration space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/125587/what-are-the-difference-between-an-edge-case-a-corner-case-a-base-case-and-a-b|title=What are the difference between an edge case, a corner case, a base case and a boundary case?|website=Software Engineering Stack Exchange|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''death threat''' is a [[threat]], often made [[Anonymity|anonymously]], by one person or a group of people to kill another person or group of people. These threats are often designed to [[intimidate]] victims in order to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] their behaviour, and thus a death threat can be a form of [[coercion]]. For example, a death threat could be used to dissuade a public figure from pursuing a criminal investigation or an advocacy campaign.

In most jurisdictions, death threats are a serious type of [[criminal offence]]. Death threats are often covered by coercion statutes. For instance, the coercion statute in [[Alaska]] says:
{{quote|text=A person commits the crime of coercion if the person compels another to engage in conduct from which there is a legal right to abstain or abstain from conduct in which there is a legal right to engage, by means of instilling in the person who is compelled a fear that, if the demand is not complied with, the person who makes the demand or another may inflict physical injury on anyone....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touchngo.com/lglcntr/akstats/Statutes/Title11/Chapter41/Section530.htm Alaska Statute 11.41.530(a)(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Methods==
A death threat can be communicated via a wide range of media, among these letters, [[newspaper]] publications, [[telephone call]]s, [[blog|internet blogs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6499095.stm ''Blog death threats spark debate''] [[BBC News]] retrieved September 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[e-mail]]. If the threat is made against a political figure, it can also be considered [[treason]]. If a threat is against a non-living location that frequently contains living individuals (e.g. a building), it could be a [[Terrorism|terrorist threat]]. Sometimes, death threats are part of a wider campaign of abuse targeting a person or a group of people (see [[terrorism]], [[mass murder]]).

==Against a head of state==
In some [[Monarchy|monarchies]] and [[republic]]s, both democratic and authoritarian, threatening to kill the [[head of state]] and/or [[head of government]] (such as the [[sovereign]], [[Threatening the President of the United States|president]], or [[prime minister]]), is considered a crime, for which punishments vary. The United States law provides for up to five years in prison for threatening any type of [[threatening government officials of the United States|government official]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 18 U.S. Code § 871 - Threats against President and successors to the Presidency {{!}} US Law {{!}} LII / Legal Information Institute|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/871|website = www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], under the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]], it is illegal to attempt to kill or deprive the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] of his/her throne; this offense was originally punished with [[penal transportation]], and then was changed to the [[death penalty]], and currently the penalty is [[life imprisonment]].

==Osman warning, letter or notice==
Named after a high-profile case, ''[[Osman v United Kingdom]]'', these are warnings of death threat or high risk of murder that are issued by British police or legal authorities to the possible victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/2157509/Dads-death-threat-warning.html |title=Dad's death threat warning  |work=[[The Scottish Sun]] |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used when there is intelligence of the threat, but there is not enough evidence to justify the police arresting the potential murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published on Friday 13 June 2008 17:49 |url=http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/bed-news/Beds-is-one-of-nations.4185282.jp |title=Beds is one of nation's 'death-threat capitals' - News |publisher=Bedford Today |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek science==
An early attempt at demarcation can be seen in the efforts of Greek natural philosophers and medical practitioners to distinguish their methods and their accounts of nature from the mythological or mystical accounts of their predecessors and contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G. E. R. | author-link = G. E. R.

{{quote|Aristotle described at length what was involved in having scientific knowledge of something. To be scientific, he said, one must deal with causes, one must use logical demonstration, and one must identify the universals which 'inhere' in the particulars of sense. But above all, to have science one must have ''[[Apodicticity|apodictic certainty]]''. It is the last feature which, for Aristotle, most clearly distinguished the scientific way of knowing.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;|[[Larry Laudan]]|''Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis'', "The Demise of the Demarcation Problem"}}
In Charmides Plato discusses a "science of science". Although the subject in the dialogue is epistemological, it is an early version of the demarcation problem.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable secondary source.|date=August 2018}}

[[G. E. R. Lloyd]] notes that there was a sense in which the groups engaged in various forms of inquiry into nature set out to "legitimate their own positions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G. E. R. | author-link = G. E. R.

==Logical positivism==
[[Logical positivism]], formulated in the 1920s, held that only statements about matters of fact or logical relations between concepts are meaningful. All other statements lack sense and are labelled "[[Metaphysics#Rejections of metaphysics|metaphysics]]" (see [[the verifiability theory of meaning]] also known as [[verificationism]]). This distinction between science, which in the view of the [[Vienna Circle]] possessed empirically verifiable statements, and what they pejoratively called "metaphysics", which lacked such statements, can be seen as representing another aspect of the demarcation problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kYUFhlIRZA4C&amp;pg=PT97&amp;dq=demarcation+%22logical+positivism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z9n8U7vdEuKw7AbYgIG4DA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&amp;q=demarcation%20%22logical%20positivism%22&amp;f=false Grayling, AC., ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 67-68.]&lt;/ref&gt; Logical positivism is often discussed in the context of the demarcation between science and non-science or pseudoscience. However, "The verificationist proposals had the aim of solving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that between science and metaphysics."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#LogPos |at=4.1 The Logical Positivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falsifiability==
[[Falsifiability]] is the demarcation criterion proposed by [[Karl Popper]] as opposed to verificationism: "statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable observations".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#KarPop |at=4.2 Falsificationism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper saw demarcation as a central problem in the philosophy of science.  Unlike the Vienna Circle, Popper stated that his proposal was not a criterion of "meaningfulness".

{{quote|Popper's demarcation criterion has been criticized both for excluding legitimate science… and for giving some pseudosciences the status of being scientific… According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it "has the untoward consequence of countenancing as 'scientific' every crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions". Astrology, rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a pseudoscience, has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted… Similarly, the major threats to the scientific status of psychoanalysis, another of his major targets, do not come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has been tested and failed the tests.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

In Popper's later work, he stated that falsifiability is both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for demarcation. He described falsifiability as a property of "the logical structure of sentences and classes of sentences," so that a statement's scientific or non-scientific status does not change over time. This has been summarized as a statement being falsifiable "if and only if it logically contradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically possible event that it would be logically possible to observe."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

[[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued that physics only accepts theories that are sufficiently unified, this persistent preference for unity committing physics to accepting an implicit metaphysical (i.e. non-falsifiable) thesis concerning the unity of nature.  For good Popperian reasons, this implicit metaphysical thesis needs to be made explicit within physics so that it can be critically assessed and, we may hope, improved.  Popper's demarcation criterion is refuted: an unfalsifiable, metaphysical thesis is a basic tenet of scientific knowledge within physics, whether this is recognized or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1974) [http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1348844/ The Rationality of Scientific Discovery] Philosophy of Science, 41 (2) 123-153; 1998 [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press, Oxford; 2017 [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress] Paragon House, St. Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postpositivism==
[[Thomas Kuhn]], an American historian and philosopher of science, is often connected with what has been called [[postpositivism]] or [[postempiricism]]. In his 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn divided the process of doing science into two different endeavors, which he called [[normal science]] and [[extraordinary science]] (which he sometimes also called "revolutionary science"). "In Kuhn's view, 'it is normal science, in which Sir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from other enterprises'…"&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt; That is, the utility of a scientific paradigm for puzzle-solving lies in its suggesting solutions to new problems while continuing to satisfy all of the problems solved by the paradigm that it replaces.

{{quote|Kuhn's view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his comparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has been a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an astronomer's prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he could hope to solve for instance with more measurements or with adjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such puzzles since in that discipline "particular failures did not give rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make use of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological tradition"… Therefore, according to Kuhn, astrology has never been a science.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

Popper criticized Kuhn's demarcation criterion, saying that astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and that therefore Kuhn's criterion recognized astrology as a science. He stated that Kuhn's criterion leads to a "major disaster…[the] replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological one".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

==Feyerabend and Lakatos==
Kuhn's work largely called into question Popper's demarcation, and emphasized the human, [[subjectivity|subjective]] quality of scientific change. [[Paul Feyerabend]] was concerned that the very question of demarcation was insidious: science itself had no need of a demarcation criterion, but instead some philosophers were seeking to justify a special position of authority from which science could dominate public discourse.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=C.A. |last=Taylor |year=1996 |title=Defining Science: A Rhetoric of Demarcation |series=Rhetoric of the Human Sciences Series |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299150341 |lccn=96000180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdkDiqh5ySYC&amp;pg=PA41 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend argued that science does not in fact occupy a special place in terms of either its logic or method, and no claim to special authority made by scientists can be upheld. He argued that, within the history of scientific practice, no rule or method can be found that has not been violated or circumvented at some point in order to advance scientific knowledge. Both [[Imre Lakatos]] and Feyerabend suggest that science is not an autonomous form of reasoning, but is inseparable from the larger body of human thought and inquiry.

==Thagard==
[[Paul R. Thagard]] has proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties, and believes it is important for society to find a way of doing so. According to Thagard's method, a theory is not scientific if it satisfies two conditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH29A/thagard.html ''Why Astrology Is A Pseudoscience''], [[Paul R. Thagard]], In Philosophy of Science Association 1978 Volume 1, edited by P.D. Asquith and I. Hacking (East Lansing: Philosophy of Science Association, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;
# The theory has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; and...
# The community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.

Thagard specifies that sometimes theories will spend some time as merely "unpromising" before they truly deserve the title of pseudoscience. He cites astrology as an example: it was stagnant compared to advances in physics during the 17th century, and only later became "pseudoscience" in the advent of alternative explanations provided by psychology during the 19th century.

Thagard also states that his criteria should not be interpreted so narrowly as to allow willful [[ignorance]] of alternative explanations, or so broadly as to discount our modern science compared to science of the future. His definition is a practical one, which generally seeks to distinguish pseudoscience as areas of inquiry which are stagnant and without active scientific investigation.

==Some historians' perspectives==
Many historians of science are concerned with the development of science from its primitive origins; consequently they define science in sufficiently broad terms to include early forms of natural knowledge.  In the article on science in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh edition]] of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the scientist and historian [[William Cecil Dampier Whetham]] defined science as "ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dampier Whetham | first = William Cecil | author-link = William Cecil Dampier Whetham | publication-date = 1911 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | contribution = Science | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-place = New York | url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his study of Greek science, [[Marshall Clagett]] defined science as "first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clagett | first = Marshall | author-link = Marshall Clagett
| publication-date = 1963 | title = Greek Science in Antiquity | publisher = Collier Books | publication-place = New York | page = 4 | isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar definition appeared more recently in [[David Pingree]]'s study of early science: "Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation.  Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pingree | first = David | author-link = David Pingree | year = 1992 | title = Hellenophilia versus the History of Science | journal = Isis | volume  = 83 | pages = 554–563 | doi=10.1086/356288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These definitions tend to focus more on the subject matter of science than on its method and from these perspectives, the philosophical concern to establish a line of demarcation between science and non-science becomes "problematic, if not futile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | editor-last = Fountain | editor-first = John W. | editor2-last = Sinclair | editor2-first = Rolf M. | publication-date = 2005 | title = Current Studies in Archaeoastronomy: Conversations Across Time and Space | chapter = Different Astronomies, Different Cultures and the Question of Cultural Relativism | publisher = Carolina Academic Press | publication-place = Durham, NC | page = 71 | isbn = 0-89089-771-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laudan==
[[Larry Laudan]] concluded, after examining various historical attempts to establish a demarcation criterion, that "philosophy has failed to deliver the goods" in its attempts to distinguish science from non-science—to distinguish science from pseudoscience.  None of the past attempts would be accepted by a majority of philosophers nor, in his view, should they be accepted by them or by anyone else.  He stated that many well-founded beliefs are not scientific and, conversely, many scientific conjectures are not well-founded.  He also stated that demarcation criteria were historically used as {{lang|fr|machines de guerre}} in polemical disputes between "scientists" and "pseudo-scientists."  Advancing a number of examples from everyday practice of football and carpentry and non-scientific scholarship such as literary criticism and philosophy, he saw the question of whether a belief is well-founded or not to be more practically and philosophically significant than whether it is scientific or not.  In his judgment, the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem that would best be replaced by focusing on the distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge, without bothering to ask whether that knowledge is scientific or not.  He would consign phrases like "pseudo-science" or "unscientific" to the rhetoric of politicians or sociologists.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;

Others have disagreed with Laudan. Sebastian Lutz, for example, argues that demarcation does not have to be a single necessary and sufficient condition as Laudan implied.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;  Rather, Laudan's reasoning at the most establishes that there has to be one necessary criterion and one possibly different sufficient criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lutz |first=Sebastian |title=On an Allegedly Essential Feature of Criteria for the Demarcation of Science |journal=The Reasoner |pages=125–126 |volume=5 |number=8 |year=2011 |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5(8).pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109143743/http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5%288%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have argued for multiple demarcation criteria suggesting that there should be one set of criteria for the natural sciences; another set of criteria for the social sciences, and claims involving the supernatural could have a set of pseudoscientific criteria. [[Massimo Pigliucci]] wrote that science generally conforms to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s concept of [[family resemblance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci, Massimo]] (2013). "The Demarcation Problem: A (Belated) Response to Laudan" in Pigliucci, Massimo; [[Maarten Boudry|Boudry, Maarten]], eds. ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem'' chapter 1.  {{ISBN|978-0-226-05196-3}}. Pigliucci's chapter is available online at http://philpapers.org/rec/PIGTDP.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Concerning [[science education]], Michael D. Gordin wrote:&lt;ref name=Gordin&gt;Michael D. Gordin (2015) "Myth 27. That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience", in ''Newton’s Apple and other Myths about Science'', [[Ronald L. Numbers]] editor, [[Harvard University Press]] {{doi|10.4159/9780674089167-029}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220}}
:Every student in public or private takes several years of science, but only a small fraction of them pursue careers in the sciences. We teach the rest of them so much science so that they will appreciate what it ''means'' to be scientific – and, hopefully, become scientifically literate and apply some of those lessons in their lives. For such students, the myth of a bright line of demarcation is essential.
Discussions of the demarcation problem highlight the [[rhetoric of science]] and promote [[critical thinking]]. Citizens thinking critically, and expressing themselves with reasoned argument in [[public policy|policy discussion]], contribute to enlightened democracy. For example, Gordin stated
:Demarcation remains essential for the enormously high political stakes of climate-change denial and other anti-regulatory fringe doctrines.&lt;ref name=Gordin/&gt;{{rp|225}}
The demarcation problem has been compared to the problem of differentiating [[fake news]] from real news, which rose to prominence in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=LeVine |first=Michael V |title=Science has experience fighting fake news — and Facebook should take note |url=https://mic.com/articles/161376/science-has-experience-fighting-fake-news-and-facebook-should-take-note#.m62pUua8z |year=2016 |journal=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eternal return''' (also known as '''eternal recurrence''') is a theory that the [[universe]] and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a [[self-similar]] form an [[infinity|infinite]] number of times across infinite time or space.
The theory is found in [[Indian philosophy]] and in [[ancient Egypt]] and was subsequently taken up by the [[Pythagoreans]] and [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoics]. With the decline of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the spread of [[Christianity]], the theory fell into disuse in the [[Western world]], with the exception of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who connected the thought to many of his other concepts, including ''[[amor fati]]''. Eternal return is based on the philosophy of pre-determinism in that people are predestined to continue repeating the same events over and over again.

==Premise==
The basic premise proceeds from the assumption that the [[probability]] of a world coming into existence exactly like our own is nonzero. If [[space]] and time are infinite, then it follows logically that our existence must recur an infinite number of times.&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark M., "Parallel universes". Sci. Am. 2003 May; 288(5):40–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], assuming a Newtonian cosmology where time and space are infinite, claimed to have demonstrated eternal recurrence as a mathematical certainty.&lt;ref&gt;

== Classical antiquity ==

[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scarabaeus sacer|Scarab]] on a [[fresco]].]]

In [[ancient Egypt]], the scarab ([[dung beetle]]) was viewed as a sign of eternal renewal and reemergence of life, a reminder of the life to come. (See also [[Atum]] and [[Ma'at]].)

The [[Maya calendar#Maya concepts of time|Mayans]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] also took a cyclical view of time.

In [[ancient Greece]], the concept of eternal return was connected with [[Empedocles]], [[Zeno of Citium]], and most notably in [[Stoicism]] (see [[ekpyrosis]]).

== Indian religions ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=February 2018}}
{{See also|End time in Indian religions}}
The concept of cyclical patterns is prominent in [[Indian religions]], such as [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] among others. The important distinction is that events don't repeat endlessly but souls take birth until they attain salvation. The [[Bhavacakra|wheel of life]] represents an endless cycle of birth, life, and death from which one seeks liberation.  In [[Tantric Buddhism]], a [[wheel of time]] concept known as the [[Kalachakra]] expresses the idea of an endless cycle of existence and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;!--linked from 'Amor fati'--&gt; ==
The concept of "eternal recurrence", the idea that with infinite time and a finite number of events, events will recur again and again infinitely, is central to the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.lmu.edu/tshanahan/Nietzsche-Eternal_Recurrence.html&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence, in aphorism 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (cited below), presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.' "&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thought of eternal recurrence appears in a few of his works, in particular §285 and §341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' and then in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The most complete treatment of the subject appears in the work entitled ''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'', a work which was published in 2007 alongside [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s own version of eternal return, which he calls 'repetition'. Nietzsche sums up his thought most succinctly when he addresses the reader with: "Everything has returned. Sirius,  and the spider, and thy thoughts at this moment, and this last thought of thine that all things will return". However, he also expresses his thought at greater length when he says to his reader:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet here for the first time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us, and let me tell thee something of the thought which has suddenly risen before me like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as befits the nature of light. - Fellow man! Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'' - Vol. 16 of Oscar Levy Edition of Nietzsche's Complete Works (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This thought is indeed also noted in a posthumous fragment.&lt;ref&gt;1881 (11 [143])&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this thought is dated by Nietzsche himself, via posthumous fragments, to August 1881, at [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils-Maria]]. In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' (1888), he wrote that he thought of the eternal return as the "fundamental conception" of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, [[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]], "Why I Write Such Good Books", "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Am Stein der Ewigen Wiederkunft.JPG|thumb|Scene of Nietzsche's inspiration: „by a massive, pyramidally piled up block not far from [[Surlej|Surlei]]“.]]

Several authors have pointed out other occurrences of this hypothesis in contemporary thought. [[Rudolf Steiner]], who revised the first catalogue of Nietzsche's personal library in January 1896, pointed out that Nietzsche would have read something similar in [[Eugen Dühring]]'s ''Courses on philosophy'' (1875), which Nietzsche readily criticized. [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]] pointed out that Nietzsche referred to ancient cyclical conceptions of time, in particular by the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], in the ''Untimely Meditations''. [[Henri Lichtenberger]] and [[Charles Andler]] have pinpointed three works contemporary to Nietzsche which carried on the same hypothesis: J.G. Vogt, ''Die Kraft. Eine real-monistische Weltanschauung'' (1878), [[Auguste Blanqui]], ''[http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/blanqui_louis_auguste/eternite_par_les_astres/eternite_.html L'éternité par les astres]'' (1872) and [[Gustave Le Bon]], ''L'homme et les sociétés'' (1881). [[Walter Benjamin]] juxtaposes Blanqui and Nietzsche's discussion of eternal recurrence in his unfinished, monumental work ''[[The Arcades Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Benjamin]]. ''The Arcades Project''. Trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin. Cambridge: Belknap-Harvard, 2002. See chapter D, "Boredom Eternal Return," pp. 101-119.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gustave Le Bon is not quoted anywhere in Nietzsche's manuscripts; and Auguste Blanqui was named only in 1883. Vogt's work, on the other hand, was read by Nietzsche during this summer of 1881 in Sils-Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116044517/http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn/catalogues.html |title=revision of previous catalogues }} on the [[École Normale Supérieure]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; Blanqui is mentioned by [[Albert Lange]] in his ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]'' (History of Materialism), a book closely read by Nietzsche.&lt;ref name=Fouillee&gt;Alfred Fouillée, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Note_sur_Nietzsche_et_Lange_:_%C2%AB_le_retour_%C3%A9ternel_%C2%BB "Note sur Nietzsche et Lange: le "retour éternel"], in ''Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger''. An. 34. Paris 1909. T. 67, S. 519-525 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The eternal recurrence is also mentioned in passing by the Devil in Part Four, Book XI, Chapter 9 of Dostoevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is another possible source that Nietzsche may have been drawing upon.

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered this idea in the works of [[Heinrich Heine]], who once wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite. They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them is also determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again...&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche; Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist.'' 1959, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche calls the idea "horrifying and paralyzing",{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} referring to it as a burden of the "heaviest weight" ("''das schwerste Gewicht''")&lt;ref&gt;Kundera, Milan. ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being''. 1999, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; imaginable.  He professes that the wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.{{'}} [''[[The Gay Science]]'', §341]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate":&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;Dudley, Will. ''Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom''. 2002, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for human greatness is ''amor fati'': that one wants to have nothing different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely to bear the necessary, still less to conceal it—all idealism is mendaciousness before the necessary—but to ''love'' it.&lt;ref name=dudl /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Carl Jung's seminar on ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Jung claims that the dwarf states the idea of the eternal return before Zarathustra finishes his argument of the eternal return when the dwarf says, "'Everything straight lies,' murmured the dwarf disdainfully.  'All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.'" However, Zarathustra rebuffs the dwarf in the following paragraph, warning him against over-simplifications.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve, M. (2015). The Gay Science and the Rosarium Philosophorum. Agathos, 6(2), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albert Camus ==
The philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] explores the notion of "eternal return" in his essay on "The Myth of Sisyphus", in which the repetitive nature of existence comes to represent life's absurdity, something the hero seeks to withstand through manifesting what [[Paul Tillich]] called "The Courage to Be".  Though the task of rolling the stone repeatedly up the hill without end is inherently meaningless, the challenge faced by Sisyphus is to refrain from despair.  Hence Camus famously concludes that, "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."

== Opposing argument ==

Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has described an argument originally put forward by [[Georg Simmel]], which rebuts the claim that a finite number of states must repeat within an infinite amount of time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even if there were exceedingly few things in a finite space in an infinite time, they would not have to repeat in the same configurations. Suppose there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist''. (Fourth Edition)  Princeton University Press, 1974. p327&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus a system could have an infinite number of distinct physical configurations that never recur. However the example presupposes the possibility of perfect continuity: for instance, if the universe proves to have a [[quantum foam]] nature, then the exact quantity of an irrational number cannot be expressed by any physical object.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

'''Eyes Wide Open''' is an exhibit created by the [[American Friends Service Committee]] observing the [[United States|American]] soldiers and marines that have died in the [[Iraq War]]. It contains a pair of [[combat boot]]s to represent every American soldier and marine that has died in the war, as well as shoes representing [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] civilians who have lost their lives during the invasion and occupation. The exhibit was first shown in [[Chicago]]'s Federal Plaza in January 2004. At that time, the exhibit contained 504 pairs of boots.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/eyes/about-the-exhibit.htm|title=About the Exhibit|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=American Friends Service Committee|accessdate=2016-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816083202/https://www.afsc.org/eyes/about-the-exhibit.htm|archivedate=August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2007, the national exhibit contained over 3,400 pairs of boots and had visited more than 100 cities in 40 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/eyes/locations/main.htm|title=See where we've been|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=American Friends Service Committee|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816083220/https://www.afsc.org/eyes/locations/main.htm|archivedate=August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as a result of its unmanageable size, the exhibit has been broken down state-by-state. Currently,  nearly every state has its own state exhibit.  The national exhibit in its entirety would currently contain more than 4,000 pairs of empty boots.

==Background==
According to the [[American Friends Service Committee]], the intent of the exhibit is to present a visual reminder of the "human cost" of the [[Iraq War]] and provide a place for public mourning.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Based on public information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icasualties.org/oif/|title=Iraq Coalition Casualty Count|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=iCasualties.org|access-date=|accessdate=August 24, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822212648/http://icasualties.org/oif/|archivedate=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Friends Service Committee writes the name, age, rank and home state of each soldier and attaches it to a representative pair of boots. As the exhibit travels across the country, family members, friends and sympathizers leave flags, flowers and other mementos with individual pairs of boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garofoli |first=Joe |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/03/26/BAGTBBV26U1.DTL |title=SAN FRANCISCO / Empty boots are silent testament to war's toll / Each pair in exhibit represents soldier who died in Iraq |website=SFGate.com |date=2005-03-26 |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a family wishes to have their child's name removed from the exhibit, AFSC will replace the serviceman's name with the information "name removed request of family". [[September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows|September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows]] co-sponsors the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/article.php?id=515|title=Peaceful Tomorrows &amp; Eyes Wide Open|last=|first=|date=2005-03-21|website=|publisher=September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607220645/http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/article.php?id=515|archivedate=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to boots representing the deaths of service men and women, AFSC has collected shoes representing Iraqis who have lost their lives during occupation. Few names of Iraqi dead are known. Raed Jarrar, an Iraqi social activist, has collected the names of several thousand Iraqi civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raedinthemiddle.blogspot.com/ |title=Blogger |website=Raedinthemiddle.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the names that appear on tags of civilian shoes at ''Eyes Wide Open'' exhibits and for another exhibit entitled, "Dreams and Nightmares". AFSC’s  Dreams and Nightmares is a memorial to Iraqi civilians that includes photographs and stories of individuals who have lost their lives during occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/eyes/dreams-and-nightmares.htm|title=Dreams and Nightmares|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=American Friends Service Committee|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815205238/https://www.afsc.org/eyes/dreams-and-nightmares.htm|archivedate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related exhibits==
Since the inauguration of the original exhibit, several other exhibits have been created to assist in the original one's goal.

===Eyes Wide Open State Exhibits ===
The national exhibit had grown so large by spring of 2007 that it had become difficult to transport by semi-truck. As a result, it has been divided into state exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/eyes/chicago-three-years.htm|title=Experience Eyes Wide Open|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=American Friends Service Committee|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816085033/https://www.afsc.org/eyes/chicago-three-years.htm|archivedate=August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illinois]] established the first state exhibit in August 2006. As of July 2008, there are 48 state exhibits: [[Alabama]], [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[Arkansas]], two in [[California]], [[Colorado]],  [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[District of Columbia]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Hawaii]], [[Idaho]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]],  [[Maryland]], [[Maine]]/[[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]]/[[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]]/[[New Jersey]], [[North Carolina]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], [[Vermont]], [[Virginia]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/eyes/states.php|title=Eyes Wide Open State Exhibits|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=American Friends Service Committee|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114130156/https://www.afsc.org/eyes/states.php|archivedate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the conclusion of the national exhibit, all but six states currently have their own exhibit. All of the ''Eyes Wide Open'' state exhibits continue to be under the leadership of The American Friends Service Committee.

===The National Guard Exhibit ===
The National Guard Exhibit was created in summer of 2005 and contains 400+ pairs of boots for [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] soldiers that have lost their lives in Iraq. The exhibit often also displays the boots of all soldiers lost from the exhibition state. In addition, the exhibit contains 50 pairs of civilian shoes representing the Iraqi civilians killed during occupation. The exhibit has visited more than 30 cities in 22 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=An Exhibit on the Human Cost of the War |url=http://www.afsc.org/eyes |title=Eyes Wide Open &amp;#124; AFSC @afsc_org |website=Afsc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Guard units are not often sent abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arng.army.mil/AboutUs.aspx|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Army National Guard|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720122000/http://www.arng.army.mil/AboutUs.aspx|archivedate=July 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of War Exhibit ===
At the conclusion of the National Eyes Wide Open Exhibit in June 2007, AFSC introduced the [[Cost of War]] Exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/cost/ |title=Cost of War &amp;#124; AFSC @afsc_org |website=Afsc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Exhibit contains ten 7 by 3 foot vinyl, full-color banners that compare the U.S. budget for the War in Iraq to the U.S. budget for human needs such as health care and education.  Based on a report by economists [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Linda Bilmes]], one day of the Iraq War costs the U.S. $720 million or $500,000 per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=832646 |title=The Economic Costs of the Iraq War: An Appraisal Three Years after the Beginning of the Conflict by Linda Bilmes, Joseph E. Stiglitz :: SSRN |doi=10.2139/ssrn.832646 |website=Papers.ssrn.com |date=2006-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In partnership with The National Priorities Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpriorities.org/tradeoffs|title=Bring the Federal Budget Home|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Priorities Project|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714054943/http://www.nationalpriorities.org/tradeoffs|archivedate=July 14, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFSC has used these numbers on the daily cost of the Iraq War to determine how many human services one day of the Iraq War budget could cover.  For example, "one day of the Iraq War" would buy 1,153,846 children school lunches for a year or provide 163,525 adults with full health coverage for one year.  This exhibit is either shown alone or in conjunction with Eyes Wide Open Exhibits.  There are currently 17 Cost of War Exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.afsc.org/eyes/ |title=Eyes Wide Open &amp;#124; AFSC @afsc_org |website=Afsc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addition of a veteran suicide component ===
Alarming studies of the suicide rate among veterans returning from the Iraq War led to the addition of a Veteran Suicide component to several state exhibits.  Veteran suicides are considered a "hidden casualty count" of the Iraq War and are represented by white combat boots.

==Exhibit in popular media==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:EWO logo.jpg|250px|right]] --&gt;
The exhibit was featured in [[blues]] musician [[Robert Cray]]’s music video for "Twenty". The song "Twenty" tells the story of a fictional serviceman who returns to The U.S. haunted by his experience in Iraq. The video stars an actual Iraq War veteran, 23-year-old Aidan Delgado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.nestor.minsk.by/jazz/news/2006/02/0807.html |title=Robert Cray's Music Video 'Twenty' |website=Home.nestor.minsk.by |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cray did not know of the ''Eyes Wide Open'' exhibit when he came up with the concept for the song, but realized that the exhibit would be a meaningful way for the character in his song to come to terms with the death he faced in Iraq. Robert Cray’s album, also titled "Twenty" was nominated for a [[Grammy]] as Best Contemporary Blues Album of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afsc.org/video/robert-cray-twenty|title=Robert Cray - Twenty|date=2010-04-06|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fundamental theorem of poker''' is a principle first articulated by [[David Sklansky]] that he believes expresses the essential nature of [[poker]] as a [[game]] of [[decision-making]] in the face of [[incomplete information]]. 

{{Cquote|Every time you play a hand differently from the way you would have played it if you could see all your opponents' cards, they gain; and every time you play your hand the same way you would have played it if you could see all their cards, they lose. Conversely, every time opponents play their hands differently from the way they would have if they could see all your cards, you gain; and every time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they could see all your cards, you lose.}}

The fundamental theorem is stated in common language, but its formulation is based on mathematical reasoning. Each decision that is made in poker can be analyzed in terms of the [[expected value]] of the payoff of a decision. The correct decision to make in a given situation is the decision that has the largest expected value. If a player could see all of their opponents' cards, they would always be able to calculate the correct decision with mathematical certainty, and the less they deviate from these correct decisions, the better their expected long-term results. This is certainly true [[poker jargon#H|heads-up]], but [[Morton's theorem]], in which an opponent's correct decision can benefit a player, may apply in multi-way pots. 

In probabilistic terms, this is an application of the [[law of total expectation]].

==An example==
Suppose Bob is playing limit [[Texas hold 'em]] and is dealt '''9♣ 9♠''' [[poker jargon#under_the_gun|under the gun]] before the [[flop (poker)|flop]]. He [[Call (poker)|calls]], and everyone else [[Fold (poker)|folds]] to Carol in the [[big blind]] who [[Check (poker)|checks]]. The flop comes '''A♣ &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;K♦ 10♦&lt;/span&gt;''', and Carol bets.

Bob now has a decision to make based upon incomplete information. In this particular circumstance, the correct decision is almost certainly to fold. There are too many [[Turn cards|turn]] and [[river cards]] that could kill his hand. Even if Carol does not have an '''A''' or a '''K''', there are 3 cards to a [[Straight (poker)|straight]] and 2 cards to a [[Flush (poker)|flush]] on the flop, and she could easily be on a straight or flush [[Draw (poker)|draw]]. Bob is essentially drawing to 2 [[Out (poker)|outs]] (another '''9'''), and even if he catches one of these outs, his set may not hold up.

However, suppose Bob knew (with 100% certainty) that Carol held '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;8♦ 7♦&lt;/span&gt;'''. In this case, it would be correct to [[Raise (poker)|''raise'']]. Even though Carol would still be getting the correct [[pot odds]] to call, the best decision for Bob is to raise. Therefore, by folding (or even calling), Bob has played his hand differently from the way he would have played it if he could see his opponent's cards, and so by the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, his opponent has gained. Bob has made a "mistake", in the sense that he has played differently from the way he would have played if he knew Carol held '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;8♦ 7♦&lt;/span&gt;''', even though this "mistake" is almost certainly the best decision given the incomplete information available to him.

This example also illustrates that one of the most important goals in poker is to induce the opponents to make mistakes. In this particular hand, Carol has practiced deception by employing a [[semi-bluff]] &amp;mdash; she has bet a hand, hoping Bob will fold, but she still has outs even if he calls or raises. Carol has induced Bob to make a mistake.

==Multi-way pots and implicit collusion==
The Fundamental Theorem of Poker applies to all [[poker jargon#H|heads-up]] decisions, but it does not apply to all multi-way decisions. This is because each opponent of a player can make an incorrect decision, but the "collective decision" of all the opponents works against the player.

This type of situation occurs mostly in games with multi-way pots, when a player has a strong hand, but several opponents are chasing with [[Draw (poker)|draws]] or other weaker hands. Also, a good example is a player with a deep stack making a play that favors a [[Poker glossary#short stack|short-stacked]] opponent because he can extract more [[expected value]] from the other deep-stacked opponents. Such a situation is sometimes referred to as [[Morton's theorem|implicit collusion]]. 

The Fundamental Theorem of Poker is simply expressed and appears axiomatic, yet its proper application to the countless varieties of circumstances that a poker player may face requires a great deal of knowledge, skill, and experience.

'''Harriet Maxwell Converse''' (née, '''Harriet Arnot Maxwell'''; [[Seneca language|Seneca clan]] name, '''Gayaneshaoh'''; Seneca tribal name, '''Ya-ih-wah-non''' or '''Gaiiwanoh'''; 11 January 1836 - 18 November 1903) was an American author of Scottish and Irish heritage. She was a [[folklorist]], poet and historian of the Iroquois; by the late 19th century, they were a loose confederacy of six nations in New York State and Canada. She became an advocate for the rights of the Seneca and other Iroquois tribes in New York state, helping them retain their lands and preserve their culture. In recognition of her contributions, the Seneca made her a member of the tribe and gave her an honorary position as a [[sachem]] or chief of the Six Nations.&lt;ref name="conversebio"&gt;[{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=James|first1=Edward T.|last2=James|first2=Janet Wilson|last3=Boyer|first3=Paul S.|title=Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&amp;pg=PA375|year=1971|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=375–376|isbn=978-0-674-62734-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an appropriation in 1897 from the New York State Museum, Converse made extensive purchases of Iroquois artifacts from private collectors and tribes to have them preserved by the state. She also donated a family collection that was a century old. She persuaded the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] to transfer their collection of historic wampum belts of the Five Nations to the state museum for preservation.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

==Early years==
Harriet Arnot Maxwell was born in [[Elmira, New York]], in 1836, daughter of [[Thomas Maxwell]] and Maria (Purdy) Maxwell. Her father had a concern for Native Americans in New York State and was active in politics; he was elected and served in office at the county, state and federal level, being elected as a Congressman. He later became vice-president of the [[Erie Railroad]]. Her mother was a woman of culture and education. Her paternal grandfather, [[Guy Maxwell]], had been an Indian trader in Virginia and New York, moving to Elmira in the late 18th century after the United States achieved independence. Both men had been adopted by the Seneca to honor them.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Biography of Harriet Maxwell Converse|url=https://www.pbs.org/warrior/content/bio/converse.html|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother Maria died when Harriet was nine, and her father sent the girl to live with relatives in [[Milan, Ohio]]. There she attended public school.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=200}}

==Career==
Converse entered a larger public life after her second marriage. After she and her husband traveled, in the late 1860s they happened to meet [[Ely S. Parker]] in New York City. He was a Seneca who had become an engineer and served with General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the American Civil War. He was highly influential in the Seneca Nation and in New York politics.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

Harriet Converse became increasingly involved in learning about the Seneca, with Parker's help. She became inspired to defend the rights of the Iroquois by aiding them politically with her wealth and support, and helped to preserve their culture.

In 1885 Converse was formally adopted by the Snipe Clan ia Seneca family.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

In 1883 she published her first volume of poems, ''Sheaves'' ([[New York City]], 1883), which passed through several editions. She also wrote an ode ''The Ho-de-no-sau-nee: The Confederacy of the Iroquois'' (1884).

Converse was a productive writer of non-fiction, contributing to several magazines and newspapers. Among her works are the historical volumes, ''The Religious Festivals of the Iroquois Indians'' and ''Mythology and Folk Lore of the North American Indians.''{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=201}} These have been criticized as being sentimental accounts.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

In 1891 Converse was a member of a delegation to [[Albany, New York]] to oppose the Whipple Bill before the [[New York State Assembly]]; it was designed to force the distribution of communal land in allotments to individual heads of households, along the lines of the federal [[Dawes Act]] to extinguish Indian land claims. It was an action designed to assimilate the Iroquois to subsistence farming in the European-American model and force a break-up of their reservations in the state. She helped achieve its defeat in committee. Converse had been invited by the Iroquois to sit in their Six-Nation Council held in Albany.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;  No white woman except [[Mary Jemison]], who had been adopted and assimilated by the Seneca as a young woman after being taken captive in a raid, had ever been honored in this way.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt; Most of the Iroquois had been forced from the area during and after the American Revolutionary War, as four of the Six Nations had allied with the British in the hopes of pushing out the Anglo-American settlers.

After the bill was defeated, the Seneca National Council convened at [[Carrollton, New York|Carrollton]], in the [[Allegany Reservation]]. During this 1891 session, members moved to make Converse an official member of the Seneca Nation as an honor, naming her ''Ya-ie-wa-noh,'' after the wife of their notable chief [[Cornplanter]]. The motion was passed by the Council. In 1892 the Onondaga Nation "raised her up" to the position of [[sachem]], to take the place of one who had died, and she was considered an honorary chief of the Six Nations.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

Among her most important work was Converse's purchases and donations to preserve Iroquois artifacts; many are held today by the [[New York State Museum]] in Albany and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. In 1897 she was given an appropriation to buy from private collectors and tribes; she also donated her family's collection, which had items that were a century old. She also persuaded the Onondaga to have the NY State Museum made the repository for their historic collection of wampum belts of the Five Nations.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

In 1902 Converse publicized her opposition to a federal bill in both New York City and Washington, DC, and helped achieve its defeat. It would have required the Seneca to pay a crushing $200,000 to settle a claim by the [[Ogden Land Company]], over an early 19th-century transaction.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Harriet Maxwell married George B. Clarke in Ohio, who was a part owner of the Congress Spring in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. He died relatively young. Inheriting his estate as well as from her father in 1864, who was vice-president of the [[Erie Railroad]] before his death, left her independently wealthy. In 1861 the widow Clarke had married again, to Franklin Buchanan Converse, whom she knew from childhood. He was a musician, inventor and writer. She had no children from either marriage. The couple traveled extensively for several years.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

The '''history of feminism''' comprises the narratives ([[chronology|chronological]] or thematic) of the [[Feminist movement|movements]] and [[Feminist theory|ideologies]] which have aimed at [[Feminism and equality|equal]] [[Women's rights|rights for women]]. While [[feminism| feminists]] around the world have differed in causes, goals, and intentions depending on time, [[culture]], and country, most [[Western culture | Western]] feminist historians assert that all [[social movement | movements]] that work to obtain [[women's rights]] should be considered{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} [[feminist movement]]s, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves.&lt;ref name="Walters2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinnaird" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen01101999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolf1989" /&gt; Some other historians limit the term "feminist" to the [[modern feminism | modern feminist movement]] and its progeny, and use the label "[[protofeminist]]" to describe earlier movements.&lt;ref name="Botting" /&gt;

Modern Western feminist history is conventionally split into three time periods, or "waves", each with slightly different aims based on prior progress:&lt;ref name="Humm"&gt;{{citation | last = Humm | first = Maggie | contribution = wave (definition) | editor-last = Humm | editor-first = Maggie | title = The dictionary of feminist theory | page = 251 | publisher = Ohio State University Press | location = Columbus | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780814205075 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker1992"&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Rebecca | first1 = Walker | authorlink1 = Rebecca Walker | editor-last= | editor-first = | editor-link=/February | title = Becoming the Third Wave|magazine= [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]] | issue = | pages = 39–41 | location = New York | publisher = Liberty Media for Women | issn = 0047-8318 | oclc = 194419734 |date= January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[First-wave feminism]] of the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on overturning legal inequalities, particularly addressing issues of [[women's suffrage]]
* [[Second-wave feminism]] (1960s–1980s) broadened debate to include [[Culture| cultural]] inequalities, [[Gender role| gender norms]], and the role of women in [[society]]
* [[Third-wave feminism]] (1990s–2000s) refers to diverse strains of feminist activity, seen{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} both as a continuation of the second wave and as a response to its perceived failures&lt;ref name="Suffragettes to Grrls"&gt;Krolokke, Charlotte and Anne Scott Sorensen, "From Suffragettes to Grrls" in ''Gender Communication Theories and Analyses: From Silence to Performance'' (Sage, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the "waves" construct has been commonly used to describe the history of feminism, the concept has also been criticized{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} for ignoring and erasing the history between the "waves", by choosing to focus solely on a few famous figures and on popular events.&lt;ref name='Feminism in "Waves": Useful or Not?'&gt;

People and activists who discuss or advance women's equality prior to the existence of the [[feminist movement]] are sometimes labeled as ''protofeminist''.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; Some scholars criticize this term because they believe it diminishes the importance of earlier contributions or that feminism does not have a single, linear history as implied by terms such as ''protofeminist'' or ''postfeminist''.&lt;ref name="Allen01101999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cott name"&gt;Cott, Nancy F.

== {{Anchor|18th century}} 18th century: the Age of Enlightenment ==
The [[Age of Enlightenment]] was characterized by secular intellectual reasoning and a flowering of philosophical writing. Many Enlightenment philosophers defended the rights of women, including [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1781), [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1790), and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1792).&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, Claire. ''The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft''. 144–155. Rev. ed. 1974. New York: Penguin, 1992. {{ISBN|0-14-016761-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important writers of the time that expressed feminist views included [[Abigail Adams]], [[Catharine Macaulay]],{{Sfn|Walters|2005|p=30}} and [[Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht]].

=== Jeremy Bentham ===
The English [[utilitarian]] and [[classical liberal]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose the career of a reformist at the age of eleven. Bentham spoke for complete equality between sexes including the rights to vote and to participate in government. He opposed the asymmetrical sexual moral standards between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Williford, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709019 Bentham on the rights of Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' (1781), Bentham strongly condemned many countries' common practice to deny women's rights due to allegedly inferior minds.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;Miriam Williford, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709019 Bentham on the rights of Women], ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham gave many examples of able female [[regent]]s.

=== Marquis de Condorcet ===
[[Nicolas de Condorcet]] was a mathematician, classical liberal politician, leading [[French Revolution]]ary, republican, and [[Voltaire]]an [[anti-clerical]]ist. He was also a fierce defender of [[human rights]], including the equality of women and the [[Abolitionism in France|abolition of slavery]], unusual for the 1780s. He advocated for [[women's suffrage]] in the new government in 1790 with ''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cité'' (''For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women'') and an article for ''Journal de la Société de 1789''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1013&amp;Itemid=99999999 Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship] (1790), The First Essay on the Political Rights of Women. A Translation of Condorcet’s Essay “Sur l’admission des femmes aux droits de Cité” (On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship). By Dr. Alice Drysdale Vickery (with preface and remarks) (Letchworth: Garden City Press, 1912).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Williams,"Condorcet, Feminism, and the Egalitarian Principle."

''Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century'' 189 (1980): 314+&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olympe de Gouges and ''A Declaration'' ===
{{Main|Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen|Olympe de Gouges}}Following de Condorcet's repeated, yet failed, appeals to the National Assembly in 1789 and 1790, Olympe de Gouges (in association with the Society of the Friends of Truth) authored and published the ''Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen'' in 1791. This was another plea for the French Revolutionary government to recognize the natural and political rights of women.&lt;ref&gt;"LES DROITS DE LA FEMME - Olympe de Gouges". ''www.olympedegouges.eu''. Retrieved 2015-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; De Gouges wrote the ''Declaration'' in the prose of the ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen'', almost mimicking the failure of men to include more than a half of the French population in ''egalité''. Even though,the ''Declaration'' did not immediately accomplish its goals, it did set a precedent for a manner in which feminists could satirize their governments for their failures in equality, seen in documents such as ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' and ''A Declaration of Sentiments''.&lt;ref&gt;Carla Hesse, ''The Other Enlightenment: How French Women Became Modern''(2001), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wollstonecraft and ''A Vindication'' ===
{{Main|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Mary Wollstonecraft}}
[[File:Wollstonecraft-right-of-woman.jpg|thumb|right|First edition print of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'']]
Perhaps the most cited feminist writer of the time was [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], often characterized as the first feminist philosopher. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) is one of the first works that can unambiguously be called feminist, although by modern standards her comparison of women to the nobility, the elite of society (coddled, fragile, and in danger of intellectual and moral sloth) may at first seem dated as a feminist argument. Wollstonecraft identified the education and upbringing of women as creating their limited expectations based on a self-image dictated by the typically male perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Meena. Women in Romanticism: Mary Wollstonecraft, Dorothy Wordsworth, and Mary Shelley. NY: Rowman and Littlefield (1989), 40&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her perceived inconsistencies (Miriam Brody referred to the "Two Wollstonecrafts")&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt; reflective of problems that had no easy answers, this book remains a foundation stone of feminist thought.&lt;ref name="Walters2005"/&gt;

Wollstonecraft believed that both genders contributed to inequality. She took women's considerable power over men for granted, and determined that both would require education to ensure the necessary changes in social attitudes. Given her humble origins and scant education, her personal achievements speak to her own determination. Wollstonecraft attracted the mockery of [[Samuel Johnson]], who described her and her ilk as "Amazons of the pen". Based on his relationship with [[Hester Thrale]],&lt;ref&gt;Prose, Francine. ''The Lives of the Muses''. New York: Harper Collins, 2002, pp. 29-56.&lt;/ref&gt; he complained of women's encroachment onto a male territory of writing, and not their intelligence or education. For many commentators, Wollstonecraft represents the first codification of [[equality feminism]], or a refusal of the [[feminine]] role in society.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, Laura. "The first woman (psycho)analysts; or, the friends of feminist history". ''Modern Language Quarterly'' 2004 March 65(1): 69-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the centrality of "equality" and "difference" feminism and their mutual metamorphosis, see [[Londa Schiebinger|Schiebinger, Londa]]: ''Has feminism changed science?'' Harvard: 1999, 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The feminine ideal ===
19th-century feminists reacted to cultural inequities including the pernicious, widespread acceptance of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] image of women's "proper" role and "sphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ideals of Womanhood in Victorian Britain|author=Abrams, Lynn|year=2001|publisher=BBC}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian ideal created a dichotomy of "separate spheres" for men and women that was very clearly defined in theory, though not always in reality. In this ideology, men were to occupy the public sphere (the space of wage labor and politics) and women the private sphere (the space of home and children.) This "[[ideal of feminine beauty|feminine ideal]]," also called "[[Cult of Domesticity|The Cult of Domesticity]]," was typified in Victorian [[conduct book]]s such as ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' and [[Sarah Stickney Ellis]]'s books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Blair, Emily|title=Virginia Woolf and the Nineteenth-Century Domestic Novel|year=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|page=33|isbn=0-7914-7120-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Angel in the House]]'' (1854) and ''El ángel del hogar'', bestsellers by [[Coventry Patmore]] and Maria del Pilar Sinués de Marco, came to symbolize the Victorian feminine ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jagoe, Elizabeth|title=Ambiguous angels: gender in the novels of Galdós|year=1994|publisher=University of California Press|page=14|isbn=0-520-08356-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen Victoria]] herself disparaged the concept of feminism, which she described in private letters as the "mad, wicked folly of 'Woman's Rights'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866–1928 |last=Crawford |first=Elizabeth |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 9781135434021 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2EK9P7-ZMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Toward the Light of Liberty |last=Grayling |first=A.

=== Feminism in fiction ===
As [[Jane Austen]] addressed women's restricted lives in the early part of the century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shields, Carol|title=Jane Austen (Penguin Lives)|year=2001|publisher=Viking Adult|page=38|isbn=0-670-89488-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlotte Brontë]], [[Anne Brontë]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], and [[George Eliot]] depicted women's misery and frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Fiction by Victorian Women: George Eliot, Elizabeth Gaskell...

=== Marion Reid and Caroline Norton ===
At the outset of the 19th century, the dissenting feminist voices had little to no social influence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} There was little sign of change in the political or social order, nor any evidence of a recognizable women's movement. Collective concerns began to coalesce by the end of the century, paralleling the emergence of a stiffer social model and code of conduct that [[Marion Kirkland Reid|Marion Reid]] described as confining and repressive for women.&lt;ref name="Walters2005"/&gt; While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly stirred the call for a woman's movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt and worry, and fueled opposing views.&lt;!-- sort of cite, have not read this article--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heilmann | first1 = Ann | last2 = Sanders | first2 = Valerie | title = The rebel, the lady and the ‘anti’: Femininity, anti-feminism, and the Victorian woman writer | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]], special issue: Feminisms and Print Culture, 1830-1930s, in the Digital Age | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 289–300 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2006.04.008 | date = May–June 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2006.04.008 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caroline Norton]] advocated for changes in British law.

While many women including Norton were wary of organized movements,&lt;!-- only from Google snippet --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Bradshaw, David J.  |author2=Ozment, Suzanne|title=The voice of toil: nineteenth-century British writings about work|page=393|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=0-8214-1293-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; their actions and words often motivated and inspired such movements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Among these was [[Florence Nightingale]], whose conviction that women had all the potential of men but none of the opportunities&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale, Florence.

Due to varying ideologies, feminists were not always supportive of each other's efforts. [[Harriet Martineau]] and others dismissed Wollstonecraft's&lt;ref name=Deerbrook /&gt; contributions as dangerous, and deplored Norton's&lt;ref name=Deerbrook&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sanders, Valerie (ed.)|title=Introduction to ''Deerbrook''|page=xvii–xix|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2005|isbn=0-14-143939-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; candidness, but seized on the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] campaign that Martineau had witnessed in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Martineau, Harriet|title=The martyr age of the United States of America: with an appeal on behalf of the Oberlin Institute in Aid of the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Finlay and Charlton|year=1840}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one that should logically be applied to women.

[[File:FrancesPowerCobb.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Frances Power Cobbe|Frances Cobbe]]]]
[[Anna Wheeler (author)|Anna Wheeler]] was influenced by [[Saint Simonian]] socialists while working in France. She advocated for suffrage and attracted the attention of [[Benjamin Disraeli]], the Conservative leader, as a dangerous radical on a par with [[Jeremy Bentham]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} She would later inspire early socialist and feminist advocate [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, Dolores, ''Equality in Community: Sexual Equality in the Writings of William Thompson and Anna Doyle Wheeler'' (Cork University Press), 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote the first work published in English to advocate full equality of rights for women, the 1825 "Appeal of One Half of the Human Race".&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, Dolores (ed.), ''William Thompson: Appeal of One Half of the Human Race'' (Cork University Press), 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists of previous centuries charged women's exclusion from education as the central cause for their domestic relegation and denial of social advancement, and women's 19th-century education was no better.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Frances Power Cobbe]], among others, called for education reform, an issue that gained attention alongside marital and property rights, and domestic violence.

Female journalists like Martineau and Cobbe in Britain, and [[Margaret Fuller]] in America, were achieving journalistic employment, which placed them in a position to influence other women. Cobbe would refer to "[[Women's rights|Woman's Rights]]" not just in the abstract, but as an identifiable cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roy|first=Sajal|year=|title=ENTERING TOWARDS NEW VISION: FEMINISM, A HISTORICAL PATHWAY OF KNOWLEDGE-WORLD|url=https://www.academia.edu/488941/ENTERING_TOWARDS_NEW_VISION_FEMINISM_A_HISTORICAL_PATHWAY_OF_KNOWLEDGE-WORLD|journal=Entering Towards New Vision: Feminism, A Historical Pathway of Knowledge-World.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ladies of Langham Place ===
{{Details|English Woman's Journal}}
[[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Leigh Smith]] and her friends met regularly during the 1850s in London's Langham Place to discuss the united women's voice necessary for achieving reform. These "Ladies of Langham Place" included [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]] and [[Anna Jameson]]. They focused on education, employment, and marital law. One of their causes became the Married Women's Property Committee of 1855.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} They collected thousands of signatures for legislative reform petitions, some of which were successful. Smith had also attended the 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in America.&lt;ref name=Ockerbloom /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodichon, Barbara Leigh Smith and Lacey, Candida Ann ed. 2001 5"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bodichon, Barbara Leigh Smith and Lacey, Candida Ann (ed.)|title=Women's Source Library: Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon and the Langham Place Group|volume=3|page=5|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0-415-25688-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith and Parkes, together and apart, wrote many articles on education and employment opportunities. In the same year as Norton, Smith summarized the legal framework for injustice in her 1854 ''A Brief Summary of the Laws of England concerning Women''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/vwwp/bodichon/brieflaw.html Full text from Victorian Women's Project, Indiana University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110063849/http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/vwwp/bodichon/brieflaw.html |date=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to reach large numbers of women via her role in the ''[[English Women's Journal]]''. The response to this journal led to their creation of the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]] (SPEW). Smith's Married Women's Property committee collected 26,000 signatures to change the law{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what law?}} for all women, including those unmarried.&lt;ref name=Ockerbloom /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodichon, Barbara Leigh Smith and Lacey, Candida Ann ed. 2001 5"/&gt;

[[Harriet Taylor]] published her ''Enfranchisement'' in 1851, and wrote about the inequities of family law. In 1853, she married [[John Stuart Mill]], and provided him with much of the subject material for ''[[The Subjection of Women]]''.

[[Emily Davies]] also encountered the Langham group, and with [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson|Elizabeth Garrett]] created SPEW branches outside London.

=== Educational reform ===
{{Main|Female education}}
The interrelated barriers to education and employment formed the backbone of 19th-century feminist reform efforts, for instance, as described by Harriet Martineau in her 1859 ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|Edinburgh Journal]]'' article, "Female Industry".{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=clarify the use of mentioning this}} These barriers did not change in conjunction with the economy. Martineau, however, remained a moderate, for practical reasons, and unlike Cobbe, did not support the emerging call for the vote.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The education reform efforts of women like Davies and the Langham group slowly made inroads. [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] (1848) and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]] (1849) in London began to offer some education to women from 1848. By 1862, Davies established a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established Local Examinations,{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what is this?}} and achieved partial success in 1865. She published ''The Higher Education of Women'' a year later. Davies and Leigh Smith founded the first higher educational institution for women and enrolled five students. The school later became [[Girton College, Cambridge]] in 1869, [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] in 1871, and [[Lady Margaret Hall]] at Oxford in 1879. Bedford began to award degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, few could take advantage of them and life for female students was still difficult.{{Clarify|date=October 2009|reason=needs more examples}}

In the 1883 [[Ilbert Bill|Ilbert Bill controversy]], a [[British India]] bill that proposed Indian judicial jurisdiction to try British criminals, Bengali women in support of the bill responded by claiming that they were more educated than the English women opposed to the bill, and noted that more [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] women had degrees than British women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Postcolonial Theory: A Reader|last=Reina Lewis|first=Sara Mills|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2003|isbn=0-415-94275-6|page=453|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=tie this in to the surrounding details—why bring this up?}}

As part of the continuing dialogue between British and American feminists, [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]], one of the first American women to graduate in medicine (1849), lectured in Britain with Langham support. She eventually took her degree in France. Garrett's very successful 1870 campaign to run for London School Board office is another example of a how a small band of very determined women were beginning to reach positions of influence at the local government level.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

=== Women's campaigns ===
[[File:Josephine Butler - portrait.jpg|thumb|Josephine Butler]]
Campaigns gave women opportunities to test their new political skills and to conjoin disparate social reform groups. Their successes include the campaign for the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882|Married Women's Property Act]] (passed in 1882) and the campaign to repeal the [[Contagious Diseases Act]]s of 1864, 1866, and 1869, which united women's groups and utilitarian liberals like [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Jeremy. Mill on Liberty and on the Contagious Diseases Acts. in, Urbinati, Nadia and Zakaras, Alex (eds), ''J. S. Mill's Political Thought: A bicentennial reassessment''. Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, women were outraged by the inherent inequity and misogyny of the legislation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} For the first time, women in large numbers took up the rights of prostitutes. Prominent critics included Blackwell, Nightingale, Martineau, and Elizabeth Wolstenholme. Elizabeth Garrett, unlike her sister, [[Millicent Fawcett|Millicent]], did not support the campaign, though she later admitted that the campaign had done well.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Josephine Butler]], already experienced in prostitution issues, a charismatic leader, and a seasoned campaigner, emerged as the natural leader&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Jane and Ingrid Sharp.

Taylor and Francis, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-22684-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; of what became the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Susan Kingsley.

London Metropolitan University, Women's Library. Archives in London]&lt;/ref&gt; Her work demonstrated the potential power of an organized lobby group. The association successfully argued that the Acts not only demeaned prostitutes, but all women and men by promoting a blatant sexual [[double standard]]. Butler's activities resulted in the radicalization of many moderate women. The Acts were repealed in 1886.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

On a smaller scale, [[Annie Besant]] campaigned for the rights of [[London matchgirls strike of 1888|matchgirls]] (female factory workers) and against the appalling conditions under which they worked in London. Her work of publicizing the difficult conditions of the workers through interviews in bi-weekly periodicals like The Link became a method for raising public concern over social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Carolyn|date=Spring 1999|title=Sensational Stories, Endangered Bodies: Women's Work and the New Journalism in England in the 1890s|journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies|volume=31|pages=49–71|jstor=4052816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th to 21st centuries ==
Feminists did not recognize separate waves of feminism until the second wave was so named by journalist Martha Lear, according to [[Jennifer Baumgardner]].&lt;ref&gt;Baumgardner, Jennifer, ''F'em!: Goo Goo, Gaga, and Some Thoughts on Balls'' (Berkeley, California: Seal Press, 2011 ({{ISBN|978-1-58005-360-0}})), p.&amp;nbsp;243 (author teacher, [[The New School]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Baumgardner reports criticism by professor [[Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz]] of the division into waves&lt;ref&gt;Baumgardner, Jennifer, ''F'em!'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;244 &amp; 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and the difficulty of categorizing some feminists into specific waves,&lt;ref name="Fem-Baumgardner-p244"&gt;Baumgardner, Jennifer, ''F'em!'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the main critics of a wave are likely to be members of the prior wave who remain vital,&lt;ref name="Fem-Baumgardner-p244" /&gt; and that waves are coming faster.&lt;ref name="Fem-Baumgardner-p244" /&gt; The "waves debate" has influenced how historians and other scholars have established the chronologies of women's political activism.[https://www.cliohistory.org/click/politics-social/politics/]

=== First wave ===
{{Main|First-wave feminism|History of women in the United States}}
[[File:Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] (seated) and [[Susan B. Anthony]]]]
The 19th- and early 20th-century feminist activity in the [[English-speaking world]] that sought to win [[women's suffrage]], female education rights, better working conditions, and abolition of gender double standards is known as first-wave feminism. The term "first-wave" was coined retrospectively when the term ''[[second-wave feminism]]'' was used to describe a newer feminist movement that fought social and cultural inequalities beyond basic political inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pramila|first1=B.|title=Feminism in Indian Writing in English Fiction with Special Reference to Anita Nair, Anita Desai &amp; Bharati Mukherjee|journal=International Journal of English: Literature, Language, &amp; Skills|date=July 2016|volume=5|issue=2|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, feminist movement leaders campaigned for the national [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] and [[The Temperance movement in the United States|Temperance]] before championing women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book|last1=Loveday|first1=V.|title=Feminism and the Women's Rights Movement|date=August 2017|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; American first-wave feminism involved a wide range of women, some belonging to conservative Christian groups (such as [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]), others resembling the diversity and radicalism of much of [[second-wave feminism]] (such as Stanton, Anthony, [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], and the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]], of which Stanton was president). First-wave feminism in the United States is considered to have ended with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1920), which granted white women the right to vote in the United States.

Activism for the equality of women was not limited to the United States.  In mid-nineteenth century Persia, [[Táhirih]] was active as a poet and religious reformer, and is recorded as proclaiming the equality of women at her execution.  She inspired later generations of Iranian feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Táhirih mentioned on PBS NewsHour - Mention of Táhirih as founder of Persian feminism by renowned scholar Azar Nafizi in a discussion on PBS about Shirin Ebadi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Louise Dittmar campaigned for women's rights, in Germany, in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions, Louise Dittmar http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/dh/ditt.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Although slightly later in time, [[Fusae Ichikawa]] was in the first wave of women's activists in her own country of Japan, campaigning for women's suffrage. [[Mary Lee (suffragette)|Mary Lee]] was active in the suffrage movement in South Australia, the first Australian colony to grant women the vote in 1894. In New Zealand, [[Kate Sheppard]] and [[Mary Ann Müller]] worked to achieve the vote for women by 1893.

[[File:19th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Nineteenth Amendment]]
In the United States, the antislavery campaign of the 1830s served as both a cause ideologically compatible with feminism and a blueprint for later feminist political organizing. Attempts to exclude women only strengthened their convictions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Sarah Grimké|Sarah]] and [[Angelina Grimké]] moved rapidly from the emancipation of slaves to the emancipation of women. The most influential feminist writer of the time was the colourful journalist [[Margaret Fuller]], whose ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' was published in 1845. Her dispatches from Europe for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' helped create to synchronize the [[Women's rights|women's rights movement]].

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lucretia Mott]] met in 1840 while en route to London where they were shunned as women by the male leadership of the first [[World's Anti-Slavery Convention]]. In 1848, Mott and Stanton held [[Seneca Falls Convention|a woman's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York]], where a [[Declaration of Sentiments|declaration of independence for women]] was drafted. [[Lucy Stone]] helped to organize the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in 1850, a much larger event at which [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Abby Kelley|Abby Kelley Foster]], and others spoke sparked [[Susan B. Anthony]] to take up the cause of women's rights. In December 1851, Sojourner Truth contributed to the feminist movement when she spoke at the Women’s Convention in Akron, Ohio. She delivered her powerful “Ain’t I a Woman” speech in an effort to promote women’s rights by demonstrating their ability to accomplish tasks that have been traditionally associated with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/sojtruth-woman.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Leigh Smith]] met with Mott in 1858,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20051123072232/http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/awrm/doc17b.htm Barbara Leigh Smith: ''An American Diary 1857-58'' (excerpts)]&lt;/ref&gt; strengthening the link between the [[Transatlantic relations|transatlantic]] feminist movements.

Stanton and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] saw [[Christian Church|the Church]] as a major obstacle to women's rights,&lt;ref&gt;Gage, Matilda Joslyn. "Woman, Church, and State", in Susan B. Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton (eds.), ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]''. 3 vols. Rochester, N.Y. 1881–82. 1: 753–99.&lt;/ref&gt; and welcomed the emerging literature on matriarchy. Both Gage and Stanton produced works on this topic, and collaborated on ''[[The Woman's Bible]]''. Stanton wrote "[[The Matriarchate or Mother-Age]]"&lt;ref name="stanton matriarch"&gt;Stanton, Elizabeth Cady. "The Matriarchate or Mother-Age", in Avery, Rachel Foster (ed.), ''Transactions of the National Council of Women of the United States''. Philadelphia, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gage wrote ''[[Woman, Church and State]]'', neatly inverting [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]]'s thesis and adding a unique [[epistemological]] perspective, the critique of objectivity and the perception of the subjective.&lt;ref name="stanton matriarch"/&gt;{{Technical statement|date=May 2013}}

Stanton once observed regarding assumptions of female inferiority, "The worst feature of these assumptions is that women themselves believe them".&lt;ref&gt;Stanton ''Matriachate'' op.cit. at 218.&lt;/ref&gt; However this attempt to replace [[Androcentrism|androcentric]] (male-centered) theological{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how is this a theological attempt?}} tradition with a [[Gynocentrism|gynocentric]] (female-centered) view made little headway in a women's movement dominated by religious elements; thus she and Gage were largely ignored by subsequent generations.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Cullen.

The women's right to vote, with its legislative representation, represented a paradigm shift where women would no longer be treated as second-class citizens without a voice. The women's suffrage campaign is the most deeply embedded campaign of the past 250 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leedstrinity.ac.uk/histcourse/suffrage/ Enfranchising Women: The Politics of Women's Suffrage in Europe 1789-1945.

At first, suffrage was treated as a lower priority. The French Revolution accelerated this,{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how?}} with the assertions of Condorcet and de Gouges, and the women who led the [[The Women's March on Versailles|1789 march on Versailles]]. In 1793, the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] was founded, and originally included suffrage on its agenda before it was suppressed at the end of the year. As a gesture, this showed that issue was now part of the European political agenda.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

German women were involved in the [[Vormärz]], a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 revolution]]. In Italy, Clara Maffei, [[Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso]], and Ester Martini Currica were politically active{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how?}} in the events leading up to 1848. In Britain, interest in suffrage emerged from the writings of Wheeler and Thompson in the 1820s, and from Reid, Taylor, and [[Anne Knight]] in the 1840s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} While New Zealand was the first sovereign state where women won the right to vote (1893), they did not win the right to stand in elections until later. The Australian State of [[South Australia]] was the first sovereign state in the world to officially grant full suffrage to women (1894).

==== The suffragettes ====
{{Main|Suffragette}}

The Langham Place ladies set up a suffrage committee at an 1866 meeting at Elizabeth Garrett's home, renamed the London Society for Women's Suffrage in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism: a paradigm shift|last=Tandon|first=Neeru|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Disturbution|year=2008|isbn=978-81-269-0888-2|location=New Delhi, India|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon similar committees had spread across the country, raising petitions, and working closely with John Stuart Mill. When denied outlets by establishment periodicals, feminists started their own, such as [[Lydia Becker]]'s ''[[Women's Suffrage Journal]]'' in 1870.

Other publications included [[Richard Pankhurst]]'s ''[[Englishwoman's Review]]'' (1866).{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=why is this worth mentioning?}} Tactical disputes were the biggest problem,{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=the biggest? of what?}} and the groups' memberships fluctuated.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=why?}} Women considered whether men (like Mill) should be involved. As it went, Mill withdrew as the movement became more aggressive with each disappointment.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what disappointments?}} The political pressure ensured debate, but year after year the movement was defeated in Parliament.

Despite this, the women accrued political experience, which translated into slow progress at the local government level. But after years of frustration, many women became increasingly radicalized. Some refused to pay taxes, and the [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Pankhurst family]] emerged as the dominant movement influence, having also founded the [[Women's Franchise League]] in 1889, which sought local election suffrage for women.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==== International suffrage ====
{{Details|Women's suffrage#Details by country}}
The Isle of Man, a UK dependency, was the first free standing jurisdiction to grant women the vote (1881), followed by the right to vote (but not to stand) in New Zealand in 1893, where [[Kate Sheppard]]&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Brian (ed.), 2000, "OPTIMISTS: Kate Sheppard – Suffragist". Accessed May 23, 2006, from http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/sheppard.html.&lt;/ref&gt; had pioneered reform. Some Australian states had also granted women the vote. This included Victoria for a brief period (1863–5), South Australia (1894), and Western Australia (1899). Australian women received the vote at the Federal level in 1902, Finland in 1906, and Norway initially in 1907 (completed in 1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History|last=Smith|first=Bonnie G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-514890-9|location=New York, NY|pages=171|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early 20th century ===
[[File:Wilhelmina Drucker IMG0020.tif|thumb|In the Netherlands, [[Wilhelmina Drucker]] (1847–1925) fought successfully for the vote and equal rights for women through political and feminist organisations she founded. In 1917–19 her goal of women's suffrage was reached.]]
In the early part of the 20th century, also known as the Edwardian era, there was a change in the way women dressed from the Victorian rigidity and complacency. Women, especially women who married a wealthy man, would often wear what we consider today, practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/manorhouse/edwardianlife/clothes.html|title=Manor House. Edwardian Life {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books, articles, speeches, pictures, and papers from the period show a diverse range of themes other than political reform and suffrage discussed publicly.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In the Netherlands, for instance, the main feminist issues were educational rights, rights to medical care,&lt;ref&gt;Aletta H.

[[Emmeline Pankhurst|Pankhursts]] formed the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) in 1903. As Emmline Pankhurst put it, they viewed votes for women no longer as "a right, but as a desperate necessity".{{Cite quote|date=May 2013}} At the state level, Australia and the United States had already granted suffrage to some women. American feminists such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] (1902) visited Britain.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=why is this important?}} While WSPU was the best-known suffrage group,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} it was only one of many, such as the [[Women's Freedom League]] and the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) led by [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]].{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what these groups did is more important than what they established—what do reliable sources say about the importance of the multitude of suffrage groups?}} WSPU was largely a family affair,{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} although externally financed. [[Christabel Pankhurst]] became the dominant figure and gathered friends such as [[Annie Kenney]], [[Flora Drummond]], [[Teresa Billington]], [[Ethel Smyth]], [[Grace Roe]], and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as [[Norah Elam]]) around her. Veterans such as Elizabeth Garrett also joined.

In 1906, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' first labeled these women "[[suffragettes]]" as a form of ridicule, but the term was embraced by the women to describe the more militant form of suffragism visible in public marches, distinctive green, purple, and white emblems, and the [[Artists' Suffrage League]]'s dramatic graphics. The feminists learned to exploit photography and the media, and left a vivid visual record including images such as the 1914 photograph of Emmeline.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The protests slowly became more violent, and included heckling, banging on doors, smashing shop windows, and arson. [[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the British government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.

==== Feminist science fiction ====
{{Main|Feminist science fiction}}
At the beginning of the 20th century, [[feminist science fiction]] emerged as a subgenre of [[science fiction]] that deals with women's roles in society. Female writers of the [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian literature]] movement at the time of [[first-wave feminism]] often addressed sexism. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915) did so.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how?}} ''[[Sultana's Dream]]'' (1905) by [[Bengali science fiction|Bengali]] [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminist]] [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]] depicts a gender-reversed [[purdah]] in a futuristic world.

During the 1920s, writers such as [[Clare Winger Harris]] and [[Gertrude Barrows Bennett]] published science fiction stories written from female perspectives and occasionally dealt with gender- and sexuality-based topics while popular 1920s and 30s [[pulp science fiction]] exaggerated masculinity alongside sexist portrayals of women.&lt;ref&gt;Clute, John (1995). ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. "Martin's Griffin", 1344.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, science fiction combined [[sensationalism]] with political and technological critiques of society. With the advent of feminism, women's roles were questioned in this "subversive, mind expanding genre".&lt;ref&gt;Clute, John (1995). ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. "Martin's Griffin", 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist science fiction]] poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, how reproduction defines gender, and how the political power of men and women are unequal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using [[utopia]]s to explore societies where gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, and [[dystopia]]s to explore worlds where gender inequalities are escalated, asserting a need for feminist work to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Elyce Rae Helford, in Westfahl, Gary. ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy'': Greenwood Press, 2005: 289-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== During the first and second world wars ====

Women entered the labor market during the [[First World War]] in unprecedented numbers, often in new sectors, and discovered the value of their work. The war also left large numbers of women bereaved and with a net loss of household income. The scores of men killed and wounded shifted the demographic composition. War also split the feminist groups, with many women opposed to the war and others involved in the [[White feather|white feather campaign]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Feminist scholars like [[Francoise Thebaud]] and [[Nancy F. Cott]] note a conservative reaction to World War I in some countries, citing a reinforcement of traditional imagery and literature that promotes motherhood. The appearance of these traits in wartime has been called the "nationalization of women".{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In the years between the wars, feminists fought discrimination and establishment opposition.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} In [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'', Woolf describes the extent of the backlash and her frustration. By now, the word "feminism" was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} When [[Rebecca West]], another prominent writer, had been attacked as "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment "I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute."&lt;ref&gt;West, Rebecca. "Mr. Chesterton in hysterics", in The Clarion 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the nontraditional styles and attitudes of [[flappers]] were popular among American and British women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==== Electoral reform ====
The United Kingdom's [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Representation of the People Act 1918 | url = http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/collections-the-vote-and-after/representation-of-the-people-act-1918/ | website = parliament.uk | publisher = [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; gave near-universal suffrage to men, and suffrage to women over 30. The [[Representation of the People Act 1928]] extended equal suffrage to both men and women. It also shifted the socioeconomic makeup of the electorate towards the working class, favoring the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who were more sympathetic to women's issues.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|following election]] and gave Labour the most seats in the house to date. The electoral reforms also allowed women to run for Parliament. [[Christabel Pankhurst]] narrowly failed to win a seat in 1918, and [[Constance Markievicz]] (Sinn Féin) was the first woman elected in Ireland in 1918, but as an [[Irish nationalism#Militant separatism and Irish independence|Irish nationalist]], refused to take her seat.  In 1919 and 1920, both [[Lady Astor]] and [[Margaret Wintringham]] won seats for the Conservatives and Liberals respectively by succeeding their husband's seats. Labour swept to power in 1924. Astor's proposal to form a women's party in 1929 was unsuccessful. Women gained considerable electoral experience over the next few years as a series of minority governments ensured almost annual elections. Close affiliation with Labour also proved to be a problem for the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]] (NUSEC), which had little support in the Conservative party. However, their persistence with Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] was rewarded with the passage of the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

European women received the vote in [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]] in 1915 (full in 1919), the [[Russian Republic]] in 1917, [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Canada]] in 1918, many countries including the [[Netherlands]] in 1919, [[Czechoslovakia]] (today [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]) in 1920, and [[Turkey]] and [[South Africa]] in 1930. [[France|French]] women did not receive the vote until 1945. [[Liechtenstein]] was one of the last countries, in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==== Social reform ====
The political change did not immediately change social circumstances. With the economic recession, women were the most vulnerable sector of the workforce. Some women who held jobs prior to the war were obliged to forfeit them to returning soldiers, and others were excessed. With limited franchise, the UK [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) pivoted into a new organization, the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]] (NUSEC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strand 2: Women's Suffrage Societies (2NSE Records of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship) | url = https://twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=2NSE&amp;pos=1 | website = twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk | publisher = [[Women's Library|The Women's Library @ London School of Economics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which still advocated for equality in franchise, but extended its scope to examine equality in social and economic areas. Legislative reform was sought for discriminatory laws (e.g., family law and [[prostitution]]) and over the differences between ''equality'' and ''equity'', the accommodations that would allow women to overcome barriers to fulfillment (known in later years as the "equality vs. difference conundrum").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Offen | first = Karen | title = Women in the western world | journal = Journal of Women's Studies | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 145&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.1353/jowh.2010.0359 | date = Summer 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jowh.2010.0359 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleanor Rathbone]], who became a British [[Member of Parliament]] in 1929, succeeded [[Millicent Fawcett|Millicent Garrett]] as president of NUSEC in 1919. She expressed the critical need for consideration of ''difference'' in gender relationships as "what women need to fulfill the potentialities of their own natures".{{Cite quote|date=May 2013}} The 1924 Labour government's social reforms created a formal split, as a [[splinter group]] of strict egalitarians formed the [[Open Door Council]] in May 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strand 5: (5ODC Campaigning Organisations  Records of the Open Door Council) | url = https://twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=5ODC&amp;pos=1 | website = twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk | publisher = [[Women's Library|The Women's Library @ London School of Economics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually became an international movement, and continued until 1965.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Other important social legislation of this period included the [[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]] (which opened professions to women), and the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1923]]. In 1932, NUSEC separated advocacy from education, and continued the former activities as the [[National Council for Equal Citizenship]] and the latter as the [[Townswomen's Guild]]. The council continued until the end of the [[Second World War]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In America, [[Margaret Sanger]] was prosecuted for her book ''Family Limitation'' under the [[Comstock laws|Comstock Act]] in 1914, and fled to Britain until it was safe to return. Sanger's work was prosecuted in Britain. She met [[Marie Stopes]] in Britain, who was never prosecuted but regularly denounced for her promotion of birth control. In 1917, Sanger started the ''[[Birth Control Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Margaret Sanger Papers.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, Sanger gave a lecture on birth control to the women's auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan in Silver Lake, New Jersey, which she referred to as a "weird experience".&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, Margaret (1938).

=== 1940s ===
In most front line countries, women volunteered or were conscripted for various duties in support of the national war effort. In Britain, women were drafted and assigned to industrial jobs or to non-combat military service. The British services enrolled 460,000 women. The largest service, [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]], had a maximum of 213,000 women enrolled, many of whom served in anti-aircraft gun combat roles.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Noakes, ''Women in the British Army: war and the gentle sex, 1907-1948'' (2006), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Ciment and Thaddeus Russell,eds. ''The Home Front Encyclopedia: United States, Britain, and Canada in World Wars I and II'' (2007), vol. 1, p. 950.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, including Germany and the Soviet Union, women volunteered or were conscripted. In Germany, women volunteered in the [[League of German Girls]] and assisted the Luftwaffe as anti-aircraft gunners, or as guerrilla fighters in [[Werwolf]] units behind [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;"Der Jungmädeldienst", published February 1940, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Soviet Union, about 820,000 women served in the military as medics, radio operators, truck drivers, snipers, combat pilots, and junior commanding officers.&lt;ref&gt;Krylova, Anna, "Soviet Women in Combat'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many American women retained their domestic chores and often added a paid job, especially one related to a war industry. Much more so than in the previous war, large numbers of women were hired for unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in munitions, and barriers against married women taking jobs were eased. The popular [[Rosie the Riveter]] icon became a symbol for a generation of American working women.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In addition, some 300,000 women served in U.S. military uniform with organizations such as [[Women's Army Corps]] and [[WAVES]]. With many young men gone, sports organizers tried to set up professional women's teams, such as the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]], which closed after the war. After the war, most munitions plants closed, and civilian plants replaced their temporary female workers with returning veterans, who had priority.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984), ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Second-wave feminism" identifies a period of [[feminist]] activity from the early 1960s through the late 1980s that saw cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked. The movement encouraged women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and reflective of a [[Hegemonic masculinity|sexist power structure]]. As first-wave feminists focused on absolute rights such as suffrage, second-wave feminists focused on other cultural equality issues, such as ending discrimination.&lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;Freedman, Estelle B., ''No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women'' (London: Ballantine Books, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Betty Friedan, ''The Feminine Mystique'', and Women's Liberation ====
In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]]'s exposé ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' became the voice for the discontent and disorientation women felt in being shunted into homemaking positions after their college graduations. In the book, Friedan explored the roots of the change in women's roles from essential workforce during World War II to homebound housewife and mother after the war, and assessed the forces that drove this change in perception of women's roles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Over the following decade, "[[Feminist movement|Women's Liberation]]" became a common phrase and concept.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

1960s feminism, its theory, and its activism was informed and fueled by the social, cultural, and political climate of that decade.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} This time was marked by increased female enrollment in higher education, the establishment of academic [[women's studies]] courses and departments,&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Florence.

=== Feminist views on pornography ===

{{Further|Feminist Sex Wars}}
[[Susan Griffin]] was one of the first{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} feminists to write on [[pornography]]'s implications in her 1981 ''[[Pornography and Silence]]''. Beyond Brownmiller and Griffin's positions, [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]] influenced debates and activism around pornography and prostitution, particularly at the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgi2.www.law.umich.edu/_FacultyBioPage/facultybiopagenew.asp?ID=219 Catherine A MacKinnon. University of Michigan Law School.]&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon, a lawyer, has stated, "To be about to be raped is to be gender female in the process of going about life as usual."&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catherine. ''Only Words''. London: Harper Collins, 1995. {{ISBN|0-674-63933-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained sexual harassment by saying that it "doesn't mean that they [harassers] all want to fuck us, they just want to hurt us, dominate us, and control us, and that is fucking us."&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catherine. ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. 1987, {{ISBN|0-674-29874-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pauline B. Bart, some people see radical feminism as the only movement that truly expresses the pain of being a woman in an unequal society, as it portrays that reality with the experiences of the battered and violated, which they claim to be the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Bart, Pauline B. "Feminism Unmodified", ''The American Journal of Sociology''. 1989 September 95(2): 538-539&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, including some feminists, civil libertarians, and jurists, have found this position uncomfortable and alienating.&lt;ref name="Walters2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciulla, Joanne B.

=== Third wave ===
[[File:bellhooks.jpg|thumb|[[bell hooks&lt;!-- For this person's name, the initials should be in the lower case. --&gt;]]]]
{{Main|Third-wave feminism}}
Third-wave feminism began in the early 1990s in response to what young women perceived as failures of the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave]]. It also responds to the backlash against the second-wave's initiatives and movements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid second-wave "[[Essentialism|essentialist]]" definitions of [[femininity]], which over-emphasized the experiences of white, upper middle class women. A [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality, or an understanding of gender as outside binary maleness and femaleness, is central to much of the third wave's ideology.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Third-wave feminists often describe "micropolitics",{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} and challenge second-wave paradigms about whether actions are unilaterally good for females.&lt;ref name=Freedman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Henry, Astrid, ''Not My Mother's Sister: Generational Conflict and Third-Wave Feminism'' (Indiana University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-253-21713-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillis&gt;Gillis, Stacy, Gillian Howie &amp; Rebecca Munford (eds), ''Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), {{ISBN|978-0-230-52174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faludi&gt;Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women'' (Vintage, 1993), {{ISBN|978-0-09-922271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=examples}}

These aspects of third-wave feminism arose in the mid-1980s. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks&lt;!-- For this person's name, the initials should be in the lower case. --&gt;]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Luisa Accati]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other feminists of color, called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice. They wanted prominent feminist thought to consider race-related subjectivities.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=examples}} This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the 1991 [[Hill–Thomas hearings]], but began to shift with the [[Freedom Ride 1992]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} a drive to register voters in poor minority communities whose rhetoric intended to rally young feminists. For many, the rallying of the young is the common link within third-wave feminism.&lt;ref name=Freedman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt;

==== Sexual politics ====
[[Lesbianism]] during the second wave was visible within and without feminism. Lesbians felt sidelined by both gay liberation and women's liberation, where they were referred to as the "[[Lavender Menace]]", provoking ''[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]'', a 1970 manifesto that put lesbian women at the forefront of the liberation movement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Jill Johnston]]'s 1973 ''[[Lesbian Nation: The Feminist Solution]]'' argued for [[lesbian separatism]].{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=explain, connect to rest of paragraph}} In its extreme form, this was expressed as the only appropriate choice for a woman.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Eventually the lesbian movement was welcomed into the mainstream women's movement. This union's threat to male normativity was substantiated by the male backlash that followed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In [[reproductive rights]], feminists sought the right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Feminists hoped to use the first [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] to free women to decide the terms under which they will bear children. They felt that reproductive self-control was essential for full economic independence from men. Access to [[abortion]] was also widely demanded for these reasons, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue.

Third-wave feminists also fought to hasten social acceptance of female sexual freedom. As societal norms allowed men to have multiple sexual partners without rebuke, feminists sought sexual equality for that freedom and encouraged "[[sexual liberation]]" for women, including sex for pleasure with multiple partners, if desired.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} &lt;!-- add critique here, previous section was completely unsourced from Feb 2007 to May 2013... --&gt;

==== Global feminism ====
Following World War II, the [[United Nations]] (UN) extended feminism's global reach. They established a [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]] in 1946.,&lt;ref name="Winslow14"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women, Politics, and the United Nations |editor=Winslow, Anne |year=1995 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location=Westport, CT |isbn=9780313295225 |pages=13–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSXKUeyp9b8C&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/CSW60YRS/CSWbriefhistory.pdf Short History of the Commission on the Status of Women]&lt;/ref&gt; which later joined the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).

There is and must be a diversity of feminisms, responsive to the different needs and concerns of women, and defined by them for themselves.

==== Arguments for a new wave ====
In 2005, Pythia Peay first argued for the existence of a fourth wave of feminism, combining justice with [[thealogy|religious spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Peay | first= Pythia | title =Feminism's fourth wave | work =[[Utne Reader]] | issue = 128 | date = March–April 2005 | pages =59–60 | url = http://www.utne.com/community/feminisms-fourth-wave.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] in 2011, a fourth wave, incorporating online resources such as [[social media]], may have begun in 2008, inspired partly by [[Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day|Take Our Daughters to Work Day]]s. This fourth wave in turn has inspired or been associated with: the Doula Project for children's services; post-abortion talk lines; pursuit of [[reproductive justice]]; [[plus-size clothing|plus-size]] fashion support; [[transgenderism (social movement)|transgenderism]] support; male feminism; [[sex work]] acceptance; and developing media including [[Feministing]], Racialicious, [[blog]]s, and [[Twitter]] campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgardner, Jennifer, ''F'em!'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Kira Cochrane]], a fourth wave had appeared in the U.K. and several other nations by 2012-13. It focused on: sexual inequality as manifested in "street harassment, sexual harassment, workplace discrimination[,]&amp;nbsp;... body-shaming";&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The fourth wave of feminism: meet the rebel women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|accessdate=14 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 December 2013}} (Cochrane is also the author of ''All the Rebel Women: The Rise of the Fourth Wave of Feminism'' (Guardian Shorts Originals series ebook 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; media images, "online misogyny",&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt; "assault[s] on public transport";&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt; on [[intersectionality]]; on [[social media]] technology for communication and online petitioning for organizing; and on the perception, inherited from prior waves, that individual experiences are shared and thus can have political solutions.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt; Cochrane identified as fourth wave such organizations and websites as the [[Everyday Sexism Project]] and [[Kat Banyard|UK Feminista]]; and events such as [[Reclaim the Night]], [[One Billion Rising]], and "a Lose the Lads' mags protest",&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt; where "many of [the leaders]&amp;nbsp;... are in their teens and 20s".&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;

In 2014, [[Betty Dodson]], who is also acknowledged as one of the leaders of the early 1980s pro-sex feminist movement, expressed that she considers herself a fourth wave feminist. Dodson expressed that the previous waves of feminist were banal and anti-sexual, which is why she has chosen to look at a new stance of feminism, fourth wave feminism. In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson says her work has gained a fresh lease of life with a new audience of young, successful women who have never had an orgasm. This includes fourth-wave feminists - those rejecting the anti-pleasure stance they believe third-wave feminists stand for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Lydia|title=Betty Dodson and Fourth-Wave Feminism: Masturbation is Key to Longer Life|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/betty-dodson-fourth-wave-feminism-masturbation-key-longer-life-1447536|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett and Holly Baxter released their book, ''The Vagenda.'' The authors of the book both consider themselves fourth wave feminists. Like their website "The Vagenda", their book aims to flag and debunk the stereotypes of femininity promoted by the mainstream women's press.&lt;ref&gt;http://vagendamagazine.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer of the book has expressed disappointment with ''The Vagenda'', saying that instead of being the "call to arms for young women" that it purports to be, it reads like a joyless dissertation detailing "everything bad the media has ever done to women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanghani|first=Radhika|title=My generation of feminists is depressing me|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10773101/My-generation-of-feminists-is-depressing-me.html|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Everyday Sexism Project ====
The Everyday Sexism Project began as a social media campaign on 16 April 2012 by Laura Bates, a British feminist writer. The aim of the site was to document everyday examples of sexism as reported by contributors around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Everyday Sexism Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bates established the Everyday Sexism Project as an open forum where women could post their experiences of harassment.  Bates explains the Everyday Sexism Project's goal, ""The project was never about solving sexism. It was about getting people to take the first step of just realising there is a problem that needs to be fixed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|title=Laura Bates interview: 'Two years ago, I didn't know what feminism meant'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/laura-bates-interview-everyday-sexism|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website was such a success that Bates decided to write and publish a book, ''Everyday Sexism'', which further emphasizes the importance of having this type of online forum for women. The book provides unique insight into the vibrant movement of the upcoming fourth wave and the untold stories that women shared through the Everyday Sexism Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bates|first=Laura|title=Everyday Sexism|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lF6EAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=the+everyday+sexism+project|isbn=9781471131585|date=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution'''

In November 2015, a group of historians working with Clio Visualizing History [https://www.cliohistory.org/] launched ''Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution.''[https://www.cliohistory.org/click/] This digital history exhibit examines the history of American feminism from the era of World War Two to the present. The exhibit has three major sections: Politics and Social Movements; Body and Health; and Workplace and Family. There are also interactive timelines linking to a vast array of sources documenting the history of American feminism and providing information about current feminist activism.

===Criticisms of the Wave Metaphor ===
The wave metaphor has been critiqued as inappropriate, limiting, and misleading by a number of feminist scholars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Theory Reader: Local and Global Perspectives|last=Nicholson|first=Linda|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=McCann|editor-first=Carole R.|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Feminism in "Waves": Useful Metaphor or Not?|editor-last2=Kim|editor-first2=Seung-Kyung|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Theory Reader: Local and Global Perspectives|last=Basu|first=Amrita|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=McCann|editor-first=Carole R.|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Globalization of the Local/Localization of the Global: Mapping Transnational Women's Movements|editor-last2=Kim|editor-first2=Seung-Kyung|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this metaphor was once useful for United States feminists in order to gain the attention required to make large-scale political changes, as was the case for the women’s suffrage movement of the 1940s, its relevance may have not only run its course but its usage has been argued as completely inappropriate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, the suffragettes did not use the term ‘feminism’ to describe themselves or their movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This critique is shown through one early twentieth century feminist’s words: “All feminists are suffragists, but not all suffragists are feminists”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grounding of Modern Feminism|last=Cott|first=Nancy|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New Haven and London|pages=15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wave metaphor has been described as misleading and even dangerous because it not only renders the periods of time in-between waves as silent and irrelevant, but it also contributes to the faulty conceptualization of a particular brand hegemonic feminism as the ultimate understanding of what feminism is.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These critiques advocate for the recognition of periods of mass social organizing rather than ‘waves’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It is argued that the wave metaphor weakens the strength and relevance of feminist arguments, since waves necessarily must peak and then retreat, which is not an accurate picture of feminist progress in the United States or elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Feminism does not retreat or disappear in-between ‘waves'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, after the explosion of mass social organizing in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, feminism was being worked into our institutions – a much less glamorous but just as important job that did not require such large-scale attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As a result, we have seen more and more women in more areas of the job force, higher education, and the installation and success of Women’s and Gender Studies programs across the United States, to name just a few examples of feminism’s continuous and very relevant presence in this time between the ‘waves’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The wave metaphor has further been criticized for privileging not only particular races and classes of women in the United States, but for privileging the feminism of the United States in general over other locations in the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Amrita Basu argues for, “the politics and conditions of emergence,” instead of the wave metaphor, which does not allow for this privileging of particular people and nations but instead allows for the importance and understanding of any and all peoples in the world who have contributed to feminism and its many understandings and meanings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== National histories of feminism ==

=== France ===
{{Main|Feminism in France}}
The 18th century [[French Revolution]]'s focus on [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|''égalité'']] (equality) extended to the inequities faced by French women. The writer [[Olympe de Gouges]] amended the 1791 ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' into the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'', where she argued that women accountable to the law must also bear equal responsibility under the law. She also addressed marriage as a social contract between equals and attacked women's reliance on beauty and charm as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Scott |first=Joan W. |authorlink=Joan Wallach Scott |title=Only Paradoxes to Offer: French Feminists and the Rights of Man |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=0-674-63930-8}}, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century, conservative, post-Revolution France was inhospitable for feminist ideas, as expressed in the counter-revolutionary writings on the role of women by [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald|Viscount Louis de Bonald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=French Feminism in the 19th Century |last=Moses |first=Claire Goldberg |year=1984 |publisher=SUNY Press |location=Albany, NY |isbn=9780873958592 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlaBeKzvc6AC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancement came mid-century under the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 revolution]] and the proclamation of the Second Republic, which introduced male suffrage amid hopes that similar benefits would apply to women.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Although the Utopian [[Charles Fourier]] is considered a feminist writer of this period, his influence was minimal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, MC. ''Charles Fourier''. Twayne's World Author's Series 578, Boston, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of the conservative [[Louis-Philippe]] in 1848, feminist hopes were raised, as in 1790. Movement newspapers and organizations appeared, such as [[Eugénie Niboyet]]'s ''[[La Voix des Femmes]]'' (''The Women's Voice''), the first feminist daily newspaper in France. Niboyet was a Protestant who had adopted [[Saint-Simonianism]], and ''La Voix'' attracted other women from that movement, including the seamstress [[Jeanne Deroin]] and the primary schoolteacher [[Pauline Roland]]. Unsuccessful attempts were also made to recruit [[George Sand]]. Feminism was treated as a threat due to its ties with socialism, which was scrutinized since the Revolution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Deroin and Roland were both arrested, tried, and imprisoned in 1849. With the emergence of a new, more conservative government in 1852, feminism would have to wait until the [[Third French Republic]].

The [[Groupe Français d'Etudes Féministes]] were women intellectuals at the beginning of the 20th century who translated part of [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|Bachofen]]'s canon into French&lt;ref&gt;Bachofen, Johann Jakob. ''Les droits de la mère dans l'antiquité'': Préface de l'ouvrage de J-J Bachofen. Groupe Français d'Etudes Féministes (trans., ed.), Paris, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; and campaigned for the family law reform. In 1905, they founded ''[[L'entente]]'', which published articles on women's history, and became the focus for the intellectual [[avant-garde]]. It advocated for women's entry into higher education and the male-dominated professions.&lt;ref&gt;Klejman, Laurence and Florence Rochefort. ''L'égalite en marche: Le féminisme sous la Troisième République'', Paris, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Parti Socialiste Féminin]] socialist feminists, adopted a Marxist version of matriarchy.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=for what?}} Like the Groupe Français, they toiled for a new age of equality, not for a return to prehistoric models of matriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aline Valette|Valette, Aline]].

{{Main|Feminism in Germany}}
Modern feminism in [[Germany]] began during the [[Wilhelmine]] period (1888–1918) with feminists pressuring a range of traditional institutions, from universities to government, to open their doors to women. The organized German women's movement is widely attributed to writer and feminist [[Louise Otto-Peters]] (1819–1895). This movement culminated in [[women's suffrage]] in 1919. Later waves of feminists continued to ask for legal and social equality in public and family life. [[Alice Schwarzer]] is the most prominent contemporary German feminist.

{{Main|Women's rights movement in Iran}}
The Iranian women's rights movement first emerged some time after the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]], in the year in which the first women's journal was published, 1910. The movement lasted until 1933, when the last women's association was dissolved by the [[Reza Shah]]'s government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The status of women further deteriorated after the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. Many of the rights women gained under Shah were systematically abolished through legislation, elimination of women from work, and forced [[hijab]] (veils for women).&lt;ref&gt;Sanasarian 136&lt;/ref&gt; The movement later grew again under feminist figures such as [[Bibi Khanoom Astarabadi]], [[Touba Azmoudeh]], [[Sediqeh Dowlatabadi]], [[Mohtaram Eskandari]], [[Roshank No'doost]], [[Afaq Parsa]], [[Fakhr ozma Arghoun]], [[Shahnaz Azad]], [[Noor-ol-Hoda Mangeneh]], [[Zandokht Shirazi]], [[Maryam Amid]] ([[Mariam Mozayen-ol Sadat]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliz Sanasarian|Sanasarian, Eliz]].

In 1992, [[Shahla Sherkat]] founded ''[[Zanan]]'' (''Women'') magazine, which covered Iranian women's concerns and tested political boundaries with edgy reportage on reform politics, domestic abuse, and sex. It is the most important Iranian women's journal published after the Iranian revolution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} It systematically criticized the Islamic legal code and argued that gender equality is Islamic and religious literature had been misread and misappropriated by misogynists. Mehangiz Kar, Shahla Lahiji, and Shahla Sherkat, the editor of ''Zanan'', lead the debate on women's rights and demanded reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranian.com/History/2000/March/Women/index3.html ''Women's movement: Zanan magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, 2006, the [[One Million Signatures]] Iranian women's rights campaign was started.

Second- and third-wave feminism in China was characterized by a re-examination of women's roles during the reform movements of the early 20th century and the ways in which feminism was adopted by those various movements in order to achieve their goals. Later and current feminists have questioned whether gender equality has actually been fully achieved, and discuss current gender problems, such as the large [[Missing women of Asia|gender disparity]] in the population.&lt;ref name="Dooling" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Feminism in Japan}}
Japanese feminism as an organized political movement dates back to the early years of the 20th century when [[Kato Shidzue]] pushed for [[contraception|birth control]] availability as part of a broad spectrum of [[progressivism|progressive]] reforms. Shidzue went on to serve in the [[National Diet of Japan|National Diet]] following the defeat of Japan in World War II and the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Japan|Peace Constitution]] by US forces.&lt;ref name=Buckley1997&gt;Buckley, Susan, ''Broken Silence: Voices of Japanese Feminism'' (University of California Press, 1997), {{ISBN|978-0-520-08514-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other figures such as [[Fumiko Hayashi (author)|Hayashi Fumiko]] and [[Ariyoshi Sawako]] illustrate the broad socialist ideologies of Japanese feminism that seeks to accomplish broad goals rather than celebrate the individual achievements of powerful women.&lt;ref name=Buckley1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mackie&gt;Mackie, Vera, ''Feminism in Modern Japan Citizenship, Embodiment and Sexuality'' (Curtin University of Technology, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-521-82018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
[[File:Camilla Collett 1839.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Camilla Collett]]
Norwegian feminism's political origins are in the [[women's suffrage]] movement. [[Camilla Collett]] (1813–1895) is widely considered the first Norwegian feminist. Originating from a literary family, she wrote a novel and several articles on the difficulties facing women of her time, and, in particular, [[forced marriage]]s. [[Amalie Skram]] (1846–1905), a [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] writer, also served as the women's voice.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Arlow W., ''Rough Road to Glory: The Norwegian-American Press Speaks Out on Public Affairs 1875 to 1925'' (Balch Institute Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]] was founded in 1884 by [[Gina Krog]] and Hagbart Berner. The organization raised issues related to women's rights to education and economic self-determination, and, above all, universal suffrage. The Norwegian Parliament passed the women's right to vote into law on June 11, 1913. Norway was the second country in Europe (after Finland) to have full suffrage for women.&lt;ref name= Andersen/&gt;

=== Poland ===
[[File:Irena Krzywicka Polish writer 1930.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Irena Krzywicka]]]]
{{Main|Feminism in Poland}}
The development of feminism in Poland ([[National Independence Day|re-recreated in modern times]] in 1918) and Polish territories has traditionally been divided into seven successive "waves".&lt;ref name=Loch&gt;Łoch, Eugenia (ed.) 2001. ''Modernizm i feminizm. Postacie kobiece w literaturze polskiej i obcej''. Lublin: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu M.Curie-Skłodowskiej.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radical feminism]] emerged in 1920s Poland. Its chief representatives, [[Irena Krzywicka]] and [[Maria Morozowicz-Szczepkowska]], advocated for women's personal, social, and legal independence from men. Krzywicka and [[Tadeusz Żeleński]] both promoted [[planned parenthood]], [[sexual education]], rights to divorce and abortion, and equality of sexes. Krzywicka published a series of articles in ''Wiadomości Literackie'' in which she protested against interference by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the intimate lives of Poles.&lt;ref name=Loch/&gt;

After the Second World War, the Polish [[Communist]] state (established in 1948) forcefully promoted women's emancipation at home and at work. However, during Communist rule (until 1989), feminism in general and second-wave feminism in particular were practically absent. Although feminist texts were produced in the 1950s and afterwards, they were usually controlled and generated by the Communist state.&lt;ref name="Śleczka" &gt;Śleczka, Kazimierz, 1997.

Gdańsk: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Gdańskiego.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of Communism, the Polish government, dominated by Catholic political parties, introduced a ''de facto'' legal ban on abortions. Since then, some feminists have adopted argumentative strategies from the 1980s [[United States pro-choice movement|American pro-choice movement]].&lt;ref name=Loch/&gt;

[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|200 px|Simone de Beauvoir]]
The sexuality and gender historian Nancy Cott distinguishes between ''modern feminism'' and its antecedents, particularly the struggle for suffrage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} She argues that in the two decades surrounding the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]]'s 1920 passage, the prior ''woman movement'' primarily concerned women as ''[[universalism|universal]]'' entities, whereas over this 20-year period, the movement prioritized social differentiation, attention to ''[[individuality]]'', and diversity.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what kind of diversity?}} New issues dealt more with gender as a [[social construct]], gender identity, and relationships within and between genders. Politically, this represented a shift from an ideological alignment comfortable with the right, to one more radically associated with the left.&lt;ref&gt;Cott, Nancy F. ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2013|reason=any secondary sources for this?}}

In the immediate postwar period, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] opposed the "woman in the home" norm. She introduced an [[existentialist]] dimension to feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' (''[[The Second Sex]]'') in 1949. While less an activist than a philosopher and novelist, she signed one of the Mouvement de Libération des Femmes manifestos.

The resurgence of feminist activism in the late 1960s was accompanied by an emerging literature of what might be considered female-associated issues, such as concerns for the earth, spirituality, and environmental activism.&lt;ref name="marler"&gt;Marler, Joan. "The Myth of Universal Patriarchy: A Critical Response to Cynthia Eller's [[Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]". ''Feminist Theology'', Vol. 14, No. 2, 163-87 (2006). For an earlier version of this article, see [http://www.belili.org/marija/eller_response.html Marija Gimbutas].&lt;/ref&gt; The atmosphere this created reignited the study of and debate on matricentricity{{Technical statement|date=May 2013}} as a rejection of [[Biological determinism|determinism]], such as with [[Adrienne Rich]] in ''Of Woman Born'' and [[Marilyn French]] in ''Beyond Power''. For [[socialist feminists]] like [[Evelyn Reed]], patriarchy held the properties of capitalism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13149">{{for|the 1976 book|The Hunting Hypothesis}}
In [[paleoanthropology]], the '''hunting hypothesis''' is the hypothesis that [[human evolution]] was primarily influenced by the activity of [[hunting]] for relatively large and fast animals, and that the activity of  hunting  distinguished human ancestors from other [[hominins]].

While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters, the importance of this fact for the final steps in the emergence of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' out of earlier [[australopithecines]], with its [[bipedalism]] and production of [[stone tool]]s (from about 2.5 million years ago), and eventually also [[control of fire]] (from about 1.5 million years ago), are emphasized in the "hunting hypothesis", and de-emphasized in scenarios that stress the [[omnivore]] status of humans as their recipe for success, and [[social interaction]], including [[mating|mating behaviour]] as essential in the emergence of language and culture.

Advocates of the hunting hypothesis tend to believe that [[tool]] use and toolmaking essential to effective hunting were an extremely important part of human evolution, and trace the  [[origin of language]] and [[prehistoric religion|religion]] to a hunting context.

As societal evidence Buss cites that modern tribal population deploy hunting as their primary way of acquiring food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buss|first1=David|title=Evolutionary Psychology: The new Science of the Mind.|date=1999|publisher=Needham Heights: Allyn &amp; Bacon.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aka people|Aka pygmies]] in the [[Central African Republic]] spend 56% of their quest for nourishment hunting, 27% gathering, and 17% processing food. Additionally, the [[!Kung]] in Botswana retain 40% of their calories from hunting and this percentage varies from 20% to 90% depending on the season.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;Buss, David M. Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2011. Print. 80&lt;/ref&gt;  For physical evidence Buss first looks to the guts of humans and apes.  The human gut consists mainly of the small [[intestines]], which are responsible for the rapid breakdown of proteins and absorption of nutrients. The ape’s gut is primarily [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], which indicates a vegetarian diet. This structural difference supports the hunting hypothesis in being an evolutionary branching point between modern humans and modern primates. Buss also cites human teeth in that fossilized human teeth have a thin enamel coating with very little heavy wear and tear that would result from a plant diet. The absence of thick enamel also indicates that historically humans have maintained a meat-heavy diet.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;  Buss notes that the bones of animals human ancestors killed found at Olduvai Gorge have cut marks at strategic points on the bones that indicate tool usage and provide evidence for ancestral butchers.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

==Applications ==
===[[Sexual division of labor (evolutionary perspective)]]===
According to the hunting hypothesis, women are preoccupied with pregnancy and dependent children and so do not hunt because it is dangerous and less profitable. Gijsbert Stoet highlights the fact that men are more competent in throwing skills, focused attention, and spatial abilities. (Experiments 1 and 2).&lt;ref name = "Stoet"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gisbert | year = 2011 | title = Sex Differences in Search and Gathering Skills | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 416–22 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible explanation for women gathering is their inherent prioritization of rearing offspring, which is difficult to uphold if women were hunting.&lt;ref name="Stoet"/&gt;

==Provisioning hypothesis==
===Parental investment===
Buss purports that the hunting hypothesis explains the high level of human male parental investment in offspring as compared to primates. Meat is an economical and condensed food resource in that it can be brought home to feed the young, however it is not efficient to carry low-calorie food across great distances. Thus, the act of hunting and the required transportation of the kill in order to feed offspring is a reasonable explanation for human male provisioning.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

===Male coalitions===
Buss suggests that the Hunting hypothesis also explains the advent of strong male coalitions. Although chimpanzees form male-male coalitions, they tend to be temporary and opportunistic. Contrastingly, large game hunters require consistent and coordinated cooperation to succeed in large game hunting. Thus male coalitions were the result of working together to succeed in providing meat for the hunters themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Kristen Hawkes suggests further that obtaining resources intended for community consumption increases a male’s fitness by appealing to the male’s society and thus being in the good favor of both males and females. The male relationship would improve hunting success and create alliances for future conflict and the female relationship would improve direct reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; 
Buss proposes alternate explanations of emergence of the strong male coalitions. He suggests that male coalitions may have been the result of group-on-group aggression, defense, and in-group political alliances. This explanation does not support the relationship between male coalitions and hunting.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

Hawkes proposes that hunters pursue large game and divide the kill across the group. Hunters compete to divvy up the kill to signal courage, power, generosity, prosocial intent, and dedication. By engaging in these activities, hunters receive reproductive benefits and respect.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolin | first1 = David A | year = 2010 | title = Food-Sharing Networks in Lamalera, Indonesia | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513811001188 | journal = Human Nature | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 243–68 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.11.003| pmc = 3398706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reproductive benefits lead to greater reproductive success in more skilled hunters.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"/&gt; Evidence of these hunting goals that do not only benefit the families of the hunters are in the [[Aché people|Ache]] and [[Hadza people|Hadza]] men. Hawkes notes that their hunting techniques are less efficient than alternative methods and are energetically costly, but the men place more importance on displaying their bravery, power, and prosocial intent than on hunting efficiency. This method is different as compared to other societies where hunters retain the control of their kills and signal their intent of sharing. This alternate method aligns with the coalition support hypothesis, in efforts to create and preserve political associations.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"/&gt;

===Reciprocal altruism===
The meat from successful large game hunts are more than what a single hunter can consume. Further, hunting success varies by week. One week a hunter may succeed in hunting large game and the next may return with no meat. In this situation Buss suggests that there are low costs to giving away meat that cannot be eaten by the individual hunter on his own and large benefits from the expectation of the returned favor in a week where his hunting is not successful.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Hawkes calls this sharing “tolerated theft” and purports that the benefits of reciprocal altruism stem from the result that families will experience “lower daily variation and higher daily average” in their resources.&lt;ref name = "Hawkes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = Kristen | year = 1991 | title = Showing Off Tests of an Hypothesis About Men's Foraging Goals | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016230959190011E | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 29–54 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(91)90011-E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisioning may actually be a form of sexual competition between males for females.&lt;ref name = "Norton"&gt;Larsen, Clark S. "Early Hominid Origins and Evolution: The Roots of Humanity." Chapter 10:. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, n.d. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.wwnorton.com/college/anthro/our-origins2/ch/10/outline.aspx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkes suggests that male provisioning is a particularly human behavior, which forges the nuclear family.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; The structure of familial provisioning determines a form of resource distribution. However, Hawkes does acknowledge inconsistencies across societies and contexts such as the fluctuating time courses dedicated to hunting and gathering, which are not directly correlated with return rates, the fact that nutrition value is often chosen over caloric count, and the fact that meat is a more widely spread resource than other resources.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

===The show-off hypothesis===
The show-off hypothesis is the concept that more successful men have better mate options. The idea relates back to the fact that meat, the result of hunting expeditions, is a distinct resource in that it comes in large quantities that more often than not the hunter’s own family is not able to consume in a timely manner so that the meat doesn’t go sour.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Also the success of hunting is unpredictable whereas berries and fruits, unless there is a drought or a bad bush, are fairly consistent in seasonality. Kristen Hawkes argues that women favor neighbors opting for men who provide the advantageous, yet infrequent meat feasts.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; These women may profit from alliance and the resulting feasts, especially in times of shortage. Hawkes suggests that it would be beneficial for women to reward men who employ the “show-off strategy” by supporting them in a dispute, caring for their offspring, or providing sexual favors.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; The benefits women may gain from their alignment lie in favored treatment of the offspring spawned by the show-off from neighbors.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; Buss echoes and cites Hawke’s thoughts on the show-off’s benefits in sexual access, increased likelihood of having children, and the favorable treatment his children would receive from the other members of the society.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Hawkes also suggests that show-offs are more likely to live in large groups and thus be less susceptible to predators.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; Show-offs gain more benefits from just sharing with their family (classical fitness) in the potential favorable treatment from the community and reciprocal altruism from other members of the community.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

Hawkes uses the Ache people of Paraguay as evidence for the Show-off hypothesis. Food acquired by men was more widely distributed across the community and inconsistent resources that came in large quantities when acquired were also more widely shared.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

While this is represented in the Ache according to Hawkes, Buss notes that this trend is contradicted in the Hadza who evenly distribute the meat across all members of their population and whose hunters have very little control over the distribution. In the Hadza the show-off hypothesis does not have to do with the resources that result from hunting, but from the prestige and risk that is involved in big game hunting. There are possible circuitous benefits such as protection and defense.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;  
&lt;!-- The following is not a sentence and does not carry a message - please complete if possible.
Why hunters forge male coalitions, even though the hunter’s personal return rate is lower and hunters eat less of their own kill than other family and community members.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4014">'''Ideal observer theory''' is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view which claims that:
# Ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are about the attitudes of a hypothetical ''ideal observer''.

In other words, ideal observer theory states that ethical judgments should be interpreted as statements about the judgments that a neutral and fully informed observer would make; "''x'' is good" means "an ideal observer would approve of ''x''".

{{cquote|The main idea [of the ideal observer theory] is that ethical terms should be defined after the pattern of the following example: "''x'' is better than ''y''" means "If anyone were, in respect of ''x'' and ''y'', fully informed and vividly imaginative, impartial, in a calm frame of mind and otherwise normal, he would ''prefer x'' to ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brandt |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brandt |title=[[Ethical Theory]] |year=1959 |location=[[Englewood Cliffs]] |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |chapter=Ethical Naturalism |pages=173 |lccn=59010075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This makes ideal observer theory arguably a [[ethical subjectivism|subjectivist]]&lt;ref&gt;Brandt 1959, p. 153: "[Objectivism and subjectivism] have been used more vaguely, confusedly, and in more different senses than the others we are considering. We suggest as a convenient usage, however, that a theory be called subjectivist [[if and only if]], according to it, any ethical assertion implies that somebody does, or somebody of a certain sort under certain conditions would, take ''some specified attitude'' toward something."&lt;/ref&gt; yet [[moral universalism|universalist]] form of [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]], though arguably the abstract "ideal observer" may be seen as an objective reference point, thus making ideal observer theory a form of ethical objectivism. Ideal observer theory stands in opposition to other forms of ethical subjectivism (e.g.[[moral relativism]], and [[individualist ethical subjectivism]]), as well as to [[moral realism]] (which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of anyone's attitudes or opinions), [[error theory]] (which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense), and [[non-cognitivism]] (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all).

While [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Hume]] are recognized to have espoused early versions of the ideal observer theory, [[Roderick Firth]] is responsible for starting a more sophisticated modern version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ethical Absolutism and the Ideal Observer |first=Roderick |last=Firth |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=12 |issue=3 |date=March 1952 |pages=317–345 |jstor=2103988}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Firth, an ideal observer has the following specific characteristics: omniscience with respect to nonmoral facts, omnipercipience, disinterestedness, dispassionateness, consistency, and normalcy in all other respects. Notice that, by defining an Ideal Observer as omniscient with respect to nonmoral facts, Firth avoids [[Begging the question|circular logic]] that would arise from defining an ideal observer as omniscient in both nonmoral and moral facts. A complete knowledge of morality is not born of itself but is an [[Emergence|emergent property]] of Firth's minimal requirements. There are also sensible restrictions to the trait of omniscience with respect to nonmoral facts. For instance, a geological event in another [[Solar System|solar system]] is hardly something necessary to know to make a moral judgment about a case of theft or murder on [[Earth]].

Those proposing the ideal observer theory do not necessarily assert that any real ideal observers actually exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6927">An '''idiosyncrasy''' is an unusual feature of a person (though there are also other uses, see below). It can also mean an odd habit. The term is often used to express [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or peculiarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rundell|first=Michael|title=Macmillan English Dictionary|year=2002|publisher=Schroedel Diesterweg|location=Hannover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/idiosyncrasy |title=Idiosyncrasy |accessdate=October 26, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028200843/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/idiosyncrasy |archivedate=October 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[synonym]] may be "[[wikt:quirk|quirk]]".

==Etymology==
The term "idiosyncrasy" originates from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἰδιοσυνκρασία#Ancient Greek|ἰδιοσυνκρασία]]}} ''idiosynkrasía'', "a peculiar temperament, habit of body" (from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἴδιος#Ancient Greek|ἴδιος]]}} ''idios'', "one's own", {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σύν#Ancient Greek|σύν]]}} ''syn'', "with" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κρᾶσις#Ancient Greek|κρᾶσις]]}} ''krasis'', "government") or literally "self-ruled".

==Linguistics==
The term can also be applied to [[symbol]]s or words. ''Idiosyncratic symbols'' mean one thing for a particular person, as a blade could mean [[war]], but to someone else, it could symbolize a [[surgery]].

===Idiosyncratic property===
In [[phonology]], an ''idiosyncratic property'' contrasts with a ''systematic regularity''. While systematic regularities in the sound system of a language are useful for identifying phonological rules during analysis of the forms morphemes can take, idiosyncratic properties are those whose occurrence is ''not'' determined by those rules. For example, the fact that the English word ''cab'' starts with a /k/ is an idiosyncratic property; on the other hand that its vowel is long is a systematic regularity, as it arises from the fact that final consonant is voiced rather than voiceless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0q0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=phonology+idiosyncratic+property&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gx-UQZ7tjQ&amp;sig=cbIcFJcdWz43NBqQcIsSX5unVi4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV17SmmoHZAhVNwlkKHV8cAf4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=phonology%20idiosyncratic%20property&amp;f=false|title=Generative Phonology: Description and Theory|author=Michael Kenstowicz, Charles Kisseberth|accessdate=30 January 2018|publisher=Academic Press|date=10 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509175337/https://books.google.com/books?id=a0q0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=phonology+idiosyncratic+property&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gx-UQZ7tjQ&amp;sig=cbIcFJcdWz43NBqQcIsSX5unVi4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV17SmmoHZAhVNwlkKHV8cAf4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=phonology%20idiosyncratic%20property&amp;f=false|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==

===Disease===
Idiosyncrasy defined the way physicians conceived [[disease]]s in the 19th century. They considered each disease as a unique condition, related to each patient. This understanding began to change in the 1870s, when discoveries made by researchers in [[Europe]] permitted the advent of a "scientific medicine", a precursor to the [[evidence-based medicine]] that is the standard of practice today. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Pharmacology===
The term [[idiosyncratic drug reaction]] denotes an aberrant or bizarre reaction or [[hypersensitivity]] to a substance, without connection to the pharmacology of the drug. It is what is known as a Type B reaction. Type B reactions have the following characteristics: They are usually unpredictable, might not be picked up by toxicological screening, not necessarily dose-related, incidence and morbidity low but mortality is high. Type B reactions are most commonly immunological (e.g. penicillin allergy){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Psychiatry and psychology===
In [[psychiatry]], the term means a specific and unique mental condition of a patient, often accompanied by [[neologism]]s. In [[psychoanalysis]] and [[behaviorism]], it is used for the personal way a given individual reacts, perceives and experiences a common situation: a certain dish made of meat may cause [[nostalgic]] memories in one person and disgust in another. These reactions are called ''idiosyncratic''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Economics==
In [[portfolio theory]], risks of price changes due to the unique circumstances of a specific security, as opposed to the overall market, are called "idiosyncratic risks". This specific risk, also called unsystematic, can be nulled out of a portfolio through diversification. Pooling multiple securities means the specific risks cancel out. In [[complete market]]s, there is no compensation for idiosyncratic risk—that is, a security's idiosyncratic risk does not matter for its price. For instance, in a complete market in which the [[capital asset pricing model]] holds, the price of a security is determined by the amount of [[systematic risk]] in its returns. Net income received, or losses suffered, by a [[landlord]] from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to idiosyncratic risk due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.&lt;ref name=NYT032913&gt;{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330081922/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|archivedate=March 30, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one macroeconomic model including a financial sector,&lt;ref&gt;Brunnermeier, Markus K. and Sannikov, Yuliy, "[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160894 A macroeconomic model with a financial sector]" (April 8, 2012). National Bank of Belgium Working Paper No. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; hedging idiosyncratic risk can be self-defeating as it leads to higher systemic risk, as it takes on more leverage. This makes the system less stable. Thus, while securitisation in principle reduces the costs of idiosyncratic shocks it ends up amplifying systemic risks in equilibrium.

In [[econometrics]], "idiosyncratic error" is used to describe error from [[panel data]] that both changes over time and across units (individuals, firms, cities, etc.)

==History==
In 2008, the [[DARPA|US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] provided a $4 million grant to the [[University of California, Irvine|University of California (Irvine)]], with the intent of providing a foundation for [[synthetic telepathy]]. According to DARPA, the project “will allow user-to-user communication on the battlefield without the use of vocalized speech through neural signals analysis. The brain generates word-specific signals prior to sending electrical impulses to the vocal cords. These '''''imagined speech''''' signals would be analyzed and translated into distinct words allowing covert person-to-person communication.”&lt;ref name="Bogue2010" /&gt;

DARPA's program outline has three major goals:&lt;ref name="Bogue2010" /&gt;
:* To attempt to identify EEG patterns unique to individual words
:* To ensure these patterns are common to different users to avoid extensive device training
:* To construct a [[prototype]] that would decode the signals and transmit them over a limited range

==Methods for detection==
The process for analyzing subjects' ''silent speech'' is composed of recording subjects’ [[Neural oscillation|brain waves]], and then using a computer to process the data and determine the content of the subjects' ''covert speech''.

===Recording===
Subject [[EEG#Waves|neural patterns]] (brain waves) can be recorded using [[Brain-computer_interface#Human_BCI_research|BCI devices]];&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010b" /&gt; currently, use of non-invasive devices,&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010a" /&gt; specifically the EEG, is of greater interest to researchers than [[Brain-computer_interface#Human_BCI_research|invasive and partially invasive types]]. This is because non-invasive types pose the least risk to subject health;&lt;ref name="Bogue2010" /&gt; EEG's have attracted the greatest interest because they offer the most user-friendly approach in addition to having far less complex [[instrumentation]] than that of [[FMRI|functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI’s)]],&lt;ref name="Bogue2010" /&gt; another commonly used non-invasive BCI.&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010b" /&gt;

===Processing===
The first step in processing non-invasive data is to remove [[EEG#Artifacts|artifacts]] such as eye movement and blinking, as well as other [[electromyographic]] activity.&lt;ref name="Porbadnigk2009" /&gt; After artifact-removal, a series of [[algorithm]]s is used to translate raw data into the '''''imagined speech''''' content.&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010a" /&gt; Processing is also intended to occur in real-time—the information is processed as it is recorded, which allows for near-simultaneous viewing of the content as the subject imagines it.

===Decoding===
Presumably, “thinking in the form of sound” recruits auditory and language areas whose activation profiles may be extracted from the EEG, given adequate processing. The goal is to relate these signals to a template that represents “what the person is thinking about”. This template could for instance be the acoustic envelope (energy) timeseries corresponding to sound if it were physically uttered. Such mapping from EEG to stimulus is an example of [[neural decoding]] techniques.

A major problem however is the many variations that the very same message can have under diverse physical conditions (speaker or noise, for example). Hence one can have the same EEG signal, but it is uncertain, at least in acoustic terms, what stimulus to map it to. This in turn makes it difficult to train the relevant decoder.

This process could instead be approached using higher-order (‘linguistic’) representations of the message. The mappings to such representations are non-linear and can be heavily context-dependent, therefore further research may be necessary. Nevertheless, it is known that an 'acoustic' strategy can still be maintained by pre-setting a “template” by making it known to the listener exactly what message to think about, even if passively, and in a non-explicit form. In these circumstances it is possible to partially decode the acoustic envelope of speech message from neural timeseries if the listener is induced to think in the form of sound&lt;ref name="CervantesConstantino_&amp;_Simon_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simon|first2=JZ|year=2018|title=Restoration and Efficiency of the Neural Processing of Continuous Speech Are Promoted by Prior Knowledge|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=56|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2018.00056 |last1=Cervantes Constantino|first1=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Challenges==
In detection of other imagined actions, such as imagined physical movements, greater brain activity occurs in one [[Hemisphere (brain)|hemisphere]] over the other. This presence of asymmetrical activity acts as a major aid in identifying the subject's imagined action. In '''''imagined speech''''' detection however, equal levels of activity commonly occur in both the [[Hemisphere (brain)|left and right hemispheres]] simultaneously. This lack of [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralization]] demonstrates a significant challenge in analyzing neural signals of this type.&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010b" /&gt;

Another unique challenge is a relatively low [[Signal-to-noise ratio|signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]] in the recorded data. A SNR represents the amount of meaningful signals found in a data set, compared to the amount of arbitrary or useless signals present in the same set. Artifacts present in EEG data are just one of many significant sources of noise.&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010a" /&gt;

To further complicate matters, the relative placement of EEG electrodes will vary amongst subjects. This is because the [[anatomical]] details of people's heads will differ; therefore, the signals recorded will vary in each subject, regardless of individuals-specific imagined speech characteristics.&lt;ref name="Porbadnigk2009" /&gt;

==Limitations for practical communication==
Foremost, EEG use requires meticulously securing electrodes onto a subject’s head; the electrodes are connected through a web of wires tethered to a [[CPU]]. So, creating an everyday, user-friendly communicator requires a further development of compacting EEGs and their signal-processors into an easy-to-use, lightweight, and fashionable device. (e.g. a headband with [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Bluetooth]])

In addition, current detection methods cannot distinguish between more than two signals (i.e. /ba/ or /ku/, yes or no). Therefore, a significant advancement in EEG processing algorithms is still required. This may suggest that an overall understanding of human-information-processing patterns must be better understood first, as it would offer insight into classifying word-specific neural-patterns common to all people.

'''Infant crying''' is the crying of infants as a response to an internal or external [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]].

==Physiology==
Crying may elicit the [[Valsalva maneuver|Valsalva reflex]]. This reflex negatively impacts [[breastfeeding|sucking]] [[Suction|pressure]]s and results in poor feeding. The [[cortisol]] levels will rise along with [[blood pressure]]. Increased blood pressure will have an effect on [[cerebral blood flow]], [[cerebral blood flow velocity]] and [[intracranial pressure]]. Increased pressures and velocity can lead to [[intracranial hemmorrhage]]. Prolonged exhalation may also cause some [[adverse effect]]s. Obstructed [[venous return]] and quick inspiratory gasp can occur. [[Foramen ovale (heart)|Foramen ovale]] shunting can occur.{{sfn | Walker | page = 210}} Adults can often determine whether an infant's cries signify [[anger]] or [[pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeskind|first=P.

==Misconceptions==
Misconceptions regarding the purpose of crying in the infant are common among caregivers and medical personnel.

===Colic===

==Maternal responses==
Crying in infants is associated with high stress levels and depression in mothers.&lt;ref name=AFP2015&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/2015/1001/p577.html|last1=Johnson|first1=JD|last2=Cocker|first2=K|last3=Chang|first3=E|title=Infantile Colic: Recognition and Treatment|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 October 2015 |accessdate = 22 July 2017| volume=92|issue=7|pages=577–82|pmid=26447441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hu&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maternal anxiety versus depressive disorders: specific relations to infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems|first1=J.|last1=Petzoldt|first2=H.-U.|last2=Wittchen|first3=F.|last3=Einsle|first4=J.|last4=Martini|date=1 March 2016|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|volume=42|issue=2|pages=231–245|doi=10.1111/cch.12292|pmid=26490836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Fallon|last2=Seymour|first2=Monique|last3=Giallo|first3=Rebecca|last4=Cann|first4=Warren|last5=Nicholson|first5=Jan M.|last6=Green|first6=Julie|last7=Hiscock|first7=Harriet|title=Comparison of methods for recruiting and engaging parents in online interventions: study protocol for the Cry Baby infant sleep and settling program|journal=BMC Pediatrics|volume=15|issue=1|pages=174|year=2015|doi=10.1186/s12887-015-0502-9|pmid=26556032|pmc=4640160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive crying has also been linked to maternal "physical aggression" and "angry speaking". The burden of care of the mother, that is, mothers without assistance in caring for the infant, are more prone to physical aggression and angry speaking.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt; During evaluations of maternal depression responses to infant crying, sleeping problems are closely associated with excessive crying and may confound the conclusions of such research. Also, it is not always clear that when sleeping problems are associated with infant crying, whether the sleeping problems are descriptive of the mother or the infant or both.&lt;ref name = hu/&gt; Maternal stress is associated with excessive crying.&lt;ref name=Ia2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iacovou|first=M|author2=Ralston, RA |author3=Muir, J |author4=Walker, KZ |author5= Truby, H |title=Dietary management of infantile colic: a systematic review.|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|date=August 2012|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1319–31|pmid=21710185|doi=10.1007/s10995-011-0842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on young children==
One definition used to study excessive crying in infants is crying for three or more hours per 24 hours. Excessive infant crying has been associated with a twofold increased risk of the overall problem behavior, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6. Excessive infant crying doubles the risk of behavioral, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6, as reported by their mother. Excessive crying is not the only factor in later childhood difficulties. Behavioral problems in childhood include the so-called regulatory problems, such as excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding problems, which occur in 20% of infants in multiproblem families. Excessive crying, whining and sleeping problems at 4–6 months are associated with decreased social development at 12 months.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Several factors may contribute to, and partly explain, an association between excessive infant crying and later behavioral and emotional problems. During early infancy, the quality of the mother–child dyad can be considered to be a crucial vehicle for child’s healthy mental development. Both early maternal and early paternal reciprocity in infancy are predictive of social competence and lower aggression in preschoolers.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Compared to other infants, excessive crying infants had a slightly lower birth weight and a slightly younger gestational age. Excessive crying infants more often had a single, lower educated mother, originating from a non-industrialized country, who reported more depression, a higher burden of infant care, and more aggressive behavior and had an authoritarian parenting style. Excessive crying was associated with a higher risk for hyperactivity/inattention problems, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer relationship problems, and overall problem behavior at the age of 5–6, as well as a higher risk for decreased pro-social behavior as reported by the mother. Excessive crying was also associated with mood problems as well as generalized anxiety problems at the age of 5–6.&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;

==Abuse==
{{Main|Abusive head trauma}}

===Normal crying===
The physical abuse of infants is related to crying.&lt;ref name = reij&gt;{{cite journal|title=Infant crying and abuse|first1=Sijmen A.|last1=Reijneveld|first2=Marcel F.|last2=van der Wal|first3=Emily|last3=Brugman|first4=Remy A.

This is the most common cause of child abuse death. Fathers are often the ones who shake the infant. Shaking may occur many times. This shaking can cause serious injuries in almost 50% of the time. Some caregivers are unaware that shaking the baby can seriously harm or kill the infant. This type of abuse is being addressed by efforts to educate parents and caregivers with educational flyers and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Parents' behavior in response to infant crying: Abusive head trauma education|first1=Hina|last1=Simonnet|first2=Anne|last2=Laurent-Vannier|first3=Wenlun|last3=Yuan|first4=Marie|last4=Hully|first5=Sakil|last5=Valimahomed|first6=Malek|last6=Bourennane|first7=Mathilde|last7=Chevignard|date=1 December 2014|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1914–1922|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.06.002|pmid=25043922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and treatment==
Infant crying is worse in the first few months of life, but improves as the child grows. A baby can sometimes be calmed by rocking gently, offering a pacifier, singing or talking softly, taking a walk with a stroller, or going for a drive in the car. If a baby won’t stop crying, it can be sick and seen by a doctor. Frustration and stress can be overwhelming for those with a crying infant. If caregivers feel as if they may lose control there are preventative measures that can be taken. The caregiver may benefit by calling a friend, relative, neighbor, or parent helpline for support. Another suggestion is to  put the baby in a safe place and walk away. The baby can be checked  every 5 to 10 minutes. 
Babies may be in danger if a person who is easily irritated or has a temper or history of violence cares for or watches the baby.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/abusive-head-trauma.html {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When "normal" causes of excessive crying are ruled out, some caregivers adopt alternative and complementary treatments for excessive crying. Those practices include: 
* Eliminating milk products, eggs, wheat, and nuts from the diet of breastfeeding mothers
* Feeding infants fiber-enriched formula; not proven to be of benefit for most infants
* Counseling parents about specific colic-management techniques; not proven to be effective for most infants
* Infant massage; not proven to be effective or recommended&lt;ref name = roberts/&gt;

Those who realize that an infant can be in a situation where abuse is a possibility, support can be offered to give a parent or caregiver a break when needed. Education and understanding can let the parent know that dealing with a crying baby can be very frustrating—especially when they are tired or stressed, but infant crying is normal and it will pass. Parents can be encouraged to take a calming break if needed while the baby is safe in the crib. Others can be sensitive and supportive in situations when parents are trying to calm a crying baby.

In [[Christian theology]], '''''kenosis''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Lang|el|κένωσις}}, ''kénōsis'', lit. [the act of emptying]) is the 'self-emptying' of Jesus' own will and becoming entirely receptive to [[God|God's]] divine will.

The word {{lang|el|ἐκένωσεν}} (''ekénōsen'') is used in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] [http://interlinearbible.org/philippians/2-7.htm 2:7], "&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Jesus]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; made himself nothing ..."{{Bibleref2c|Phil.|2:7|NIV}} ([[New International Version|NIV]]) or "...[he] emptied himself..."{{Bibleref2c|Phil.|2:7|NRSV}} ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]), using the verb form {{lang|el|κενόω}} (''kenóō'') "to empty". 

==Etymology and definition==
Etymology is from Greek {{lang|el|κενόω}} (''kenóō'') "to empty out". The Liddell–Scott [[Greek–English Lexicon]] gives the following simplified definition simplified for the noun:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Fnwsis&amp;highlight=empty κέν-ωσις , εως]&amp;nbsp;— A. emptying, depletion, {{lang|el|οὐχὶ πεῖνα καὶ δίψα}} . . {{lang|el|κενώσεις τινές εἰσι}} . . ; [[Plato]] [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] 585b, cf.

The New Testament does not use the actual noun ''kénōsis''&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians (ed. Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort) in I Corinthians, chapter 9: ... {{lang|el|γάρ μοι μᾶλλον ἀποθανεῖν ἢ&amp;nbsp;– τὸ καύχημά μου οὐδεὶς '''κενώσει'''. ἐὰν γὰρ εὐαγγελίζωμαι, οὐκ ἔστιν μοι καύχημα, ἀνάγκη}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the verb form ''kenóō'' occurs five times (Ro.4:14, 1Co.1:17, 9:15, 2Co.9:3, Phil.2:7). Of these five times it is Phil 2:7, in which Jesus is said to have "emptied himself", which is the starting point of Christian ideas of kenosis.

[[John the Baptist]] displayed the attitude when he said of Jesus, "He must become greater; I must become less." (Jn 3:30).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://padretex.com/?p=27 |title=The Initial Movement of the Eucharist |author=Fr. J.

==In Christology==

===Kenotic ethic===
The '''kenotic ethic''' is the [[ethic]] of [[Jesus]], considered as the ethic of [[sacrifice]]. The Philippians passage urges believers to imitate Christ's self-emptying. In this interpretation, Paul was not primarily putting forth a theory about God in this passage, rather he was using God's humility exhibited in the incarnation event as a call for Christians to be similarly subservient to others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jay Oord]] ''Defining Love: A Philosophical, Scientific, and Theological Engagement'', Brazos Press, 2010. 1-58743-257-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oord. T.J. "Essential Kenosis" in ''The Nature of Love: A Theology'', Chalice Press, 2010. {{ISBN|978-082720828-5}} pp. 149,155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John of the Cross===
{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}
In [[Christian theology]], ''kenosis'' is the concept of the 'self-emptying' of one's own will and becoming entirely receptive to God and the divine will. It is used both as an explanation of the [[Incarnation]], and an indication of the nature of God's activity and will. [[Mystical theology|Mystical theologian]] [[John of the Cross]]' work "[[Dark Night of the Soul]]" is a particularly lucid explanation of God's process of transforming the believer into the icon or "likeness of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kieran Kavanaugh, O.C.D; Otilio Rodriguez, O.C.D]] ''The collected Works of St. John of The Cross'', ICS Publications, 1991. pp. 353-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The Orthodox Mystical Theology of the East emphasises following the example of Christ. Kenosis is only possible through humility and presupposes that one seeks union with God.  The [[Poustinia]] tradition of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is one major expression of this search.

Kenosis is not only a Christological issue in Orthodox theology, it has moreover to do with [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|Pneumatology]], namely to do with the Holy Spirit. Kenosis, relative to the human nature, denotes the continual [[epiklesis]] and self-denial of one's own human will and desire. With regard to Christ, there is a kenosis of the Son of God, a condescension and self-sacrifice for the redemption and salvation of all humanity. Humanity can also participate in God's saving work through [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]; becoming holy by grace.&lt;ref&gt;"The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of God the Son with the God the Father." Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92-95 [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0824/_P16.HTM#N5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, in Eastern Orthodoxy, theosis never concerns becoming like God in essence or being, which is [[pantheism]]; instead, it concerns becoming united to God by grace, through his [[Essence-Energies distinction|Energies]]. Orthodox theology distinguishes between divine [[Essence-Energies distinction|Essence and Energies]]. Kenosis therefore is a paradox and a mystery since "emptying oneself" in fact fills the person with divine grace and results in union with God. Kenosis in Orthodox theology is the transcending or detaching of oneself from the world or the passions, it is a component of dispassionation. Much of the earliest debates between the Arian and Orthodox Christians were over kenosis. The need for clarification about the human and divine nature of the Christ (see the [[hypostatic union]]) were fought over the meaning and example that Christ set, as an example of kenosis or ekkenosis.&lt;ref&gt;"The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of
God the Son with the God the Father." Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92-95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
Another perspective is the idea that God is self-emptying. He poured out himself to create the [[cosmos]] and the [[universe]], and everything within it. Therefore, it is our duty to pour out ourselves. (This is similar to C.S. Lewis's statement in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that a painter pours his ideas out in his work, and yet remains quite a distinct being from his painting.)

===Roman Catholicism===
[[Pope]] [[Pius XII]] in 1951 wrote ''[[Sempiternus Rex Christus]]'', in which he condemns a particular interpretation of [[Philippians]] in regards to the kenosis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is another enemy of the [[Chalcedonian Definition|faith of Chalcedon]], widely diffused outside  the fold of the Catholic religion. This is an opinion for which a rashly and falsely understood sentence of St. Paul's Epistle to the Philippians (ii, 7), supplies a basis and a shape. This is called the  kenotic doctrine, and according to it, they imagine that the divinity was taken away from the Word in Christ. It is a wicked invention, equally to be condemned with the [[Docetism]] opposed to it. It reduces the whole mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption to empty the bloodless imaginations. 'With the entire and perfect nature of man'—thus grandly St. [[Leo the Great]]—'He Who was true God was born, complete in his own nature, complete in ours' (Ep. xxviii, 3. PL. Liv, 763. Cf. Serm. xxiii, 2. PL. lvi, 201).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_pi12sr.htm Sempiternus Rex Christus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unitarianism===
Since some forms of [[Unitarianism]] do not accept the personal [[pre-existence of Christ]] their interpretations of Phil. 2:7, and the concept of "kenosis", Christ "emptying" himself, take as a starting point that his "emptying" occurred in life, and not before birth. However, as [[Thomas Belsham]] put it, there are varying views on when in life this emptying occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Belsham ''American Unitarianism: or A Brief history of the progress and present state of the Unitarian Churches in America'' 1816 p. 119 "In answer to the inquiry ; when was it, after entering on bis publick ministry, that Christ emptied himself of the form of God, and look on him the form of a servant and the fashion of a man?"&lt;/ref&gt; Belsham took this to be at the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], whereas [[Joseph Priestley]]&lt;ref&gt;Belsham, op. cit., p. 119 citing Priestley's ''Letters'' p139&lt;/ref&gt; took this to be in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] when Christ did not resist arrest. The [[Christadelphian]] Tom Barling considered that the "emptying" of Christ was a continual process which started in the earliest references to Christ's character, Luke 2:40,52, and continued through the [[temptations of Christ]] and his [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Barling ''The Letter to the Philippians'' CMPA Birmingham 1957 p46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gnosticism===
The equivalent to kenōsis in Gnostic literature is Christ's withdrawal of his own luminosity into himself, so as to cease dazzling his own disciples. At the request of his disciples, "Jesus drew to himself the glory of his light".&lt;ref&gt;G. R. S. Mead (translator) : ''Pistis Sophia''. (lib. 1, cap. 6) ) http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ps/ps010.htm (p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; There are parallels to this voluntary withdrawal of the incarnate deity's light in the literatures of other religions also, such as in Daoism, where when the incarnate deity "Crane Boy" came to the world of humans in his incarnation as Han Xiangzi, he "concealed his auspicious light, left the underworld, and returned to the world of humans."&lt;ref&gt;Yang Erzeng (translated by Philip Clart) : ''The Story of Han Xiangzi''. University of Washington Press, Seattle, 2007. {{ISBN|0-295-98690-5}}. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
A variety of different authors, theories and fields purport influences between '''language and thought'''. Psychologists attempt to explain the emergence of thought and language in [[human evolution]].

There are two bodies of thought forming around this debate. Lingualism, which claims that there is no thought without language{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs references to reliable sources.|date=January 2018}} and denies the intelligibility of any kind of thought whatsoever in the absence of language.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs references to reliable sources.|date=January 2018}} And on the opposing side, there are '[[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]]' theories which believe that public language is inessential to private thought.

The main use of [[language]] is to transfer thoughts from one mind, to another mind. The bits of linguistic information that enter into one person's mind, from another, cause people to entertain a new thought with profound effects on his world knowledge, inferencing, and subsequent behavior. Language neither creates nor distorts conceptual life. Thought comes first, while language is an expression. There are certain limitations among language, and humans cannot express all that they think.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila|date=2005|title=Language and thought|url=https://mudarwan.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/the-cambridge-handbook-of-thinking-and-reasoning_2005.pdf#page=626|journal=Cambridge handbook of thinking and reasoning|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lingualism ==
Lingualism is the belief that the absence of language is the absence of thought. Other beliefs which are tied to Lingualism is the idea that having language crucially sharpens cognitive abilities. Arguments for lingualism include, holism of the mental, or the concept of belief which requires language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lot-hypo/|title=Language of Thought Hypothesis {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language of thought ==
Language of thought theories rely on the belief that mental representation has linguistic structure. Thoughts are "sentences in the head", meaning they take place within a mental language. Two theories work in support of the language of thought theory. Causal syntactic theory of mental practices hypothesizes that mental processes are causal processes defined over the syntax of mental representations. [[Mental representation|Representational theory of mind]] hypothesizes that propositional attitudes are relations between subjects and mental representations. In tandem, these theories explain how the brain can produce rational thought and behavior. All three of these theories were inspired by the development of modern logical inference. They were also inspired by [[Alan Turing]]'s work on causal processes that require formal procedures within physical machines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birjandi|first=Parvis|date=|title=A Review of the Language-Thought Debate: Multivariant Perspectives|url=|journal=Islamic Azad University (Science and Research Branch)|volume=|pages=|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LOTH hinges on the belief that the mind works like a computer, always in computational processes. The theory believes that mental representation has both a combinatorial syntax and [[compositional semantics]]. The claim is that mental representations possess combinatorial syntax and compositional semantic—that is, mental representations are sentences in a mental language. Alan Turing's work on physical machines implementation of causal processes that require formal procedures was modeled after these beliefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Scientific hypotheses==
* The '''[[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]''' in [[linguistics]] states that the grammatical structure of a mother language influences the way we perceive the world. The hypothesis has been largely abandoned by linguists as it has found very limited experimental support, at least in its strong form. For instance, a study showing that speakers of languages lacking a [[subjunctive]] mood such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] experience difficulty with hypothetical problems has been discredited. Another study did show that subjects in memory tests are more likely to remember a given color if their mother language includes a word for that color; however, these findings do not necessarily support this hypothesis specifically.
* Chomsky's independent theory, founded by [[Noam Chomsky]], considers language as one aspect of cognition. Chomsky's theory states that a number of cognitive systems exist, which seem to possess distinct specific properties. These cognitive systems lay the groundwork for cognitive capacities, like language faculty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
* [[Piaget's cognitive determinism]] exhibits the belief that infants integrate experience into progressively higher-level representations. He calls this belief [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]], which supports that infants progress from simple to sophisticated models of the world through a change mechanism that allows an infant to build on their lower-level representations to create higher-level ones. This view opposes nativist theories about cognition being composed of innate knowledge and abilities. 
* [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]]'s theory on cognitive development, known as Vygotsky's theory of interchanging roles, supports the idea that social and individual development stems from the processes of dialectical interaction and function unification. Lev Vygotsky believed that before two years of age, both speech and thought develop in differing ways along with differing functions. The idea that relationship between thought and speech is ever-changing, supports Vygotsky's claims. Vygotsky's theory claims that thought and speech have different genetic roots. And at the age of two, a child's thought and speech collide, and the relationship  between thought and speech shifts. Thought then becomes verbal and speech then becomes rational.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* According to the theory behind '''[[cognitive therapy]]''', founded by [[Aaron T. Beck]], our emotions and behavior are caused by our [[Inner voice|internal dialogue]]. We can change ourselves by learning to challenge and refute our own thoughts, especially a number of specific mistaken thought patterns called "[[cognitive distortion]]s". Cognitive therapy has been found to be effective by [[empirical]] studies.
* In '''[[behavioral economics]]''', according to experiments said to support the theoretical [[availability heuristic]], people believe events that are more vividly described are more probable than those that are not. Simple experiments that asked people to imagine something led them to believe it to be more likely. The [[mere exposure effect]] may also be relevant to propagandistic repetition like the [[Big Lie]]. According to [[prospect theory]], people make different economic choices based on how the matter is [[Framing effect (psychology)|framed]].

== Examples ==

===Counting===
Different cultures use numbers in different ways. The [[Munduruku]] culture for example, has number words only up to five. In addition, they refer to the number 5 as "a hand" and the number 10 as "two hands". Numbers above 10 are usually referred to as "many".

Perhaps the most different [[counting]] system from that of modern Western civilisation is the "one-two-many" system used by the [[Pirahã people]]. In this system, quantities larger than two are referred to simply as "many". In larger quantities, "one" can also mean a small amount and "many" a larger amount. Research was conducted in the Pirahã culture using various matching tasks. These are non-linguistic tasks that were analyzed to see if their counting system or more importantly their language affected their cognitive abilities. The results showed that they perform quite differently from, for example, an English speaking person who has a language with words for numbers more than two. For example, they were able to represent numbers 1 and 2 accurately using their fingers but as the quantities grew larger (up to 10), their accuracy diminished. This phenomenon is also called the "analog estimation", as numbers get bigger the estimation grows.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, P., (2004). Numerical Cognition Without Words: Evidence from Amazonia. Science. 306, pp.496-499.&lt;/ref&gt; Their declined performance is an  example of how a language can affect thought and great evidence to support the [[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis]].

===Orientation===
Language also seems to shape how people from different cultures [[Orientation (geometry)|orient]] themselves in space. For instance, people from the Australian Aboriginal community [[Pormpuraaw]] define space relative to the observer. Instead of referring to location in terms like "left", "right", "back" and "forward", most Aboriginal Nations, such as the [[Kuuk Thaayorre]], use cardinal-direction terms  – north, south, east and west.  For example, speakers from such cultures would say "There is a spider on your northeast leg" or "Pass the ball to the south southwest". In fact, instead of "hello", the greeting in such cultures is "Where are you going?" and sometimes even "Where are you coming from?" Such greeting would be followed by a directional answer "To the northeast in the middle distance". The consequence of using such language is that the speakers need to be constantly oriented in space, or they would not be able to express themselves properly, or even get past a greeting. Speakers of such languages that rely on absolute reference frames have a much greater navigational ability and spatial knowledge compared to speakers of languages that use relative reference frames (such as English). In comparison with English users, speakers of languages such as Kuuk Thaayorre are also much better at staying oriented even in unfamiliar spaces – and it is in fact their language that enables them to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Boroditsky, L. (2009, June 12). How Does Our Language Shape the Way We Think? . Edge.org. Retrieved March 18, 2013, from http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/boroditsky09/boroditsky09_index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color===
{{See also|Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate}}
Language may influence color processing. Having more names for different colors, or different shades of colors, makes it easier both for children and for adults to recognize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel L.|title=Psychology Second Edition|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=41 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|pages=360–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found that all languages have names for black and white and that the colors defined by each language follow a certain pattern (i.e. a language with three colors also defines red, one with four defines green OR yellow, one with six defines blue, then brown, then other colors).&lt;ref name=BCT&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berlin|first1=Brent|last2=Kay|first2=Paul|title=Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution|date=1969|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other schools of thought==
* '''[[General semantics]]''' is a school of thought founded by engineer [[Alfred Korzybski]] in the 1930s and later popularized by [[S.I. Hayakawa]] and others, which attempted to make language more precise and objective. It makes many basic observations of the [[English language]], particularly pointing out problems of abstraction and definition. General semantics is presented as both a theoretical and a practical system whose adoption can reliably alter human behavior in the direction of greater sanity. It is considered to be a branch of natural science and includes methods for the stimulation of the activities of the human cerebral cortex, which is generally judged by experimentation. In this theory, semantics refers to the total response to events and actions, not just the words. The neurological, emotional, cognitive, semantic, and behavioral reactions to events determines the semantic response of a situation. This reaction can be referred to as semantic response, evaluative response, or total response.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, K. (2012). General Semantics. Retrieved March 31, 2013, from http://www.trans4mind.com/personal_development/KenGenSemantics.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[E-prime]]''' is a [[constructed language]] identical to the [[English language]] but lacking all forms of "[[copula (linguistics)|to be]]". Its proponents claim that [[dogma]]tic thinking seems to rely on "to be" language constructs, and so by removing it we may discourage dogmatism.
* '''[[Neuro-linguistic programming]]''', founded by [[Richard Bandler]] and [[John Grinder]], claims that language "patterns" and other things can affect thought and behavior. It takes ideas from General Semantics and [[hypnosis]], especially that of the famous therapist [[Milton Erickson]]. Many do not consider it a credible study, and it has no empirical scientific support.
* Advocates of '''[[non-sexist language]]''' including some [[feminism|feminists]] say that the English language perpetuates biases against women, such as using male-gendered terms such as "he" and "man" as generic. Many authors including those who write textbooks now conspicuously avoid that practice, in the case of the previous examples using words like "he or she" or "they" and "human race".
* Various other schools of '''[[persuasion]]''' directly suggest using language in certain ways to change the minds of others, including [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[advertising]], [[debate]], [[sales]], and [[rhetoric]]. The ancient [[sophist]]s discussed and listed many [[figure of speech|figures of speech]] such as [[enthymeme]] and [[euphemism]]. The modern [[public relations]] term for adding persuasive elements to the interpretation of and commentary on news is called [[spin (public relations)|spin]].

==Popular culture==
The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is the premise of the 2016 [[science fiction]] film ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]''. The protagonist explains that "the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is the theory that the language you speak determines how you think".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The science behind the movie ‘Arrival’| work = Washington Post| accessdate = 2017-04-23| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-science-behind-the-movie-arrival/2016/11/14/5e344114-a6a7-11e6-ba59-a7d93165c6d4_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1198">In [[spacecraft]] operations, The '''Launch and Early Orbit phase''' ('''LEOP''') is one of the most critical phases of a mission. Spacecraft operations [[engineers]] take control of the [[satellite]] after it separates from the [[launch vehicle]] up to the time when the satellite is safely positioned in its final [[orbit]].

During this period, operations staff works 24 hours a day to activate, monitor and control the various [[subsystems]] of the satellite, including the deployment of any satellite appendages ([[antennas]], [[Photovoltaic module|solar array]], [[Reflector_(antenna)|reflector]], etc.), and undertake critical orbit and [[attitude control]] manoeuvres.

For [[geostationary satellites]], the launch vehicle typically carries the spacecraft to Geostationary Transfer Orbit, or GTO. From this [[elliptical]] orbit, the LEOP generally includes a sequence of [[Liquid Apogee Engine|apogee engine]] firings to reach the circular [[geostationary orbit]].

'''Legal observers''' are individuals, usually representatives of civilian [[human rights]] agencies, who attend [[Demonstration (people)|public demonstrations]], [[protest]]s and other activities where there is a potential for conflict between the public or activists and the [[police]], [[security guard]]s, or other law enforcement personnel. The purpose of legal observers is to monitor, record, and report on any unlawful or improper behaviour. Legal or human rights observers act as an independent third party within a conflictual civil protest context, observing police behaviour in order to keep police accountable for their actions. Legal observers can write [[incident report]]s describing police violence and misbehaviour and compile reports after the event. The use of video and still cameras, incident reports and audio recorders is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.activistrights.org.au/cb_pages/organising_legal_support.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004022928/http://www.activistrights.org.au/cb_pages/organising_legal_support.php |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the concept of using legal observers first emerged during protests in the 1930s in the [[East End of London]], where police [[agents provocateur]] were used during protests by the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} There were large counter-protests and it was alleged that the police sided with the BUF. Another case of legal observing was that carried out by the [[Black Panthers]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Legal observers were used by [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] (then known as the National Council for Civil Liberties) in [[Wapping]], [[London]], during the mid-1980s. The Wapping demonstration was in response to large protests by labour unions against the industrial relations policies of media magnate [[Rupert Murdoch]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In the United States, the [[National Lawyers Guild]] (NLG) holds registered trademarks for the words "legal observer"&lt;ref&gt;https://trademarks.justia.com/778/13/legal-observer-77813382.html&lt;/ref&gt; alone, as well as the words "legal observer" on a green background. The National Lawyers Guild Legal Observer certification program was established in 1968 in New York City in response to protests at Columbia University and citywide antiwar and civil rights demonstrations. That same year, guild students organized for the defense of people swept up in mass arrests at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The NLG Legal Observer certification program requires legal observers to take a training course and is part of a comprehensive system of legal support designed to enable people to express their political views as fully as possible without unconstitutional disruption or interference by the police and with the fewest possible consequences from the criminal justice system. Legal observers are trained and directed by National Lawyer Guild attorneys. The presence of legal observers may serve as a deterrent to unconstitutional behavior by law enforcement during a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlg.org/lo-trainings/&lt;/ref&gt; 

NLG worked with the [[Bureau des Avocats Internationaux]], the [[Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti]], and the [[International Association of Democratic Lawyers]] to debut legal observers in Haiti during [[May Day]] protests of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlg.org/haitian-legal-organization-debuts-countrys-first-legal-observers-at-may-day-protests/ Haitian Legal Organization &amp; NLG Debut Country’s First Legal Observers at May Day Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, legal observers are associated with such groups as [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] (UK), [[Green and Black Cross]] (UK), the [[G8 Legal Collective]] (Scotland), and others. In Australia in the 1970s, priests acted as legal observers during the large [[Moratorium Marches]] against the Vietnam War. In September 2000, Pt'chang Nonviolent Community Safety Group organised a large legal observer team for the [[S11 (protest)|S11 protest]] against the World Economic Forum in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ptchang/downloads/s11_legal_observer_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Sydney, the Legal Observers Project, formally based at the Community Law Centre at the [[University of Technology]], Sydney, and renamed Human Rights Monitors, was established in April 2001. This group reformed as Sydney Copwatch in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ptchang/downloads/s11_legal_observer_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] sometimes dispatch human rights observers who serve similar roles to legal observers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4449">'''Leveling''' is a social process in which the uniqueness of the individual is rendered non-existent by assigning equal value to all aspects of human endeavors, thus missing all the intricacies and subtle complexities of human identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus, Hubert]]. ''Kierkegaard on the Internet: Anonymity Vrs. Commitment in the Present Age''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131222055423/http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/html/paper_kierkegaard.html Berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Leveling is highly associated with [[existentialism|existential]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]].

==Overview==
For Kierkegaard, leveling was the process of suppressing individuality to a point where the individual's uniqueness becomes non-existent and nothing meaningful in his existence can be affirmed:

{{quote|Leveling at its maximum is like the stillness of death, where one can hear one's own heartbeat, a stillness like death, into which nothing can penetrate, in which everything sinks, powerless. One person can head a rebellion, but one person cannot head this leveling process, for that would make him a leader and he would avoid being leveled. Each individual can in his little circle participate in this leveling, but it is an abstract process, and leveling is abstraction conquering individuality.|Søren Kierkegaard|''The Present Age'', translated by Alexander Dru with Foreword by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], 1962, pp. 51–53&lt;!--as it appears in http://www.historyguide.org/europe/present_age.html--&gt;}}

However, Kierkegaard's idea of leveling wasn't one of making life meaningless but of making life equal because every single individual has equal access to the grace and gifts of God. He wasn't concerned with earthly and material goods.

{{quote|The more a person weans his soul from understanding the imperfect to grasping the perfect, the more he will appropriate the explanation of life that comforts while it is day and remains with him when night comes, when he lies forgotten in his grave and has himself forgotten what moth and rust have consumed and human sagacity has found out, and yet he will have a thought that can fill out the long interval for him, that will know nothing of the difference that troubled him but is aware only of the equality that is from above, the equality in love, which lasts and is the only thing that lasts, the equality that does not allow any human being to be another’s debtor, except as Paul says, in the one debt, the debt of loving one another. — ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' by Søren Kierkegaard, ed. by Howard Vincent Hong and Edna Hatlestad Hong, 1992, p. 158}}

[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] wrote of leveling: "by averageness and leveling down, everything gets obscured, and what has thus been covered up gets passed off as something familiar and accessible to everyone. ...by virtue of an insensitivity to all distinctions in level and genuineness, and in providing average intelligibility, opens up a standard world in which all distinctions between the unique and the general, the superior and the average, the important and the trivial have been leveled".&lt;ref name="Dreyfus"&gt;{{Cite book |title= Being-in-the-World A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time|last= Dreyfus |first= Hubert |year=1990 |publisher= [[MIT Press]]|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-262-54056-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger's view of important things becoming mundane and non-specific points towards [[Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] concept of [[master–slave morality]], in which the weak and disenfranchised reframe the positive traits of the strong and powerful as not worth pursuing.

A '''Mars flyby''' is a movement of [[spacecraft]] passing in the vicinity of the [[planet Mars]], but not entering [[Orbit (celestial mechanics)|orbit]] or landing on it.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"&gt;
Page 15-16 in Chapter 3 of David S. F. Portree's ''Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950 - 2000,'' NASA Monographs in Aerospace History Series, Number 21, February 2001. Available as [https://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/humans_to_Mars.htm NASA SP-2001-4521].&lt;/ref&gt; Unmanned space probes have used this method to collect data on Mars, as opposed to orbiting or landing.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; A spacecraft designed for a [[Flyby (spaceflight)|flyby]] is also known as a "flyby bus" or "flyby spacecraft".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUWno1sOwnUC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=flyby+bus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXelT-zbOYzg8ATisYipAw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=flyby%20bus&amp;f=false Joseph A. Angelo - '''Encyclopedia Of Space And Astronomy''' (2006) - Page 171]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==
One application of a Mars flyby is for a human mission, where after landing and staying on the surface for some time the ascent stage has a [[space rendezvous]] with another, unmanned spacecraft, that was launched separately from Earth, flying by. This  would mean the ascent stage of the lander to reach the speed necessary equal to that of the spacecraft flying by, but the resources needed for Earth return would not have to enter or leave Mars orbit.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Astronautica - FLEM"&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/flem.html Astronautica - FLEM]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft they live in on the journey to Mars does the flyby, but the crew separates and goes into a lander.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"/&gt; The Excursion module's ascent stage must rejoin the main spacecraft before it gets too far away.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"/&gt; An advantage is that the resources needed for Earth return don't have to enter and leave Mars orbit, but the ascent stage has to perform [[space rendezvous]] in solar orbit and the time on Mars is constrained by the need to this.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Astronautica - FLEM"/&gt; [[Mars cycler]]s orbit the Sun in such a way as to pass by Mars and the Earth on regular intervals, performing Mars flybys on regular intervals. The crews would live on the stations during the interplanetary voyages. The concept for [[Flyby Excursion Landing Module]] is that a lander and flyby would separate in solar orbit, the lander would accelerate to get to Mars first, then land on Mars meanwhile the other segment does a Mars flyby, then the lander takes off and rendezvous with the flyby segment transferring the crew over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2014/01/to-mars-by-flyby-landing-excursion-mode-flem-1966/ W.I.R.E.D.]&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Mars Excursion Module]] (MEM))

Alternately, a flyby-only human mission is also possible, without detaching at Mars, but to [[Gravitational slingshot|slingshot]] around Mars and back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/dennis-titos-mission-to-mars-launching-in-2018-for-the-children-and-to-beat-china/2013/02/27/4a4a98ce-8135-11e2-8074-b26a871b165a_story.html "Dennis Tito’s mission to Mars: Launching in 2018 for the children (and to beat China)"], Brian Vastag, 27 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1965, Mariner 4 achieved a flyby of Mars with a return of data, providing the public and scientists with dramatically closer images of Mars.&lt;ref name=status&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063315001956 | doi=10.1016/j.pss.2015.06.017 | bibcode=2015P&amp;SS..117..207S | volume=117 | title=On the status of orbital high-resolution repeat imaging of Mars for the observation of dynamic surface processes | year=2015 | journal=Planetary and Space Science | pages=207–222 | last1 = Sidiropoulos | first1 = P. | last2 = Muller | first2 = J.-P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the flyby Mariner 4 took 21 pictures amounting to about 1% of the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name=status/&gt; Mars was not globally mapped until the [[Mariner 9]] orbiter, which over the course of 1972 to 1973 took thousands of images up to 100m a pixel.&lt;ref name=status/&gt; Observations from optical ground-based Earth telescopes have to peer through the atmosphere which blurred images, typically limiting them to resolving features about {{convert|300|km|mile|sp=us}} across even when Earth and Mars are closest.&lt;ref name="usra"&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/redplanet2/slide_2.html] THE RED PLANET: A SURVEY OF MARS Slide 2 Earth Telescope View of Mars [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/redplanet2/index.shtml index]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Mars Cube One]] (MarCO), two flyby [[CubeSat]]s to relay communication from ''[[InSight]]'' lander during its EDL were launched towards Mars with the cruise stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2018/0501-marco-cubesats-to-mars.html|title=MarCO: CubeSats to Mars!|website=www.planetary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MarCOs reached Mars and successfully relayed data during the entry, descent, and landing phase of ''Insight'' on November 26, 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/42541-mars-insight-lander-success.html|title=Touchdown on Mars!

'''Matching funds''' are funds that are set to be paid in equal amount to funds available from other sources.  Matching fund payments usually arise in situations of charity or [[Public interest|public good]]. The terms [[cost sharing]], in-kind, and matching are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Research/COSTSHARING_PROC02.html |title=University of Minnesota Policy |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable causes==
In philanthropic giving, foundations and corporations often give money to non-profit entities in the form of a '''matching gift'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantspace.org/Tools/Knowledge-Base/Funding-Resources/Corporations/Matching-gifts|title=Where can I learn more about workplace giving, like employee matching gifts?|first=|last=Grantspace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate matches often take the form of employee matching gifts, which means that if an employee donates to a nonprofit, the employee's corporation will donate money to the same nonprofit according to a predetermined match ratio (usually 1:1). For foundations, matching gifts are in the form of grants made directly to nonprofits if that the nonprofit raises a set quantity of money before the grant is bestowed. The benefit of foundation matching grants is that they provide greater incentive leverage when a nonprofit is fundraising from its constituency. If a foundation approves a 1:1 matching grant, donors know that their dollars will be doubled. On the other side, foundations who give matching grants receive assurance of the nonprofit's capacity to raise adequate funds.

For example, Dr. [[Booker T. Washington]], a famous [[African-American]] [[educator]], had a long-time friendship with [[millionaire]] [[industrialist]] [[Henry H. Rogers]], who provided him with substantial amounts of money to be applied for the betterment and education of black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Washington later wrote that Rogers had encouraged projects with at least partial matching funds'' so that two ends were accomplished: 
# The gifts would help fund even greater work. 
# Recipients would have a stake in knowing that they were helping themselves by their own hard work and sacrifice.

Using the matching funds philosophy, after Rogers's death, [[Julius Rosenwald]] and the [[Rosenwald Fund]] continued and expanded the work, eventually funding over 5,000 [[Rosenwald School]]s between 1912 and 1932. During that time, over US$4.6 million additional dollars were contributed by [[Black people|blacks]] in the communities to respond to the challenge thus presented.

In 1954, the General Electrics Foundation created the Corporate Alumni Program to match donations to the colleges and universities that employees graduated from.  This eventually broadened to other charities.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/|title=10 Awesome Matching Gift Resources for Nonprofits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation is one of the most generous with a $25,000 match per employee or retiree. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gefoundation.com/giving-programs/matching-gifts/|title=Matching Gifts - GE Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies facilitate the process, allowing employers to match the gifts of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/|title=10 Awesome Matching Gift Resources for Nonprofits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A matching gift, typically a one-time charitable gift made by an employee and matched by the employer, should not be confused with an [[employer matching program]], which has to do with the employee's [[401(k)]] plan and [[retirement]].

In 2014, corporations donated $17.8 Billion to nonprofit organizations. This is a 13.7% increase over 2013 corporate giving levels. In 2010, matching gifts represented ~20% of corporate cash donations.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, over 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer an employee matching gift program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/|title=Matching Gift &amp; Corporate Philanthropy Statistics (Updated)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the not-for-profit organisation, [[the Big Give]], have used match funding to raise over £97m for thousands of different charitable projects. The match funding is provided by a network of philanthropists and funders, called 'Champions'. Research commissioned by the Big Give shows that more people give when donations are matched (84% of surveyed respondents said they would be more likely to give if donation was matched) and people give more (one in three donors said they would give more than they usually would if do). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.thebiggive.org.uk/static/docs/A-Great+Match-EVersion.pdf|title=A Great Match|last=|first=|date=|website=www.theBigGive.org.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure funding==
In the United States, many projects in the various states and communities are partially funded with federal grants with a requirement for matching funds. For example, the [[Interstate Highway System]] was primarily built with a mix of 90% FHWA funds from the Highway Trust Fund and 10% matching state DOT funds. In some cases, borrowed money may be used to meet criteria for a matching grant; the $550 million Canadian federal government investment to connect a [[Detroit River International Crossing]] to [[Interstate 75 in Michigan]] qualifies the state for US$2 billion in US federal matching grants that can rebuild other [[Michigan]] highways even though the Canadian money is nominally a loan, to be repaid by tolls on the new bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deal reached to build new bridge to Detroit|author=Dave Battagello|publisher=Windsor Star|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/Deal+reached+build+bridge+Detroit/6791295/story.html |date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic preservation==
US federal matching grants have also funded historic preservation initiatives; a local historic property may be able to seek a 1:1 federal matching grant for specific capital projects, such as restoration of structures on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Preservation Grants|publisher=US [[National Park Service]]|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/HPG/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
In [[American politics]], the term refers to the money a [[president of the United States|presidential]] candidate is given by [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] to match the money they have raised personally. Candidates can expect up to US$250 extra from public funds for each contribution from an individual they receive.&lt;ref name="FECMatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/pubfund.shtml |title=Public Funding of Presidential Elections |publisher=US Federal Election Commission |accessdate=January 23, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222110433/http://www.cfinst.org/pr/111005.html |archivedate=February 22, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That usually applies to the two main parties; as in order for a candidate to gain the benefits of matching funds, they must raise $5,000 from 20 states during the primaries or have received 5% of the popular vote in the general election.&lt;ref name="FECMatch"/&gt; [[Pat Buchanan]], running as the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate in 2000, received matching funds despite winning only 0.4% of the vote.

The source of the funds comes from a $3 voluntary [[Presidential election campaign fund checkoff|checkoff]] on the [[US Income tax]] form. The program was established by the 1971 [[Federal Election Campaign Act]]. The law also "established overall spending limits for eligibility to receive matching funds, and provided for public funding of major party candidates in the general election for president".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Campaign Finance Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences|url = http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa238.html|website = www.cato.org|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect that these have on the candidates for presidential campaigns is to strengthen the role that the party plays in raising money.

Former New Mexico Governor [[Gary Johnson]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] candidate for president, qualified for federal matching funds in the [[2012 US presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2012/20120531_GJohnsonEligibility.shtml |title=20120531_GJohnsonEligibility |publisher=Fec.gov |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2012-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601010804/http://www.fec.gov/press/press2012/20120531_GJohnsonEligibility.shtml |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on June 30, 2012, [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate, [[Jill Stein]], also received enough contributions to qualify.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

On July 15, 2016, ALL Party presidential candidate, Alberto Cedeno, intentionally received no contributions to avoid qualifying for federal matching funds.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Prior to a 2011 Supreme Court decision, states like Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Wisconsin were using a system that distributed "additional funding to publicly financed candidates when they face big-spending opponents or opposition groups".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court strikes Arizona’s ‘matching funds’ for publicly financed candidates|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-strikes-arizona-system-of-matching-funds-to-publicly-financed-candidates/2011/06/26/AG92xenH_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2011-06-26|access-date = 2015-11-03|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Robert|last = Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined cases, ''Arizona Free Enterprise Fund v. Bennett'' (2011) and ''[[McComish v. Bennett]]'' (2011) held that "the law impermissibly forces private candidates and independent political organizations to either restrain their spending or risk triggering matching funds to their publicly financed opponents".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Now, states and cities are considering the implementation of programs like [[New York City]]'s public financing model; public funds are used to multiply the impact of a small donor. The program is administered by the [[New York City Campaign Finance Board]], which has avoided partisan divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Small%20Donor%20Matching%20Funds-The%20NYC%20Election%20Experience.pdf|title = Small Donor Matching Funds: The NYC Election Experience|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = Brennan Center for Justice|publisher = New York University School of Law|last = Migally|first = Angela|last2 = Liss|first2 = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs work by making each contribution worth more than their current value, thereby increasing the proportional impact of the contribution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Public Financing of Judicial Races Can Give Small Donors a Decisive Role|url = https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/civil-liberties/report/2012/12/12/47657/public-financing-of-judicial-races-can-give-small-donors-a-decisive-role/|website = name|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, for example, a $6-to-$1 program has resulted in "small dollar donors constitute the vast majority of spending in New York City elections, representing 73% of all contributions in 2013 and 80% specifically to City Council race".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New York City Partial-Public Matching Program: A Model of Successful Campaign Finance Reform|url = https://www.ced.org/blog/entry/new-york-city-partial-public-matching-program-a-model-of-successful-campaig|website = Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the Brennan Center found that "by pumping up the value of small contributions, the New York City system gives [candidates] an incentive to reach out to their own constituents rather than focusing all their attention on wealthy out-of-district donors, leading them to attract more diverse donors into the political process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/publications/DonorDiversityReport_WEB.PDF|title = Donor Diversity Through Public Matching Funds|date = May 14, 2012|accessdate = July 21, 2015|website = Brennan Center for Justice|publisher = New York University School of Law|last = Genn|first = Elisabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs of this type incentivize candidates to "fuse fundraising with voter outreach" and incentivize political engagement by communities that can afford only modest contributions. Candidates may then have more an incentive to reach out to their constituents rather than devoting their energy to financing their campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ''Election Law Journal'' found that matching funds through a multiplier has increased the proportional role of small donors as well as the number of small donors. The programs have also helped to shift the demographic and class profile of those who give. Finally, besides diluting the power of major givers, these programs led candidates to reach out and engage a more representative set of constituents during fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cfinst.org/pdf/state/NYC-as-a-Model_ELJ_As-Published_March2012.pdf|title = Small Donors, Big Democracy: New York City's Matching Funds as a Model for the Nation and States|last = Malbin|first = Michael J.|date = 2012|journal = Election Law Journal|doi = 10.1089/elj.2010.0099|pmid = |access-date = July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some dispute regarding the impact of matching funds programs like the one implemented in New York City. For example, "after implementing the public matching funds program in NYC, [the] most recent mayoral election of 2009 witnessed the lowest voter turnout it's had since the 1960's".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Benefits and Inequalities of Matching Funds - CFO - Compliance|url = http://www.cfo-compliance.com/benefits-and-inequalities-of-matching-funds/|website = CFO - Compliance|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the matching funds system benefits candidates with higher name recognition, especially if they are tied to a measure of popular support.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some have suggested that public funding actually has a negative effect on the perceptions the public has of the government, perhaps because public funding programs do not meet "the expectations set by reformers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = What Does Research Say About Public Funding for Political Campaigns|last = Primo|first = David M.|date = August 2010|journal = Institute for Justice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NUL logo.svg|thumb|220px|National Urban League logo]]

The '''National Urban League''' ('''NUL'''), formerly known as the '''National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes''', is a nonpartisan [[civil rights]] organization based in New York City that advocates on behalf of [[African American]]s and against [[racial discrimination in the United States]]. It is the oldest and largest [[community-based organization]] of its kind in the nation. Its current President is [[Marc Morial]].

==History==

The Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes was founded in New York City on September 29, 1910 by [[Ruth Standish Baldwin]] and Dr. [[George Edmund Haynes]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Parris, Guichard and Lester Brooks. ''Blacks in the City: A History of the National Urban League''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1971. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  It merged with the Committee for the Improvement of Industrial Conditions Among Negroes in New York (founded in New York in 1906) and the National League for the Protection of Colored Women (founded in 1905), and was renamed the National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson, N. "NEW CHAPTER IN SOCIAL UPLIFT." Afro-American (1893-1988): 2. Dec 30 1911. ProQuest. Web. 6 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parris, Guichard and Lester Brooks. ''Blacks in the City: A History of the National Urban League''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1971. pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, [[Eugene Kinckle Jones|Eugene K. Jones]] took the leadership of the organization. Under his direction, the League significantly expanded its multifaceted campaign to crack the barriers to black employment, spurred first by the boom years of the 1920s, and then by the desperate years of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Armfield, Felix L. ''Eugene Kinckle Jones: The National Urban League and Black Social Work, 1910-1940''. Urbana : University of Illinois Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the organization took the present name, the National Urban League.&lt;ref&gt;Parris, Guichard and Lester Brooks. ''Blacks in the City: A History of the National Urban League''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;   The mission of the Urban League movement, as stated by the National Urban League, is "to enable African Americans to secure economic self-reliance, parity, power and civil rights."&lt;ref name="nul"&gt;"[http://nul.iamempowered.com/who-we-are/mission-and-history Mission and History]." ''National Urban League''. Accessed 6 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Lester Granger]] was appointed Executive Secretary and led the NUL's effort to support the March on Washington proposed by [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[A. J. Muste]] to protest racial discrimination in defense work and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Jesse. "Urban League Bulletin." The Atlanta Constitution (1881-1945): 1. Jan 25 1942. ProQuest. Web. 6 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Granger prevailed in his insistence that the NUL continue its strategy of "education and persuasion".

In 1961, [[Whitney Young]] became executive director amidst the expansion of activism in the civil rights movement, which provoked a change for the League. Young substantially expanded the League's fund-raising ability- and made the League a full partner in the civil rights movement. In 1963, the NUL hosted the planning meetings of [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and other civil rights leaders for the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]].  During Young's ten-year tenure at the League, he initiated programs such as "Street Academy," an alternative education system to prepare [[high school dropout]]s for college; and "New Thrust," an effort to help local black leaders identify and solve community problems. Young also pushed for federal aid to cities.

[[Clarence M. Pendleton, Jr.]], was from 1975 to 1981, the head of the Urban League in [[San Diego, California]]. In 1981, U.S. President [[Ronald W. Reagan]] tapped Pendleton as the chairman of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], a position which he held until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton sought to steer the commission into the [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] direction in line with Reagan's views on social and civil rights policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/nkaa/record.php?note_id=1144|title=Notable Kentucky African Americans Database|publisher=uky.edu|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Hugh Bernard Price|Hugh Price]] was appointed as president of the Urban League.

In 2003, [[Marc Morial]], former [[List of mayors of New Orleans|mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana]], was appointed the league's eighth President and Chief Executive Officer. He worked to reenergize the movement's diverse constituencies by building on the legacy of the organization and increasing the profile of the organization.

==Current status==
Today, the National Urban League has 90 affiliates serving 300 communities, in 36 states and the District of Columbia.  The National Urban League provides direct services in the areas of education, health care, housing, jobs, and justice -- improving the lives of more than 2 million people nationwide.  The organization also has a [http://nulwb.iamempowered.com/ Washington Bureau] that serves as its research, policy and advocacy arm on issues relating to Congress and the Administration.

The National Urban League is an organizational member of the [[Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]], which advocates [[gun control]].  In 1989, it was the beneficiary of all proceeds from the [[Stop the Violence Movement]] and their [[hip hop]] single, "Self Destruction".

In May 2017, the National Urban League began producing its now annual [https://tvone.tv/52289/the-national-urban-leagues-state-of-black-america-townhall-how-far-have-we-really-come/ State of Black America TV Town Hall], which airs on TV One. The TV Town Hall elevates social issues related to African Americans through an interview style format with celebrity guests. The show is executive produced by Rhonda Spears Bell.

In February 2018, the National Urban League launched a weekly podcast named, [https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/for-the-movement/id1345148843?mt=2 For The Movement], which discusses persistent policy, social and civil rights issues affecting communities of color. The co-hosts for the podcast are Marc Morial, Donald Cravins, Jr., Kezmiché "Kim" Atterbury, and Jordun Lawrence. The podcast was created and is executive produced by Kezmiché "Kim" Atterbury.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8219">In [[mathematics]], '''obstruction theory''' is a name given to two different [[mathematical theory|mathematical theories]], both of which yield [[cohomological]] [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]].

In the original work of [[Eduard Stiefel|Stiefel]] and [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]], [[characteristic class]]es were defined as obstructions to the existence of certain fields of linear independent [[Vector field|vector]]s. Obstruction theory turns out to be an application of cohomology theory to the problem of constructing a [[Section (fiber bundle)|cross-section]] of a [[Fiber bundle|bundle]].

==In homotopy theory==
The older meaning for obstruction theory in [[homotopy theory]] relates to the procedure, inductive with respect to dimension, for extending a [[continuous mapping]] defined on a [[simplicial complex]], or [[CW complex]]. It is traditionally called ''Eilenberg obstruction theory'', after [[Samuel Eilenberg]]. It involves [[cohomology group]]s with coefficients in [[homotopy group]]s to define obstructions to extensions. For example, with a mapping from a simplicial complex ''X'' to another, ''Y'', defined initially on the [[0-skeleton]] of ''X'' (the vertices of ''X''), an extension to the 1-skeleton will be possible whenever the image of the 0-skeleton will belong to the same [[path-connected]] component of ''Y''. Extending from the 1-skeleton to the 2-skeleton means defining the mapping on each solid triangle from ''X'', given the mapping already defined on its boundary edges. Likewise, then extending the mapping to the 3-skeleton involves extending the mapping to each solid 3-simplex of ''X'', given the mapping already defined on its boundary. 

At some point, say extending the mapping from the (n-1)-skeleton of ''X'' to the n-skeleton of ''X'', this procedure might be impossible. In that case, one can assign to each n-simplex the homotopy class {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}} of the mapping already defined on its boundary, (at least one of which will be non-zero). These assignments define an [[cohomology|n-cochain]]  with coefficients in {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}}. Amazingly, this cochain turns out to be a '''cocyle''' and so defines a [[cohomology]] class in the nth cohomology group of ''X'' with coefficients in {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}}. When this cohomology class is equal to 0, it turns out that the mapping may be modified within its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton of ''X'' so that the mapping may be extended to the n-skeleton of ''X''.  If the class is not equal to zero, it is called the obstruction to extending the mapping over the n-skeleton, given its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton.

===Obstruction to extending a section of a principal bundle===

====Construction====
Suppose that {{mvar|B}} is a [[simply connected]] simplicial complex and that {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''B''}} is a [[fibration]] with fiber {{mvar|F}}.  Furthermore, assume that we have a partially defined [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] {{math| ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''E''}} on the [[N-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] of {{mvar|B}}.

For every {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplex {{mvar|Δ}} in {{mvar|B}}, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be restricted to its boundary (which is a topological [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]]).  Because {{mvar|p}} send each of these back to each {{mvar|Δ}}, we have a map from an {{mvar|n}}-sphere to {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Δ'')}}. Because fibrations satisfy the homotopy lifting property, and {{mvar|Δ}} is [[Contractible space|contractible]]; {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Δ'')}} is [[homotopy equivalent]] to {{mvar|F}}. So this partially defined section assigns an element of [[homotopy group|{{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}}]] to every {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplex.  This is precisely the data of a {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}}-valued [[simplicial homology|simplicial]] [[cohomology#definition|cochain]] of degree {{math|''n'' + 1}} on {{mvar|B}}, i.e. an element of {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;(B; ''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''))}}.  This cochain is called the '''obstruction cochain''' because it being the zero means that all of these elements of {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}} are trivial, which means that our partially defined section can be extended to the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton by using the homotopy between (the partially defined section on the boundary of each {{mvar|Δ}}) and the constant map.

The fact that this cochain came from a partially defined section (as opposed to an arbitrary collection of maps from the all the boundaries of all the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplices) can be used to prove that this cochain is a cocycle.  If one started with a different partially defined section {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} that agreed with the original on the {{math|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-skeleton, then one can also prove that the resulting cocycle would differ from the first by a coboundary.  Therefore we have a well-defined element of the cohomology group {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''; ''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''))}} such that if a partially defined section on the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton exists that agrees with the given choice on the {{math|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-skeleton, then this cohomology class must be trivial.

The converse is also true if one allows such things as ''homotopy sections'', i.e. a map {{math|''σ'' : ''B'' → ''E''}} such that {{math|''p'' ∘ ''σ''}} is homotopic (as opposed to equal) to the identity map on {{mvar|B}}.  Thus it provides a complete invariant of the existence of sections up to homotopy on the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton.

====Applications====
* By inducting over {{mvar|n}}, one can construct a ''first obstruction to a section'' as the first of the above cohomology classes that is non-zero. 
* This can be used to find obstructions to trivializations of [[principal bundle#Trivializations and cross sections|principal bundles]].
* Because [[homotopy fiber|any map can be turned into a fibration]], this construction can be used to see if there are obstructions to the existence of a lift (up to homotopy) of a map into {{mvar|B}} to a map into {{mvar|E}} even if {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''B''}} is not a fibration.
* It is crucial to the construction of [[Postnikov system]]s.

==In geometric topology==
In [[geometric topology]], obstruction theory is concerned with when a [[topological manifold]] has a [[piecewise linear structure]], and when a piecewise linear manifold has a [[differential structure]].

In dimension at most 2 (Rado), and 3 (Moise), the notions of topological manifolds and piecewise linear manifolds coincide. In dimension 4 they are not the same.

In dimensions at most 6 the notions of piecewise linear manifolds and differentiable manifolds coincide.

==In surgery theory==
The two basic questions of [[surgery theory]] are whether a topological space with ''n''-dimensional [[Poincaré duality]] is [[homotopy equivalent]] to an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]], and also whether a [[homotopy equivalence]] of ''n''-dimensional manifolds is [[homotopic]] to a [[diffeomorphism]]. In both cases there are two obstructions for ''n&gt;9'', a primary [[topological K-theory]] obstruction to the existence of a [[vector bundle]]: if this vanishes there exists a [[normal invariant|normal map]], allowing the definition of the secondary [[surgery theory|surgery obstruction]] in [[L-theory|algebraic L-theory]] to performing surgery on the normal map to obtain a [[homotopy equivalence]].

A '''plan''' is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an [[Goal|objective]] to do something. See also [[strategy]]. It is commonly understood as a [[modal logic|temporal]] [[set (mathematics)|set]] of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a [[goal]].

For [[space|spatial]] or [[Plane (geometry)|planar]] [[topology|topologic]] or [[topography|topographic]] sets see [[map]].
  
Plans can be formal or informal:
* Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in [[project]]s, [[diplomacy]], [[career]]s, [[economic development]], [[military]] campaigns, [[combat]], [[sports]], [[games]], or in the conduct of other [[business]]. In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pmhut.com/what-should-be-included-in-a-project-plan |title=What Should Be Included in a Project Plan |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |website=www.pmhut.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Value%20of%20Formal%20Planning.pdf | title = The Value of Formal Planning for Strategic Decisions: A Reply | author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–185| year = 1986 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250070207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informal or [[ad hoc]] plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.

The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another. For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories.

It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.

==Topics==

===Planning===
The term [[planning]] implies the working out of sub-components in some degree of elaborate detail. Broader-brush enunciations of objectives may qualify as metaphorical [[Technology roadmap|roadmap]]s. Planning literally just means the creation of a plan; it can be as simple as making a [[task list|list]]. It has acquired a technical meaning, however, to cover the area of [[government]] [[legislation]] and [[regulation]]s elated to the use of resources.

Planning can refer to the planned use of any and all resources, as in the succession of [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]]s through which the government of the [[Soviet Union]] sought to develop the country. However, the term is most frequently used in relation to planning for the use of land and related resources, for example in [[urban planning]], [[transportation planning]], etc.

[[transportation planning|ión  planning]], etc.

In a governmental context, "planning" without any qualification is most likely to mean the regulation of [[land use]]. See also [[zoning]].

===Planners===
Planners are the professionals that have the requisite training to take or make decisions that will help or balance the society in order to have a functional, aesthetic, and convenient environment.

===Methodology===
Concepts such as [[top-down planning]] (as opposed to bottom-up planning) reveal similarities with the [[systems thinking]] behind the [[top-down model]].

The subject touches such broad fields as [[psychology]], [[game theory]], [[communication]]s and [[information theory]], which inform the planning methods that people seek to use and refine; as well as [[logic]] and [[science]] (i.e. methodological naturalism) which serve as a means of testing different parts of a plan for reliability or consistency.

The specific methods used to create and refine plans depend on who is to make it, who is to put it to use, and what resources are available for the task. The methods used by an [[individual]] in his or her [[mind]] or [[personal organizer]], may be very different from the collection of planning techniques found in a [[corporation|corporate]] board-room, and the planning done by a [[project manager]] has different priorities and uses different tools to the planning done by an [[engineer]] or [[industrial designer]].

'''Proactive law''' seeks a new approach to legal issues in businesses and societies. Instead of perceiving law as a constraint that companies and people in general need to comply with, '''proactive law''' considers law as an instrument that can create success and foster sustainable relationships, which in the end carries the potential to increase value for companies, individuals, and societies in general.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[proactive]] is the opposite of reactive, meaning that the approach to law is based on an [[ex ante]] view rather than an [[ex post]] view. According to the dictionary of [[Merriam-Webster]], the word proactive refers to ''acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proactive.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the proactive law approach challenges the traditional backwards and failure oriented approach to law by acting in [[67th World Science Fiction Convention|anticipation]] of legal [[disputes]], taking control of potential problems, providing solutions, and self-initiation, instead of reacting to failures and shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotbed of the proactive law movement is the Nordic countries and Finland in particular. The movement took off in the late 1990s and is almost similar to the American movement – Law as a Competitive Source. Both of these parallel evolutions are founded on the work of [[Louis M. Brown]], developed in the 1950s known as the [[preventive]] approach to law.

== From Preventive Law to Proactive Law ==
The proactive law movement has become more visible in recent years, but the idea of an [[ex ante]] view is not new. It is generally known that the earlier a dispute or a potential dispute is addressed, the better the chances of a fair, just and prompt solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Louis M. Brown]] was the first to introduce the [[ex ant]]e view in his ground-laying book “Preventive Law”.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he identified and organized the preventive law into a distinctive way of thinking, he was not the inventor of this approach. It has been, and still is, well known to many legal professionals and every business manager that:

“It usually costs less to avoid getting into trouble than to pay for getting out of trouble.”&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950). p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the general principles of proactive law requires understanding the core principles of [[preventive law]], as these principles create the foundation for proactive law and [[proactive contracting]]. [[Edward Dauer]] identifies four core principles of preventive law:&lt;ref&gt;Dauer E. A., Four Principles for a Theory of Preventive Law, p. 13-35&lt;/ref&gt;

* Predicting human behavior to anticipate and account for what people will do, and by doing so, prevents litigation. This improves personal and business relationships, and constitutes an essential part of the preventive law.
* Conflict management—preventive law draws parallels from the medical world, e.g., successful medical treatment is prophylactic.
* Embracement of risks: Instead of focusing solely on reducing one or a few risks to zero, the preventive law approach strives to reduce the overall sum of risk.
* Preventive legal service: Lawyers and in-house counsels must participate with others in multi-disciplinary teams in the planning of business ventures. Bringing legal expertise in earlier helps detect and prevent legal problems.

The proactive law movement encompasses the basic principles of preventive law stated above, namely preventing what is not desirable, and keeping problems and risks from materializing.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, as proactive law consists of preventive law, the characteristics above constitute the foundation of proactive law.

=== The Promotive Dimension ===
To this preventive dimension of law, proactive law adds a second aspect, which is often neglected in traditional law – known as the ''[[promotive]] dimension''.

The nature of the promotive dimension is positive and constructive and promotes what is desirable while encouraging good behavior. This is where we find the distinction to preventive law. 
In a legal context, proactive law emphasizes the importance of collaboration between legal professionals and other disciplines to achieve the desired goals in circumstances where legal expertise collaborates with other disciplines. Proactive law therefore emphasizes the need for dialogue between different understandings. In a medical context, the preventive law prevents ill health, while proactive law promotes well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proactive law approach is based on legal certainty, [[literacy]], and cross-professional collaboration to “localize the mines and preventing them from exploding.”&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to navigating past the mines, the legal professionals should create economic value, and thus must be outcome-orientated to exploit the promotive dimension. Lawyers and [[in-house counsel]] thus must act to achieve results by watching for changes or opportunities and setting improved goals. To do so, legal professionals must highlight opportunities to build a solid business foundation, roadmaps for performance, trust, and better sustainable relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides achieving these business goals, it is important to focus on legal [[risk management]] to prevent disputes. Many legal disputes arise due to misunderstandings and disappointed expectations. However, careful attention to legal clarity along with early warning mechanisms, and enhanced collaboration between business partners, through establishment of common goals, avoids the business from getting to the stage of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential in proactive law that legal professionals, managers, and other involved stakeholders collaborate on a cross-professional basis to avoid disputes. In addition to avoiding disputes, it is also important to promote creative thinking. To develop new ideas, and concepts that correspond to the needs, problems or challenges, it is necessary to look towards the future rather than the past, maybe by using already known approaches, but also non-existing approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; This invites businesses, authorities and researchers to develop solutions through creative thinking.

Thus, proactive law is about problem-solving, detecting real-life causes for potential misunderstandings and failures, but most of all it is about fostering and promoting fruitful and sustainable relationships that enables the stakeholders to reach their goals, creating value for business, individuals, and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proactive Law in Legislation ==

An indication that Proactive Law is gaining prominence is the fact that the [[European Commission]] has published an [[opinion]] on Proactive Law.

The EESC urges a [[paradigm]] shift, as the time has come to give up the centuries-old reactive approach to law and to adopt a pro active approach. It is time to look at law in a different way: to look forward rather than back, to focus on how the law is used and oper ates in everyday life and how it is received in the community it seeks to regulate. While responding to and resolving problems remain important, preventing causes of problems is vital, along with serving the needs and facilitating the productive interaction of citizens and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

By its very nature, the Community legal system is precisely the type of area in which the proactive approach should be adopted when planning, drawing up and implementing laws; against this backdrop, the EESC would argue that rules and regu lations are not the only way nor always the best way to achieve the desired objectives; at times, the regulator may best support valuable goals by refraining from regulating and, where appropri ate, encouraging self-regulation and co-regulation. This being the case, the fundamental principles of [[subsidiarity]], [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], [[precaution]] and [[sustainability]] take on new importance and a new dimension.

The EESC believes that the single market can benefit greatly when EU law and its makers — [[legislators]] and administrators in the broadest sense — shift their focus from inward, from inside the legal system, rules and institutions, to outward, to the users of the law: to society, citizens and businesses that the legal system is intended to serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

While the transposition and implementation of laws are important steps towards better regulation at EU level, regulatory success should be measured by how the goals are achieved at the level of the users of the law, EU citizens and businesses. The laws should be communicated in ways that are meaningful to their intended audience, first and foremost to those whose behaviour is affected and not just to the relevant institutions and administrators.

The application of the Proactive Law approach should be considered systematically in all lawmaking and implementation within the EU. The EESC strongly believes that by making this approach not only part of the Better Regulation agenda, and but also a priority for legislators and administrators at the EU, national and regional levels, it would be possible to build a strong legal foundation for individuals and businesses to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive Law in a Business Context==

While Proactive Law in general has gained increased attention at the highest legislatory authorities, businesses seem to be the first movers in this developing research field.

When Proactive Law is adapted to businesses the approach is called [[Proactive Contracting]] and Proactive [[Contract Management]]. The idea is that [[Proactive Contracting]] may constitute a sustainable [[competitive advantage]], when implemented thoroughly.

In recent years law has gained increased prominence as a source of competitive advantage to businesses. This prominence originated with the work of scholars and professionals in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the US, research of Robert Bird has contributed to the movement of Law as a [[Competitive Advantage]]. 
Robert Bird uses a strategy framework to analyze the attributes of law necessary to obtain a competitive advantage. In Europe, the proactive law movement constitutes the same. 
As contracts and contract law are major components of successful [[R&amp;D]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[operations management]], [[outsourcing]] etc., it is important that the contracts and contracting processes involved are successful. 
In the words of [[Tim Cummins]], [[CEO]] of the IACCM, “contracts lie at the heart of most business relationships, certainly within Western [[cultures]] and [[economies]], and increasingly among all companies or entities that seek to operate in an international market”.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, T. (2006): Best Practices In Commercial Contracting, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

As international trading grows in value and quantity, it is important for businesses to excel in contracting. Businesses that can manage contracting successfully have a competitive advantage [[ceteris paribus]].

By incorporating both a [[preventive]] and a [[promotive]] focus, the proactive law movement encourages both legal goals, which are often preventive—and business goals, which tend to be promotive.&lt;ref&gt;Siedel, G. J. &amp; Haapio, H.: Using Proactive Law for Competitive Advantages, (2010) p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

By combining these two approaches to reaching goals, businesses take advantage of both the preventive focus and the promotive focus.
[[Tory Higgins]] has developed a [[psychological]] theory called the [[Regulatory Focus Theory]] that focuses on motivations and how people tend to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. T.: Promotion and Prevention: Regulatory Focus as a Motivational Principle. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The two different orientations towards goal achievement, which have been recognized by [[Tory Higgins]], are:

(1) a preventive focus that emphasizes [[safety]], [[Legal liability|responsibility]] and [[security]], and

(2) a promotive focus that emphasizes [[hopes]], [[accomplishments]], and [[advancements]].

Thus, the way of businesses to pursuing a goal depends on whether their approach is [[preventive]] or [[promotive]]. According to Mayer and [[Weber]], people with a preventive focus view goals as minimal targets that produce a low-intensity response when the goal is achieved.  On the other hand, people with a promotive approach see goals as maximal targets. Thus, “achievement of the goal results in feelings of high-intensity happiness instead of low-intensity calm”.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, K. J. &amp; Weber, L.: Unpacking Contract Capabilities: Shaping Behavior by Implementing Appropriate Contract Framing, (2009) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

If businesses succeed in incorporating both the preventive and promotive approach in reaching their goals, they may able to utilize the advantages of both legal and business goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054654/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4962">In the branch of abstract mathematics called [[category theory]], a '''projective cover''' of an object ''X'' is in a sense the best approximation of ''X'' by a [[projective object]] ''P''.  Projective covers are the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] of [[injective envelope]]s.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] and ''X'' an object in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.  A '''projective cover''' is a pair (''P'',''p''), with ''P'' a [[projective object]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and ''p'' a superfluous epimorphism in Hom(''P'', ''X'').

If ''R'' is a ring, then in the category of ''R''-modules, a '''superfluous epimorphism''' is then an [[epimorphism]] &lt;math&gt;p : P \to X&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''p'' is a [[superfluous submodule]] of ''P''.

==Properties==
Projective covers and their superfluous epimorphisms, when they exist, are unique up to [[isomorphism]]. The isomorphism need not be unique, however, since the projective property is not a full fledged [[universal property]].

The main effect of ''p'' having a superfluous kernel is the following: if ''N'' is any proper submodule of ''P'', then &lt;math&gt;p(N) \ne M&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Proof:  Let ''N'' be proper in ''P'' and suppose ''p''(''N'')=''M''.  Since ker(''p'') is superfluous, ker(''p'')+''N''≠''P''.  Choose ''x'' in ''P'' outside of ker(''p'')+''N''.  By the surjectivity of ''p'', there exists ''x' '' in ''N'' such that ''p''(''x' '')=''p''(''x ''),, whence ''x''−''x' '' is in ker(''p'').  But then ''x'' is in ker(''p'')+''N'', a contradiction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally speaking, this shows the superfluous kernel causes ''P'' to cover ''M'' optimally, that is, no submodule of ''P'' would suffice. This does not depend upon the projectivity of ''P'': it is true of all superfluous epimorphisms.

If (''P'',''p'') is a projective cover of ''M'', and ''P' '' is another projective module with an epimorphism &lt;math&gt;p':P'\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a [[epimorphism#Related concepts|split epimorphism]] α from ''P' '' to ''P'' such that &lt;math&gt;p\alpha=p'&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike [[injective envelope]]s and [[flat cover]]s, which exist for every left (right) [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] regardless of the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'', left (right) ''R''-modules do not in general have projective covers.  A ring ''R'' is called left (right) [[perfect ring|perfect]] if every left (right) ''R''-module has a projective cover in ''R''-Mod (Mod-''R'').

A ring is called [[semiperfect ring|semiperfect]] if every [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] left (right) ''R''-module has a projective cover in ''R''-Mod (Mod-''R'').  "Semiperfect" is a left-right symmetric property.

A ring is called ''lift/rad'' if [[Idempotent (ring theory)#Category of R modules|idempotents lift]] from ''R''/''J'' to ''R'', where ''J'' is the [[Jacobson radical]] of ''R''.  The property of being lift/rad can be characterized in terms of projective covers: ''R'' is lift/rad if and only if direct summands of the ''R'' module ''R''/''J'' (as a right or left module) have projective covers.{{sfn|Anderson|Fuller|1992|loc=p. 302}}

== Examples ==
In the category of ''R'' modules:
*If ''M'' is already a projective module, then the identity map from ''M'' to ''M'' is a superfluous epimorphism (its kernel being zero).  Hence, projective modules always have projective covers.
*If J(''R'')=0, then a module ''M'' has a projective cover if and only if ''M'' is already projective.
*In the case that a module ''M'' is [[simple module|simple]], then it is necessarily the [[top (mathematics)|top]] of its projective cover, if it exists.
*The injective envelope for a module always exists, however over certain rings modules may not have projective covers.  For example, the natural map from '''Z''' onto '''Z'''/2'''Z''' is not a projective cover of the '''Z'''-module '''Z'''/2'''Z''' (which in fact has no projective cover). The class of rings which provides all of its right modules with projective covers is the class of right [[perfect ring]]s.
*Any ''R''-module ''M'' has a [[flat cover]], which is equal to the projective cover if ''R'' has a projective cover.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1850">A '''Public Force''' is a force which has a legitimate and legalised use of physical force in order to serve the public interests. 

The term is broad and loosely defined. Public force could be used to refer to either police or military forces.

==Original use of the term==
The first use of the concept of a '''public force''', in French '''''Force Publique''''', is in the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789.'' 

'' '''Article XIII''' - For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenditures of administration, a common contribution is indispensable; it must be equally distributed between all the citizens, by reason of their faculties [i.e., ability to pay].''

The declaration sought to regulate the relationship between the citizen and the legitimate use of violence. In contrast to similar declarations of rights from [[Anglo-Saxon]] countries, the emphasis is on the citizen's duty to contribute to the existence of such a force, rather than on the citizen's rights vis-a-vis such a force.

==Further use of the term==
The concept was also used in other countries, e.g. in Thomas Jefferson's [[s:Thomas Jefferson's Sixth State of the Union Address|Sixth State of the Union Address]].

'''''Force Publique''''' was the title of the colonial army and gendarmerie of the [[Congo Free State]] and [[Belgian Congo]] from 1885-1960 (''see: '''[[Public Force (Congo)]]'''''). 

The term has been used as a designation for police or military forces in other countries, e.g. [[Panama]] and [[Costa Rica]], and is commonly used as a conceptual term in several countries, e.g. [[France]] and [[Morocco]].

'''SAMPL''', which stands for '''"Stochastic [[AMPL]]"''', is an [[algebraic modeling language]] resulting by expanding the well-known language [[AMPL]] with extended syntax and keywords. It is designed specifically for representing [[stochastic programming]] problems&lt;ref name="ExtendingAlgebraicLanguages"&gt;
{{cite journal | author=Christian Valente, Gautam Mitra, Mustapha Sadki and Robert Fourer| title=Extending algebraic modelling languages for stochastic programming| journal=INFORMS Journal on Computing| year=2009| volume=21| issue=1| pages=107–122| url=http://joc.journal.informs.org/content/21/1/107.abstract| doi=10.1287/ijoc.1080.0282}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and, through recent extensions, problems with chance constraints, integrated chance constraints and [[robust optimization]] problems. 
It can generate the deterministic equivalent version of the instances, using all the solvers AMPL connects to,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ampl.com/solvers.html&lt;/ref&gt; or generate an [[MPS (format)#extensions|SMPS]] representation and use specialized decomposition based solvers, like [[FortSP]].

== Language Features ==

SAMPL shares all language features with AMPL, and adds some constructs specifically designed for expressing scenario based [[stochastic programming]] and [[robust optimization]].

=== Stochastic programming features and constructs ===

To express scenario-based SP problems, additional constructs describe the tree structure and group the decision variable into stages. Moreover, it is possible to specify which parameter stores the probabilities for each branch of the tree and which set represents the scenario set. Other constructs to easily define chance constraints and integrated chance constraint in an SP problem are available as well.
Using these language constructs allows to retain the structure of the problem, hence making it available to the solvers, which might exploit it using specialized decomposition methods like [[Benders' decomposition]] to speed-up the solution.

=== Robust optimization constructs ===

SAMPL supports constructs to describe three types of robust optimization formulations:

== Availability ==

SAMPL is currently available as a part of the software AMPLDev (distributed by [http://www.optirisk-systems.com www.optirisk-systems.com]). It supports many popular 32- and 64-bit platforms including [[Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]]. A free evaluation version with limited functionality is available.&lt;ref&gt;http://optirisk-systems.com/products_ampldevSP.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

 sales{p in Prod, s in Scen}: amountsell[p,s] &lt;= Demand[p,s];
 ''# Respect initial budget''
 budgetres: sum{r in Resource} Cost[r] * buy[r] &lt;= Budget;

== Solvers connectivity ==

SAMPL instance level format for SP problems is SMPS, and therefore the problem can be solved by any solver which supports that standard. One of such solvers (FortSP) is included in the standard SAMPL distribution. Regarding robust optimization problems, the needed solver depend on the specific formulation used, as Ben-Tal and Nemirovski formulation need a [[Second-order cone programming|second-order cone]] capable solver.

'''Self-determination theory''' ('''SDT''') is a macro theory of human motivation and personality that concerns people's inherent growth tendencies and innate psychological needs. It is concerned with the [[motivation]] behind choices people make without external influence and interference. SDT focuses on the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined.&lt;ref name="Deci, E. 2002"&gt;Ryan, R. M. &amp; Deci, E. L. (2000). Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being. ''American Psychologist'', 55, 68-78. https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deci, E. L., &amp; Ryan, R. M. (2012). Motivation, personality, and development within embedded social contexts: An overview of self-determination theory. In R. M. Ryan (Ed.), Oxford handbook of human motivation (pp. 85-107).

In the 1970s, research on SDT evolved from studies comparing the [[intrinsic motivation|intrinsic]] and [[intrinsic motivation|extrinsic]] motives, and from growing understanding of the dominant role intrinsic motivation played in an individual's behavior&lt;ref name="eg Lepper, M. K. 1973"&gt;e.g. Lepper, M. K., Greene, D., &amp; Nisbett, R. (1973). Undermining children's intrinsic interest with extrinsic reward: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''28'', 129&amp;ndash;137.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until the mid-1980s that SDT was formally introduced and accepted as a sound empirical theory. Research applying SDT to different areas in [[social psychology]] has increased considerably since the 2000s.

Key studies that led to emergence of SDT included research on intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name="eg Deci, E. L. 1971"&gt;e.g. Deci, E. L. (1971). Effects of externally mediated rewards on intrinsic motivation. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''18'', 105&amp;ndash;115.&lt;/ref&gt; Intrinsic motivation refers to initiating an activity for its own sake because it is interesting and satisfying in itself, as opposed to doing an activity to obtain an external goal (extrinsic motivation). Different types of motivations have been described based on the degree they have been [[internalization|internalized]]. Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioural regulations that were originally external.&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R | year = 1995 | title = Psychological needs and the facilitation of integrative processes | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 397–427 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1995.tb00501.x| pmid = 7562360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward L. Deci]] and [[Richard Ryan (professor)|Richard Ryan]] later expanded on the early work differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and proposed three main intrinsic needs involved in self-determination.&lt;ref name="Deci, E. 1991"&gt;Deci, E., &amp; Ryan, R. (1991). A motivational approach to self: Integration in personalit'. In R. Dienstbier (Ed.), ''Nebraska symposium on motivation: Vol. 38. Perspectives on motivation'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;237&amp;ndash;288). Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deci, E. 1995"&gt;Deci, E. L., &amp; Ryan, R. M. (1995). Human autonomy: The basis for true self-esteem. In M. Kernis (Ed.), ''Efficacy, agency, and self-esteem'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;3149). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deci and Ryan, the three psychological needs motivate the self to initiate behavior and specify nutriments that are essential for psychological health and well-being of an individual. These needs are said to be universal, innate and psychological and include the need for [[Competence (human resources)|competence]], [[autonomy]], and [[Social relation|relatedness]].&lt;ref name="Deci, E. 2002"/&gt;

==Basic theory==
SDT is centered on the belief that human nature shows persistent positive features, that it repeatedly shows effort, agency and commitment in their lives that the theory calls "inherent growth tendencies". People also have innate psychological needs that are the basis for self-motivation and personality integration.
[[File:SelfDeterminationTheory.png|right|250px]]
SDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth:

These needs are seen as universal necessities that are innate, not learned (instinctive), and seen in humanity across time, gender and culture.&lt;ref name="Chirkov, V. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chirkov | first1 = V. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R. M. | last3 = Kim | first3 = Y. | last4 = Kaplan | first4 = U. | year = 2003 | title = Differentiating autonomy from individualism and independence: A self-determination perspective on internalisation of cultural orientations, gender and well being | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 97–110 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.97| pmid = 12518973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deci and Ryan claim that there are three essential elements of the theory:&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deci | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Vansteenkiste | first2 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Self-determination theory and basic need satisfaction: Understanding human development in positive psychology | url = | journal = Ricerche di Psichologia | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 17–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Humans are inherently proactive with their potential and mastering their inner forces (such as drives and emotions)
# Humans have an inherent tendency toward growth development and integrated functioning
# Optimal development and actions are inherent in humans but they don't happen automatically

To actualise their inherent potential they need nurturing from the social environment.

If this happens there are positive consequences (e.g. well being and growth) but if not, there are negative consequences. So SDT emphasises humans' natural growth toward positive motivation; however, this is thwarted if their basic needs are not fulfilled.

===Needs===
SDT supports three basic psychological needs that must be satisfied to foster well-being and health. These needs can be universally applied. However, some may be more salient than others at certain times and are expressed differently based on time, culture, or experience.

;'''Competence''' :Seek to control the outcome and experience mastery&lt;ref name="White, R. W. 1959"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = R. W. | year = 1959 | title = Motivation reconsidered: The concept of competence | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 66 | issue = 5| pages = 297–333 | doi=10.1037/h0040934}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;'''Relatedness''' : Will to interact, be connected to, and experience caring for others&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R. 1995"/&gt;
;'''Autonomy''': Desire to be causal agents of one's own life and act in harmony with one's integrated self; however, Deci and Vansteenkiste&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 2004" /&gt; note this does not mean to be independent of others

===Motivations===
SDT claims to give a different approach to motivation, considering what motivates a person at any given time as opposed to seeing motivation as a unitary concept. SDT makes distinctions between different types of motivation and the consequences of them.

====Intrinsic motivation====
[[Intrinsic motivation]] is the natural, inherent drive to seek out challenges and new possibilities that SDT associates with cognitive and social development.

''[[Cognitive evaluation theory]]'' (CET)&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 1985"&gt;Deci, E. L., &amp; Ryan, R. M. (1985). ''Intrinsic motivation and self-determination in human behaviour''. New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; is a sub-theory of SDT that specifies factors explaining intrinsic motivation and variability with it and looks at how social and environmental factors help or hinder intrinsic motivations.
CET focuses on the needs of competence and autonomy. CET is offered as an explanation of the phenomenon known as [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational "crowding out."]]

Claiming social context events like feedback on work or rewards lead to feelings of competence and so enhance intrinsic motivations. Deci&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 1975" /&gt; found positive feedback enhanced intrinsic motivations and negative feedback diminished it. Vallerand and Reid&lt;ref name="Vallerand, R. J. 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vallerand | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Reid | first2 = G. | year = 1984 | title = On the causal effects of perceived competence on intrinsic motivation: A test of cognitive evaluation theory | url = | journal = Journal of Sport Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 94–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; went further and found that these effects were being mediated by perceived control.

Autonomy, however, must accompany competence for people to see their behaviours as self determined by intrinsic motivation. For this to happen there must be immediate contextual support for both needs or inner resources based on prior development support for both needs.&lt;ref name="Reeve, J. 1996"&gt;Reeve, J. (1996). ''Motivating others''. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;

CET and intrinsic motivation is also linked to relatedness through the hypothesis that intrinsic motivation flourishes if linked with a sense of security and relatedness. Grolnick and Ryan&lt;ref name="Grolnick, W. S. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grolnick | first1 = W. S. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R. M. | year = 1989 | title = Parent styles associated with children's self-regulation and competence in schools | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 143–154 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.81.2.143}}&lt;/ref&gt; found lower intrinsic motivation in children who believed their teachers to be uncaring or cold and so not fulfilling their relatedness needs.

====Extrinsic motivation====
[[Extrinsic motivation]] comes from external sources. Deci and Ryan&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 1985" /&gt; developed organismic integration theory (OIT), as a sub-theory of SDT, to explain the different ways extrinsically motivated behaviour is regulated.

OIT details the different forms of extrinsic motivation and the contexts in which they come about. It is the context of such motivation that concerns the SDT theory as these contexts affect whether the motivations are internalised and so integrated into the sense of self.

OIT describes four different types of extrinsic motivations that often vary in terms of their relative autonomy:

# '''Externally regulated behaviour''': Is the least autonomous, it is performed because of external demand or possible reward. Such actions can be seen to have an externally perceived [[locus of causality]].&lt;ref name="deCharms, R. 1968"/&gt;
# '''Introjected regulation of behaviour''': describes taking on regulations to behaviour but not fully accepting said regulations as your own. Deci and Ryan&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 1995"&gt;Deci, E. L., &amp; Ryan, R. M. (1995). Human autonomy: The basis for true self-esteem. In M. Kemis (Ed.), ''Efficacy, agency, and self-esteem'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;31&amp;ndash;49). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; claim such behaviour normally represents regulation by contingent self-esteem, citing ego involvement as a classic form of introjections.&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. M. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Deci | first2 = E. L. | year = 2000 | title = Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 68–78 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.68| citeseerx = 10.1.1.529.4370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the kind of behaviour where people feel motivated to demonstrate ability to maintain self-worth. While this is internally driven, introjected behavior has an external perceived locus of causality or not coming from one's self.  Since the causality of the behavior is perceived as external, the behavior is considered non-self-determined.
# '''Regulation through identification''': Is a more autonomously driven form of extrinsic motivation. It involves consciously valuing a goal or regulation so that said action is accepted as personally important.
# '''Integrated Regulation''': Is the most autonomous kind of extrinsic motivation.  Occurring when regulations are fully assimilated with self so they are included in a person's self evaluations and beliefs on personal needs.  Because of this, integrated motivations share qualities with intrinsic motivation but are still classified as extrinsic because the goals that are trying to be achieved are for reasons extrinsic to the self, rather than the inherent enjoyment or interest in the task.

Extrinsically motivated behaviours can be integrated into self.  OIT proposes internalization is more likely to occur when there is a sense of relatedness.

Ryan, Stiller and Lynch&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. M. 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Stiller | first2 = J. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = J. H. | year = 1994 | title = Representations of relationships to teachers, parents, and friends as predictors of academic motivation and self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Early Adolescence | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 226–249 | doi=10.1177/027243169401400207}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children internalize school's extrinsic regulations when they feel secure and cared for by parents and teachers.

Internalisation of extrinsic motivation is also linked to competence. OIT suggests that feelings of competence in activities should facilitate internalisation of said actions.&lt;ref name="Vallerand, R. J. 1997"&gt;Vallerand, R. J. (1997). Toward a hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. In M. P. Zanna (Ed.), ''Advances in experimental social psychology'' (Vol. 29, pp.&amp;nbsp;271&amp;ndash;360). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomy is particularly important when trying to integrate its regulations into a person's sense of self. If an external context allows a person to integrate regulation—they must feel competent, related and autonomous. They must also understand the regulation in terms of their other goals to facilitate a sense of autonomy.&lt;ref name="Kuhl, J. 1998"&gt;Kuhl, J., &amp; Fuhrmann, A. (1998). Decomposing self-regulation and selfcontrol. In J. Heckhausen &amp; C. Dweck (Eds.), ''Motivation and self-regulation across the life-span'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;15&amp;ndash;49), New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by Deci, Eghrari, Patrick and Leone&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deci | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Eghrari | first2 = H. | last3 = Patrick | first3 = B. C. | last4 = Leone | first4 = D. R. | year = 1994 | title = Facilitating internalization: The self-determination theory perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 119–142 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00797.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; who found in laboratory settings if a person was given a meaningful reason for uninteresting behaviour along with support for their sense of autonomy and relatedness they internalized and integrated their behaviour.

==Basic needs and intrinsic motivation==
White&lt;ref name="White, R. W. 1959"/&gt; and deCharms&lt;ref name="deCharms, R. 1968"/&gt; proposed that the need for competence and autonomy is the basis of intrinsic motivation and behaviour. This is a link between people's basic needs and their motivations.

===Autonomy===
Deci&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 1971"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deci | first1 = E. L. | year = 1971 | title = Effects of externally mediated rewards on intrinsic motivation | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 105–115 | doi=10.1037/h0030644}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that offering people extrinsic rewards for behaviour that is intrinsically motivated undermined the intrinsic motivation as they grow less interested in it. Initially intrinsically motivated behaviour becomes controlled by external rewards, which undermines their autonomy.

Further research by Amabile, DeJong and Lepper&lt;ref name="Amabile, T. M. 1976"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | last2 = DeJong | first2 = W. | last3 = Lepper | first3 = M. | year = 1976 | title = Effects of externally imposed deadlines on intrinsic motivation | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 92–98 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.34.1.92}}&lt;/ref&gt; found other external factors like deadlines, which restrict and control, also decrease intrinsic motivation.

Situations that give autonomy as opposed to taking it away also have a similar link to motivation. Studies looking at choice have found that increasing a participant's options and choices increases their intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman, M. 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zuckerman | first1 = M. | last2 = Porac | first2 = J. | last3 = Lathin | first3 = D. | last4 = Smith | first4 = R. | last5 = Deci | first5 = E. L. | year = 1978 | title = On the importance of self-determination for intrinsically motivated behaviour | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 443–446 | doi=10.1177/014616727800400317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competence===
Deci&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 1971" /&gt; found that giving people unexpected positive feedback on a task increases people's intrinsic motivation to do it, meaning that this was because the positive feedback was fulfilling people's need for competence. In fact, giving positive feedback on a task served only to increase people's intrinsic motivation and decreased extrinsic motivation for the task.

Vallerand and Reid&lt;ref name="Vallerand, R. J. 1984" /&gt; found negative feedback has the opposite effect (i.e., decreasing intrinsic motivation by taking away from people's need for competence).

===Relatedness===
During a study on the relationship between infants' attachment styles, their exhibition of mastery-oriented behaviour, and their affect during play, Frodi, Bridges and Grolnick&lt;ref name="Frodi, A. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frodi | first1 = A. | last2 = Bridges | first2 = L. | last3 = Grolnick | first3 = W. S. | year = 1985 | title = Correlates of mastery-related behaviour: A short term longitudinal study of infant in their second year | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 5| pages = 1291–1298 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00197.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; failed to find significant effects: "Perhaps somewhat surprising was the finding that the quality of attachment assessed at 12 months failed to significantly predict either mastery motivation, competence, or affect 8 months later, when other investigators have demonstrated an association between similar constructs ..." Yet they note that larger sample sizes could be able to uncover such effects: "A comparison of the secure/stable and the insecure/stable groups, however, did suggest that the secure/stable group was superior to the insecure/stable groups on all mastery-related measures. Obviously, replications of all the attachment-motivation relations are needed with different and larger samples."

==Individual differences==
SDT argues that needs are innate but can be developed in a social context. Some people develop stronger needs than others, creating individual differences. However, individual differences within the theory focus on concepts resulting from the degree to which needs have been satisfied or not satisfied.

Within SDT there are two general individual difference concepts, Causality Orientations and Life Goals.

===Causality orientations===
Causality orientations are motivational orientations that refer to either the way people orient to an environment and regulate their behaviour because of this or the extent to which they are self determined in general across many settings. SDT created three orientations: autonomous, controlled and impersonal.

# '''Autonomous Orientations''': result from satisfaction of the basic needs
# '''Strong controlled orientations''': Result from satisfaction of competence and relatedness needs but not of autonomy and is linked to regulation through internal and external contingencies, which lead to rigid functioning and diminished well being.
# '''Impersonal Orientations''': Results from failing to fulfill all three needs.  This is also related to poor functioning and ill being.

According to the theory people have some amount of each of the orientations, which can be used to make predictions on a persons psychological health and behavioural outcomes.

===Life goals===
Life goals are long-term goals people use to guide their activities, and they fall into two categories:&lt;ref name="Kasser, T. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kasser | first1 = T. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R. M. | year = 1996 | title = Further examining the American dream: Differential correlates of intrinsic and extrinsic goals | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 280–287 | doi=10.1177/0146167296223006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Intrinsic Aspirations''': Contain life goals like affiliation, generativity and personal development.
# '''Extrinsic Aspirations''': Have life goals like wealth, fame and attractiveness.

There have been several studies on this subject that chart intrinsic goals being associated with greater health, well being and performance.&lt;ref name="Vansteenkiste, M. 2003"&gt;Vansteenkiste, M., Simons, J., Lens, W., Sheldon, K.

==Key studies==

===Deci (1971): External rewards on intrinsic motivation===
Deci&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 1971" /&gt; investigated the effects of external rewards on intrinsic motivation in two laboratory and one field experiment. Based on the results from earlier animal and human studies regarding intrinsic motivation the author explored two possibilities. In the first two experiments he looked at the effect of extrinsic rewards in terms of a decrease in intrinsic motivation to perform a task. Earlier studies showed contradictory or inconclusive findings regarding decrease in performance on a task following an external reward. The third experiment was based on findings of developmental learning theorists and looked at whether a different type of reward enhances intrinsic motivation to participate in an activity.

====Experiment I====
This experiment tested the hypothesis that if an individual is intrinsically motivated to perform an activity, introduction of an extrinsic reward decreases the degree of intrinsic motivation to perform the task.

Twenty-four undergraduate psychology students participated in the first laboratory experiment and were assigned to experimental (''n'' = 12) and control group (''n'' = 12). Each group participated in three sessions conducted on three different days. During the sessions, participants were engaged in working on a [[Soma cube]] puzzle—which the experimenters assumed was an activity college students would be intrinsically motivated to do. The puzzle could be put together to form numerous different configurations. In each session, the participants were shown four different configurations drawn on a piece of paper and were asked to use the puzzle to reproduce the configurations while they were being timed.

The first and third session of the experimental condition were identical to control, but in the second session the participants in the experimental condition were given a dollar for completing each puzzle within time. During the middle of each session, the experimenter left the room for eight minutes and the participants were told that they were free to do whatever they wanted during that time, while the experimenter observed during that period. The amount of time spent working on the puzzle during the free choice period was used to measure motivation.

As Deci expected, when external reward was introduced during session two, the participants spent more time working on the puzzles during the free choice period in comparison to session 1 and when the external reward was removed in the third session, the time spent working on the puzzle dropped lower than the first session. All subjects reported finding the task interesting and enjoyable at the end of each session, providing evidence for the experimenter's assumption that the task was intrinsically motivating for the college students. The study showed some support of the experimenter's hypothesis and a trend towards decrease in intrinsic motivation was seen after money was provided to the participants as external reward.

====Experiment II====
The second experiment was a field experiment, similar to laboratory Experiment I, but was conducted in a natural setting.

Eight student workers were observed at a college biweekly newspaper. Four of the students served as a control group and worked on Friday. The experimental group worked on Tuesdays.

The control and experimental group students were not aware that they were being observed. The 10-week observation was divided into three time periods. The task in this study required the students to write headlines for the newspaper.

During "Time 2", the students in the experimental group were given 50 cents for each headline they wrote. At the end of Time 2, they were told that in the future the newspaper cannot pay them 50 cent for each headline anymore as the newspaper ran out of the money allocated for that and they were not paid for the headlines during Time 3.

The speed of task completion (headlines) was used as a measure of motivation in this experiment. Absences were used as a measure of attitudes.

To assess the stability of the observed effect, the experimenter observed the students again (Time 4) for two weeks. There was a gap of five weeks between Time 3 and Time 4. Due to absences and change in assignment etc., motivation data was not available for all students. The results of this experiment were similar to Experiment I and monetary reward was found to decrease the intrinsic motivation of the students, supporting Deci's hypothesis.

====Experiment III====
Experiment III was also conducted in the laboratory and was identical to Experiment I in all respects except for the kind of external reward provided to the students in experimental condition during Session 2.

In this experiment, verbal praise was used as an extrinsic reward.

The experimenter hypothesized that a different type of reward—i.e., social approval in the form of verbal reinforcement and positive feedback for performing the task that a person is intrinsically motivated to perform—enhances the degree of external motivation, even after the extrinsic reward is removed.

The results of the experiment III confirmed the hypothesis and the students' performance increased significantly during the third session in comparison to session one, showing that verbal praise and positive feedback enhances performance in tasks that a person is initially intrinsically motivated to perform. This provides evidence that verbal praise as external reward increases intrinsic motivation.

The author explained differences between the two types of external rewards as having different effects on intrinsic motivation. When a person is intrinsically motivated to perform a task and money is introduced to work on the task, the individual cognitively re-evaluates the importance of the task and the intrinsic motivation to perform the task (because the individual finds it interesting) shifts to extrinsic motivation and the primary focus changes from enjoying the task to gaining financial reward.  However, when verbal praise is provided in a similar situation increases intrinsic motivation as it is not evaluated to be controlled by external factors and the person sees the task as an enjoyable task that is performed autonomously.  The increase in intrinsic motivation is explained by [[positive reinforcement]] and an increase in perceived locus of control to perform the task.

===Pritchard, Campbell and Campbell (1977): Evaluation of Deci's Hypothesis===
Pritchard, Campbell and Campbell&lt;ref name="Pritchard, R. 1977"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pritchard | first1 = R. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = K. | last3 = Campbell | first3 = D. | year = 1977 | title = Effects of extrinsic financial rewards on intrinsic motivation | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 9–15 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.62.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a similar study to evaluate Deci's hypothesis regarding the role of extrinsic rewards on decreasing intrinsic motivation.

Participants were randomly assigned to two groups. A chess-problem task was used in this study. Data was collected in two sessions.

====Session I====
Participants were asked to complete a background questionnaire that included questions on the amount of time the participant played chess during the week, the number of years that the participant has been playing chess for, amount of enjoyment the participant gets from playing the game, etc.

The participants in both groups were then told that the experimenter needed to enter the information in the computer and for the next 10 minutes the participant were free to do whatever they liked.

The experimenter left the room for 10 minutes. The room had similar chess-problem tasks on the table, some magazines as well as coffee was made available for the participants if they chose to have it.

The time spent on the chess-problem task was observed through a one way mirror by the experimenter during the 10 minutes break and was used as a measure of intrinsic motivation. After the experimenter returned, the experimental group was told that there was a monetary reward for the participant who could work on the most chess problems in the given time and that the reward is for this session only and would not be offered during the next session. The control group was not offered a monetary reward.

====Session II====
The second session was the same for the two groups:

After a filler task, the experimenter left the room for 10 minutes and the time participants spent on the chess-problem task was observed. The experimental group was reminded that there was no reward for the task this time.

After both sessions the participants were required to respond to questionnaires evaluating the task, i.e. to what degree did they find the task interesting. Both groups reported that they found the task interesting.

The results of the study showed that the experimental group showed a significant decrease in time spent on the chess-problem task during the 10-minute free time from session 1 to session 2 in comparison to the group that was not paid, thus confirming the hypothesis presented by Deci that contingent monetary reward for an activity decreases the intrinsic motivation to perform that activity. Other studies were conducted around this time focusing on other types of rewards as well as other external factors that play a role in decreasing intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name="eg Amabile, T.

==New developments==
Principles of SDT have been applied in many domains of life, e.g., job demands;&lt;ref name="Fernet, C. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fernet | first1 = C. | last2 = Guay | first2 = F. | last3 = Senecal | first3 = C. | year = 2004 | title = Adjusting to job demands: The role of work self-determination and job control in predicting burnout | url = | journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 39–56 | doi=10.1016/s0001-8791(03)00098-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; parenting;&lt;ref name="eg Soenens, B. 2007"&gt;e.g. Soenens, B., Vansteenkiste, M., Lens, W., Luyckx, K., Beyers, W., Goossens, L., &amp; Ryan, R.

===Exercise===
Murcia, Roman, Galindo, Alonso and Gonzalez-Cutre&lt;ref name="Murcia, J. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murcia | first1 = J. | last2 = Roman | first2 = M. | last3 = Galindo | first3 = C. | last4 = Alonso | first4 = N. | last5 = Gonzalez-Cutre | first5 = D. | year = 2008 | title = Peers' influence on exercise enjoyment: A self-determination theory approach | url = | journal = Journal of Sports Science and Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 23–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the influence of peers on enjoyment in exercise. Specifically, the researchers looked at the effect of motivational climate generated by peers on exercisers by analyzing data collected through questionnaires and rating scales. The assessment included evaluation of motivational climate, basic psychological needs satisfaction, levels of self-determination and self-regulation (amotivation, external, introjected, identified and intrinsic regulation) and also the assessment of the level of satisfaction and enjoyment in exercising.

Data analysis revealed that when peers are supportive and there is an emphasis on cooperation, effort, and personal improvement, the climate influences variables like basic psychological needs, motivation and enjoyment. The task climate positively predicted the three basic psychological needs (competence, autonomy and relatedness) and so positively predicted self-determined motivation. Task climate and the resulting self-determination were also found to positively influence level of enjoyment the exercisers experienced during the activity.

===Awareness===
[[Awareness]] has always been associated with autonomous functioning; however, it was only recently that the SDT researchers incorporated the idea of [[mindfulness]] and its relationship with autonomous functioning and emotional wellbeing in their research.

Brown and Ryan&lt;ref name="Brown, K. W. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = K. W. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R. M. | year = 2003 | title = The benefits of being present: Mindfulness and its role in psychological well-being | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 4| pages = 822–848 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.4.822 | pmid=12703651| citeseerx = 10.1.1.331.8033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a series of five experiments to study mindfulness: They defined mindfulness as open, undivided attention to what is happening within as well as around oneself.

From their experiments, the authors concluded that when individuals act mindfully, their actions are consistent with their values and interest. Also, there is a possibility that being autonomous and performing an action because it is enjoyable to oneself increases mindful attention to one's actions.

===Vitality and self-regulation===
Another area of interest for SDT researchers is the relationship between [[subjective vitality]] and self-regulation. Ryan and Deci&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R. | last2 = Deci | first2 = E. | year = 2008 | title = From ego-depletion to vitality: Theory and findings concerning the facilitation of energy available to the self | url = | journal = Social and Personality Psychology Compass | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 702–717 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2008.00098.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; define vitality as energy available to the self, either directly or indirectly, from basic psychological needs. This energy allows individuals to act autonomously.

Many theorists have posited that self-regulation depletes energy but SDT researchers have proposed and demonstrated that only controlled regulation depletes energy, autonomous regulation can actually be vitalizing.&lt;ref name="Moller, A. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moller | first1 = A. | last2 = Deci | first2 = E. | last3 = Ryan | first3 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Choice and ego-depletion: The moderating role of autonomy | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 32 | issue = 8| pages = 1024–1036 | doi=10.1177/0146167206288008| pmid = 16861307 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.466.5776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
A recent study by Hyungshim Jang&lt;ref name="Jang, H. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jang | first1 = H | year = 2008 | title = Supporting students' motivation, engagement, and learning during an uninteresting activity | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 798–811 | doi=10.1037/a0012841}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the capacity of two different theoretical models of motivation were used to explain why an externally provided rationale for doing a particular assignment often helps in a student's motivation, engagement, and learning during relatively uninteresting learning activities.

Undergraduate students (''N'' = 136; 108 women, 28 men) worked on a relatively uninteresting short lesson after either receiving or not receiving a rationale. Students who received the rationale showed greater interest, work ethic, and determination.

[[Structural equation modeling]] was used to test three alternative explanatory models to understand why the rationale produced such benefits:
# An identified regulation model based on self-determination theory
# An interest regulation model based on interest-enhancing strategies research
# An additive model that integrated both models.

The data fit all three models; but only the model based on self-determination theory helped students to engage and learn. Findings show the role that externally provided rationales can play in helping students generate the motivation they need to engage in and learn from uninteresting, but personally important, material.&lt;ref name="Jang, H. 2008" /&gt;

The importance of these findings to those in the field of education is that when teachers try to find ways to promote student's motivation during relatively uninteresting learning activities, they can successfully do so by promoting the value of the task. One way teachers can help students value what they may deem "uninteresting" is by providing a rationale that identifies the lesson's otherwise hidden value, helps students understand why the lesson is genuinely worth their effort, and communicates why the lesson can be expected to be useful to them.&lt;ref name="Jang, H. 2008" /&gt;

An example of SDT and education are [[Sudbury school|Sudbury Model schools]] where people decide for themselves how to spend their days. In these schools, students of all ages determine what they do, as well as when, how, and where they do it. This freedom is at the heart of the school; it belongs to the students as their right, not to be violated. The fundamental premises of the school are simple: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility. In practice this means that students initiate all their own activities and create their own environments. The physical plant, the staff, and the equipment are there for the students to use as the need arises. The school provides a setting in which students are independent, are trusted, and are treated as responsible people; and a community in which students are exposed to the complexities of life in the framework of a participatory democracy. Sudbury schools do not perform and do not offer evaluations, assessments, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational evaluation for the 21st century, they adduce.&lt;ref name="Greenberg, D. 1995"&gt;Greenberg, D.(1995).

==Alcohol use==
According to self-determination theory,&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deci | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R. M. | year = 1987 | title = The support of autonomy and the control of behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 6| pages = 1024–1037 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.6.1024}}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals who attribute their actions to external circumstances rather than internal mechanisms are far more likely to succumb to peer pressure.  In contrast, individuals who consider themselves autonomous tend to be initiators of actions rather than followers.  Research examining the relationship between self-determination theory and alcohol use among college students has indicated that individuals with the former criteria for decision making are associated with greater alcohol consumption and drinking as a function of social pressure.  For instance, in a study conducted by Knee and Neighbors,&lt;ref name="Knee, C. R. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knee | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Neighbors | first2 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Self-determination, perception of peer pressure, and drinking among college students | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 522–543 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb00228.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; external factors in the individuals who claim to not be motivated by internal factors were found to be associated with drinking for extrinsic reasons, and with stronger perceptions of peer pressure, which in turn was related to heavier alcohol use. Given the evidence suggesting a positive association between an outward motivation and drinking, and the potential role of perceived social influence in this association, understanding the precise nature of this relationship seems important. Further, it may be hypothesized that the relationship between self-determination and drinking may be mediated to some extent by the perceived approval of others.&lt;ref name="Chawla, N. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chawla | first1 = N. | last2 = Neighbors | first2 = C. | last3 = Logan | first3 = D. | last4 = Lewis | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Fossos | first5 = N. | year = 2009 | title = Perceived approval of friends and parents as mediators of the relationship between self-determination and drinking | url = | journal = Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 92–100 | doi=10.15288/jsad.2009.70.92| pmid = 19118397 | pmc = 2629627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivational interviewing==
[[Motivational interviewing]] (MI) is a popular approach to positive behavioral change. Used initially in the area of addiction (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002),&lt;ref&gt;Miller, W. R., &amp; Rollnick, S. (2002). ''Motivational interviewing: Preparing people for change (2nd ed.)''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; it is now used for a wider range of issues. It is a client-centered method that doesn't persuade or coerce patients to change and instead attempts to explore and resolve their ambivalent feelings, which allows them to choose themselves whether to change or not.

Markland, Ryan, Tobin, and Rollnick&lt;ref name="Markland, D. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markland | first1 = D. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R. M. | last3 = Tobin | first3 = V. | last4 = Rollnick | first4 = S. | year = 2005 | title = Motivational interviewing and self-determination theory | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 811–831 | doi=10.1521/jscp.2005.24.6.811}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that SDT provides a framework behind how and the reasons why MI works. They believe that MI provides an autonomy-supportive atmosphere, which allows clients to find their own source of motivation and achieve their own success (in terms of overcoming addiction). Patients randomly assigned to an MI treatment group found the setting to be more autonomy-supportive than those in a regular support group.&lt;ref name="Foote, J. 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foote | first1 = J. | last2 = DeLuca | first2 = A. | last3 = Magura | first3 = S. | last4 = Grand | first4 = A. | last5 = Rosenblum | first5 = A. | last6 = Stahl | first6 = S. | year = 1999 | title = A group motivational treatment for chemical dependence | url = | journal = Journal of Substance Abuse | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 181–192 | doi=10.1016/s0740-5472(99)00003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental behaviors==

Several studies explored the link between self-determination theory and environmental behaviors to determine the role of intrinsic motivation for environmental behavior performance and to account for the lack of success of current intervention strategies.&lt;ref name=Green-Demers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green-Demers|first=Isabelle|author2=Pelletier, L. G. |author3=Menard, S. |title=The impact of behavioural difficulty on the salience of the association between self-determined motivation and environmental behaviours|journal= Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science|year=1997|volume=29|issue=3|pages=157–166|doi=10.1037/0008-400x.29.3.157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation toward the Environment Scale===

Environmental attitudes and knowledge are not good predictors of behavior. Self-determination theory suggests that motivation can predict behavior performance. Pelletier et al. (1998) constructed a scale of motivation for environmental behavior, which consists of 4x6 statements (4 statements for each type of motivation on the SDT motivation scale: intrinsic, integrated, identified, introjected, external, and amotivation) responding to a question 'Why are you doing things for the environment?'. Each item is scored on a 1-7 Likert scale.&lt;ref name="Pelletier 1998 437–468"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Luc G.|author2=Tuson, K. M. |author3=Green-Demers, I. |author4=Noels, K. |author5=Beaton, A. M. |title=Why are you doing things for the environment? The motivation toward the environment scale (MTES).|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=28|issue=5|pages=437–468|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01714.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilizing MTES, Villacorta (2003) demonstrates a correlation between environmental concerns and intrinsic motivations together with peer and parental support; further, intrinsically motivated behaviors tend to persist longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Villacorta|first=Mark|author2=Koestner, R. |author3=Lekes, N. |title= Further validation of the motivation toward the environment scale.|journal=Environment and Behavior|year=2003|volume=35|issue=4|pages=486–505|doi=10.1177/0013916503035004003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Amotivation===

Pelletier et al. (1999) shows that four personal beliefs, helplessness, strategy, capacity, and effort, lead to greater amotivation, while self-determination has an inverse relationship with amotivation. The Amotivation toward the Environment Scale measures the four reasons for amotivation by answering a question 'Why are you not doing things for the environment?'. The participants rank 16 total statements (four in each category of amotivation) on a 1-7 Likert scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Luc G.|author2=Dion, S. |author3=Tuson, K. |author4=Green-Demers, I. |title= Why do people fail to adopt environmental protective behaviors? Toward a taxonomy of environmental amotivation|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|year=1999|volume=29|issue=12|pages=2481–2504|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1999.tb00122.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intervention strategies===

Intervention strategies have to be effective in bridging the gap between attitudes and behaviors. Monetary incentives, persuasive communication, and convenience are often successful in the short term, but when the intervention is removed, behavior is discontinued. In the long run, such intervention strategies are therefore expensive and difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name="Green-Demers"/&gt;

Self-determination theory explains that environmental behavior that is not motivated intrinsically is not persistent. On the other hand, when self-determination is high, behavior is more likely to occur repeatedly. The importance of intrinsic motivation is particularly apparent with more difficult behaviors. While they are less likely to be performed in general, people with high internal motivation are more likely to perform them more frequently than people with low intrinsic motivation. 5 Subjects scoring high on intrinsic motivation and supporting ecological well-being also reported a high level of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Kirk W.|author2=Kasser, T. |title=Are psychological and ecological well-being compatible? The role of values, mindfulness, and lifestyle.|journal=Social Indicators Research|year=2005|volume=74|issue=2|pages=349–368|doi=10.1007/s11205-004-8207-8|citeseerx=10.1.1.321.1585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Osbaldiston and Sheldon (2003), autonomy perceived by an individual leads to an increased frequency of environmental behavior performance. In their study, 162 university students chose an environmental goal and performed it for a week. Perceived autonomy, success in performing chosen behavior, and their future intention to continue were measured. The results suggested that people with higher degree of self-perceived autonomy successfully perform behaviors and are more likely to do so in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Obaldiston|first=Richard|author2=Sheldon, K. M. |title=Promoting internalized motivation for environmentally responsible behaviors: A prospective study of environmental goals.|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2003|volume=23|issue=4|pages=349–357|doi=10.1016/s0272-4944(03)00035-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the connection between self-determination theory and environmental behaviors, Pelletier et al. suggest that successful intervention should emphasize self-determined motivation for performing environmental behaviors.&lt;ref name="Pelletier 1998 437–468"/&gt;

The '''Silent Sentinels''' were a group of women in favor of women's [[suffrage]] organized by [[Alice Paul]] and the [[National Woman's Party]]. They protested in front of the [[White House]] during [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s presidency starting on January 10, 1917.&lt;ref name="Stillion1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stillion Southard|first1=Belinda|title=The National Woman's Party and the Silent Sentinels|location=University of Maryland|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silent Sentinels started to protest after a meeting with the president on January 9, 1917, during which he told the women to "concert public opinion on behalf of women's suffrage."&lt;ref name="Stillion2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stillion Southard|first1=Belinda A.|title=Militancy, power, and identity: The Silent Sentinels as women fighting for political voice|journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs|date=2007|volume=10|issue=3|pages=399–417|doi=10.1353/rap.2008.0003|jstor=41940153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters served as a constant reminder to Wilson of his lack of support for suffrage. At first the picketers were tolerated, but they were later arrested on charges of obstructing traffic.The women protested for six days a week until June 4, 1919 when the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was passed both by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

The name Silent Sentinels was given to the women because of their silent protesting. Using silence as a form of protest was a new principled, strategic, and rhetorical strategy within the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|national suffrage movement]] and within their own assortment of protest strategies.&lt;ref name="Stillion2"/&gt;

Throughout this two and a half year long vigil many of the nearly 2,000 women&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/women-of-protest/articles-and-essays/tactics-and-techniques-of-the-national-womans-party-suffrage-campaign/|title=Tactics and Techniques of the National Woman's Party Campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who picketed were harassed, arrested, and unjustly treated by local and US authorities, including the torture and abuse inflicted on them before and during the November 14, 1917 Night of Terror.

==Background==
The Silent Sentinels' protests were organized by the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), a militant women's suffrage organization. The NWP was first founded as the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]] (CUWS) in 1913 by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]] following the Congressional Committee's woman suffrage parade in 1913.&lt;ref name="Stillion3" /&gt; CUWS by definition was an organization that took a militant approach to women's suffrage and broke away from the more moderate [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).&lt;ref name=Stillion3&gt;{{Cite book|title=Militant Citizenship: Rhetorical Strategies of the National Woman's Party, 1913–1920|last=Stillion Southard|first=Belinda A.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60344-281-7|location=College Station, TX|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUWS only lasted for three years until its founders merged it with the Woman's Party to form the [[National Woman's Party]].&lt;ref name=Stillion3/&gt; The [[National Woman's Party]] boasted fewer members than [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]](having 50,000 members to NAWSA's 2 million),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but its tactics were more attention-grabbing and harnessed more media coverage. The NWP's members are known primarily for picketing the White House and going on hunger strikes while in the workhouses.

==The Suffragist==
''[[The Suffragist]]'' was the [[National Woman's Party]] weekly newsletter. ''The Suffragist'' acted as a voice for the Silent Sentinels throughout their vigil. It covered the Sentinels' progress and included interviews with protesters, reports on President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s (non) reaction, and political essays.&lt;ref name ="Stillion1" /&gt; While the Sentinels were in prison, a few meters wrote about their experiences which were later posted in ''The Suffragist''. "Although The Suffragist was intended for mass circulation, its subscription peaked at just over 20,000 issues in 1917. Further, most copies went to party members, advertisers, branch headquarters, and NWP organizers, which strongly suggests that the [[suffragists]] themselves were a key audience of the publication."&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;

==Banners==
[[File:Suffragette banner carried in picket of the White House.jpg|thumb|A Sentinel with a banner]]

The following are examples of banners held by the women:
* "Mr. President, what will you do for woman suffrage?"&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;
* "Mr. President, how long must women wait for liberty?"&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;
* "We shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Woodrow. Address to Joint Session of Congress. Congress. Washington D.C.. 2 April 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Democracy Should Begin at Home"
* "The time has come to conquer or submit, for us there can be but one choice. We have made it." (another quotation from Wilson)
* "Kaiser Wilson, have you forgotten your sympathy with the poor Germans because they were not self-governed? 20,000,000 American women are not self-governed. Take the beam out of your own eye." (comparing Wilson to [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany, and to a famous quote of [[Jesus]] regarding hypocrisy)
* "Mr. President, you say liberty is the fundamental demand of the human spirit."&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt; 
* "Mr. President, you say we are interested in the United States, politically speaking, in nothing but human liberty."&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;

The Sentinels all wore purple, white, and gold sashes which are the NWP's colors. Their banners were also usually colored this way.&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;

==Responses==
The public's responses to the Silent Sentinels were varied.

Some people wholeheartedly approved of the work Silent Sentinels were performing. Men and women present at the scene of the [[White House]] showed their support for the Sentinels by bringing them hot drinks and hot bricks to stand on. Sometimes, women would even assist in holding up the banners. Other ways of showing support included writing letters praising the Sentinels to The Suffragist and donating money.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Woman's Crusade: Alice Paul and the Battle for the Ballot|last=Walton|first=Mary|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-61175-7|location=New York, NY|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some disapproved of Silent Sentinels' protests. This included some of the more moderate suffragists. For example, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]- then the leader of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] believed that the best way to realize women's suffrage was to gain the vote through individual states first, upon which women could vote for a pro-suffrage majority in Congress. She thus opposed advocating for a national amendment to grant women's suffrage, as the Sentinels did.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Members of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] feared that pickets would create a backlash from male voters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Anti-suffragists also opposed the Silent Sentinels' protest. Mobs sometimes attempted to deter the Silent Sentinels through violence (which increased after US entry into [[World War I]]). For example, some attacked the Silent Sentinels and tore their banners to shreds. This occurred especially with the more provocative banners, such as banners calling [[Woodrow Wilson]] "Kaiser Wilson."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The New York Times called the protests "silent, silly, and offensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent Sentinels|url=https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/3/2/silent-sentinels |website=The Attic|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men hurled insults or rotten fruit.

At first President Wilson was not very responsive to the women's protest. At points he even seemed amused with it by tipping his hat and smiling. It was said that at one point Wilson even invited them in for coffee.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilson: A Portrait : Women's Suffrage|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/wilson/portrait/wp_suffrage.html|website=PBS|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other points in time, he ignored the protests altogether, such as when the Sentinels protested on the day of his second inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Militant Citizenship: Rhetorical Strategies of the National Woman's Party, 1913–1920|last=Stillion Southard|first=Belinda A.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60344-281-7|location=College Station, TX|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Sentinels continued to protest, the issue became bigger and Wilson's opinion began to change.

==Occoquan Workhouse and the Night of Terror==
[[File:F B Hilles152007v.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Bayard Hilles]], chairman of the Delaware Branch of the [[National Woman's Party|NWP]] and member of the national executive committee, was arrested picketing the [[White House]] July 13, 1917, sentenced to 60 days in [[Occoquan Workhouse]]. She was pardoned by President Wilson after serving three days of her term.]]

On June 22, 1917, police arrested protesters [[Lucy Burns]] and Katherine Morey on charges of obstructing traffic because they carried a banner quoting from Wilson's speech to Congress: "We shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments." On June 25, 12 women were arrested, including [[Mabel Vernon]] and [[Annie Arniel]] from [[Delaware]], again on charges of obstructing traffic. They were sentenced to three days in jail or to pay a $10 fine. They chose jail because they wanted to show commitment to their cause and their willingness to sacrifice their physical bodies. On July 14, 16 women, including [[Florence Bayard Hilles]], [[Alison Turnbull Hopkins]], and [[Elizabeth Selden Rogers]] (of the politically powerful Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman family) were arrested and sentenced to 60 days in jail or to pay a $25 fine.&lt;ref name="Freedom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Doris|title=Jailed for Freedom|date=1920|publisher=Liverright Publishing|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the women chose jail. Lucy Burns argued that the women should be treated as political prisoners, but Wilson denied this request.

When the women arrived at the [[Occoquan Workhouse]] (now the [[Lorton Correctional Complex]]) they were asked to give up everything except for their clothing. They were then taken to a showering station where they were ordered to strip naked and bathe. There was only one bar of soap available for everyone in the workhouse to use, so all of the suffragists refused to use it. Afterwards they were given baggy, unclean, and uncomfortable prison clothes and taken to dinner. They could barely eat dinner because it was so sour and distasteful.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;
 
The conditions of the Occoquan Workhouse were very unsanitary and unsafe. Prisoners had to share cells and many other things with those who had [[syphilis]], and worms were frequently found in their food.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

After serving three days in the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia, Wilson pardoned the women. At first they refused to be pardoned because they were innocent and had nothing to be pardoned for, but they were eventually forced out.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; After a heated debate, the House of Representatives created a committee to deal with women's suffrage in September 1917. Massachusetts Representative [[Joseph Walsh (Massachusetts)|Joseph Walsh]] opposed the creation of the committee, thinking the House was yielding to "the nagging of iron-jawed angels." He referred to the Silent Sentinels as "bewildered, deluded creatures with short skirts and short hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HOUSE MOVES FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE; Adopts by 181 to 107 Rule to Create a Committee to Deal with the Subject.

As the suffragists kept protesting, the jail terms grew longer. Finally, police arrested [[Alice Paul]] on October 20, 1917, while she carried a banner that quoted Wilson: "The time has come to conquer or submit, for us there can be but one choice. We have made it." She was sentenced to seven months in prison. Paul and many others were again sent to the Occoquan Workhouse, where Paul was placed in [[solitary confinement]] for two weeks, with nothing to eat except bread and water. She became weak and unable to walk, so she was taken to the prison hospital. There, she began a [[hunger strike]], and others joined her.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

In response to the hunger strike the prison doctors force fed the women by putting tubes down their throats.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; They force fed them substances that would have as much protein as possible, like raw eggs mixed with milk. Many of the women ended up vomiting because their stomachs could not handle the protein. One physician reported that Alice Paul had "a spirit like [[Joan of Arc]], and it is useless to try to change it. She will die but she will never give up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nardo|first1=Don|title=The Split History of the Women's Suffrage Movement: A Perspective Flip Book|date=1947|publisher=Capstone|location=Stevens Point, WI|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Burns suffered injuries from force feeding, so after the Nineteenth Amendment was passed, she was unable to continue to work with Paul.

On the night of November 14, 1917, known as the "Night of Terror", the superintendent of the Occoquan Workhouse, W.H. Whittaker, ordered the nearly forty guards to brutalize the suffragists. They beat [[Lucy Burns]], chained her hands to the cell bars above her head, then left her there for the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mickenberg|first1=Julia L.|title=Suffragettes and Soviets: American Feminists and the Spector of Revolutionary Russia|journal=Journal of American History|date=2014|volume=100|issue=4|page=1041|doi=10.1093/jahist/jau004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They threw [[Dora Lewis]] into a dark cell and smashed her head against an iron bed, which knocked her out. Her cellmate, Alice Cosu, who believed Lewis to be dead, suffered a heart attack. [[Dorothy Day]], who later co-founded the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], was slammed repeatedly over the back of an iron bench. Guards grabbed, dragged, beat, choked, pinched, and kicked other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=B. F.|title=Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten|journal=Public Policy|date=2004|volume=415|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers carried stories about how the protesters were being treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E5D7113AE433A25756C2A9679D946696D6CF|title=Move Militants from Workhouse|date=November 25, 1917|work=The New York Times|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stories angered some Americans and created more support for the suffrage amendment. On November 27 and 28, all the protesters were released, including Alice Paul after spending five weeks in prison. Later, in March 1918, the [[D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] vacated six suffragists' convictions.&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hunter_v._District_of_Columbia ''Hunter v. District of Columbia''], 47 App. D.C. 406 (D.C. Cir. 1918).&lt;/Ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collins&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459608 Collins, Representing Injustice: Justice as an Icon of Woman Suffrage]&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the [[Information (formal criminal charge)|informations]] on which the women's convictions were based were overly vague.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt;

==Decision==
On January 9, 1918, Wilson announced his support of the women's suffrage amendment. The next day, the House of Representatives narrowly passed the amendment but the Senate refused to even debate it until October. When the Senate voted on the amendment in October, it failed by two votes. And in spite of the ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arrests of White House protesters resumed on August 6, 1918.

To keep up the pressure, on December 16, 1918, protesters started burning Wilson's words in watch fires in front of the White House. On February 9, 1919, the protesters burned Wilson's image in [[effigy]] at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Phillip Edward|title=Prison Narratives from Boethius to Zena|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillian|location=New York, NY|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another front, the National Woman's Party, led by Paul, urged citizens to vote against anti-suffrage senators up for election in the fall of 1918. After the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1918|1918 election]], most members of Congress were pro-suffrage. On May 21, 1919, the House of Representatives passed the amendment, and two weeks later on June 4, the Senate finally followed. With their work done in Congress, the protesters turned their attention to getting the states to ratify the amendment.

It was ratified on August 18, 1920, upon its ratification by Tennessee, the thirty-sixth state to do so by the single vote of a legislator ([[Harry T. Burn]]) who had opposed the amendment but changed his position after his mother sent him a telegram saying "Dear Son, Hurrah! and vote for suffrage. Don't forget to be a good boy and help [[Carrie Chapman Catt|Mrs. Catt]] put the 'rat' in ratification."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">In [[geometry]] and [[combinatorics]], a '''simplicial''' (or '''combinatorial''') '''''d''-sphere''' is a [[simplicial complex]] [[homeomorphic]] to the [[n-sphere|''d''-dimensional sphere]]. Some simplicial spheres arise as the boundaries of [[convex polytope]]s, however, in higher dimensions most simplicial spheres cannot be obtained in this way.

The most important open problem in the field is the '''g-conjecture''', formulated by [[Peter McMullen]], which asks about possible numbers of faces of different dimensions of a simplicial sphere.

== Examples ==
* For any ''n'' ≥ 3, the [[cycle graph|simple ''n''-cycle]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a '''simplicial circle''', i.e. a simplicial sphere of dimension 1. This construction produces all simplicial circles.
* The boundary of a convex [[polyhedron]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with triangular faces, such as an [[octahedron]] or [[icosahedron]], is a simplicial 2-sphere.
* More generally, the boundary of any (''d''+1)-dimensional [[compact space|compact]] (or [[bounded set|bounded]]) simplicial [[convex polytope]] in the [[Euclidean space]] is a simplicial ''d''-sphere.

== Properties ==
It follows from [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]] that any simplicial 2-sphere with ''n'' vertices has 3''n'' &amp;minus; 6 edges and 2''n'' &amp;minus; 4 faces. The case of ''n'' = 4 is realized by the tetrahedron. By repeatedly performing the [[barycentric subdivision]], it is easy to construct a simplicial sphere for any ''n'' ≥ 4. Moreover, [[Ernst Steinitz]] gave a [[Steinitz's theorem|characterization of 1-skeleta]] (or edge graphs) of convex polytopes in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; implying that any simplicial 2-sphere is a boundary of a convex polytope.

[[Branko Grünbaum]] constructed an example of a non-polytopal simplicial sphere. [[Gil Kalai]] proved that, in fact, "most" simplicial spheres are non-polytopal. The smallest example is of dimension ''d'' = 4 and has ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 vertices.

The [[upper bound theorem]] gives upper bounds for the numbers ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''i''-faces of any simplicial ''d''-sphere with ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n'' vertices. This conjecture was proved for polytopal spheres by [[Peter McMullen]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;McMullen, P. On the upper-bound conjecture for convex polytopes. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B 10 1971 187–200.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Richard P. Stanley|Richard Stanley]] for general simplicial spheres in 1975.

The '''''g''-conjecture''', formulated by McMullen in 1970, asks for a complete characterization of ''f''-vectors of simplicial ''d''-spheres. In other words, what are the possible sequences of numbers of faces of each dimension for a simplicial ''d''-sphere? In the case of polytopal spheres, the answer is given by the '''''g''-theorem''', proved in 1979 by Billera and Lee (existence) and Stanley (necessity). It has been conjectured that the same conditions are necessary for general simplicial spheres. The conjecture is open for ''d'' at least 5 (as of 2018).

A supporter of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]], he has been described as [[alt-right]] by ''[[Politico]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and far-right and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] by [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krieg |first=Gregory |date=November 10, 2016 |title=How did Trump win?

== Background ==
Molyneux was born in Ireland and raised mainly in London before moving to Canada at age 11.&lt;ref name=Mississauga-2003 /&gt;  Molyneux attended the [[Glendon College]] of [[York University]], where he was an actor at Theatre Glendon&lt;ref name=Star-23Feb1988 /&gt; and a member of the Debating Society.&lt;ref name=ProTem-8Feb1988 /&gt; He then attended the [[National Theatre School of Canada]] in Montreal.&lt;ref name=Mississauga-2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burg-Star /&gt; In 1991, Molyneux received a B.A. in History from [[McGill University]], where he was active in the [[Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate|McGill Debating Union]]. He then went on to receive an M.A. in History from [[University of Toronto]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=Burg-Star /&gt;&lt;ref name=Globe-2008 /&gt;

== Career ==
In early 1995, Molyneux and his brother Hugh founded Caribou Systems Corporation, a Toronto-based provider of environmental database software. The company was sold in 2000.&lt;ref name="Burg-Star" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2002-01-28_Blue292" /&gt;

In 2005, Molyneux began a podcast called ''Freedomain Radio'' (''FDR'').&lt;ref name="freedomainradio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/0 |title=An Introduction to Freedomain Radio |website=Freedomainradio.com |date= |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the same name for the website on which he distributes his own writings, hosts podcast archives, and provides an [[Internet forum]] for ''FDR'' listeners. Molyneux also produces videos and commentary on current events, and he presents a weekly call-in show on which listeners can ask questions or discuss personal issues.&lt;ref name="Globe-2008" /&gt; Molyneux funds his efforts by soliciting direct payment from listeners and viewers.&lt;ref name="Horsager-TheTrustEdge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Horsager |first=David |date=October 2012 |title=The Trust Edge: How top leaders gain faster results, deeper relationships, and a stronger bottom line |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=New York |pages=25–26 |oclc=820783989 |isbn=978-1-4767-1137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Molyneux interviewed James Damore, the [[Google]] employee who was fired after writing the [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]] memo.&lt;ref name="Goo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Levin |first=Sam |date=August 9, 2017 |title=Fired Google memo writer gives first big interviews to rightwing YouTubers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/09/james-damore-google-memo-youtube-interviews |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Molyneux and Canadian internet personality [[Lauren Southern]] toured the Australian cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Luke |title=What I learnt about the far right from Lauren Southern |url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/what-i-learnt-about-the-far-right-from-lauren-southern/news-story/0443ce7a7a09dc8431776f469b34ae0d |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NITV]] quotes Simon Copland, an SBS freelance writer, who thinks that Molyneux disparaged pre-colonisation [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] culture, calling it "very violent", and downplayed massacres perpetrated against Aborigines, saying that the European takeover of Australia had been less violent than other such takeovers, and that the settlers "were trying to stop infanticide and mass rape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Douglas |title=Far-right Canadian duo's vile rampage against Aboriginal culture at Sydney event |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/07/30/far-right-canadian-duos-vile-rampage-against-aboriginal-culture-sydney-event |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=[[National Indigenous Television]], [[Special Broadcasting Service]] |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molyneux and Southern subsequently traveled to New Zealand for their speaking engagement at [[Auckland]]'s Powerstation theatre. The event was cancelled at the last minute when the Powerstation's owner rescinded the booking, citing opposition from local groups and the offensive content of their speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux's speaking event cancelled |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/08/lauren-southern-and-stefan-molyneux-s-secret-speaking-location-revealed-as-the-powerstation.html |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Truebridge |first1=Nick |last2=Niall |first2=Todd |title=Auckland's Powerstation owner apologises for booking controversial speakers |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/106002242/aucklands-powerstation-owner-apologises-for-booking-controversial-speakers |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Auckland venue cancels controversial far-right Canadian pair's speaking event |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/auckland-venue-cancels-controversial-far-right-canadian-pairs-speaking-event |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molyneaux has hosted prominent white supremacists on his podcast, such as Peter Brimelow (founder of the white nationalist website VDare) and Jared Taylor (founder of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Views ==
=== A Voice for Men ===
Molyneux was a panelist at a 2014 Detroit conference held by the [[men's rights movement]] and [[manosphere]] organization, [[A Voice for Men]]. According to Jessica Roy of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Molyneux argued that violence in the world is the result of how women treat their children, and that "If we could just get people to be nice to their babies for five years straight, that would be it for war, drug abuse, addiction, promiscuity, sexually transmitted diseases, ... Almost all would be completely eliminated, because they all arise from dysfunctional early childhood experiences, which are all run by women."&lt;ref name="men"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roy |first=Jessica |date=July 2, 2014 |title=What I Learned as a Woman at a Men's-Rights Conference |url=http://time.com/2949435/what-i-learned-as-a-woman-at-a-mens-rights-conference/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alt-right ===
Molyneux has been described as a part of the "[[alt-right]]" by ''Politico'', ''Metro'', ''NY Magazine,'' ''Vanity Fair,'' and ''CBS,'' and has been described as "one of the alt-right's biggest YouTube stars" by ''Washington Post'' columnist J. J. McCullough.&lt;ref name="Politico17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washp17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Metro17&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Adam |date=August 19, 2017 |title=Heartbroken mother describes how she lost her son to alt-right movement |url=https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/19/heartbroken-mother-pens-open-letter-to-son-she-lost-to-alt-right-movement-6864145/ |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |access-date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilgore |first=Ed |date=August 14, 2017 |title=Don’t Look Now, But Alt-Right Demonstrations Are Scheduled for Nine Cities Next Weekend [Update: Now Cancelled] |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/alt-right-demonstrations-scheduled-for-9-cities-next-weekend.html |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kosoff |first=Maya |date=August 9, 2017 |title=The Fired Google Engineer Is Doubling Down |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/james-damore-google-silicon-valley-culture-war |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 9, 2017 |title=Fired Google Engineer Who Wrote Controversial Gender Essay Speaks Out |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/08/09/google-gender-essay-fired-engineer-james-damore-legal-options/ |publisher=[[KPIX-TV]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Business Insider]]'' and [[BuzzFeed]] have characterized Molyneux as [[far-right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tani |first=Maxwell |date=August 23, 2017 |title='UNLIMITED WAR': Breitbart and the far right start to turn on Trump over his Afghanistan decision |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/far-right-trump-backers-pan-afghanistan-speech-2017-8 |newspaper=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ling |first=Justin |date=January 8, 2018 |title=The Far Right Can’t Decide If The Iran Protests Are A Good Thing, Or A George Soros Deep State Coup |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/justinling/the-far-right-cant-decide-if-the-iran-protests-are-a-good |publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 YouTube video, Molyneux has denied that he identifies with the alt-right movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=S-Wn0J0eC6I|title=What Is The Alt-Right? Vox Day and Stefan Molyneux}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data &amp; Society, a research institute, described Molyneux as "a Canadian talk show host who promotes [[scientific racism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://datasociety.net/output/alternative-influence/|title=Alternative Influence|work=Data &amp; Society|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family of origin (FOO) relationships ===
Molyneux refers to the family that people are born into as their "family of origin" or "FOO". Molyneux suggests that family of origin relationships may not necessarily be desirable, and in some circumstances may even be detrimental, and thus, for those individuals having suffered abusive childhood relationships, it would be advantageous for them to sever such involuntary relationships as adults, or "deFOO".&lt;ref name=Guardian-2008&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/15/family-relationships-fdr-defoo-cult |title=You will never see me again |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |first=Kate |last=Hilpern |date=November 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, he views all adult relationships as being voluntary and discretionary rather than obligatory. According to a 2008 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', both Molyneux and his wife have "deFOOed".&lt;ref name=Guardian-2008 /&gt;

=== Stateless society ===
Molyneux theorizes that the pursuit of virtue in our personal lives could bring about a [[stateless society]] that abhors the initiation of force (see [[non-aggression principle]]). In addition, the free market (see [[anarcho-capitalism]]), [[polycentric law|polycentric legal system]]s and private "dispute resolution organizations" (DROs) could be empowered to find new and more peaceful ways of adjudicating [[common law]] infractions and contractual disputes.&lt;ref name=molyneux-DRO&gt;{{cite web|last=Molyneux|first=Stefan|title=The Stateless Society An Examination of Alternatives|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/10/stefan-molyneux/the-stateless-society-an-examination-of-alternatives/|publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]]|date=October 24, 2005|accessdate= May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, libertarian philosopher [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] gave a critical examination of Molyneux's 2007 ''Universally Preferable Behaviour: A Rational Proof for Secular Ethics'' in ''The Mises Review'', stating, "He fails, and fails miserably. His arguments are often preposterously bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/daily/6101/The-Molyneux-Problem |title=The Molyneux Problem &amp;#124; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordon would reply again to Molyneux's own response to the criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/mr-molyneux-responds |title=Mr. Molyneux Responds; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White genocide ===
Molyneux believes in the [[White genocide conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/362284/alt-right-speakers-stefan-molyneux-and-lauren-southern-anger-nz-muslims |title=Alt-right speakers Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern anger NZ Muslims |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 interview with [[Lauren Southern]] about [[South African farm attacks|violence against white farmers in South Africa]], he stated that the media and [[NGOs]] were under-reporting the subject because they "don’t want to scare the whites in the west with what happens when whites become a minority in a highly aggressive and tribalised world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=White Farmers Slaughtered in South Africa {{!}} Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TfAq3LrIjg&amp;t=1288 |first=Stefan |last= Molyneux |date= February 10, 2018 |publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/jul/16/news-corps-promotion-of-lauren-southern-is-disturbing |title=News Corp Australia’s promotion of Lauren Southern is disturbing |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After portrait painter [[Kehinde Wiley]] was chosen to paint [[Barack Obama]]'s [[President Barack Obama (painting)|presidential portrait]], Molyneux called Wiley a "white genocide [[fetish artist]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/07/free-speech-group-says-dangerous-precedent-will-be-set-if-they-lose-lawsuit.html |title=Free-speech group says 'dangerous precedent' will be set if they lose lawsuit |publisher=''[[Newshub]]'' |date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that in 2012 Wiley had created two paintings of black women holding up the severed heads of white women, which Wiley later referred to as "sort of a play on the 'kill [[whitey (slang)|whitey]]' thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President Obama's Anti-White Racism Portrait Scandal |url=https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=98d_1518555494 |first=Stefan |last=Molyneux |date= February 13, 2018 |publisher=LiveLeak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kehinde Wiley's Obama portrait controversy proves Americans struggle to engage with art |url= https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/kehinde-wiley-s-obama-portrait-controversy-shows-americans-don-t-ncna849156 |first=Seph |last= Rodney |date= Feb 18, 2018 |publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult accusations==

According to [[Steven Hassan]], a mental health counselor with experience on cults, "Partly what's going on with the people on the Internet who are indoctrinated, they spend lots of hours on the computer. Videos can have them up all night for several nights in a row. Molyneux knows how to talk like he knows what he's talking about, despite very little academic research. He cites this and cites that, and presents it as the whole truth. It dismantles people's sense of self and replaces it with his sense of confidence about how to fix the world."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Collins, Ben (February 5, 2016). [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/05/meet-the-cult-leader-stumping-for-donald-trump.html Meet the 'Cult' Leader Stumping for Donald Trump.] ''The Daily Beast.'' Retrieved: October 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Tu Thanh Ha wrote that Molyneux was called the leader of a "therapy cult" following ''Freedomain Radio (FDR)'' community member Tom Bell breaking off all contact with his family.&lt;ref name="Globe-2008" /&gt; In April 2008, Bell had called in to the show asking about his [[veganism]] and his feeling of disgust towards people that eat meat.&lt;ref name="Times-2009"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whipple |first=Tom |date=January 10, 2009 |title=The mother and son torn apart by web 'cult' that destroys families |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-mother-and-son-torn-apart-by-web-cult-that-destroys-families-w8klkzndf50 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate= August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molyneux suggested that this disgust could have come from witnessing an authority figure who was cruel to animals.&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt; Bell responded by describing memories of his father being verbally and physically cruel to the family cat, causing him to feel intimidated by the father, and then described his [[emotional detachment]] toward his mother and the rest of his family.&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt;

The following month, Bell left a note stating he no longer wanted contact and left home. It was reported that, of the estimated 50,000 users of the website, about 20 (0.04%) ''FDR'' members had also "deFOOed" (disassociate from family of origin), and that many parents chose not to speak to the media in an effort to avoid alienating their children further.&lt;ref name=Times-2009 /&gt; A representative of the British [[Cult Information Centre]] said they were following ''FDR'', and noted that one sign of cults was that they cut people off from their families. Molyneux responded by saying, "If I advised a wife to leave an abusive husband, there would not be articles about how I am a cult leader."&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt;

Molyneux and FOO were subjects of an investigative documentary by [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which aired on August 20, 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.channel5.com/shows/trapped-in-a-cult |title=Trapped In A Cult? |publisher=Channel 5 |date=2015-08-20 |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Daisy |date=August 20, 2015 |title= Trapped in a Cult? – TV review: Disappointing Channel 5 shock-doc fails to come up to scratch |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/trapped-in-a-cult-tv-review-disappointing-channel-5-shock-doc-fails-to-come-up-to-scratch-10464473.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date= November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molyneux and "deFOOing" were one of three subjects featured on the February 18, 2016 episode of the documentary series ''[[Dark Net (TV series)|Dark Net]]''. The episode calls ''Freedomain Radio'' a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sho.com/dark-net/season/1/episode/5/trapped |title=Dark Net – Season 1, Episode 5 |website= Showtime |accessdate= 12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''Sturmian word''' ('''Sturmian sequence''' or '''billiard sequence'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hordijk | first1 = A. | last2 = Laan | first2 = D. A. | chapter = Bounds for Deterministic Periodic Routing sequences | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45535-3_19 | title = Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 2081 | pages = 236 | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-3-540-42225-9 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;), named after [[Jacques Charles François Sturm]], is a certain kind of infinitely long [[string (computer science)|sequence of characters]]. Such a sequence can be generated by considering a game of [[English billiards]] on a square table. The struck ball will successively hit the vertical and horizontal edges labelled 0 and 1 generating a sequence of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=117|title=Recent Trends in Combinatorics: The Legacy of Paul Erdős|year=2009|first1=Ervin|last1=Győri|first2=Vera|last2=Sós|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-12004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequence is a Sturmian word.

== Definition ==
Sturmian sequences can be defined strictly in terms of their combinatoric properties or geometrically as [[cutting sequence]]s for lines of irrational slope or codings for [[irrational rotation]]s.  They are traditionally taken to be infinite sequences on the alphabet of the two symbols 0 and&amp;nbsp;1.

=== Combinatoric definitions ===

==== Sequences of low complexity ====
For an infinite sequence of symbols ''w'', let ''&amp;sigma;''(''n'') be the [[complexity function]] of ''w''; i.e., ''&amp;sigma;''(''n'') = the number of distinct subwords in ''w'' of length ''n''. ''w'' is Sturmian if ''&amp;sigma;''(n)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 for all&amp;nbsp;''n''.

==== Balanced sequences ====
A set ''X'' of binary strings is called ''balanced'' if the [[Hamming weight]] of elements of ''X'' takes at most two distinct values.  That is, for any &lt;math&gt;s\in X&lt;/math&gt; |''s''|&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' or |''s''|&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''' where |''s''|&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of 1s in ''s''.

Let ''w'' be an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L_n(w)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all length-''n'' subwords of ''w''.  The sequence ''w'' is Sturmian if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L_n(w)&lt;/math&gt; is balanced for all ''n'' and ''w'' is not eventually periodic.

=== Geometric definitions ===

==== Cutting sequence of irrational ====
Let ''w'' be an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s.  The sequence ''w'' is Sturmian if for some &lt;math&gt;x\in[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and some irrational &lt;math&gt;\theta\in(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, ''w'' is realized as the [[cutting sequence]] of the line &lt;math&gt;f(t)=\theta t+x&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Difference of Beatty sequences ====
Let ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s.  The sequence ''w'' is Sturmian if it is the difference of non-homogeneous [[Beatty sequence]]s, that is, for some &lt;math&gt;x\in[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and some irrational &lt;math&gt;\theta\in(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;w_n = \lfloor n\theta + x\rfloor - \lfloor (n-1)\theta + x \rfloor &lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; or
:&lt;math&gt;w_n = \lceil n\theta + x\rceil - \lceil (n-1)\theta + x \rceil &lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Coding of irrational rotation ====
[[File:Sturmian-sequence-from-irrational-rotation.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|Enlarge for animation showing the Sturmian sequence generated by an irrational rotation with ''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;asymp;&amp;nbsp;0.2882 and ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;asymp;&amp;nbsp;0.0789]]&lt;!-- why does it have to be clicked to animate? --&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;\theta\in [0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;T_\theta:[0,1)\to[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;t\mapsto t+\theta\bmod 1&lt;/math&gt;.  For &lt;math&gt;x\in[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; define the ''&amp;theta;''-coding of ''x'' to be the sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) where
:&lt;math&gt;x_n= \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } T_\theta^n(x)\in [0,\theta), \\ 0 &amp; \text{else}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''w'' be an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s.  The sequence ''w'' is Sturmian if for some &lt;math&gt;x\in[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and some irrational &lt;math&gt;\theta\in(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, ''w'' is the ''&amp;theta;''-coding of&amp;nbsp;''x''.

== Discussion ==

===Example===
A famous example of a (standard) Sturmian word is the [[Fibonacci word]];&lt;ref name=deluca1995&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Information Processing Letters | year=1995 | pages=307&amp;ndash;312 | doi=10.1016/0020-0190(95)00067-M | title=A division property of the Fibonacci word | first=Aldo | last=de Luca | volume=54 | issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its slope is &lt;math&gt;1/\phi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[golden ratio]].

===Balanced aperiodic sequences===
A set ''S'' of finite binary words is ''balanced'' if for each ''n'' the subset ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of words of length ''n'' has the property that the [[Hamming weight]] of the words in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; takes at most two distinct values.  A '''balanced sequence''' is one for which the set of factors is balanced.  A balanced sequence has at most ''n''+1 distinct factors of length ''n''.&lt;ref name=Loth2002&gt;{{cite book | last = Lothaire | first = M. | authorlink = M. Lothaire | title =  Algebraic Combinatorics on Words | url = http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Lothaire/AlgCWContents.html | accessdate = 2007-02-25 | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-81220-8 | chapter = Sturmian Words | zbl=1001.68093 | chapterurl = http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/%7Eberstel/Lothaire/ChapitresACW/C2.ps }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}}  An '''aperiodic sequence''' is one which does not consist of a finite sequence followed by a finite cycle.  An aperiodic sequence has at least ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 distinct factors of length ''n''.&lt;ref name=Loth2002/&gt;{{rp|43}}  A sequence is Sturmian if and only if it is balanced and aperiodic.&lt;ref name=Loth2002/&gt;{{rp|43}}

===Slope and intercept===
A [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; over {0,1} is a Sturmian word if and only if there exist two [[real number]]s, the ''slope'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and the ''intercept'' &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; [[Irrational number|irrational]], such that

:&lt;math&gt;a_n=\lfloor\alpha(n+1)+\rho\rfloor -\lfloor\alpha n+\rho\rfloor-\lfloor\alpha\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Allo2003&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Allouche | first1 = Jean-Paul | last2 = Shallit | first2 = Jeffrey | author2-link = Jeffrey Shallit | isbn = 978-0-521-82332-6 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | title = Automatic Sequences: Theory, Applications, Generalizations | year = 2003 | zbl=1086.11015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|284}}&lt;ref name=Fogg2002&gt;{{cite book | last=Pytheas Fogg | first=N. | editor1-first=Valérie | editor1-last = Berthé |editor1-link = Valérie Berthé| editor2-last = Ferenczi | editor2-first= Sébastien | editor3-last= Mauduit | editor3-first= Christian | editor4-last= Siegel | editor4-first= A. | title=Substitutions in dynamics, arithmetics and combinatorics | series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics | volume=1794 | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2002 | isbn=3-540-44141-7 | zbl=1014.11015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}} Thus a Sturmian word provides a [[discretization]] of the straight line with slope &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and intercept&amp;nbsp;''&amp;rho;''.  Without loss of generality, we can always assume &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\alpha&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, because for any integer ''k'' we have

: &lt;math&gt;\lfloor(\alpha + k)(n + 1) + \rho\rfloor - \lfloor(\alpha+k)n + \rho\rfloor - \lfloor\alpha + k\rfloor = a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

All the Sturmian words corresponding to the same slope &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; have the same set of factors; the word &lt;math&gt;c_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the intercept &lt;math&gt;\rho=0&lt;/math&gt; is the '''standard word''' or '''characteristic word''' of slope &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Allo2003/&gt;{{rp|283}} Hence, if &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\alpha&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the characteristic word &lt;math&gt;c_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[first difference]] of the [[Beatty sequence]] corresponding to the irrational number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

The standard word &lt;math&gt;c_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is also the limit of a sequence of words &lt;math&gt;(s_n)_{n \ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; defined recursively as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;[0; d_1+1, d_2, \ldots, d_n, \ldots]&lt;/math&gt; be the [[continued fraction]] expansion of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and define
* &lt;math&gt;s_0=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;s_1=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;s_{n+1}=s_n^{d_n}s_{n-1}\text{ for }n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
where the product between words is just their [[concatenation]]. Every word in the sequence &lt;math&gt;(s_n)_{n&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]] of the next ones, so that the sequence itself [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] to an infinite word, which is &lt;math&gt;c_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

The infinite sequence of words &lt;math&gt;(s_n)_{n \ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; defined by the above recursion is called the '''standard sequence''' for the  standard word &lt;math&gt;c_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and the infinite sequence ''d'' = (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) of nonnegative integers,  with ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 (''n'' ≥ 2), is called its '''directive sequence'''.

A Sturmian word ''w'' over {0,1} is characteristic if and only if both 0''w'' and 1''w'' are Sturmian.&lt;ref name=BS1994&gt;{{citation | last1=Berstel | first1=J. | last2=Séébold | first2=P. | title=A remark on morphic Sturmian words | journal=RAIRO, Inform. Théor. Appl. 2| volume=8 | number=3-4 | pages=255–263 | year=1994 | issn=0988-3754 | zbl=0883.68104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequencies===
If ''s'' is an infinite sequence word and ''w'' is a finite word, let μ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(''w'') denote the number of occurrences of ''w'' as a factor in the prefix of ''s'' of length ''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;|''w''|&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.  If ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(''w'') has a limit as ''N''→∞, we call this the '''frequency'''  of ''w'', denoted by ''μ''(''w'').&lt;ref name=Loth2002/&gt;{{rp|73}}

For a Sturmian word ''s'', every finite factor has a frequency.  The [[three-gap theorem]] implies that the factors of fixed length ''n'' have at most three distinct frequencies, and if there are three values then one is the sum of the other two.&lt;ref name=Loth2002/&gt;{{rp|73}}

==Non-binary words==
For words over an alphabet of size ''k'' greater than 2, we define a Sturmian word to be one with complexity function ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=Fogg2002/&gt;{{rp|6}}  They can be described in terms of cutting sequences for ''k''-dimensional space.&lt;ref name=Fogg2002/&gt;{{rp|84}}  An alternative definition is as words of minimal complexity subject to not being ultimately periodic.&lt;ref name=Fogg2002/&gt;{{rp|85}}

==Associated real numbers==
A real number for which the digits with respect to some fixed base form a Sturmian word is a [[transcendental number]].&lt;ref name=Fogg2002/&gt;{{rp|64,85}}

== History ==
Although the study of Sturmian words dates back to [[Johann III Bernoulli]] (1772),&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernoulli III, Sur une nouvelle espece de calcul, Recueil pour les Astronomes, vol. 1, Berlin, 1772, pp. 255–284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allo2003/&gt;{{rp|295}} it was [[Gustav A. Hedlund]] and [[Marston Morse]] in 1940 who coined the term ''Sturmian'' to refer to such sequences,&lt;ref name=Allo2003/&gt;{{rp|295}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Morse | first1 = M. | authorlink = Marston Morse| last2 = Hedlund | first2 = G.

'''Suyat''' is the modern collective name of the indigenous scripts of various ethno-linguistic groups in the [[Philippines]] prior to [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonization in the 16th century]] up to the independence era in the 21st century. The scripts are highly varied; nonetheless, the term was used by cultural organizations in the Philippines to denote a unified neutral terminology for Philippine indigenous scripts.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/985669/protect-all-ph-writing-systems-heritage-advocates-urge-congress|title=Protect all PH writing systems, heritage advocates urge Congress|first=Tonette|last=Orejas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2018/04/26/baybayin-bill.html|title=The Baybayin bill and the never ending search for ‘Filipino-ness’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suyat includes the [[Kulitan alphabet|kulitan]] script of the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan people]], the [[Visayan languages|badlit]] script of various [[Visayan languages|Visayan ethnic groups]], the [[Eskaya|iniskaya]] script of the [[Eskaya people]], the [[baybayin]] script of the [[Tagalog people]], the [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]] script of the Buhid [[Mangyan]] people, the [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]] script of the Hanuno'o [[Mangyan]] people, the [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]] script of the [[Tagbanwa people]], the [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]] script of the [[Palawan people|Palaw'an people]], the [[Ilocano language|kur-itan]] script of the [[Ilocano language|Ilokano people]], and many other indigenous scripts in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/201104-baybayin-national-writing-system-reactions|title=‘Educate first’: Filipinos react to Baybayin as national writing system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1602707/Manila/Local-News/House-panel-approves-Baybayin-as-national-writing-system|title=House panel approves Baybayin as national writing system|date=24 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/25/18/5-things-to-know-about-phs-pre-hispanic-writing-system|title=5 things to know about PH's pre-Hispanic writing system|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"/&gt;

In 1999, four suyat scripts were inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme]], under the name ''Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan)''. The four scripts, [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]], [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]], [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]], and [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]], were recognized by [[UNESCO]] as the only existing suyat scripts still used by certain Philippine communities in their daily lives. [[UNESCO]] also recognized that the four scripts, along with thirteen other suyat scripts, have existed within the Philippine archipelago since the 10th century AD. The ''ambahan'' poetry made with the [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo script]] was also cited. The inscription of the four suyat scripts was the first documentary heritage of the Philippines to be inscribed in the Memory of the World Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/philippine-paleographs-hanunoo-buid-tagbanua-and-palawan/|title=Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan) - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of [[suyat]] scripts have also established various [[calligraphy]] techniques and styles in the Philippines. Each suyat script has its own suyat calligraphy, although all suyat calligraphy are collectively called as Filipino suyat calligraphy for the sake of nationalism. Western-alphabet and Arabic calligraphy, however, are not considered as Filipino suyat calligraphy as the alphabets used did not develop indigenously. The variety of [[suyat]] scripts is due to four main factors: the alignment of the archipelagic culture with the [[Indosphere]]; the alignment of the archipelagic culture with the [[Sinosphere]]; the alignment of the archipelagic culture with both [[Indosphere]] and [[Sinosphere]]; and non-alignment of archipelagic culture to both [[Indosphere]] and [[Sinosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrxOs-33aM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"/&gt;

== National writing system ==
[[File:Inskripsyon sa Binatbat na Tanso ng Laguna.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The actual image of the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] found in Lumbang River, the oldest known artifact to have a [[suyat]] writing on it.]]
The ''"National Script Act"'' has been in Congress since 2011. The bill aims to revive the usage of all known indigenous scripts in the Philippines. The bill also mandates that each community should teach the script respective to the area's ethnic peoples. The bill does not mandate the government to teach a single specific suyat script for all citizens, as that would demean the other suyat scripts of various ethnic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;http://ical13.ling.sinica.edu.tw/Full_papers_and_ppts/July_21/P4-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to lack of congressional and senatorial sessions and support, the bill did not pass into law in the 16th Congress. It was refiled again in 2016 under the 17th Congress.

'''This is the Public Domain''' is an [[art]] project designed to look at the difficulty in demarcating a piece of land as part of the international commons for [[perpetuity]] within the United States.&lt;ref name= "This is the Public Domain mute mag"&gt;[http://www.metamute.org/en/This-is-the-Public-Domain/ 'This is the Public Domain' ''Mute Magazine'' May 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cca.rca.ac.uk/publicsmog/documents/PressRelease_publicsmog.pdf Press release from the Royal College of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''This is the Public Domain'' was created by [[San Francisco]] based artist [[Amy Balkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsandecology.org.uk/magazine/artworks/project-1 "This is the Public Domain in Arts &amp; Ecology magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Balkin purchased {{convert|2.5|acre|m2}} of land in Tehachapi, California&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artofcommonspace.org/site/75/325.html Haring Woods Associates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cca.edu/calendar/1163 California College of the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; with the intention of giving them to a "global everyone." As a means of doing this, Balkin looked into a number of legal strategies within the constraints of [[property law|property]] and [[copyright law]].

==Legal Tactics==
Those working to create ''This is the [[Public Domain]]'' have attempted a number of legal strategies to achieve their goal.&lt;ref name= "This is the Public Domain"&gt;[http://thisisthepublicdomain.org This is the Public Domain website]&lt;/ref&gt; The first was attempting to [[copyright]] and then enter into the public domain the land within the project's boundaries as a [[conceptual art]]work. However, the artists involved learned that one can only give away the rights of works which can be reproduced. In order to deal with this limitation, a bench was created and the land was declared an extension of said bench.

The second was to enter the land into the public domain by putting the land into a [[land trust|trust]] and then distributing the [[license]] which allows people to occupy or modify the land. Included in the license is that the land must either be licensed for universal use or for no one's use. Redistribution of this license is allowed, but modification is not.

The final three strategies appear to be theoretical. One is the creation of a bearer corporation which controls the land. The upside to this from the artists' perspective is that the land would have strong legal protection, but they question whether [[corporation|corporate]] control is the proper way to achieve it. Another is creating a Limited Common Property Regime. This is seen as acceptable if one can include the entire world as members of the regime, but they have doubts about whether or not that would be possible. The final is creating a land trust. However, this would require [[private ownership]], and thus is likely to be rejected.

{{psychoanalysis}}
'''Transference neurosis''' is a term that [[Sigmund Freud]] introduced in 1914 to describe a new form of the [[analysand]]'s infantile [[neurosis]] that develops during the [[psychoanalytic]] process.&lt;ref&gt;(Etchegoyen, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[Dora (case study)|Dora]]'s case history, Freud suggested that during therapy the creation of new symptoms stops, but new versions of the patient's [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] and impulses are generated. He called these newer versions "[[transference]]s" and characterized them as the substitution of the analyst for a person from the patient's past. According to Freud's description: "a whole series of psychological experiences are revived not as belonging to the past, but as applying to the person of the analyst at the present moment".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; When transference neurosis develops, the relationship with the therapist becomes the most important one for the patient, who directs strong infantile feelings and conflicts towards the therapist, e.g. the patient may react as if the analyst is his/her father.&lt;ref name="Chessick, 2002"&gt;Chessick, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic characteristics==

Transference neurosis can be distinguished from other kinds of transference because: 
# It is very vivid and it rekindles the infantile neurosis.
# It is generated by the feelings of frustration that the analysand inevitably experiences during sessions, since the analyst does not fulfill the analysand's longings.
# In transference neurosis the symptoms are not stable, but they are transformed.
# Regression and repetition play a key role in the creation of transference neurosis.
# Transference neurosis reveals the particular meanings that the analysand has given to current infantile relationships and events, which generate internal conflicts between wishes and particular defenses formed to strive against them. These meanings are united and create several transference patterns.&lt;ref name="Chessick, 2002"/&gt;

==Resolution==

Once transference neurosis has developed, it leads to a form of [[psychological resistance|resistance]], called "transference resistance". At this point, the analysis of the transference becomes difficult since new obstacles arise in therapy, e.g. the analysand may insist on fulfilling the infantile wishes that emerged in transference, or may refuse to acknowledge that the current experience is, in fact, a reproduction of a past experience. However, the successful resolution of transference neurosis through interpretation will lead to the lifting of [[repression (psychological)|repression]] and will enable the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]] to solve the infantile conflicts in new ways.&lt;ref name="Chessick, 2002"/&gt; Furthermore, it will allow the analysand to recognize that the current relationship with the analyst is based on repetition of childhood experiences, leading to the detachment of the patient from the analyst.&lt;ref&gt;The Gale group, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The replacement of the infantile neurosis by transference neurosis and its resolution through interpretation remains the main focus of the classical psychoanalytic therapy. In other types of therapy, either the transference neurosis does not develop at all, or it does not play a central role in the therapy process.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, 1994, Shaw, 1991, Tyson, 1996, at Meissner, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is more likely for transference neurosis to develop in psychoanalysis, where the sessions are more frequent, it may also appear during psychotherapy.

The '''Visayan leopard cat''' is a [[Sunda leopard cat]] (''Prionailurus javanensis sumatranus'') population in the [[Philippine Islands]] of [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Cebu]] and [[Panay]].&lt;ref name=CatSG2017&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kitchener, A.

== Taxonomy ==
''Prionailurus bengalensis rabori'' was proposed in 1997 by [[Colin Groves]] on the basis of morphological analysis of a skin and skull. He considered it a [[leopard cat]] [[subspecies]].&lt;ref name="groves97"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Groves, C. P. |year=1997 |title=Leopard-cats, ''Prionailurus bengalensis'' (Carnivora: Felidae) from Indonesia and the Philippines, with the description of two new species |journal=Zeitschrift für Säugetierkunde |volume=62 |pages=330–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of [[phylogeographic]] research show that Sunda leopard cats from Borneo, Sumatra and the Philippine islands are [[Mitochondrial DNA#Female_inheritance|genetically]] very similar. The Sunda leopard cat probably reached the Philippine islands from Borneo after the [[Toba catastrophe theory|eruption of Toba Volcano]] during the [[late Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Patel, R.P., Wutke, S., Lenz, D., Mukherjee, S., Ramakrishnan, U., Veron, G., Fickel, J., Wilting, A. and Förster, D.W.  |year=2017 |title=Genetic structure and phylogeography of the leopard cat (''Prionailurus bengalensis'') inferred from mitochondrial genomes |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=349−360 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has therefore been subsumed to ''P. javanensis sumatranus'' in 2017.&lt;ref name=CatSG2017/&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The fur of the Visayan leopard cat is dark ochre to buffy fawn with large and dark spots. Its skull is a little narrower than of Sumatran leopard cat and Bornean leopard cat.&lt;ref name="groves97"/&gt;

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Visayan leopard cat occurs on the Philippine islands of Panay and Negros where it inhabits remnant forest fragments. On Cebu, it has also been recorded in [[sugarcane]] farms.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; It is probably [[locally extinct]] or close to extinction on the islands of Cebu and [[Masbate]]. Panay and Negros islands have lost 90–95 % of their natural habitat.&lt;ref name=Lorica2013&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lorica, M.R.P. &amp; L.R. Heaney |year=2013 |title=Survival of a native mammalian carnivore, the leopard cat ''Prionailurus bengalensis'' Kerr, 1792 (Carnivora: Felidae), in an agricultural landscape on an oceanic Philippine island |journal=Journal of Threatened Taxa |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=4451–4460}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- == Kitten mortality due to habitat loss ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
It is clear that the Visayan leopard cat mothers frequently and gives birth in sugar cane fields, presumably attracted by dense cover and an ample supply of rats and other agricultural pests. It is not clear whether pregnant cats migrate into the cane fields from neighboring forest patches to give birth, or whether they permanently inhabit agricultural areas. In either case, the harvesting of sugar cane has disastrous consequences for any females rearing litters, which they are then forced to abandon.
Most kittens orphaned in this way die before or shortly after they reach rescue centers, probably from dehydration or other factors relating to their age and the length of time between their capture and arrival at the center, which can be several days. Improved personnel training, access to expert advice, better equipment, better milk substitutes, and imported vaccines all can contribute to improving the kittens' chances of survival.  Rescued kittens almost certainly represent the only captive stock, though even this number of individuals is now putting a severe strain on available resources. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6053">'''Völkerabfälle''' is a term used by [[Frederick Engels]] to describe small nations which he considered residual fragments of former peoples who had succumbed to more powerful neighbours in the historic process of social development and which Engels considered prone to become "fanatical standard-bearers of counter-revolution".&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engels |first1=Frederick |title=Magyar Struggle |journal=Neue Rheinsiche Zeitung |date=1849 |issue=No. 194 |url=http://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/marx/works/1849/01/13.htm |accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He offers as examples:&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;
* the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]: "Such, in Scotland, are the [[Gaels]], the supporters of the [[Stuarts]] from 1640 to 1745."
* the [[Chouannerie]]: "Such, in France, are the [[Bretons]], the supporters of the [[Bourbons]] from 1792 to 1800."
* the [[First Carlist War]]: "Such, in Spain, are the [[Basques]], the supporters of [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]]."

Engels was referring also specifically to the [[Serb uprising of 1848–49]], in which Serbs from Vojvodina fought against the previously victorious [[Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848#Serbs_of_Vojvodina|Hungarian revolution]]. Engels finished the article with the folwing prediction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But at the first victorious uprising of the French proletariat, which Louis Napoleon is striving with all his might to conjure up, the Austrian Germans and Magyars will be set free and wreak a bloody revenge on the Slav barbarians. The general war which will then break out will smash this Slav [[Sonderbund]] and wipe out all these petty hidebound nations, down to their very names.&lt;p&gt;The next world war will result in the disappearance from the face of the earth not only of reactionary classes and dynasties, but also of entire reactionary peoples. And that, too, is a step forward.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critique==
Engels views were criticised by leading socialist [[Karl Kautsky]] who in 1915 argued that subsequent to 1848/9 the Czech and Austrian South Slavs had transformed themselves in a manner which in practice refuted the views of Marx and Engels. Referring to [[Heinrich Cunow]] he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Today when those people have achieved such great power and significance to refer to them in the old Marxian terms of 1848/9 does appear most unfortunate. Should someone today still hold onto that standpoint he has a lot to unlearn&lt;ref name="Herod"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herod |first1=N. A. |title=The Nation in the History of Marxian Thought: The Concept of Nations with History and Nations without History |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9789401747547 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Mb2lBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=V%C3%B6lkerabf%C3%A4lle#v=onepage&amp;q=V%C3%B6lkerabf%C3%A4lle&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roman Rozdolsky]] analyses Engels' position in his book ''Engels and the 'Nonhistoric' Peoples: the National Question in the Revolution of 1848''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two ways to look at Marx and Engels: as the creators of a brilliant, but in its deepest essence, thoroughly critical, scientific method; or as church fathers of some sort, the bronzed figures of a monument. Those who have the latter vision will not have found this study to their taste. We, however, prefer to see them as they were in reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rosdolsky examines Engels' viewpoint at length. Both Marx and Engels had supported the [[1848 revolution]] which had spread throughout Europe. They saw this as a necessary first step towards the Socialist revolution, which was hoped to be imminent. However, the forces of reaction rallied in [[Klemens von Metternich]]'s Austria in October 1848 with the brutal suppression of the [[Vienna Uprising]]. Engels was prompted to write his article thanks to the Austrian Slavs' rejection of the opportunity to liberate themselves from the oppressive rule of the [[Habsburgs]], as well their enthusiastic embrace of Metternich’s counter-revolution.&lt;ref name="Clarkson"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clarkson |first1=Andy |title=Reviews – Engels and the 'Nonhistoric' Peoples |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/revhist/backiss/vol3/no2/rosdolsk.html |website=www.marxists.org |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
This last passage, the final paragraph of Engels' article in 1849, has fuelled accusations that this constitutes a call for genocide. The British [[Liberalism|Liberal]] historian, [[George G. Watson|George Watson]], for example, cited this text by Engels as evidence for his view that [[Hitler]] was a [[Marxist]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

Alexander Dyukov has provided evidence that the film relies on falsified images to give an historically inaccurate account of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Dyukov"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alexander |first1=Dyukov |title="THE SOVIET STORY" – The tissue of lies |url=http://rugraz.net/index.php/ru/istoricheskoe-dostoinstvo/mifi-o-rossii-i-cccp/1009-alexander-dyukov-the-soviet-story-the-tissue-of-lies |website=rugraz.netaz Net |publisher=Mag.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3580">'''Warnock's dilemma''', named for its originator Bryan Warnock, is the problem of interpreting a lack of response to a posting in a [[virtual community]].{{sfn|Holiday|2012|pp=101-103}}  The term originally referred to  [[Electronic mailing list|mailing list discussions]], but has been applied to [[Usenet]] posts, [[blog]]s, [[Internet forum|Web forum]]s, and online content in general.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|p=101}} The dilemma arises because a lack of response does not necessarily imply that no one is interested in the topic, but could also mean for example that readers find the content to be exceptionally good (leaving nothing for commenters to add).{{sfn|Holiday|2012|p=101}}

On many internet forums, only around [[1% rule (Internet culture)|1 percent of users create new posts]], while 9 percent reply and 90 percent are [[lurker]]s that don't contribute to the discussion.&lt;ref name="arthur"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jul/20/guardianweeklytechnologysection2 What is the 1% rule?] by Charles Arthur, ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When no users reply, the original poster has no way of knowing what lurkers think of their contribution.

Warnock's dilemma leads to online writers and publishers adopting more confrontational writing strategies in order to ensure that they will get a response.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|p=102}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Say Everything: How Blogging Began, What It's Becoming, and Why It Matters|page=259

==Original description==

{{cquote|The problem with no response is that there are five possible interpretations:

# The post is correct, well-written information that needs no follow-up commentary. There's nothing more to say except "Yeah, what he said."
# The post is complete and utter nonsense, and no one wants to waste the energy or bandwidth to even point this out.
# No one read the post, for whatever reason.
# No one understood the post, but won't ask for clarification, for whatever reason.
# No one cares about the post, for whatever reason.|||Bryan C. Warnock|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/1127 Re: RFCs: two proposals for change] -- Original description of the dilemma&lt;/ref&gt;}}
