'''Activity recognition''' aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions. Since the 1980s, this research field has captured the attention of several [[computer science]] communities due to its strength in providing personalized support for many different applications and its connection to many different fields of study such as medicine, human-computer interaction, or sociology.

Due to its many-faceted nature, different fields may refer to activity recognition as plan recognition, goal recognition, intent recognition, behavior recognition, location estimation and location-based services.

==Types==

===Sensor-based, single-user activity recognition===
[[Sensor]]-based activity recognition integrates the emerging area of sensor networks with novel [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]] techniques to model a wide range of human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Tanzeem Choudhury, [[Gaetano Borriello]], et al. The Mobile Sensing Platform: An Embedded System for Activity Recognition. Appears in the IEEE Pervasive Magazine - Special Issue on Activity-Based Computing, April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishkam Ravi, Nikhil Dandekar, Preetham Mysore, Michael Littman. [http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2005/IAAI05-013.pdf Activity Recognition from Accelerometer Data]. Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI/AAAI 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile devices (e.g. smart phones) provide sufficient sensor data and calculation power to enable physical activity recognition to provide an estimation of the energy consumption during everyday life. Sensor-based activity recognition researchers believe that by empowering [[ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous computers]] and sensors to monitor the behavior of agents (under consent), these computers will be better suited to act on our behalf.

====Levels of sensor-based activity recognition====
Sensor-based activity recognition is a challenging task due to the inherent noisy nature of the input. Thus, [[statistical modeling]] has been the main thrust in this direction in layers, where the recognition at several intermediate levels is conducted and connected. At the lowest level where the sensor data are collected, statistical learning concerns how to find the detailed locations of agents from the received signal data. At an intermediate level, [[statistical inference]] may be concerned about how to recognize individuals' activities from the inferred location sequences and environmental conditions at the lower levels. Furthermore, at the highest level a major concern is to find out the overall goal or subgoals of an agent from the activity sequences through a mixture of logical and statistical reasoning.

===Sensor-based, multi-user activity recognition===
Recognizing activities for multiple users using on-body sensors first appeared in the work by ORL using active badge systems&lt;ref&gt;Want R., Hopper A., Falcao V., Gibbons J.: The Active Badge Location System, ACM Transactions on Information, Systems, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 91-102, January 1992&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 90's. Other sensor technology such as acceleration sensors were used for identifying group activity patterns during office scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;Bieber G., Kirste T., Untersuchung des gruppendynamischen Aktivitaetsverhaltes im Office-Umfeld, 7. Berliner Werkstatt Mensch-Maschine-Systeme, Berlin, Germany, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Activities of Multiple Users in intelligent environments are addressed in Gu et al.&lt;ref&gt;Tao Gu, Zhanqing Wu, Liang Wang, Xianping Tao, and Jian Lu. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5326404/ Mining Emerging Patterns for Recognizing Activities of Multiple Users in Pervasive Computing]. In Proc. of the 6th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services (MobiQuitous '09), Toronto, Canada, July 13–16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, they investigate the fundamental problem of recognizing activities for multiple users from sensor readings in a home environment, and propose a novel pattern mining approach to recognize both single-user and multi-user activities in a unified solution.

===Sensor-based group activity recognition===
Recognition of group activities is fundamentally different from single, or multi-user activity recognition in that the goal is to recognize the behavior of the group as an entity, rather than the activities of the individual members within it.&lt;ref&gt;Dawud Gordon, Jan-Hendrik Hanne, Martin Berchtold, Ali Asghar Nazari Shirehjini, Michael Beigl: [http://www.teco.edu/~gordon/publications/MONE_GAR.pdf Towards Collaborative Group Activity Recognition Using Mobile Devices], Mobile Networks and Applications 18(3), 2013, p. 326-340&lt;/ref&gt;  Group behavior is emergent in nature, meaning that the properties of the behavior of the group are fundamentally different then the properties of the behavior of the individuals within it, or any sum of that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, K. Field theory in social science: selected theoretical papers. Social science paperbacks. Harper, New York, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main challenges are in modeling the behavior of the individual group members, as well as the roles of the individual within the group dynamic &lt;ref&gt;Hirano, T., and Maekawa, T. [http://www-nishio.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/~maekawa/paper/maekawa-ISWC2013.pdf A hybrid unsupervised/supervised model for group activity recognition]. In Proceedings of the 2013 International Symposium on Wearable Computers, ISWC ’13, ACM (New York, NY, USA, 2013), 21–24&lt;/ref&gt; and their relationship to emergent behavior of the group in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Brdiczka, O., Maisonnasse, J., Reignier, P., and Crowley, J. L. [http://www-prima.imag.fr/Prima/Homepages/jlc/papers/BrdiczkaAppliedIntelligence.pdf Detecting small group activities from multimodal observations]. Applied Intelligence 30, 1 (July 2007), 47–57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Challenges which must still be addressed include quantification of the behavior and roles of individuals who join the group, integration of explicit models for role description into inference algorithms, and scalability evaluations for very large groups and crowds.  Group activity recognition has applications for crowd management and response in emergency situations, as well as for social networking and [[Quantified Self]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;Dawud Gordon, Group Activity Recognition Using Wearable Sensing Devices, Dissertation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==

===Activity recognition through logic and reasoning===
Logic-based approaches keep track of all [[logically consistent]] explanations of the observed actions. Thus, all possible and consistent plans or goals must be considered. Kautz provided a formal theory of plan recognition. He described plan recognition as a logical inference process of circumscription. All actions, plans are uniformly referred to as goals, and a recognizer's knowledge is represented by a set of first-order statements called event hierarchy encoded in first-order logic, which defines abstraction, decomposition and functional relationships between types of events.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kautz. "[https://urresearch.rochester.edu/fileDownloadForInstitutionalItem.action?itemId=5934&amp;itemFileId=9297 A formal theory of plan recognition]". In PhD thesis, University of Rochester, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kautz's general framework for plan recognition has an exponential time complexity in worst case, measured in the size of input hierarchy. Lesh and Etzioni went one step further and presented methods in scaling up goal recognition to scale up his work computationally. In contrast to Kautz's approach where the plan library is explicitly represented, Lesh and Etzioni's approach enables automatic plan-library construction from domain primitives. Furthermore, they introduced compact representations and efficient algorithms for goal recognition on large plan libraries.&lt;ref&gt;N. Lesh and O. Etzioni. "[http://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/95-2/Papers/088.pdf A sound and fast goal recognizer]". In ''Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inconsistent plans and goals are repeatedly pruned when new actions arrive. Besides, they also presented methods for adapting a goal recognizer to handle individual idiosyncratic behavior given a sample of an individual's recent behavior. Pollack et al. described a direct argumentation model that can know about the relative strength of several kinds of arguments for belief and intention description.

A serious problem of logic-based approaches is their inability or inherent infeasibility to represent uncertainty. They offer no mechanism for preferring one consistent approach to another and incapable of deciding whether one particular plan is more likely than another, as long as both of them can be consistent enough to explain the actions observed. There is also a lack of learning ability associated with logic based methods.

Another approach to logic-based activity recognition is to use stream reasoning based on Answer Set Programming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Do|first=Thang|author2=Seng W. Loke|author3=Fei Liu|title=Answer Set Programming for Stream Reasoning|journal=Advances in Artificial Intelligence, Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2011|volume=6657|pages=104–109|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-21043-3_13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been applied to recognising activities for health-related applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Do|first=Thang|author2=Seng W. Loke|author3=Fei Liu|title=HealthyLife: an Activity Recognition System with Smartphone using Logic-Based Stream Reasoning|journal=Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services, (Mobiquitous 2012)|year=2012|url=http://homepage.cs.latrobe.edu.au/sloke/papers/Mobiquitous2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which uses weak constraints to model a degree of ambiguity/uncertainty.

===Activity recognition through probabilistic reasoning===
Probability theory and statistical learning models are more recently applied in activity recognition to reason about actions, plans and goals under uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;E. Charniak and R.P. Goldman. "[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000437029390060O A Bayesian model of plan recognition]". ''Artificial Intelligence'', 64:53–79, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In the literature, there have been several approaches which explicitly represent uncertainty in reasoning about an agent's plans and goals.

Using sensor data as input, Hodges and Pollack designed machine learning-based systems for identifying individuals as they perform routine daily activities such as making coffee.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Hodges and M.E. Pollack. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.109.5487&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf An 'object-use fingerprint': The use of electronic sensors for human identification]". In ''Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intel Research Lablets|Intel Research (Seattle) Lab]] and [[University of Washington]] at Seattle have done some important works on using sensors to detect human plans.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Perkowitz, Matthai Philipose, Donald J. Patterson, and Kenneth P. Fishkin. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.7512&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Mining models of human activities from the web]". In ''Proceedings of the Thirteenth International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2004), pages 573–582, May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthai Philipose, Kenneth P. Fishkin, Mike Perkowitz, Donald J. Patterson, Dieter Fox, Henry Kautz, and Dirk Hähnel. "[https://ftp.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/papers/pervasive_proact_final.pdf Inferring activities from interactions with objects]". In ''IEEE Pervasive Computing'', pages 50–57, October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Fox Lin Liao, Donald J. Patterson and Henry A. Kautz.

Intell.'', 171(5-6):311–331, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these works infer user transportation modes from readings of radio-frequency identifiers (RFID) and global positioning systems (GPS).

The use of temporal probabilistic models has been shown to perform well in activity recognition and generally outperform non-temporal models.&lt;ref&gt;TLM van Kasteren, Gwenn Englebienne, BJA Kröse. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Van_Kasteren/publication/227017257_Human_Activity_Recognition_from_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Data_Benchmark_and_Software/links/0deec52b531429802c000000/Human-Activity-Recognition-from-Wireless-Sensor-Network-Data-Benchmark-and-Software.pdf Human activity recognition from wireless sensor network data: Benchmark and software]." Activity Recognition in Pervasive Intelligent Environments, 165-186, Atlantis Press&lt;/ref&gt; Generative models such as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the more generally formulated Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) are popular choices in modelling activities from sensor data.&lt;ref&gt;Piyathilaka, L.; Kodagoda, S., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Piyathilaka_Lasitha/publication/258341803_Gaussian_Mixture_Based_HMM_for_Human_Daily_Activity_Recognition_Using_3D_Skeleton_Features/links/0deec527f42f76c8f4000000/Gaussian-Mixture-Based-HMM-for-Human-Daily-Activity-Recognition-Using-3D-Skeleton-Features.pdf Gaussian mixture based HMM for human daily activity recognition using 3D skeleton features]," Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA), 2013 8th IEEE Conference on, vol., no., pp.567,572, 19–21 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;TLM van Kasteren, Gwenn Englebienne, Ben Kröse" [https://sites.google.com/site/tim0306/amiKasterenHierch.pdf?attredirects=0 Hierarchical Activity Recognition Using Automatically Clustered Actions]", 2011, Ambient Intelligence, 82-91, Springer Berlin/Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Wilson and Chris Atkeson.

Appears in PAMI Special Issue on Visual Surveillance and Monitoring, Aug 00&lt;/ref&gt;
Discriminative models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are also commonly applied and also give good performance in activity recognition.&lt;ref&gt;TLM Van Kasteren, Athanasios Noulas, Gwenn Englebienne, Ben Kröse, "[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1409637 Accurate activity recognition in a home setting]", 2008/9/21, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Ubiquitous computing, 1-9, ACM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hao Hu, Sinno Jialin Pan, Vincent Wenchen Zheng, Nathan NanLiu, and Qiang Yang. Real world activity recognition with multiple goals. In Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Ubiquitous computing, Ubicomp, pages 30–39, New York, NY, USA, 2008. ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generative and discriminative models both have their pros and cons and the ideal choice depends on their area of application. A dataset together with implementations of a number of popular models (HMM, CRF) for activity recognition can be found [https://sites.google.com/site/tim0306/datasets here].

Conventional temporal probabilistic models such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model the correlations between the activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which take into account the rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Nuria Oliver]], Ashutosh Garg, and Eric Horvitz. Layered representations for learning and inferring office activity from multiple sensory channels. Comput. Vis. Image Underst., 96(2):163–180, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amarnag Subramanya, Alvin Raj, Jeff Bilmes, and Dieter Fox. Hierarchical models for activity recognition. In Proceedings of the international conference on Multimedia Signal Processing, MMSP, Victoria, CA, October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Data mining based approach to activity recognition===
Different from traditional machine learning approaches, an approach based on data mining has been recently proposed. In the work of Gu et al., the problem of activity recognition is formulated as a pattern-based classification problem. They proposed a data mining approach based on discriminative patterns which describe significant changes between any two activity classes of data to recognize sequential, interleaved and concurrent activities in a unified solution.&lt;ref&gt;Tao Gu, Zhanqing Wu, Xianping Tao, Hung Keng Pung, and Jian Lu. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4912776/ epSICAR: An Emerging Patterns based Approach to Sequential, Interleaved and Concurrent Activity Recognition]. In Proc. of the 7th Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (Percom '09), Galveston, Texas, March 9–13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert ''et al.'' use 2D corners in both space and time. These are grouped spatially and temporally using a hierarchical process, with an increasing search area. At each stage of the hierarchy, the most distinctive and descriptive features are learned efficiently through data mining (Apriori rule).&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert A, Illingworth J, Bowden R. Action Recognition using Mined Hierarchical Compound Features. IEEE Trans Pattern Analysis and Machine Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensor usage==

===Vision-based activity recognition===
It is a very important and challenging problem to track and understand the behavior of agents through videos taken by various cameras. The primary technique employed is computer vision. Vision-based activity recognition has found many applications such as human-computer interaction, user interface design, [[robot learning]], and surveillance, among others.
Scientific conferences where vision based activity recognition work often appears are [[ICCV]] and [[CVPR]].

In vision-based activity recognition, a great deal of work has been done. Researchers have attempted a number of methods such as [[optical flow]], [[Kalman filtering]], [[Hidden Markov model]]s, etc., under different modalities such as single camera, stereo, and infrared. In addition, researchers have considered multiple aspects on this topic, including single pedestrian tracking, group tracking, and detecting dropped objects.

Recently some researchers have used RGBD cameras like Microsoft Kinect to detect human activities. Depth cameras add extra dimension i.e. depth which normal 2d camera fails to provide. Sensory information from these depth cameras have been used to generate real-time skeleton model of humans with different body positions. These skeleton information provides meaningful information that researchers have used to model human activities which are trained and later used to recognize unknown activities.&lt;ref&gt;Piyathilaka, L.; Kodagoda, S., "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6566433&amp;isnumber=6566328 Gaussian mixture based HMM for human daily activity recognition using 3D skeleton features]," Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA), 2013 8th IEEE Conference on, vol., no., pp.567,572, 19–21 June 2013  URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6566433&amp;isnumber=6566328&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite remarkable progress of vision-based activity recognition, its usage for most actual visual surveillance applications remains a distant aspiration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bux |first1=Allah |last2=Angelov |first2=Plamen |last3=Habib |first3=Zulfiqar |title=A comprehensive review on handcrafted and learning-based action representation approaches for human activity recognition |journal=Applied Sciences |date=2017 |volume=7 |issue=1 |page=110 |doi=10.3390/app7010110}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conversely, the human brain seems to have perfected the ability to recognize human actions. This capability relies not only on acquired knowledge, but also on the aptitude of extracting information relevant to a given context and logical reasoning. Based on this observation, it has been proposed to enhance vision-based activity recognition systems by integrating [[commonsense reasoning]] and, contextual and commonsense knowledge. Experiments performed using video and RGBD cameras demonstrate the added value of such approach &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martinez-del-Rincon |first1=Jesus |last2=Santofimia |first2=Maria Jose |last3=Nebel |first3=Jean-Christophe |title=Common Sense Reasoning for Human Action Recognition |journal=Pattern Recognition Letters |date=2013 |volume=34 |issue=15 |page=1849-1860 |doi=10.1016/j.patrec.2012.10.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cantarero |first1=R. |last2=Santofimia |first2=M.

====Levels of vision-based activity recognition====
In vision-based activity recognition, the computational process is often divided into four steps, namely human detection, human tracking, human activity recognition and then a high-level activity evaluation.

====Fine-grained action localization====
{{main|Object Co-segmentation}}

In [[computer vision]]-based activity recognition, fine-grained action localization typically provides per-image segmentation masks delineating the human object and its action category (e.g., ''Segment-Tube''&lt;ref name="Wang Duan Zhang Niu p=1657"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wang | first=Le | last2=Duan | first2=Xuhuan | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Niu | first4=Zhenxing | last5=Hua | first5=Gang | last6=Zheng | first6=Nanning | title=Segment-Tube: Spatio-Temporal Action Localization in Untrimmed Videos with Per-Frame Segmentation | journal=Sensors | publisher=MDPI AG | volume=18 | issue=5 | date=2018-05-22 | issn=1424-8220 | doi=10.3390/s18051657 | page=1657 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/Segment-Tube_Spatio-Temporal_Action_Localization_in_Untrimmed_Videos_with_Per-Frame_Segmentation.pdf}}  [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]].&lt;/ref&gt;). Techniques such as dynamic [[Markov random field|Markov Networks]], [[Convolutional neural network|CNN]] and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]] are often employed to exploit the semantic correlations between consecutive video frames.

====Automatic gait recognition====
{{Main|Gait recognition}}

One way to identify specific people is by how they walk. Gait-recognition software can be used to record a person's gait or gait feature profile in a database for the purpose of recognizing that person later, even if they are wearing a disguise.

===Wi-Fi-based activity recognition===
When activity recognition is performed indoors and in cities using the widely available [[Wi-Fi]] signals and [[802.11]] access points, there is much noise and uncertainty. These uncertainties can be modeled using a dynamic [[Bayesian network]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Jie Yin, Xiaoyong Chai and Qiang Yang, "[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2004/AAAI04-092.pdf High-level Goal Recognition in a Wireless LAN]". In ''Proceedings of the Nineteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI-04), San Jose, CA USA, July 2004. Pages 578-584&lt;/ref&gt; In a multiple goal model that can reason about user's interleaving goals,a [[deterministic]] state transition model is applied.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaoyong Chai and Qiang Yang, "[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2005/AAAI05-001.pdf Multiple-Goal Recognition From Low-level Signals]". ''Proceedings of the Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI 2005), Pittsburgh, PA USA, July 2005. Pages 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible method models the concurrent and interleaving activities in a probabilistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hao Hu, Qiang Yang. "[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-216.pdf CIGAR: Concurrent and Interleaving Goal and Activity Recognition]", to appear in AAAI 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A user action discovery model could segment Wi-Fi signals to produce possible actions.&lt;ref&gt;Jie Yin, Dou Shen, Qiang Yang and Ze-nian Li "[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2005/AAAI05-005.pdf Activity Recognition through Goal-Based Segmentation]".

An '''assignment'''&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''cessio''&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal term used in the context of the law of [[contract]] and of [[property (law)|property]]. In both instances, assignment is the process whereby a person, the ''assignor'', transfers rights or benefits to another, the ''assignee''.&lt;ref&gt;For the assignment of claim see [http://www.trans-lex.org/917000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; An assignment may not transfer a duty, burden or detriment without the express agreement of the assignee. The right or benefit being assigned may be a gift (such as a [[waiver]]) or it may be paid for with a contractual [[consideration]] such as money. 

The rights may be vested or contingent,&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation|HCA|21|1963|parallelcite=(1963) 109 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 9 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may include an [[equitable interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Law Dictionary|publisher=oxford university press|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mortgages and loans are relatively straightforward and amenable to assignment. An assignor may assign rights, such as a [[mortgage note]] issued by a third party borrower, and this would require the latter to make repayments to the assignee.

A related concept of assignment is [[novation]] wherein, by agreement with all parties, one contracting party is replaced by a new party. While novation requires the consent of all parties, assignment needs no consent from other non-assigning parties. However, in the case of assignment, the consent of the non-assigning party may be required by a contractual provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdnf.tlcollect.com/f1/cl/610/8172/TMT%20Newsletter%20August%202010%20v1d.pdf#page=3 |title=Tips and traps in contracting: novation versus assignment |last1=Kallenbach |first1=Paul |last2=Reid |first2=Nicole |publisher=[[MinterEllison]] |date=August 2010 |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The assignment does not necessarily have to be in writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish [[privity]] (in other words, contractual relationship, including right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party [[obligor]] and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.

==Liabilities and duties==
Unless the contractual agreement states otherwise, the assignee typically does not receive more rights than the assignor, and the assignor may remain liable to the original counterparty for the performance of the contract. The assignor often delegates duties in addition to rights to the assignee, but the assignor may remain ultimately responsible.

However, in the United States, there are various laws that limit the liability of the assignee, often to facilitate credit, as assignees are typically lenders.&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability&gt;[http://arnstein.com/attorneypublications/Ropiquet/Assignee.Liability.-.Through.the.Minefield.pdf Assignee Liability: Through the Minefield]. Arnstein &amp; Lehr LLP.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples include a provision in the [[Truth in Lending Act]]&lt;ref&gt;See 15 U.S.C. 1641(a).&lt;/ref&gt; and provisions in the [[Consumer Leasing Act]] and the [[Home Ownership Equity Protection Act]].&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability/&gt;

In other cases, the contract may be a [[negotiable instrument]] in which the person receiving the instrument may become a [[holder in due course]], which is similar to an assignee except that issues, such as lack of performance, by the assignor may not be a valid defense for the obligor.&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC&gt;[http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm Commercial Paper: Holder in Due Course &amp; Defenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128024402/http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm |date=2012-11-28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] promulgated Rule 433, formally known as the "Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses", which "effectively abolished the [holder in due course] doctrine in consumer credit transactions".&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC/&gt; In 2012, the commission reaffirmed the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/05/holderrule.shtm FTC Opinion Letter Affirms Consumers' Rights under the Holder Rule]. FTC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assignment of contract rights==
{{Contract law}}

After the assignment of contractual rights, the assignee will receive all benefits that had accrued to the assignor. For example, if A contracts to sell his car for $100 to B, A may assign the benefits (the right to be paid $100) to C.&lt;ref&gt;In this scenario, Party A is the '''obligee/assignor''', Party B is an '''obligor''', and Party C is the '''assignee'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Party C is ''not'' a ''[[third party beneficiary]]'', because the contract was not made for C's benefit. Assignment takes place after the contract was formed; they may not precede them.{{cn|date=April 2018}}
===When assignment will be permitted===
The [[common law]] favors the freedom of assignment, so an assignment will generally be permitted unless there is an express prohibition against assignment in the contract. Where assignment is thus permitted, the assignor need not consult the other party to the contract. An assignment cannot have any effect on the duties of the other party to the contract, nor can it reduce the possibility of the other party receiving full performance of the same quality. Certain kinds of performance, therefore, ''cannot'' be assigned, because they create a unique relationship between the parties to the contract. For example, the assignment of a legal malpractice claim is void since an assignee would be a stranger to the attorney-client relationship, who was owed no duty by the attorney and would imperil the sanctity of the highly confidential and fiduciary relationship existing between attorney and client.

Torts are not assignable as [[public policy]], and various statutes may prohibit assignment in certain instances.&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; In addition, the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] lists prohibitions in §317(2)(a) based upon the effect to the nonassigning party (obligor),&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; with similar prohibitions in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] §2-210.&lt;ref name=LexisNexisStudy&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/contracts/contracts18.htm Chapter 18: Assignment and Delegation]. LexisNexis study outline.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, UCC §2-210 states the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-210 Uniform Commercial Code § 2-210. Delegation of Performance; Assignment of Rights].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreementotherwise [sic].}}

===Requirements for an effective assignment===
For assignment to be effective, it must occur in the present. No specific language is required to make such an assignment, but the assignor must make some clear statement of intent to assign clearly identified contractual rights to the assignee. A promise to assign in the future has no legal effect. Although this prevents a party from assigning the benefits of a contract that has not yet been made, a [[court of equity]] may enforce such an assignment where an established economic relationship between the assignor and the assignee raised an expectation that the assignee would indeed form the appropriate contract in the future.

A contract may contain a [[non-assignment clause]], which prohibits the assignment of specific rights and some various rights, or of the entire contract, to another. However, such a clause does not necessarily destroy the power of either party to make an assignment. Instead, it merely gives the other party the ability to sue for breach of contract if such an assignment is made. However, an assignment of a contract containing such a clause will be ineffective if the assignee ''knows'' of the non-assignment clause, or if the non-assignment clause specifies that "all assignments are void".

Two other techniques to prevent the assignment of contracts are ''[[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] clauses'' or clauses creating a ''[[condition subsequent]]''. The former would give the other party to the contract the power to rescind the contract if an assignment is made; the latter would rescind the contract automatically in such circumstances.

====Requirement of a writing====
There are certain situations in which the assignment must be in writing.
#Assignment of [[wages]]; additionally, statutes may prohibit this assignment&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt;
#Assignment of any interest in [[real property]]
#Assignment of [[Chose (English law)|choses in action]] worth over $5,000

===Delegation===
A parallel concept to assignment is ''[[delegation (law)|delegation]]'', which occurs when one party transfers his ''duties or liabilities'' under a contract to another. A delegation and an assignment can be accomplished at the same time, although a non-assignment clause may also bar delegation.

== Remedies ==
[[Legal remedy|Legal remedies]] may be available if the nonassigning party's rights are affected by the assignment.

===Revocability===
Assignments made for consideration are irrevocable, meaning that the assignor permanently gives up the legal right to take back the assignment once it has been made. Donative assignments, on the other hand, are generally revocable, either by the assignor giving notice to the assignee, taking performance directly from the obligor, or making a subsequent assignment of the same right to another. There are some exceptions to the revocability of a donative assignment:
#The assignment can not be revoked if the obligor has already performed
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignee has received a ''token chose'' (''chose'' being derived from the [[French language|French]] word for "thing", as in a chose of action) - a physical object that signifies a right to collect, such as a stock certificate or the passbook to a savings account.
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignor has set forth in writing the assignment of a ''simple chose'' - a contract right embodied in any form of token.
#[[Estoppel]] can prevent the revocation of a donative assignment if the assignee changed their position in reliance on the assignment.

===Breach and defenses===
A cause of action for [[breach of contract|breach]] on the part of the obligor lies with the assignee, who will hold the exclusive right to commence a cause of action for any failure to perform or defective performance. At this stage, because the assignee "stands in the shoes" of the assignor, the obligor can raise any defense to the contract that the obligor could have raised against the assignor. Furthermore, the obligor can raise against the assignee counterclaims and setoffs that the obligor had against the assignor. For example, suppose that A makes a contract to paint B's house in exchange for $500. A then assigns the right to receive the $500 to C, to pay off a debt owed to C. However, A does such a careless job painting the house that B has to pay another painter $400 to correct A's work. If C sues B to collect the debt, B can raise his counterclaim for the expenses caused by the poor paint job, and can reduce the amount owed to C by that $400, leaving only $100 to be collected.

When the assignor makes the assignment, he makes with it an [[implied warranty]] that the right to assign was not subject to defenses. If the contract had a provision that made the assignment ineffective, the assignee could sue the assignor for breach of this implied warranty. Similarly, the assignee could also sue under this theory if the assignor wrongfully revoked the assignment.

===Successive assignments===
Occasionally, an unscrupulous assignor will asof the assignment, and on the timing of the assignments relative to certain other actions.

In a quirk left over from the common law, if the assignment was donative, the ''last assignee'' is the true owner of the rights. However, if the assignment was for consideration, the ''first assignee'' to actually ''collect against the assigned contract'' is the true owner of the rights. Under the modern ''American rule'', now followed in most U.S. jurisdictions, the first assignor with equity (i.e. the first to have paid for the assignment) will have the strongest claim, while remaining assignees may have other remedies.  In some countries, the rights of the respective assignees are determined by the old common law [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']].

# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was revocable (because it had not been made irrevocable by any of the means listed above) have no cause of action whatsoever.
# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was made irrevocable can bring an action for the [[tort]] of [[conversion (law)|conversion]], because the assignment was technically their property when it was given to a later assignee.
# Later assignees for consideration have a cause of action for breaches of the implied warranty discussed above.

See [[interpleader]].

==Special rules for assignment of certain rights==

===Property rights===
{{Property law}}
{{See also|Rule in Dumpor's Case|Privity of estate}}
[[Real property]] rights can be assigned just as any other contractual right. However, special duties and liabilities attach to transfers of the right to possess property. With an assignment, the assignor transfers the complete remainder of the interest to the assignee. The assignor must not retain any sort of reversionary interest in the right to possess. The assignee's interest must abut the interest of the next person to have the right to possession. If any time or interest is reserved by a tenant assignor then the act is not an assignment, but is instead a sublease.

The liability of the assignee depends upon the contract formed when the assignment takes place. However, in general, the assignee has privity of estate with a lessor. With privity of estate comes the duty on the part of the assignee to perform certain obligations under covenant, e.g. pay rent. Similarly, the lessor retains the obligations to perform on covenants to maintain or repair the land.

If the assignor agrees to continue paying rent to the lessor and subsequently defaults, the lessor can sue both the assignor under the original contract signed with the lessor as well as the assignee because by taking possession of the property interest, the assignee has obliged himself to perform duties under covenant such as the payment of rent.

Unlike a Novation where consent of both the lessor and lesse is required for the third party to assume all obligations and liabilities of the original lessee, an assignment does not always need the consent of all parties. If the contract terms state specifically that the lessor's consent is not needed to assign the contract, then the lesee can assign the contract to whomever the lesee wants to.

Absent language to the contrary, a tenant may assign their rights to an assignee without the landlord's consent. In the majority of jurisdictions, when there is a clause that the landlord may withhold consent to an assignment, the general rule is that the landlord may not withhold consent unreasonably unless there is a provision that states specifically that the Landlord may withhold consent at Landlord's sole discretion.

===Partnership rights===
A person can also assign their rights to receive the benefits owed to a partner in a [[partnership]]. However, the assignee can ''not'' thereby gain any of the assignor's rights with respect to the operation of the partnership. The assignee may not vote on partnership matters, inspect the partnership books, or take possession of partnership property; rather, the assignee can only be given the right is to collect distributions of income, unless the remaining partners consent to the assignment of a new general partner with operational, management, and financial interests. If the partnership is dissolved, the assignee can also claim the assignor's share of any distribution accompanying the dissolution.

===Intellectual property rights===
{{See also|transfer (patent)}}

Ownership of intellectual property, including [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, and [[trademark]]s, may be assigned, but special conditions attach to the assignment of patents and trademarks. In the [[United States]], assignment of a patent is governed by [[statute]], {{USCode|35|261}}.  Patent rights are assignable by an "instrument in writing."  Title in a patent can also be transferred as a result of other financial transactions, such as a [[merger]] or a [[takeover]], or as a result of operation of law, such as in an [[inheritance]] process, or in a [[bankruptcy]].  An assignment of a patent can be recorded with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].  Although such recording is not required, if an assignment is not recorded at the USPTO within three (3) months or prior to a subsequent assignment, the assignment will be void against a subsequent assignee without notice of the earlier, unrecorded assignment.

With respect to a trademark, the owner of the mark may not transfer ownership of the mark without transferring the [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] associated with the mark.

Companies sometimes request from employees that they assign all intellectual property they create while under the employment of the company.  This is typically done within an Employment Agreement, but is sometimes done through a specific agreement called Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement (PIIA).

===Personal injury torts===

The standard rule is that [[personal injury]] [[tort]] causes of action are nonassignable as a matter of [[Public policy (law)|public policy]].&lt;ref name=Stark2003&gt;Stark T. (2003). ''Negotiating and Drafting Contract Boilerplate'', [http://www.starklegaled.com/downloads/sample-nadcp-3.2.pdf Ch. 3: Assignment and Delegation]. ALM Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pony v. County of Los Angeles'', 433 F.3d 1138 (9th Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  These should be distinguished from final settlements or judgments resulting from lawsuits brought on such causes of action, which may be assignable.

===Legal malpractice===

In the majority of jurisdictions, assignments involving fraud or [[legal malpractice]] causes of action are void as against public policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Cowan Liebowitz &amp; Latman, PC v. Kaplan'', 902 So. 2d 755, 759-760 (Fla. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equitable assignment==
An '''equitable assignment''' is an assignment, or transfer of rights, in [[Equity (law)|equity]].

===General principles===

There are numerous requirements that exist for an equitable assignment of property, outside the 'standard' ''clear and unconditional intention to assign''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|39|2007|litigants=Westbourne Grammar School v Sanget Pty |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements are fundamental characteristics of a statutory assignment: Absolute assignment (an unconditional transfer: conditions precedent or part of a debt are not absolute) and the assignment must be made in writing and signed by the assignor, and in particular, this applies to real property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca1919141|Conveyancing Act 1919|23C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assigning future property in equity cannot be gratuitous. The assignor must receive consideration for the agreement, otherwise the assignment will be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt; However, an absolute assignment does not require consideration to be given. Secondly, between the period of agreement between assignor and assignee and acquisition by the assignor, the assignees rights are not [[contractual]], but rather a [[property|proprietary right]] to the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|39|1978|litigants=Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Everett |parallelcite=(1978) 21 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 625 at p. 643 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] (Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the assignee has an interest in this future property, in the same manner any owner has over property.

In equity, these principles operate to protect both the assignor and the assignee. In ''Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation'',&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt;  a taxpayer attempted to assign by [[deed]], to his wife certain moneys which he was eventually going to receive. This included dividends and [[interest]] due on [[loan]]s. The court held the interest and the [[dividend]]s were expectancies or possibilities which could not be assigned without consideration. The court's worry was that assignments without consideration might be used as instruments of fraud, to avoid creditors and tax collection.

===Mere expectancies===

Courts will not enforce a contract to assign an expectancy unless there is a valuable consideration. For example, under a settlement of property the respondent "the son" would have been entitled to an equal portion of properties along with his other siblings which was gained in a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] by his mother. This portion was only his when allocated to him at his mothers discretion. Prior to this allocation being made, the respondent allotted his benefit to [[trustee]]s for a voluntary settlement. He was assigning or purporting to assign something which he might become entitled to in the future, not a [[contingent interest]]. The judgment held it ineffective and elaborated on previous points to state the respondent cannot be compelled to allow the trustees to retain the appointed sum.&lt;ref&gt;Northumberland (Duke) v Inland Revenue Comrs&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
In some schools of [[Buddhism]],  '''''bardo''''' ([[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] བར་དོ་ Wylie: ''bar do'') or '''''antarabhāva''''' ([[Sanskrit]]) is an intermediate, transitional, or liminal state between death and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. It is a concept which arose soon after the Buddha's passing, with a number of earlier Buddhist groups accepting the existence of such an intermediate state, while other schools rejected it. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], ''bardo'' is the central theme of the ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'' (literally ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State''), the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead''.

Used loosely, "bardo" is the state of existence intermediate between two lives on earth. According to [[Tibet]]an tradition, after death and before one's next birth, when one's consciousness is not connected with a physical body, one experiences a variety of phenomena. These usually follow a particular sequence of degeneration from, just after death, the clearest experiences of reality of which one is [[spirit]]ually capable, and then proceeding to terrifying hallucinations that arise from the impulses of one's previous unskillful actions. For the prepared and appropriately trained individuals, the bardo offers a state of great opportunity for liberation, since transcendental insight may arise with the direct experience of reality; for others, it can become a place of danger as the [[karma|karmically]] created hallucinations can impel one into a less than desirable [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Metaphorically, ''bardo'' can describe times when our usual way of life becomes suspended, as, for example, during a period of illness or during a meditation [[Retreat (religious/spiritual)|retreat]]. Such times can prove fruitful for spiritual progress because external constraints diminish. However, they can also present challenges because our less skillful impulses may come to the foreground, just as in the [[Bardo Thodol|''sidpa bardo'']].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The concept of ''antarabhāva'', an intervening state between death and rebirth, was brought into Buddhism from the Vedic-Upanishadic philosophical tradition which later developed into Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', ''s.v.'' [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192800947.001.0001/acref-9780192800947-e-524]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Jaré Cuevas, "Predecessors and Prototypes: Towards a Conceptual History of the Buddhist Antarābhava", ''Numen'' '''43''':3:263-302 (September 1996) {{jstor|3270367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intermediate state in Indian Buddhism==

From the records of early Buddhist schools, it appears that at least six different groups accepted the notion of an intermediate existence (antarabhāva), namely, the [[Sarvāstivāda]], [[Darṣṭāntika]], [[Vātsīputrīyas]], [[Saṃmitīya]], [[Pūrvaśaila]] and late [[Mahīśāsaka]].  The first four of these are closely related schools.  Opposing them were the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], early [[Mahīśāsaka]], [[Theravāda]], [[Vibhajyavāda]] and the [[Śāriputra Abhidharma]] (possibly [[Dharmagupta]]) (Bareau 1955: 291).

Some of the earliest references we have to the “intermediate existence” are to be found in the Sarvāstivādin text the [[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhāṣa]] (阿毘達磨大毘婆沙論).  For instance, the Mahāvibhāṣa indicates a “basic existence” (本有), an “intermediate existence” (中有), a “birth existence” (生有) and “death existence” (死有) (CBETA, T27, no. 1545, p.&amp;nbsp;959, etc.).   Bareau (1955: 143) provides the arguments of the Sarvāstivāda as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intermediate being who makes the passage in this way from one existence to the next is formed, like every living being, of the five aggregates (skandha). His existence is demonstrated by the fact that it cannot have any discontinuity in time and space between the place and moment of death and those of rebirth, and therefore it must be that the two existences belonging to the same series are linked in time and space by an intermediate stage. The intermediate being is the [[Gandharva]], the presence of which is as necessary at conception as the fecundity and union of the parents. Furthermore, the Antarāparinirvāyin is an Anāgamin who obtains parinirvāṇa during the intermediary existence. As for the heinous criminal guilty of one of the five crimes without interval (ānantarya), he passes in quite the same way by an intermediate existence at the end of which he is reborn necessarily in hell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Deriving from a later period of the same school, though with some differences, [[Vasubandhu]]’s [[Abhidharmakośa]] explains (English trs. p.&amp;nbsp;383ff):

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is an intermediate being, and an intermediate existence? Intermediate existence, which inserts itself between existence at death and existence at birth, not having arrived at the location where it should go, cannot be said to be born.  Between death—that is, the five skandhas of the moment of death—and arising—that is, the five skandhas of the moment of rebirth—there is found an existence—a "body" of five skandhas—that goes to the place of rebirth. This existence between two realms of rebirth (gatī) is called intermediate existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He cites a number of texts and examples to defend the notion against other schools which reject it and claim that death in one life is immediately followed by rebirth in the next, without any intermediate state in between the two.  Both the Mahāvibhāṣa and the Abhidharmakośa have the notion of the intermediate state lasting "seven times seven days" (i.e. 49 days) at most.  This is one view, though, and there were also others.

Similar arguments were also used in [[Harivarman]]’s *Satyasiddhi Śāstra, a quasi-[[Mahāyāna]] text, and the Upadeśa commentary on the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras, both of which have strong influence from the Sarvāstivāda school.  Both of these texts had powerful influence in Chinese Buddhism, which also accepts this idea as a rule.

Fremantle (2001) states that there are six traditional bardo states known as the Six Bardos:  the Bardo of This Life (p.&amp;nbsp;55); the Bardo of Meditation (p.&amp;nbsp;58); the Bardo of Dream (p.&amp;nbsp;62); the Bardo of Dying (p.&amp;nbsp;64); the Bardo of Dharmata (p.&amp;nbsp;65); and the Bardo of Existence (p.&amp;nbsp;66).

Shugchang, ''et al.'' (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;5) discuss the [[Zhitro]] (Tibetan: Zhi-khro) teachings which subsume the ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'' and mention [[Karma Lingpa]], [[Terma (religion)|terma]] and [[Padmasambhava]] and list the Six Bardo:  "The first bardo begins when we take birth and endures as long as we live. The second is the bardo of dreams. The third is the bardo of concentration or meditation. The fourth occurs at the moment of death. The fifth is known as the bardo of the luminosity of the true nature. The sixth is called the bardo of transmigration or karmic becoming.&lt;ref&gt;Shugchang, Padma (editor); Sherab, Khenchen Palden &amp; Dongyal, Khenpo Tse Wang (2000).

# '''Kyenay bardo''' (''skye gnas bar do''): is the first bardo of birth and life. This bardo commences from conception until the last breath, when the [[mindstream]] withdraws from the body.
# '''Milam bardo''' (''rmi lam bar do''): is the second bardo of the dream state. The Milam Bardo is a subset of the first Bardo.  [[Dream Yoga]] develops practices to integrate the dream state into Buddhist [[sadhana]].
# '''Samten bardo''' (''bsam gtan bar do'') is the third bardo of [[meditation]]. This bardo is generally only experienced by meditators, though individuals may have spontaneous experience of it. Samten Bardo is a subset of the Shinay Bardo.
# '''Chikhai bardo''' ('''chi kha'i bar do''): is the fourth bardo of the moment of death. According to tradition, this bardo is held to commence when the outer and inner signs presage that the onset of death is nigh, and continues through the dissolution or transmutation of the [[Mahabhuta]] until the external and internal breath has completed.
# '''Chönyi bardo''' (''chos nyid bar do''): is the fifth bardo of the luminosity of the true nature which commences after the final 'inner breath' (Sanskrit: ''[[prana]]'', [[vayu]]; Tibetan: ''[[rlung]]''). It is within this Bardo that visions and auditory phenomena occur. In the Dzogchen teachings, these are known as the spontaneously manifesting [[Thödgal]] (Tibetan: ''thod-rgyal'') visions. Concomitant to these visions, there is a welling of profound peace and pristine awareness. Sentient beings who have not practiced during their lived experience and/or who do not recognize the clear light (Tibetan: ''[[Ösel (yoga)|od gsal]]'') at the moment of death are usually deluded throughout the fifth bardo of luminosity.
# '''Sidpa bardo''' (''srid pa bar do''): is the sixth bardo of becoming or transmigration.  This bardo endures until the inner-breath commences in the new transmigrating form determined by the "karmic seeds" within the [[storehouse consciousness]].

==Exegesis==
Fremantle (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;53–54) charts the development of the bardo concept through the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Originally bardo referred only to the period between one life and the next, and this is still its normal meaning when it is mentioned without any qualification.  There was considerable dispute over this theory during the early centuries of Buddhism, with one side arguing that rebirth (or conception) follows immediately after death, and the other saying that there must be an interval between the two. With the rise of mahayana, belief in a transitional period prevailed.  Later Buddhism expanded the whole concept to distinguish six or more similar states, covering the whole cycle of life, death, and rebirth.  But it can also be interpreted as any transitional experience, any state that lies between two other states.  Its original meaning, the experience of being between death and rebirth, is the prototype of the bardo experience, while the six traditional bardos show how the essential qualities of that experience are also present in other transitional periods.  By refining even further the understanding of the essence of bardo, it can then be applied to every moment of existence.  The present moment, the now, is a continual bardo, always suspended between the past and the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as shown above, Fremantle's idea that it was originally only "between one life and next" was not how it was understood by the Sarvāstivāda school at the outset.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Also, the idea that the ascendancy of this idea was due to the Mahāyāna is unfounded, and it is much more likely that it was due to the Sarvāstivāda influence, several centuries before the Mahāyāna had any real influence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

{{Black-box}}
In [[science studies]], the social process of '''blackboxing''' is based on the abstract notion of a [[black box]]. To cite  [[Bruno Latour]], blackboxing is "the way scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success. When a machine runs efficiently, when a matter of fact is settled, one need focus only on its inputs and outputs and not on its internal complexity. Thus, paradoxically, the more science and technology succeed, the more opaque and obscure they become."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bruno Latour|title=Pandora's hope: essays on the reality of science studies|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]. p. 304|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Social constructivist]] approaches to science and technology studies, such as [[Social construction of technology]] (SCOT) often revolve around "opening the black box", or attempting to understand the internal workings of a given system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology|year=1987|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=21–22|author1=Pinch, Trevor  |author2=Wiebe E. Bijker |lastauthoramp=yes |editor1=Wiebe E. Bijker |editor2=Thomas Hughes |editor3=Trevor Pinch |chapter=The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology might Benefit Each Other}}&lt;/ref&gt; This then allows the researcher to provide empirical models of technological change that are specific and better able to describe the events that took place during the development of the technology.  This approach has also been criticized by scholars such as [[Langdon Winner]] for being excessively formulaic in its methods and too narrow in its focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|title=Upon opening the black box and finding it empty: Social constructivism and the philosophy of technology|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|year=1993|volume=18|issue=3|pages=365–368|doi=10.1177/016224399301800306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "black box" is also important in [[Actor–network theory]] as it relates to simplification.  As [[Michel Callon]] notes, an actor-network is a system of discrete entities or nodes, while the reality that it represents is theoretically infinite.  Therefore, in order to describe something in terms of an actor-network, complex systems must be simplified down to individual nodes, ignoring their internal workings and focusing only on their interactions with other nodes within the network.  However, if the simplified "black box" is insufficient modeling the system in question, it must be opened, creating a "swarm of new actors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mapping the Dynamics of Science and Technology: Sociology of Science in the Real World|year=1986|publisher=Sheridan House Inc|isbn=0333372239|pages=29–30|author=Michel Callon|authorlink=Michel Callon|editor1=Callon, M. |editor2=Law, J. |editor3=Rip, A. |chapter=The sociology of an actor-network: The case of the electric vehicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mass-spring-damper-bond-graph.png|thumb|266x266px|A simple [[mass–spring–damper]] system, and its equivalent bond-graph form]]

A '''bond graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphical representation]] of a physical [[Dynamical system|dynamic system]]. It allows the conversion of the system into a [[state-space representation]]. It is similar to a [[block diagram]] or [[signal-flow graph]], with the major difference that the arcs in bond graphs represent [[Undirected graph|bi-directional]] exchange of physical [[energy]], while those in block diagrams and signal-flow graphs represent [[Directed graph|uni-directional]] flow of information. Bond graphs are multi-energy domain (e.g. mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, etc) and domain neutral. This means a bond graph can incorporate multiple domains seamlessly.

The bond graph is composed of the "bonds" which link together "single port", "double-port" and "multi-port" elements (see below for details). Each bond represents the instantaneous flow of energy (''dE''/''dt'') or [[Power (physics)|power]]. The flow in each bond is denoted by a pair of variables called power variables, whose product is the instantaneous power of the bond. The power variables are broken into two parts: flow and effort. For example, for the bond of an electrical system, the flow is the current, while the effort is the voltage. By multiplying current and voltage in this example you can get the instantaneous power of the bond.

A bond has two other features described briefly here, and discussed in more detail below. One is the "half-arrow" sign convention. This defines the assumed direction of positive energy flow. As with electrical circuit diagrams and free-body diagrams, the choice of positive direction is arbitrary, with the caveat that the analyst must be consistent throughout with the chosen definition. The other feature is the "causality". This is a vertical bar placed on only one end of the bond. It is not arbitrary. As described below, there are rules for assigning the proper causality to a given port, and rules for the precedence among ports. Causality explains the mathematical relationship between effort and flow. The positions of the causalities show which of the power variables are dependent and which are independent.

If the dynamics of the physical system to be modeled operate on widely varying time scales, fast continuous-time behaviors can be modeled as instantaneous phenomena by using a [[hybrid bond graph]]. Bond graphs were invented by [[Henry Paynter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Analysis and Design of Engineering Systems|date=1961|publisher=The M.I.T. Press|author=Paynter, Henry M.|ISBN=0-262-16004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tetrahedron of state ==
[[File:Tetrahedron-of-state.png|thumb|Tetrahedron of state]]
The tetrahedron of state is a tetrahedron that graphically shows the conversion between effort and flow. The adjacent image shows the tetrahedron in its generalized form. The tetrahedron can be modified depending on the energy domain. The table below shows the variables and constants of the tetrahedron of state in common energy domains.

Using the tetrahedron of state, one can find a mathematical relationship between any variables on the tetrahedron. This is done by following the arrows around the diagram and multiplying any constants along the way. For example, if you wanted to find the relationship between generalized flow and generalized displacement, you would start at the ''f(t)'' and then integrate it to get ''q(t)''. More examples of equations can be seen below.

Relationship between generalized displacement and generalized flow.

&lt;math&gt;q(t) = \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized effort.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac {1}{R} \cdot e(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized momentum.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{I} \cdot p(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized momentum and generalized effort.

&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \int e(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized involving the constant C.

&lt;math&gt;e(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

All of the mathematical relationships remain the same when switching energy domains, only the symbols change. This can be seen with the following examples.

Relationship between displacement and velocity.

&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \int v(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between current and voltage, this is also known as [[Ohm's law]].

&lt;math&gt;i(t) = \frac {1}{R} \cdot V(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between force and displacement, also known as [[Hooke's law]]. It should be noted that the negative sign is dropped in this equation because the sign is factored into the way the arrow is pointing in the bond graph. 

&lt;math&gt;F(t) = k \cdot x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

== Components ==
If an engine is connected to a wheel through a shaft, the power is being transmitted in the rotational mechanical domain, meaning the effort and the flow are torque (τ) and angular velocity (ω) respectively. A word bond graph is a first step towards a bond graph, in which words define the components. As a word bond graph, this system would look like:
: &lt;math&gt;{\text{engine}}\;\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;
A half-arrow is used to provide a sign convention, so if the engine is doing work when τ and ω are positive, then the diagram would be drawn:
: &lt;math&gt;{\text{engine}}\;\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;
This system can also be represented in a more general method. This involves changing from using the words, to symbols representing the same items. These symbols are based on the generalized form, as explained above. As the engine is applying a torque to the wheel, it will be represented as a source of effort for the system. The wheel can be presented by an impedance on the system.  Further, the torque and angular velocity symbols are dropped and replaced with the generalized symbols for effort and flow. While not necessary in the example, it is common to number the bonds, to keep track of in equations. The simplified diagram can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;{S_e}\;\overset{\textstyle e_1}{\underset{\textstyle f_1}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Given that effort is always above the flow on the bond, it is also possible to drop the effort and flow symbols altogether, without losing any relevant information. However, the bond number should not be dropped. The example can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;{S_e}\;\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{I}&lt;/math&gt;

The bond number will be important later when converting from the bond graph to state-space equations.

=== Single-port elements ===
Single port elements are elements in a bond graph that can have only one port.

==== Sources and sinks ====
Sources are elements that represent the input for a system. They will either input effort or flow into a system. They are denoted by a capital "S" with either a lower case "e" or "f" for effort or flow respectively. Sources will always have the arrow pointing away from the element. An examples of sources include: motors (source of effort, torque), voltage sources (source of effort), and current sources (source of flow).

&lt;math&gt;S_e \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ J
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
S_f \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ J&lt;/math&gt;

Sinks are elements that represent the output for a system. They are represented the same way as sources, but have the arrow pointing into the element instead of away from it.

&lt;math&gt;J \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ S_e
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
J \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ S_f&lt;/math&gt;

==== Inertance ====
Inertance elements are denoted by a capital "I", and always have power flowing into them. Inertance elements are elements that store kinetic energy. Most commonly these are a mass for mechanical systems, and inductors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ I&lt;/math&gt;

==== Resistance ====
Resistance elements are denoted by a capital "R", and always have power flowing into them. Resistance elements are elements that dissipate energy. Most commonly these are a dampener, for mechanical systems, and resistors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ R&lt;/math&gt;

==== Capacitance ====
Capacitance elements are denoted by a capital "C", and always have power flowing into them. Capacitance elements are elements that store potential energy. Most commonly these are springs for mechanical systems, and capacitors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ C&lt;/math&gt;

=== Two-port elements ===
These elements have two ports. They are used to change the power between or within a system. When converting from one to the other, no power is lost during the transfer. The elements have a constant that will be given with it. The constant is called a transformer constant or gyrator constant depending on which element is being used. These constants will commonly be displayed as a ratio below the element.

====Transformer====
A transformer applies a relationship between flow in flow out, and effort in effort out. Examples include an ideal electrical [[transformer]] or a [[lever]].

Denoted

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 \overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup } }\ \ \ TR\ \   \overset{\textstyle _2}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\  \\
     ^{r:1}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''r'' denotes the modulus of the transformer. This means
: &lt;math&gt;f_1 \cdot r = f_2&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;e_2 \cdot r = e_1&lt;/math&gt;

====Gyrator====
A [[gyrator]] applies a relationship between flow in effort out, and effort in flow out. An example of a gyrator is a DC motor, which converts voltage (electrical effort) into Angular velocity (angular mechanical flow).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 \overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup } }\ \ \ GY\ \   \overset{\textstyle _2}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\  \\
     ^{g:1}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

meaning that
: &lt;math&gt;e_2 = g \cdot f_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;e_1 = g \cdot f_2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multi-port elements ===
Junctions, unlike the other elements can have any number of ports either in or out. Junctions split power across their ports. There are two distant junctions, the 0-junction and the 1-junction which differ only in the how effort and flow are carried across. It should be noted that the same junction in series can be combined, but different junctions in series cannot.

==== 0-junctions ====
0-junctions behave such that all efforts values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the flow values in equals the sum the flow values out.

&lt;math&gt;all\ e's\ are\ equal
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum f_{in} = \sum f_{out}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;
\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
\stackrel{\textstyle\stackrel{\textstyle _2}{\upharpoonright}}{0}
\overset{\textstyle _3}{\underset{\textstyle }{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Resulting equations:

&lt;math&gt;e_1 = e_2 = e_3
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = f_2 + f_3
&lt;/math&gt;

==== 1-junctions ====
1-junctions behave opposite of 0-junctions. 1-junctions behave such that all flow values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the effort values in equals the sum the effort values out.

&lt;math&gt;all\ f's\ are\ equal
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum e_{in} = \sum e_{out}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
\stackrel{\textstyle\stackrel{\textstyle _2}{\upharpoonright}}{1}
\overset{\textstyle _3}{\underset{\textstyle }{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Resulting equations:

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = f_2 = f_3
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e_1 = e_2 + e_3
&lt;/math&gt;

==Causality==
Bond graphs have a notion of causality, indicating which side of a bond determines the instantaneous effort and which determines the instantaneous flow. In formulating the dynamic equations that describe the system, causality defines, for each modeling element, which variable is dependent and which is independent.  By propagating the causation graphically from one modeling element to the other, analysis of large-scale models becomes easier.  Completing causal assignment in a bond graph model will allow the detection of modeling situation where an algebraic loop exists; that is the situation when a variable is defined recursively as a function of itself.

As an example of causality, consider a capacitor in series with a battery. It is not physically possible to charge a capacitor instantly, so anything connected in parallel with a capacitor will necessarily have the same voltage (effort variable) as the capacitor. Similarly, an inductor cannot change flux instantly and so any component in series with an inductor will necessarily have the same flow as the inductor. Because capacitors and inductors are passive devices, they cannot maintain their respective voltage and flow indefinitely&amp;#x2014;the components to which they are attached will affect their respective voltage and flow, but only indirectly by affecting their current and voltage respectively.

Note: Causality is a symmetric relationship. When one side "causes" effort, the other side "causes" flow.

In bond graph notation, a causal stroke may be added to one end of the power bond to indicate that the opposite end is defining the effort. Consider a constant-torque motor driving a wheel, i.e. a source of effort (''SE''). That would be drawn as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}[b]{r}\text{motor}\\SE\end{array}\;
\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--

   motor      τ    \|
      SE  ----------| wheel
              ω     |
--&gt;

Symmetrically, the side with the causal stroke (in this case the wheel) defines the flow for the bond.

Causality results in compatibility constraints. Clearly only one end of a power bond can define the effort and so only one end of a bond can have a causal stroke. In addition, the two passive components with time-dependent behavior, ''I'' and ''C'', can only have one sort of causation: an ''I'' component determines flow; a ''C'' component defines effort. So from a junction, ''J'', the preferred causal orientation is as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;I
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\;C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
          \|
  J -------| I
           |

    |      \
  J |------- C
    |
--&gt;

The reason that this is the preferred method for these elements can be further analyzed if you consider the equations they would give shown by the tetrahedron of state.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{I} \int e(t) \operatorname{d}\!t
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
e(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting equations involve the integral of the independent power variable. This is preferred over the result of having the causality the other way, which results in derivative. The equations can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;e(t) = I \cdot \dot{f}(t)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
f(t) = C \cdot \dot{e}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible for a bond graph to have a casual bar on one of these elements in the non-preferred manner. In such a case a "casual conflict" is said to have occurred at that bond. The results of a causal conflict are only seen when writing the [[state-space]] equations for the graph. It is explained in more details in that section.

A resistor has no time-dependent behavior: apply a voltage and get a flow instantly, or apply a flow and get a voltage instantly, thus a resistor can be at either end of a causal bond:
: &lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;R
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\;R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
         \|               |       \
 J -------| R           J |-------- R
          |               |
--&gt;

Sources of flow (''SF'') define flow, sources of effort (''SE'') define effort. Transformers are passive, neither dissipating nor storing energy, so causality passes through them:
: &lt;math&gt;\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
TF
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
TF
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
         | ..      |          |       .. |
   ------| TF -----|    or    |------ TF |------
         |         |          |          |
--&gt;

A gyrator transforms flow to effort and effort to flow, so if flow is caused on one side, effort is caused on the other side and vice versa:
: &lt;math&gt;\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
GY
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
GY
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
   |       ..      |                | .. |     
   |------ GY -----|    or    ------| GY |------
   |               |                |    |
--&gt;
; Junctions
In a 0-junction, efforts are equal; in a 1-junction, flows are equal. Thus, with causal bonds, only one bond can cause the effort in a 0-junction and only one can cause the flow in a 1-junction. Thus, if the causality of one bond of a junction is known, the causality of the others is also known. That one bond is called the 'strong bond'
: &lt;math&gt;\text{strong bond}\rightarrow\;\dashv\!\overset{\textstyle \top}{\underset{\textstyle\bot}{0}}\!\dashv
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\text{strong bond}\rightarrow\;\vdash\!\overset{\textstyle \bot}{\underset{\textstyle\top}{1}}\!\vdash&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
                 ___

=== Determining causality ===
In order to determine the causality of a bond graph certain steps must be followed. Those steps are:
# Draw Source Causal Bars
# Draw Preferred causality for C and I bonds
# Draw causal bars for 0 and 1 junctions, transformers and gyrators
# Draw R bond causal bars
# If a causal conflict occurs, change C or I bond to differentiation
A walk-through of the steps is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first step is to draw causality for the sources, over which there is only one. This results in the graph below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to draw the preferred causality for the C bonds.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \bar{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1}&amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Next apply the causality for the 0 and 1 junctions, transformers, and gyrators.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \bar{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

However, it should be noted that there is an issue with 0-junction on the left. The 0-junction has two causal bars at the junction, but the 0-junction wants one and only one at the junction. This was caused by having &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C_2
&lt;/math&gt; be in the preferred causality. The only way to fix this is to flip that causal bar. This results in a causal conflict, the corrected version of the graph is below, with the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\star
&lt;/math&gt; representing the causal conflict.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft} \star    &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Converting from other systems ==
One of the main advantages of using bond graphs is that once you have a bond graph it doesn't matter the original energy domain. Below are some of the steps to apply when converting from the energy domain to a bond graph.

=== Electromagnetic ===
The steps for solving an Electromagnetic problem as a bond graph are as follows:
# Place an 0-junction at each node
# Insert Sources, R, I, C, TR, and GY bonds with 1 junctions
# Ground (both sides if a transformer or gyrator is present)
# Assign power flow direction
# Simplify
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Linear mechanical ===
The steps for solving an Linear Mechanical problem as a bond graph are as follows:
# Place 1-junctions for each distinct velocity (usually at a mass)
# Insert R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1 junctions where they act
# Insert Sources and I bonds on the 1 junctions where they act
# Assign power flow direction
# Simplify
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Simplifying ===
The simplifying step is the same regardless if the system was electromagnetic or linear mechanical. The steps are:
# Remove Bond of zero power (due to ground or zero velocity)
# Remove 0 and 1 junctions with less than three bonds
# Simplify parallel power
# Combine 0 junctions in series
# Combine 1 junctions in series
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Parallel power ===
Parallel power is when power runs in parallel in a bond graph. An example of parallel power is shown below.

[[File:Bond-graph-parallel-power-example.png|frameless]]

Parallel power can be simplified, by recalling the relationship between effort and flow for 0 and 1-junctions. To solve parallel power you will first want to write down all of the equations for the junctions. For the example provided, the equations can be seen below. (Please make note of the number bond the effort/flow variable represents).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
f_1=f_2=f_3 &amp;  &amp; e_2=e_4=e_7 \\
e_1=e_2+e_3 &amp;  &amp; f_2=f_4+f_7 \\
            &amp;  &amp;             \\
e_3=e_5=e_6 &amp;  &amp; f_7=f_6=f_8 \\
f_3=f_5+f_6 &amp;  &amp; e_7+e_6=e_8
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

By manipulating these equations you can arrange them such that you can find an equivalent set of 0 and 1-junctions to describe the parallel power.

For example because &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_3=e_6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_2=e_7&lt;/math&gt; you can replace the variables in the equation &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1=e_2+e_3&lt;/math&gt; resulting in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1=e_6+e_7&lt;/math&gt; and since

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_6+e_7=e_8&lt;/math&gt;, we now know that &lt;math&gt;e_1=e_8&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship of two effort variables equaling can explained by an 0-junction. Manipulating other equations you can find that &lt;math&gt;f_4=f_5&lt;/math&gt; which describes the relationship of a 1-junction. Once you have determined the relationships that you need you can redraw the parallel power section with the new junctions. The result for the example show is seen below.

[[File:Bond-graph-parallel-power-solved.png|frameless]]

=== Examples ===

==== Simple electrical system ====
A simple electrical circuit consisting of a voltage source, resistor, and capacitor in series.

[[File:Simple-RC-circuit.png|frameless]]

The first step is to draw 0-junctions at all of the node. The result is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; 0 &amp; \\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; 0 &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to add all of the elements acting at their own 1-junction. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
    &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; R &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   \\ 
    &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; - &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   \\
S_e &amp; - &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; C  \\
    &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp; \underline{0} &amp; - &amp; - &amp; - &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to pick a ground. The ground is simply an 0-junction that is going to be assumed to have no voltage. For this case, the ground will be chosen to be the lower left 0-junction, that is underlined above. The next step is to draw all of the arrows for the bond graph. The arrows on junctions should point towards ground (following a similar path to current). For resistance, inertance, and compliance elements, the arrows always point towards the elements. The result of drawing the arrows can be seen below, with the 0-junction marked with a star as the ground.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-1.png|frameless]]

Now that we have the Bond graph, we can start the process of simplifying it. The first step is to remove all the ground nodes. Both of the bottom 0-junctions can be removed, because they are both grounded. The result is shown below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|199x199px]]

Next, the junctions with less than three bonds can be removed. This is because flow and effort pass through these junctions without be modified, so they can be removed to allow us to draw less. The result can be seen below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|140x140px]]

The final step is to apply causality to the bond graph. Applying causality was explained above. The final bond graph is shown below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-4.png|frameless|140x140px]]

==== Advanced electrical system ====
A more advanced electrical system with a current source, resistors, capacitors, and a transformer

[[File:Transformer-rc-circuit.png|frameless|464x464px]]

Following the steps with this circuit will result in the bond graph below, before it is simplified. The nodes marked with the star denote the ground.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|463x463px]]

Simplifying the bond graph will result in the image below.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|355x355px]]

Lastly, applying causality will result in the bond graph below. It should be noted that the bond with star denotes a causal conflict.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|348x348px]]

==== Simple linear mechanical ====
A simple linear mechanical system, consisting of a mass on a spring that is attached to a wall. The mass has some force being applied to it. An image of the system is shown below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-corrected.png|frameless|291x291px]]

For a mechanical system, the first step is to place a 1-junction at each distant velocity, in this case there are two distant velocities, the mass and the wall. It is usually helpful to label the 1-junctions for reference. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
1_{mass} &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
1_{wall} &amp;  &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to draw the R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1-junctions where they act. For this example there is only one of these bonds, the C bond for the spring. It acts between the 1-junction representing the mass and the 1-junction representing the wall. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
         &amp;   &amp;               \\
         &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{mass} &amp;   &amp;               \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
0        &amp; - &amp; C:\frac{1}{k} \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{wall} &amp;   &amp;   
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next you want to add the sources and I bonds on the 1-junction where they act. There is one source, the source of effort (force) and one I bond, the mass of the mass both of which act on the 1-junction of the mass. The result is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_e:F(t)      &amp;   &amp;               \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{mass} &amp; - &amp; I:m           \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
0        &amp; - &amp; C:\frac{1}{k} \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{wall} &amp;   &amp;  
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next you want to assign power flow. Like the electrical examples, power should flow towards ground, in this case the 1-junction of the wall. Exceptions to this are R,C, or I bond, which always point towards the element. The resulting bond graph is below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-bond-graph-1.png|frameless]]

Now that the bond graph has been generated, it can be simplified. Because the wall is grounded (has zero velocity), you can remove that junction. As such the 0-junction the C bond is on, can also be removed because it will then have less than three bonds. The simplified bond graph can be seen below.

The last step is to apply causality, the final bond graph can be seen below.

==== Advanced linear mechanical ====
A more advanced linear mechanical system can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech.png|frameless]]

Just like the above example, the first step is to make 1-junctions at each of the distant velocities. In this example there are three distant velocity, Mass 1, Mass 2, and the wall. Then you connect all of the bonds and assign power flow. The bond can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|318x318px]]

Next you start the process of simplifying the bond graph, by removing the 1-junction of the wall, and removing junctions with less than three bonds. The bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mechanical-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|375x375px]]

It should be noted that there is parallel power in the bond graph. Solving parallel power was explained above. The result of solving it can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|370x370px]]

Lastly, apply causality, the final bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-4.png|frameless|348x348px]]

== State equations ==
Once a bond graph is complete, it can be utilized to generate the [[state-space representation]] equations of the system. State-space representation is especially powerful as it allows complex multi-order [[Differential equation|differential]] system to be solved as a system of first-order equations instead. The general form of the state equation can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}} (t) = \textbf{A}\cdot \textbf{x}(t) + \textbf{B}\cdot \textbf{u}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{x} (t)&lt;/math&gt; is a column matrix of the [[state variable]]s, or the unknowns of the system. &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[time derivative]] of the state variables. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;is a column matrix of the inputs of the system. And &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are matrices of constants based on the system. The state variables of a system are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; values for each C and I bond without a causal conflict. Each I bond gets a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; while each C bond gets a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if you have the bond graph shown below.

[[File:State-equation-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|422x422px]]

Would have the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{x} (t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt; matrices.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{ x} }(t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
\dot{p}_3(t) \\
\dot{q}_6(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\textbf{x}(t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
p_3(t) \\
q_6(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\textbf{ u} (t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
e_1(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

The matrices of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are solved by determining the relationship of the state variables and their respective elements, as was described in the tetrahedron of state. The first step to solve the state equations, is to list all of the governing equations for the bond graph. The table below, shows the relationship between bonds and their governing equations.

For the example provided,

[[File:State-equation-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|422x422px]]

The governing equations are the following.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
input=e_1                                                                   &amp; eq. 1  \\
e_1=e_2+e_3+e_4                                                             &amp; eq. 2  \\
f_1=f_2=f_3=f_4                                                             &amp; eq. 3  \\
e_2=R_2 \cdot f_2                                                           &amp; eq. 4  \\
f_3 = \frac{1}{I_3} \int e_3 \operatorname{d}\!t = \frac{1}{I_3} \cdot p_3  &amp; eq. 5  \\
f_4 \cdot r = f_5                                                           &amp; eq. 6  \\
e_5 \cdot r = e_4                                                           &amp; eq. 7  \\
e_5 = e_6= e_7                                                              &amp; eq. 8  \\
f_5=f_6+f_7                                                                 &amp; eq. 9  \\
e_6 = \frac{1}{C_5} \int f_6 \operatorname{d}\!t = \frac {1}{C_6} \cdot q_6 &amp; eq. 10 \\
f_7 = \frac{1}{R_7} \cdot e_7                                               &amp; eq. 11
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be manipulated to yield the state equations. For this example, you are trying to find equations that relate &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{p}_3(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{q}_6(t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_3(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

To start you should recall from the tetrahedron of state that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{p}_3(t) = e_3(t)&lt;/math&gt;starting with equation 2, you can rearrange it so that &lt;math&gt;e_3 = e_1 - e_2 - e_4&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; can be substituted for equation 4, while in equation 4, &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;f_3&lt;/math&gt;due to equation 3, which can then be replaced by equation 5. &lt;math&gt;e_4&lt;/math&gt; can likewise be replaced using equation 7, in which &lt;math&gt;e_5&lt;/math&gt;can be replaced with &lt;math&gt;e_6&lt;/math&gt; which can then be replaced with equation 10. Following these substituted yields the first state equation which is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_3(t) = e_3(t) = e_1(t) - \frac {R_2}{I_3} \cdot p_3(t) - \frac{r}{C_6} \cdot q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The second state equation can likewise be solved, by recalling that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{q}_6(t) = f_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The second state equation is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_6(t)=f_6(t)=\frac{r}{I_3}\cdot p_3(t) - \frac{1}{R_7 \cdot C_6} \cdot q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Both equations can further be rearranged into matrix form. The result of which is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{p}_3(t)\\ 
\dot{q}_6(t)
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
- \frac{R_2}{I_3} &amp; - \frac{r}{C_6}\\ 
 \frac{r}{I_3} &amp; -\frac{1}{R_7 \cdot C_6}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_3(t)\\ 
q_6(t)
\end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\ 
0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1(t)
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point the equations can be treated as any other [[state-space representation]] problem.

[[File:Cassandra1.jpeg|thumb|Painting of Cassandra by [[Evelyn De Morgan]]]]

The '''Cassandra metaphor''' (variously labelled the '''Cassandra''' "'''syndrome'''", "'''complex'''", "'''phenomenon'''", "'''predicament'''", "'''dilemma'''", or "'''curse'''") occurs when valid warnings or concerns are dismissed or disbelieved.

The term originates in [[Greek mythology]]. [[Cassandra]] was a daughter of [[Priam]], the King of [[Troy]].  Struck by her beauty, [[Apollo]] provided her with the gift of [[prophecy]], but when Cassandra refused Apollo's romantic advances, he placed a curse ensuring that nobody would believe her warnings.  Cassandra was left with the knowledge of future events, but could neither alter these events nor convince others of the validity of her predictions.

The metaphor has been applied in a variety of contexts such as psychology, environmentalism, politics, science, cinema, the corporate world, and in philosophy, and has been in circulation since at least 1949 when French philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]] coined the term 'Cassandra Complex' to refer to a belief that things could be known in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard, Gaston, Le Rationalisme appliqué PUF, Paris, (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

The Cassandra metaphor is applied by some psychologists to individuals who experience physical and emotional suffering as a result of distressing personal perceptions, and who are disbelieved when they attempt to share the cause of their suffering with others.

===Melanie Klein===

In 1963, [[psychologist]] [[Melanie Klein]] provided an interpretation of [[Cassandra]] as representing the human moral conscience whose main task is to issue warnings. Cassandra as moral conscience, "predicts ill to come and warns that punishment will follow and grief arise".&lt;ref name="Klein, M. 1975"&gt;Klein, M., Envy and Gratitude- And Other Works 1946–1963, p. 293 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Cassandra's need to point out moral infringements and subsequent social consequences is driven by what Klein calls "the destructive influences of the cruel super-ego", which is represented in the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] by the god [[Apollo]], Cassandra's overlord and persecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, M., Envy and Gratitude – And Other Works 1946–1963, p. 295 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's use of the metaphor centers on the moral nature of certain predictions, which tends to evoke in others "a refusal to believe what at the same time they know to be true, and expresses the universal tendency toward denial, [with] denial being a potent defence against persecutory anxiety and guilt".&lt;ref name="Klein, M. 1975"/&gt;

===Laurie Layton Schapira===

In a 1988 study, [[Jungian]] analyst Laurie Layton Schapira, explored what she called the "[[Cassandra Complex]]" in the lives of two of her analysands.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL2243156M/The_Cassandra_complex|title=The Cassandra complex: living with disbelief: a modern perspective on hysteria|last=Schapira|first=Laurie Layton|date=1988|publisher=Inner City Books|year=|isbn=091912335X|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Based on clinical experience, she delineates three factors which constitute the Cassandra complex: 
# dysfunctional relationships with the "[[Apollo archetype]]",
# emotional or physical suffering, including [[hysteria]] ([[conversion disorder]]) or "women’s problems",
# and being disbelieved when attempting to relate the facticity of these experiences to others.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"/&gt;

Layton Schapira views the Cassandra [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] as resulting from a dysfunctional [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with what she calls the "[[Apollo archetype]]", an archetype which refers to any individual's or culture's pattern that is dedicated to, yet bound by, order, reason, intellect, truth and clarity that disavows itself of anything occult or irrational.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Layton Schapira, The Cassandra Complex: Living With Disbelief: A Modern Perspective on Hysteria p.10 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual specialization of this archetype creates emotional distance and can predispose relationships to a lack of emotional reciprocity and consequent dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"/&gt; She further states that a "Cassandra woman" is very prone to hysteria because she "feels attacked not only from the outside world but also from within, especially from the body in the form of somatic, often gynaecological, complaints."&lt;ref name="Layton_p65"&gt;Laurie Layton Schapira, ''The Cassandra Complex: Living With Disbelief: A Modern Perspective on Hysteria'' p.65 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the [[metaphor]]ical application of the [[Cassandra|Greek Cassandra myth]], Layton Schapira states that:
{{blockquote|What the Cassandra woman sees is something dark and painful that may not be apparent on the surface of things or that objective facts do not corroborate. She may envision a negative or unexpected outcome; or something which would be difficult to deal with; or a truth which others, especially authority figures, would not accept. In her frightened, ego-less state, the Cassandra woman may blurt out what she sees, perhaps with the unconscious hope that others might be able to make some sense of it. But to them her words sound meaningless, disconnected and blown out of all proportion.&lt;ref name="Layton_p65"/&gt;}}

===Jean Shinoda Bolen===

In 1989, [[Jean Shinoda Bolen]], Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the [[University of California]], published an essay on the god Apollo&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; in which she detailed a psychological profile of the "Cassandra woman" whom she suggested referred to someone suffering—as happened in the mythological relationship between Cassandra and Apollo—a dysfunctional relationship with an "Apollo man". Bolen added that the Cassandra woman may exhibit "hysterical" overtones, and may be disbelieved when attempting to share what she knows.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves pp. 130–160 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bolen, the archetypes of Cassandra and Apollo are not gender-specific. She states that "women often find that a particular [male] god exists in them as well, just as I found that when I spoke about goddesses men could identify a part of themselves with a specific goddess. Gods and goddesses represent different qualities in the human psyche. The pantheon of Greek deities together, male and female, exist as archetypes in us all&amp;nbsp;... There are gods and goddesses in every person."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' pp. x–xi (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

"As an archetype, Apollo personifies the aspect of the personality that wants clear definitions, is drawn to master a skill, values order and harmony, and prefers to look at the surface rather than at what underlies appearances. The Apollo archetype favors thinking over feeling, distance over closeness, objective assessment over subjective intuition."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' p.135 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Of what she describes as the negative Apollonic influence, Dr. Bolen writes:
{{blockquote|Individuals who resemble Apollo have difficulties that are related to emotional distance, such as communication problems, and the inability to be intimate&amp;nbsp;... Rapport with another person is hard for the Apollo man. He prefers to access (or judge) the situation or the person from a distance, not knowing that he must "get close up"—be vulnerable and empathic—in order to truly know someone else&amp;nbsp;... But if the woman wants a deeper, more personal relationship, then there are difficulties&amp;nbsp;... she may become increasingly irrational or hysterical.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"/&gt;}}
Bolen suggests that a Cassandra woman (or man) may become increasingly hysterical and irrational when in a dysfunctional relationship with a negative Apollo, and may experience others' disbelief when describing her experiences.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"/&gt;

==Corporate world==

Foreseeing potential future directions for a corporation or company is sometimes called "visioning".&lt;ref name="Davies1998"&gt;Davies, P., "The Cassandra Complex: how to avoid generating a corporate vision that no one buys into" pp. 103–123 in ''Success in Sight: Visioning'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet achieving a clear, shared vision in an organization is often difficult due to a lack of commitment to the new vision by some individuals in the organization, because it does not match reality as they see it. Those who support the new vision are termed "Cassandras"—able to see what is going to happen, but not believed.&lt;ref name="Davies1998"/&gt; Sometimes the name Cassandra is applied to those who can predict rises, falls, and particularly crashes on the global [[stock market]], as happened with [[Warren Buffett]], who repeatedly warned that the 1990s stock market surge was a bubble, attracting to him the title of "Wall Street Cassandra".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bear Book: Survive and Profit in Ferocious Markets'', p. 81 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Grove]], in his book ''Only The Paranoid Survive'', reminds the reader of the Helpful Cassandras that sense the winds of change before others and are critical to managing through Strategic Inflection Points.&lt;ref&gt; ''Only The Paranoid Survive'' (1999) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this is a primary source—we need another to establish notability --&gt;{{better source needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental movement==

Many environmentalists have predicted looming environmental catastrophes including [[climate change]], rise in sea levels, irreversible [[pollution]], and an impending collapse of [[ecosystem]]s, including those of [[rain forest|rainforests]] and [[ocean]] [[reef]]s.&lt;ref name="AtKisson, A. 1999"&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, [[Earthscan]] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though much of this has since come to pass, individuals sometimes acquire the label of 'Cassandras', whose warnings of impending environmental disaster are disbelieved or mocked.&lt;ref name="AtKisson, A. 1999"/&gt; [[Environmentalist]] [[Alan Atkisson]] wrote in 1999 that to understand that humanity is on a collision course with the laws of nature is to be stuck in what he calls the 'Cassandra dilemma' in which one can see the most likely outcome of current trends and can warn people about what is happening, but the vast majority cannot, or will not respond, and later if catastrophe occurs, they may even blame you, as if your prediction set the disaster in motion.&lt;ref&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, p.22 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally there may be a "successful" alert, though the succession of books, campaigns, organizations, and personalities that we think of as the environmental movement has more generally fallen toward the opposite side of this dilemma: a failure to "get through" to the people and avert disaster. In the words of Atkisson: "too often we watch helplessly, as Cassandra did, while the soldiers emerge from the Trojan horse just as foreseen and wreak their predicted havoc. Worse, Cassandra's dilemma has seemed to grow more inescapable even as the chorus of Cassandras has grown larger."&lt;ref&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, p.22 pp. 32–33 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==

There are examples of the Cassandra metaphor being applied in the contexts of [[medical science]],&lt;ref&gt;Web, S., Contemporary IMRT: Developing Physics and Clinical Implementation, p.357 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lantos, J.D., The Lazarus Case: Life-and-Death Issues in Neonatal Intensive Care, p.160 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; the media,&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, L., Digital Media: Transformations in Human Communication, p.157 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; to feminist perspectives on reality,&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, L., 'The Cassandra Complex', pp. 37–41 in Haring-Smith, T., New Monologues For Women By Women – Vol II (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delamotte, D., Women Imagine Change: A Global Anthology of Women's Resistance From 600 B.C.E. p.86 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, S., Angus, I., Orwell, G., My Country Right or Left p.378 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of the metaphor being used in popular music lyrics, such as the 1982 ABBA song "Cassandra",&lt;ref&gt;Atkisson, A., Cassandra's Lyre (song) on album Believing Cassandra 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[ABBA]]: 'Cassandra' recorded October 18, 1982 as the B-side of the single The Day Before You Came&lt;/ref&gt;  Emmy the Great's "Cassandra", and [[Star One (band)|Star One]]'s "Cassandra Complex". The five-part [[The Mars Volta]] song "Cassandra Gemini" may reference this syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;Fear Before the March of Flames, Taking Cassandra to the End of the World Party (song) on album The Always Open Mouth 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' or in [[Dead and Divine]]'s "Cassandra Syndrome". The Ohio band Curse of Cassandra is named after the metaphor.

There are also distinct parallels to Old Testament prophets such as Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Amos - prophets who called attention to the failure of those who thought of themselves as God's people to forsake meaningless sacrifices and devote themselves to caring for "orphans and widows in their distress." The prophets called their societies to thereby honor God and avoid social / political disasters. Their "prophecies" were not well-received; Jeremiah, for example, being thrown into a deep well as well as put in wooden stocks.

{{hatnote|This article concerns Chinese units of measurement as generally used in [[mainland China]]. For local modifications of it, see [[Taiwanese units|Taiwanese]], [[Hong Kong units|Hong Kong]], and [[Singaporean units of measurement]].}}

'''Chinese units of measurement''', known in Chinese as the '''''shìzhì''''' ("market system"), are the traditional [[units of measurement]] of the [[Han Chinese]]. Although [[Chinese numerals]] have been [[decimal]] (base-10) since the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], several Chinese measures use [[hexadecimal]] (base-16). Local applications have varied, but the [[Chinese dynasties]] usually proclaimed standard measurements and recorded their predecessor's systems in [[Chinese dynastic histories|their histories]]. 

In the present day, the [[People's Republic of China]] maintains some customary units based upon the market units but standardized to round values in the [[metric system]], for example the common ''jin'' or [[catty (unit)|catty]] of exactly 500{{nbsp}}[[gram (unit)|g]]. The Chinese name for most metric units is based on that of the closest traditional unit; when confusion might arise, the word "market" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|市}}}}, ''shì'') is used to specify the traditional unit and "common" or "public" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|公}}}}, ''gōng'') is used for the metric value. [[Taiwan]], like [[Korean units|Korea]], saw [[Taiwanese units of measurement|its traditional units]] standardized to [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese values]] and their conversion to a metric basis, such as the Taiwanese ''[[ping (unit)|ping]]'' of about 3.306{{nbsp}}m² based on the square ''[[Ken (unit)|ken]]''. The [[Hong Kong SAR]] continues to use [[Hong Kong units of measurement|its traditional units]], now legally defined based on a local equation with metric units. For instance, the Hong Kong catty is precisely 604.78982{{nbsp}}g.

Note: The names ''lí'' ({{lang|zh|厘}}) and ''fēn'' ({{lang|zh|分}}) for small units are the same for length, area, and mass; however, they refer to different kinds of measurements.

==History==
[[File:Bronze ruler. Han Dynasty 206 BCE to CE 220. Excavated in Zichang County. Shaanxi History Museum, Xi'an.jpg|thumb|Bronze ruler from the Han Dynasty (206 BCE to CE 220); excavated in [[Zichang County]]; [[Shaanxi History Museum]], [[Xi'an]]]]
{{History of science and technology in China}}
According to the ''[[Liji]]'', the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] created the first measurement units. The ''[[Xiao Erya]]'' and the ''[[Kongzi Jiayu]]'' state that length units were derived from the human body. According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', these human body units caused inconsistency, and [[Yu the Great]], another legendary figure, unified the length measurements. [[Ruler]]s with decimal units have been unearthed from [[Shang Dynasty]] tombs.

In the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the king conferred nobles with powers of the state and the measurement units began to be inconsistent from state to state. After the [[Warring States period]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] unified China, and later standardized measurement units. In the [[Han Dynasty]], these measurements were still being used, and were documented systematically in the [[Book of Han]].

Astronomical instruments show little change of the length of chi in the following centuries, since the calendar needed to be consistent. It was not until the introduction of decimal units in the [[Ming Dynasty]] that the traditional system was revised.

===Republican Era===
{{see also|Taiwanese units of measurement}}
On 7 January 1915, the [[Beiyang Government]] promulgated a measurement law to use not only metric system as the standard but also a set of Chinese-style measurement.&lt;ref name="ROC1915"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/eng/detail.jsp?sysid=D1500002 |contribution=權度法 [''Quándù Fǎ''] |title=''政府公報 [''Zhèngfǔ Gōngbào'', ''Government Gazette'']'' |location=Beijing |volume=No. 957 |publisher=Office of the President |date=7 January 1915 |pp=85–94 }}. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 1929, the [[Nationalist Government]] adopted and promulgated ''The Weights and Measures Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawHistory.aspx?PCode=J0100052 |title=The Weights and Measures Act: Legislative History |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (Republic of China)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to adopt the [[metric system]] as the official standard and to limit the newer Chinese units of measurement ({{zh|c=市用制|p=shìyòngzhì|l=market-use system}}) to private sales and trade in Article 11, effective on 1 January 1930.&lt;ref name="ROC1930"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01926/0192618020200.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425025351/http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01926/0192618020200.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-04-25 |title=The Weights and Measures Act (1929) |publisher=[[Legislative Yuan]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
The [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] continued using the market system along with metric system, as decreed by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] on 25 June 1959, but 1 [[catty]] being 500 grams, would become divided into 10 (new) [[tael]]s, instead of 16 (old) taels, to be converted from [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|province to province]], while exempting [[Chinese herbology|Chinese prescription drugs]] from the conversion to prevent errors.&lt;ref name="PRC1959"&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2011-11/09/content_1988933.htm 1959 Gazette of the State Council of the People's Republic of China], [http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/shuju/1959/gwyb195916.pdf No. 180], pages 311 to 312&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 1984, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decreed the market system to remain acceptable till the end of 1990 and ordered the transition to the national legal measures by that time, but [[Agricultural land|farmland]] measures would be exempt from this mandatory [[metrication]] until further investigation and study.&lt;ref name="PRC1984"&gt;[http://www.yfzs.gov.cn/gb/info/LawData/gjf2001q/gwyfg/2003-07/10/1425371513.html Decree of the State Council Concerning the Use of Uniform Legal Measures in the Country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409152907/http://www.yfzs.gov.cn/gb/info/LawData/gjf2001q/gwyfg/2003-07/10/1425371513.html |date=2015-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{main|Hong Kong units of measurement}}
In 1976 the [[Hong Kong]] [[Metrication Ordinance]] allowed a gradual replacement of the system in favor of the [[International System of Units]] (SI) metric system.&lt;ref&gt;Yearbook HK. "[http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/1997/ch7/e7s.htm Yearbook]." ''Metrication.'' Retrieved on 26 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Weights and Measures Ordinance defines the metric, Imperial, and Chinese units.&lt;ref name="HK"&gt;[https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap68 Cap. 68 WEIGHTS AND MEASURES ORDINANCE]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, all three systems are legal for trade and are in widespread use.

===Macau===
On 24 August 1992, [[Macau]] published ''Law No. 14/92/M'' to order that Chinese units of measurement similar to those used in Hong Kong, [[Imperial units]], and [[United States customary units]] would be permissible for five years since the effective date of the Law, 1 January 1993, on the condition of indicating the corresponding SI values, then for three more years thereafter, Chinese, Imperial, and US units would be permissible as secondary to the SI.&lt;ref name="MO"&gt;''Law No. 14/92/M'' ({{zh icon}} {{lang|zh|[http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/92/34/lei14_cn.asp 第14/92/M號法律]}}; {{pt icon}} [http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/92/34/lei14.asp Lei n.º 14/92/M])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Length===

Traditional units of length include the ''[[chi (unit)|chi]]'' ({{lang|zh|尺}}), ''bu'' ({{lang|zh|步}}), and ''[[li (length)|li]]'' ({{lang|zh|里}}). The precise length of these units, and the ratios between these units, has varied over time. 1 ''bu'' has consisted of either 5 or 6 ''chi'', while 1 ''li'' has consisted of 300 or 360 ''bu''.

====Metric length units====
The Chinese word for [[metre]] is {{lang|zh|米}} ''mǐ''; this can take the [[Chinese numerals#SI prefixes|Chinese standard SI prefixes]] (for "kilo-", "centi-", etc.). A [[kilometre]], however, may also be called {{lang|zh|公里}} ''gōnglǐ'', i.e. a metric ''[[li (Chinese unit)|lǐ]]''.

In the engineering field, traditional units are rounded up to metric units.For example, the Chinese word {{lang|zh|丝}} sī is used to express 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm.

====Metric volume units====
In the case of volume, the market and metric ''shēng'' coincide, being equal to one litre as shown in the table. The [[Chinese numerals#SI prefixes|Chinese standard SI prefixes]] (for "milli-", "centi-", etc.) may be added to this word ''shēng''.

Units of volume can also be obtained from any standard unit of length using the prefix {{lang|zh|立方}} ''lìfāng'' ("cubic"), as in {{lang|zh|立方米}} ''lìfāng mǐ'' for a cubic metre.

'''Cognitive shifting''' is the mental process of ''consciously'' redirecting one's [[attention]] from one fixation to another. In contrast, if this process happened ''unconsciously'',  then it is referred to as [[task switching (psychology)|task switching]].  Both are forms of [[cognitive flexibility]].

In the general framework of [[cognitive therapy]] and awareness management, cognitive shifting refers to the conscious choice to take charge of one's mental habits—and redirect one's focus of attention in helpful, more successful directions. In the term's specific usage in corporate awareness methodology, cognitive shifting is a performance-oriented technique for refocusing attention in more alert, innovative, charismatic and empathic directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Head D, Bolton D, Hymas N |title=Deficit in cognitive shifting ability in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=929–37 |date=April 1989 |pmid=2720006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-3223(89)90272-2 |doi=10.1016/0006-3223(89)90272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins in cognitive therapy==
In [[cognitive therapy]], as developed by its founder [[Aaron T. Beck]] and others, a client is taught to shift his or her cognitive focus from one thought or mental fixation to a more positive, realistic focus—thus the descriptive origins of the term "cognitive shifting". In "third wave" ACT therapy as taught by [[Steven C. Hayes]] and his associates in the [[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] movement, cognitive shifting is employed not only to shift from negative to positive thoughts, but also to shift into a quiet state of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. Cognitive shifting is also employed quite dominantly in the meditative-health procedures of medical and stress-reduction researchers such as [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

Cognitive shifting has become a common term among [[psychotherapy|therapists]] especially on the West Coast, and more recently in discussions of mind management methodology. More recently the term, as noted above, has appeared regularly in medical and psychiatric journals etc.&lt;ref name=Sanz01/&gt;

==Examples of usage==
''In research'': The term has become fairly common in psychiatric research, used in the following manner: "Neuropsychological findings in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been explained in terms of '''reduced cognitive shifting ability''' as a result of low levels of frontal inhibitory activity."&lt;ref name=Sanz01&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanz M, Molina V, Martin-Loeches M, Calcedo A, Rubia FJ |title=Auditory P300 event related potential and serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients |journal=Psychiatry Res |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=75–81 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11223122 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1781(00)00250-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165-1781(00)00250-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In therapy'': In therapy (as in the work of Steven Hayes and associates), a client is taught first to identify and accept a negative thought or attitude, and then to allow the cognitive shifting process to re-direct attention away from the negative fixation, toward a chosen aim or goal that is more positive—thus the "accept and choose act" from whence comes the ACT therapy name. Cognitive studies of the elderly refer to "...Impaired cognitive shifting in Parkinsonian patients on anticholinergic therapy..." etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lanser MG, Berger HJ, Ellenbroek BA, Cools AR, Zitman FG |title=Perseveration in schizophrenia: failure to generate a plan and relationship with the psychomotor poverty subsyndrome |journal=Psychiatry Res |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=13–26 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12379447 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1781(02)00178-6 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165178102001786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Everyday usage'': Books such as ''The Way Of The Tiger'' by [[Lance Secretan]], and ''The Creative Manager'' by Peter Russell have shown how cognitive shifting principles apply to everyday life. Decades ago [[Rollo May]] taught the process of conscious choosing and cognitive shifting at Princeton in his psychology lectures. And in books such as ''The Emotional Brain'', [[Joseph LeDoux]] clarified the power of consciously shifting from a negative to a more positive emotional focus. In  [[John Selby (psychologist)|John Selby's]] writings, most notable in ''Quiet Your Mind'', the term appears frequently.

''In meditation'': Among the first references to the general mental process of focal shifting or cognitive shifting (the term cognitive is a relatively new term), the Hindu [[Upanishads]] are probably the first written documentation of the meditative process of redirecting one's focus of attention in particular disciplined directions. Cognitive shifting is the core process of all meditation, especially in [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] meditation but also in [[Zen]] meditation and even in [[Christian mysticism]] where the mind's attention is re-directed (or shifted) toward particular theologically-determined focal points. Recent books have spoken directly of cognitive shifting as a meditative procedure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Specific term roots==
In a recent NPR interview with Michael Toms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndbroadcasting.org/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=182/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234422/http://www.ndbroadcasting.org/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=182%2F |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere in his writings, John Selby attributes his initial introduction to the process of cognitive shifting to [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whom he considers his early spiritual teacher, and also to his training with Rollo May at Princeton. In the NPR interview, Selby says he is almost certain that he first heard the actual term from a lecture by the 1960s philosopher [[Alan Watts]] during his "Expanding Christianity" lectures at the [http://sfts.edu/ San Francisco Theological Seminary] in 1972.

==Focus phrase methodology==
The primary cognitive technology that is used for cognitive shifting is called "[[focus phrase]]" methodology. This term has emerged from the actual process in which cognitive shifting is encouraged or even provoked in a client or any other person. The person states clear intent through a specially-worded focus phrase—and then experiences the inner shift that the focus phrase elicits.

Another term sometimes used for focus phrases is "elicitor statements". In some methodologies focus phrases are said as a set of 4 to 7 statements, fairly quickly and to oneself. In other techniques a single focus phrase is held in the mind during a whole morning or day, and perhaps changed each new day during the week.

The '''cooperative eye hypothesis''' is a proposed explanation for the appearance of the [[human eye]]. It suggests that the eye's distinctive visible characteristics [[evolution|evolved]] to make it easier for [[human]]s to follow another's gaze while communicating or while working together on tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello, Brian Hare, Hagen Lehmann and Josep Call (2007). Reliance on head versus eyes in the gaze following of great apes and human infants: the cooperative eye hypothesis. ''Journal of Human Evolution'' 52: 314-320 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Than"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Than|first=Ker|title=Why eyes are so alluring|journal=Live Science|date=2006-11-07|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/061107_human_eyes.html|accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="campus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2007/01/dont-click-until-you-see-the-ffffff-of-their-eyes.aspx|title=Don't Click Until You See the #FFFFFF of Their Eyes|last=Calhoun|first=Terry|date=2007-01-25|publisher=Campus Technology|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in primate eyes==
Unlike other [[primate]]s, human beings have [[human eye|eye]]s with a distinct colour contrast between the white [[sclera]], the coloured [[iris (anatomy)|iris]], and the black [[pupil]]. This is due to a lack of [[pigment]] in the sclera. Other primates have pigmented sclerae that are brown or dark in colour. There is also a higher [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between [[human skin]], sclera, and irises. [[Human eye]]s are also larger in proportion to body size, and are longer horizontally. Among primates, humans are the only ones where the outline of the eye and the position of the iris can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name="Than" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cozolino&gt;{{cite book|last=Cozolino|first=Louis|title=The Neuroscience of Human Relationships|year=2006|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-70454-9|pages=447|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?id=9329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
[[File:Bonobo-Head.jpg|thumb|[[Bonobo]] with dark [[sclera]]]]
[[File:Gorilla-eyes.jpg|thumb|[[Gorilla]] eyes]]
The cooperative eye hypothesis was first proposed by H. Kobayashi and S. Khoshima in 2002&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, H. and S. Kohshima 2001. Unique morphology of the human eye and its adaptive meaning: comparative studies on external morphology of the primate eye. ''Journal of Human Evolution'' (40) (5): 419-435.&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently tested by [[Michael Tomasello]] and others at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in [[Germany]]. Researchers examined the effect of head and eye movement on changing gaze direction in humans and [[hominidae|great ape]]s. A human experimenter, observed by either a human [[infant]], a [[gorilla]], a [[bonobo]], or a [[chimpanzee]], did one of four actions:
*Tilted his head up while closing his eyes
*Looked at the ceiling with his eyes while keeping his head stationary
*Looked at the ceiling with his head and his eyes
*Looked straight ahead without moving his head or his eyes

The apes were most likely to follow the gaze of the experimenter when only his head moved. The infants followed the gaze more often when only the eyes moved.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello, Brian Hare, Hagen Lehmann and Josep Call (2007). Reliance on head versus eyes in the gaze following of great apes and human infants: the cooperative eye hypothesis. Journal of Human Evolution 52: 314-320 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Than" /&gt;

The results suggest that humans depend more on eye movements than head movements when trying to follow the gaze of another. Anthropologists not involved in the study have called the hypothesis plausible, noting that "human infants and children both infer cooperative intentions in others and display cooperative intentions themselves."&lt;ref name="Than" /&gt;

==Why did it evolve?==
Studies of great ape behavior show that they are good at cooperating in situations where there is no potential of deception, but behave egotistically in situations where there are motives for deception, suggesting that their "lack of cooperativeness" is not a lack of a cognitive ability at all, but rather a necessary adaptation to a society full of deception.{{fact|date=April 2018}} This suggests that human cooperativeness began when proto-humans began to successfully avoid competition, which is also supported by the fact that the oldest evidence of care for the long-term sick and disabled are from shortly after the first emigration of hominins out of Africa about 1.8 million years ago.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

==Other hypotheses==

The cooperative eye hypothesis is not the only one that has been proposed to explain the appearance of the human eye. Other hypotheses include the proposal that white sclerae are a sign of good health, useful in [[mating|mate selection]], or that eye visibility promotes [[altruism|altruistic]] behaviour by letting people know they are being watched. The Planck institute study noted that "these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and highly visible eyes may serve all of these functions."&lt;ref name="Than" /&gt;

'''De-anonymization''' is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to  the anonymous data source. The term became popular in 2006 when Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov entered a  hosted by Netflix, and applied their de-anonymization techniques to successfully identify Netflix data for a number of specific members.

More and more data are becoming publicly available over the Internet. These data are released after applying some anonymization techniques like removing  such as names, addresses and social security numbers to ensure the sources' privacy. This assurance of privacy allows the government to legally share limited data sets with third parties without requiring written permission. Such data has proved to be very valuable for researchers, particularly in health care. However, as the Netflix contest dramatically revealed so much of data is available, even after anonymization, that a specific individual’s identity could be re-discovered.

==Examples of de-anonymization==
*"Researchers at MIT and the , in Belgium, analyzed data on 1.5&amp;nbsp;million cellphone users in a small European country over a span of 15&amp;nbsp;months and found that just four points of reference, with fairly low spatial and temporal resolution, was enough to uniquely identify 95 percent of them. In other words, to extract the complete location information for a single person from an “anonymized” data set of more than a million people, all you would need to do is place him or her within a couple of hundred yards of a cellphone transmitter, sometime over the course of an hour, four times in one year. A few Twitter posts would probably provide all the information you needed, if they contained specific information about the person’s whereabouts."
*"Sharing sequencing data short tandem repeats on the Y chromosome and querying recreational genetic genealogy databases. It is shown that a combination of a surname with other types of metadata, such as age and state, can be used to identity of the person.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Deus ex machina''}}
[[File:Medea rappresentation (2009) 07.JPG|thumb|''Deus ex machina'' in classical theatre: Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', performed in 2009 in Syracuse, Italy]]

'''''Deus ex machina''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈdeʊs ɛks ˈmaː.kʰɪ.naː|lang}}: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|.|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|ɑː|k|iː|n|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|æ|k|ᵻ|n|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; plural: ''dei ex machina''; English ‘god from the machine’) is a [[plot device]] whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem in a story is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected and seemingly unlikely occurrence, typically so much as to seem contrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=deus ex machina | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=23 Apr 2018 | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/art/deus-ex-machina | title=Deus ex machina | website=Encyclopaedia Britannica | accessdate=23 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its function can be to resolve an otherwise irresolvable plot situation, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a [[happy ending]], or act as a comedic device.

==Origin of the expression==
''Deus ex machina'' is a Latin [[calque]] {{ety|gre|''ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός'' (apò mēkhanês theós)|god from the machine}}.&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest occurrences of the phrase is in fragment 227 of [[Menander]]: ἀπὸ μηχανῆϛ θεὸς ἐπεφάνηϛ "You are by your epiphany a veritable god from the machine", as quoted in ''The Woman Possessed with a Divinity'', as translated in ''Menander: The Principal Fragments'' (1921) by [[:de:Francis Greenleaf Allinson|Francis Greenleaf Allinson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined from the conventions of [[Greek tragedy]], where a machine is used to bring actors playing gods onto the stage. The machine could be either a crane (''[[mechane]]'') used to lower actors from above or a riser that brought actors up through a trapdoor. Preparation to pick up the actors was done behind the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skene]]''. The idea was introduced by [[Aeschylus]] and was used often to resolve the conflict and conclude the drama. Although the device is associated mostly with Greek tragedy, it also appeared in comedies.&lt;ref name="machine"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chondros |first1=Thomas G. |last2=Milidonis |first2=Kypros|last3=Vitzilaios |first3=George |last4=Vaitsis|first4=John |title="Deus-Ex-Machina" reconstruction in the Athens theater of Dionysus |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |date=September 2013 |volume=67 |pages=172–191 |doi=10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2013.04.010}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient examples===
[[Aeschylus]] used the device in his ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but it was with [[Euripides]] that it became an established stage machine. More than half of Euripides' extant [[tragedy|tragedies]] employ a ''deus ex machina'' in their resolution, and some critics claim that Euripides, not Aeschylus, invented it.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 72) and Walton (1984, 51).&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently cited example is Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', in which the ''deus ex machina'', a dragon-drawn chariot sent by the sun god, is used to convey his granddaughter [[Medea]], who has just committed murder and [[infanticide]], away from her husband [[Jason]] to the safety and civilization of Athens. In ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life in order to spare the life of her husband, Admetus. At the end, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from [[Thanatos|Death]], restoring her to life and to Admetus.

[[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' parodies Euripides' frequent use of the crane by making Euripides himself a character in the play and bringing him on stage by way of the ''mechane''.

The effect of the device on Greek audiences was a direct and immediate emotional response. Audiences would have a feeling of wonder and astonishment at the appearance of the gods, which would often add to the moral effect of the drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cunningham |first1=Maurice P.|title=Medea ΑΠΟ ΜΗΧΑΝΗΣ|journal=Classical Philology |date=July 1954 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=151–160 |jstor = 265931 |doi = 10.1086/363788 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern theatrical examples===
[[Shakespeare]] used the device in ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'', ''[[Cymbeline]]''  and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 70).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in John Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' where the author uses a character to break the action and rewrite the ending as a reprieve of the hanging of MacHeath. Both in Shakespeare's and Gay's plays the ''deus ex machina'' happens with breaking the dramatic illusion often in the form of an episodic narrator exposing the play itself and laying bare the author. This is different from the use of the ''deus ex machina'' in the ancient examples with the ending coming from a participant in the action in the form of a god. It is natural for the gods to be considered participants and not outside sources because of their privileged position and power. It is these attributes that allow the Greek gods to believably wrap up and solve the series of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Francis M|title=Tragedy's End : Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama: Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the politically turbulent 17th and 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries, the ''deus ex machina'' was sometimes used to make a controversial thesis more palatable to the powers of the day. For example, in the final scene of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Tartuffe]]'' the heroes are saved from a terrible fate by an agent of the compassionate, all-seeing [[Louis XIV|king]] — the same king that held Molière's career and livelihood in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/dfs_18/dfs_18_00023.html "Tartuffe: Novel Guide"]. 2003. Retrieved 2&amp;nbsp;November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot device==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to use a Greek term equivalent to the Latin phrase ''deus ex machina'' as a term to describe the technique as a device to resolve the plot of tragedies.&lt;ref name=machine /&gt; It is generally deemed undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. The reasons for this are that it does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic (although it is sometimes deliberately used to do this) and is often so unlikely that it challenges [[suspension of disbelief]], allowing the author to conclude the story with an unlikely, though perhaps more palatable, ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_D.html |title=Literary Terms and Definitions: D |author= Dr. L. Kip Wheeler |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
In H. G. Wells's ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', the Martians, who have destroyed everything in their path and apparently triumphed over humanity, are killed by bacteria.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Westfahl |editor1-first=Gary |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1 |date=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313329516 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SQMQQyIaACYC&amp;pg=PA195 195] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', the rescue of the savage children by a passing navy officer (which author [[William Golding]] called a "gimmick") is viewed by some critics as a ''deus ex machina''. The abrupt ending conveys the terrible fate that would have afflicted the children (in particular Ralph) if the officer had not arrived at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=William Golding's Lord of the Flies |editor-last=Bloom |editor-first=Harold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1ZJcFqQ7V8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Lord+of+the+Flies,+deus+ex+machina |pages=67–68 |chapter=Grief, grief, grief: ''Lord of the Flies'' |first=Lawrence S. |last=Friedman |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] referred to the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] that appear in several places in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as "a dangerous 'machine'."&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, letter 210 as quoted [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eagles here]&lt;/ref&gt;. This was in a letter refusing permission to a film adapter to have the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] transported by eagles rather than traveling on foot. He felt that the eagles had already been overused as a plot device. For example, in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the eagles save [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Gandalf]], and the dwarves from the goblins and wargs, then help turn the tide of the [[Battle of the Five Armies]], and in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' they save [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] from certain death on Mount Doom. In the [[Harvard Lampoon]]'s parody [[Bored of the Rings]], the eagles are referred to as 'Deus ex Machina Airlines.'

''Deus ex machina'' was also used by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', when in the very peak of climax, Rose Maylie turns out to be the long-lost sister of Agnes, and therefore Oliver's aunt; and she marries her long-time sweetheart Harry, allowing Oliver to live happily with his saviour, Mr. Brownlow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |editor-last=Abrams |editor-first=MH |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/glossary-of-literary-terms-m-h-abrams/1100175018?ean=9780495898023 |pages=44–45 |publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, USA |year=1993 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The ''deus ex machina'' device has many criticisms attached to it, mainly referring to it as inartistic, too convenient, and overly simplistic. On the other hand, champions of the device say that it opens up ideological and artistic possibilities.&lt;ref name="ghosts"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breton |first1=Rob |title=Ghosts in the Machina: Plotting in Chartist and Working-Class Fiction |journal=Victorian Studies |date=Summer 2005 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=557–575 |doi=10.1353/vic.2006.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient criticism===
[[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]] was one of the device's earliest critics. Antiphanes believed that the use of the ''deus ex machina'' was a sign that the playwright was unable to properly manage the complications of his plot. 
{{quote|when they don't know what to say

and have completely given up on the play

just like a finger they lift the machine

and the spectators are satisfied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Handley |first1=Miriam |title=Shaw's response to the deus ex machina: From the Quintessence of Ibsenism to ''Heartbreak House'' |publisher=Theatre: Ancient &amp; Modern, January 1999 Conference |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another critical reference to the device can be found in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', 425d, though it is made in the context of an argument unrelated to drama.

[[Aristotle]] criticized the device in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play:&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 20)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In the characters too, exactly as in the structure of the incidents, [the poet] ought always to seek what is either necessary or probable, so that it is either necessary or probable that a person of such-and-such a sort say or do things of the same sort, and it is either necessary or probable that this [incident] happen after that one. It is obvious that the solutions of plots too should come about as a result of the plot itself, and not from a contrivance, as in the ''Medea'' and in the passage about sailing home in the ''[[Iliad]]''. A contrivance must be used for matters outside the drama — either previous events which are beyond human knowledge, or later ones that need to be foretold or announced. For we grant that the gods can see everything. There should be nothing improbable in the incidents; otherwise, it should be outside the tragedy, e.g., that in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]''. |''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' |(1454a33–1454b9) }}

Aristotle praised Euripides, however, for generally ending his plays with bad fortune, which he viewed as correct in tragedy, and somewhat excused the intervention of a deity by suggesting that "astonishment" should be sought in tragic drama:&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'' 11.5, Penguin (1996, 45).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Irrationalities should be referred to what people say: That is one solution, and also sometimes that it is not irrational, since it is probable that improbable things will happen.}}

Such a device was referred to by [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (lines 191–2), where he instructs poets that they should never resort to a "god from the machine" to resolve their plots "unless a difficulty worthy of a god's unraveling should happen" [''nec deus intersit, nisi dignus uindice nodus inciderit; nec quarta loqui persona laboret''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/essay/237830?page=3 |title=Ars Poetica by Horace |date=21 September 2017 |website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern criticism===
Following Aristotle, Renaissance critics continued to view the ''deus ex machina'' as an inept plot device, although it continued to be employed by Renaissance dramatists.

Towards the end of the 19th century, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized [[Euripides]] for making tragedy an optimistic [[genre]] via use of the device, and was highly skeptical of the "Greek cheerfulness", prompting what he viewed as the plays' "blissful delight in life".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''deus ex machina'' as Nietzsche saw it was symptomatic of [[Socrates|Socratic]] culture, which valued knowledge over [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysiac]] music and ultimately caused the death of tragedy:&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 84–86).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| But the new non-Dionysiac spirit is most clearly apparent in the ''endings'' of the new dramas. At the end of the old tragedies there was a sense of metaphysical conciliation without which it is impossible to imagine our taking delight in tragedy; perhaps the conciliatory tones from another world echo most purely in ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. Now, once tragedy had lost the genius of music, tragedy in the strictest sense was dead: for where was that metaphysical consolation now to be found? Hence an earthly resolution for tragic dissonance was sought; the hero, having been adequately tormented by fate, won his well-earned reward in a stately marriage and tokens of divine honour. The hero had become a gladiator, granted freedom once he had been satisfactorily flayed and scarred. Metaphysical consolation had been ousted by the ''deus ex machina''.|Friedrich Nietzsche}}
Nietzsche argued that the ''deus ex machina'' creates a false sense of consolation that ought not to be sought in phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 80).&lt;/ref&gt; His denigration of the plot device has prevailed in critical opinion.
 
In [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]]'s publication ''Euripides the Rationalist'' (1895), he surveyed and recorded other late 19th century responses to the device. He recorded that some of the critical responses to the term referred to it as 'burlesque', 'coup de théâtre', and 'catastrophe'. Verrall notes that critics have a dismissive response to authors who deploy the device in their writings. He comes to the conclusion that critics feel that the ''deus ex machina'' is evidence of the author's attempt to ruin the whole of his work and prevent anyone from putting any importance on his work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, other scholars have looked at Euripides' use of ''deus ex machina'' and described its use as an integral part of the plot designed for a specific purpose. Often Euripides' plays would begin with gods, so it is argued that it would be natural for the gods to finish the action. The conflict throughout Euripides' plays would be caused by the meddling of the gods and therefore would make sense to both the playwright and the audience of the time that the gods would resolve all conflict that they began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abel |first1=D. Herbert |title=Euripides' Deus ex Machina: Fault or Excellence |journal=The Classical Journal |date=December 1954 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=127–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of Euripides' eighteen extant plays end with the use of ''deus ex machina'', therefore it was not simply a device to relieve the playwright of the embarrassment of a confusing plot ending. This device enabled him to bring about a natural and more dignified dramatic and tragic ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flickinger |first1=Roy Caston |title=The Greek Theatre and its Drama |date=1926 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other champions of the device believe that it can be a spectacular agent of subversion. It can be used to undercut generic conventions and challenge cultural assumptions and the privileged role of tragedy as a literary/theatrical model.&lt;ref name=ghosts /&gt;

Some 20th-century revisionist criticism suggests that ''deus ex machina'' cannot be viewed in these simplified terms, and contends that the device allows mortals to "probe" their relationship with the divine.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71"&gt;Rehm (1992, 71).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rush Rehm]] in particular cites examples of Greek tragedy in which the ''deus ex machina'' complicates the lives and attitudes of characters confronted by the deity, while simultaneously bringing the drama home to its audience.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71" /&gt; Sometimes, the unlikeliness of the ''deus ex machina'' plot device is employed deliberately. For example, comic effect is created in a scene in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' when Brian, who lives in [[Judea]] at the time of [[Christ]], is saved from a high fall by a passing [[ancient astronauts|alien space ship]].&lt;ref&gt;James Berardinelli, James.

'''Eliminationism''' is the belief that one's political opponents are "a [[cancer]] on the body politic that must be excised—either by separation from the public at large, through [[censorship]] or by outright [[mass murder|extermination]]—in order to protect the purity of the nation".&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"&gt;{{cite paper| last = Bernard | first = Phyllis E. | title = Eliminationist Discourse In A Conflicted Society: Lessons For America From Africa? | date = June 12, 2009 | url = http://epublications.marquette.edu/mulr/vol93/iss1/12/ |accessdate = 2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''eliminationism'' was coined by American political scientist [[Daniel Goldhagen]] in his 1996 book ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners]]'' in which he posits that ordinary [[Germans]] not only knew about, but also supported, the [[Holocaust]] because of a unique and virulent "eliminationist antisemitism" in the German identity, which had developed in the preceding centuries.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt;

==Effects==
In his 2009 book ''Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism, and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity'', Goldhagen argues that eliminationism is the root cause of every [[mass murder]] perpetrated in the 20th and 21st centuries, including:&lt;ref name="Gray 2009"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Gray, John | title = Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity By Daniel Jonah Goldhagen | date = 4 February 2010 | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/02/genocide-goldhagen-mass | accessdate = 2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Operation Condor]] in [[Latin America]] (1973–1985)

American journalist [[David Neiwert]] argued in 2009 that eliminationist rhetoric is becoming increasingly mainstream within the [[Conservatism in the United States|American right wing]], fueled in large part by the extremist discourse found on conservative [[blog]]s and [[talk radio]], which may provoke a resurgence of [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Holland 2009"&gt;{{cite paper|author=Holland, Joshua |title=The Terrorist Threat: Right-Wing Radicals and the Eliminationist Mindset |date=12 June 2009 |url=http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723075225/http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |archivedate=2009-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American professor of law Phyllis E. Bernard argues that interventions in [[Rwanda]] and [[Nigeria]], which adapted American dispute prevention and [[dispute resolution|resolution]] methods to African media and dispute resolution traditions, may provide a better fit and forum for the U.S. to address eliminationist media messages and their impact on society.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt;

[[Theodore N. Kaufman]] self-published ''[[Germany Must Perish!]]'' in the United States in 1941. In the 104-page book, Kaufman advocated genocide through [[forced sterilization]] of all [[Germans]] and the territorial disassociation of [[Germany]]. The obscure book received very little attention in the US, but was eventually cited by the [[Nazi]] regime as proof of a vast [[Jew]]ish [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|conspiracy]] to annihilate Germany and Germans (Kaufman was a Jew). The Nazis published quotes from the book in wartime [[propaganda]], pretending that the book was indicative of the views of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], which in turn was added justification for Nazi Germany's continued persecution of the Jews as part of the [[Holocaust]].

During the 1991–2002 [[Algerian Civil War]] the predominant faction of the conflict's first phase was known as ''[[les éradicateurs]]'' for their ideology and for their rural and urban tactics. These hardliners were opposed in the [[People's National Army (Algeria)|Army]] and the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] by ''[[les dialoguistes]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1526">A '''feud letter''' ({{lang-de|Fehdebrief}} or ''Absagebrief'') was a [[document]] in which a [[feud]] was announced – usually with few words - in medieval Europe. The letter had to be issued three days in advance in order to be legally valid.

So that the feud did not became a case of [[murder]] and thus become punishable by law, those involved had to abide by the following rules:

# The feud, whether between [[knight]]s or between the [[nobility]] and towns, had to be initiated by a formal feud letter
# The killing of innocent parties was forbidden
# The razing of houses and laying waste to the land was allowed
# During the feud, fighting was not permitted in churches or in the home, and the parties were to be allowed go to and return from church or court without being molested.

== Examples ==
* Around 1444, the town of [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] declared war on the [[Archbishop]] of [[Cologne]] at the start of the [[Soest Feud]] with the following famous, brief feud letter:

''"Wettet, biscop Dierich van Moeres, dat wy den vesten Junker Johan can Cleve lever hebbet alls Juwe, unde wert Juwe hiermit affgesaget"''&lt;br&gt;(''"Know this, Bishop Dietrich of Moers, that we prefer the steadfast [[Junker]], John of Cleves, to you, and hereby give you notice thereof."'')

{{Mesopotamian myth (7)}}
The concept of a '''Garden of the gods''' or a '''divine paradise''' might be of [[Sumer]]ian origin, or so it is argued by [[Samuel Noah Kramer]].&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"&gt;{{cite book| first=Samuel Noah| last=Kramer| title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&amp;pg=PA293| accessdate=14 June 2011| year=1964| publisher=University of Chicago Press| isbn=978-0-226-45238-8| page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of this home of the immortals was later handed down to the [[Babylonia]]ns who conquered Sumer.&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"/&gt;

==Location==

=== ''Persian Gulf'' ===
A Sumerian paradise is usually associated with the [[Dilmun civilization]] of [[Eastern Arabia]]. [[Sir Henry Rawlinson]] first suggested the geographical location of Dilmun was in Bahrain in 1880.&lt;ref name="Şengör2003"&gt;{{cite book| first=A. M.| last=Celâl Şengör| title=The Large-wavelength Deformations of the Lithosphere: Materials for a History of the Evolution of Thought from the Earliest Times to Plate Tectonics| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-He_prc5ybUC&amp;pg=PA32| accessdate=16 June 2011| year=2003| publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]| isbn=978-0-8137-1196-6| page=32| location=[[Boulder, Colorado]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This  theory was later  promoted by Frederich Delitzsch in his book ''Wo lag das Paradies'' in 1881, suggesting that it was at the head of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="Delitzsch1881"&gt;{{cite book| first=Friedrich| last=Delitzsch| title=Wo lag das Paradies?: eine biblisch-assyriologische Studie: mit zahlreichen assyriologischen Beiträgen zur biblischen Länder- und Völkerkunde und einer Karte Babyloniens|trans-title=Where was Paradise?: A Scriptural-Assyrian Study of the Several Assyrian Contributions to Biblical Countries and Ethnography with a Map of Babylon| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhkYAAAAYAAJ| accessdate=16 June 2011| year=1881| publisher=J.C. Hinrichs'sche Buchhandlung}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other theories have been put forward on this theme. Dilmun is first mentioned in association with [[Kur]] (mountain) and this is particularly problematic as Bahrain is very flat, having a highest prominence of only {{convert|134|m|ft}} elevation.&lt;ref name="Şengör2003"/&gt; Also, in the early epic ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]'', the construction of the [[ziggurat]]s in [[Uruk]] and [[Eridu]] are described as taking place in a world "before Dilmun had yet been settled". In 1987, Theresa Howard-Carter realized that the locations in this area possess no archaeological evidence of a settlement dating 3300-2300 BC. She proposed that Dilmun could have existed in different eras and the one of this era might be a still unidentified tell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Theresa |last=Howard-Carter |title=Dilmun: At Sea or Not at Sea?

In tablet nine of the standard version of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], [[Gilgamesh]] travels to the garden of the gods through the [[Cedar Forest]] and the depths of [[Mashu]], a comparable location in Sumerian version is the "Mountain of cedar-felling".&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.5# Gilgameš and Ḫuwawa (Version A) - Translation, Lines 9A &amp; 12, kur-jicerin-kud]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KlugerKluger1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maier1997"&gt;{{cite book| first=John R.| last=Maier| title=Gilgamesh: a reader| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Ok5WbdWi3QC&amp;pg=PA144| accessdate=22 June 2011| year=1997| publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers| isbn=978-0-86516-339-3| page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little description remains of the "jewelled garden" of Gilgamesh because twenty four lines of the myth were damaged and could not be translated at that point in the text.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Armesto2004"&gt;{{cite book| first=Felipe| last=Fernández-Armesto| title=World of Myths| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEXXAAAAMAAJ| accessdate=24 June 2011| date=1 June 2004| publisher=University of Texas Press| isbn=978-0-292-70607-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The name of the mountain is Mashu. As he arrives at the mountain of Mashu, Which every day keeps watch over the rising and setting of the sun, Whose peakes reach as high as the "banks of heaven," and whose breast reaches down to the netherworld, The [[Scorpion man|scorpion-people]] keep watch at its gate.&lt;ref name="KlugerKluger1991"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Rivkah Schärf| last1=Kluger| first2=H.

Bohl has highlighted that the word ''Mashu'' in Sumerian means "twins". Jensen and Zimmern thought it to be the geographical location between [[Mount Lebanon]] and [[Mount Hermon]] in the [[Anti-Lebanon]] range.&lt;ref name="KlugerKluger1991"/&gt; [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] and [[Peter Kyle McCarter]] have suggested that the garden of the gods relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges.&lt;ref name="Lipinski"&gt;Lipinski, Edward.

The location of garden of the gods is close to the forest, which is described in the line:

=== ''Eridu'' ===
[[File:Eridu mound4c.8.png|thumb|Tell mound at Eridu with temple dedicated to the gods]]
[[Theophilus Pinches]] suggested in 1908 that [[Eridu]] was the  Sumerian paradise calling it "not the earthly city of that name, but a city conceived as lying also "within the Abyss", containing a tree of life fed by the [[Euphrates]] river.&lt;ref name="Pinches2005"&gt;{{cite book| first=Theophilus| last=Pinches| title=The Old Testament in the Light of the Historical Records and Legends of Assyria and Babylonia| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBHqzLyjdxgC| accessdate=16 June 2011| date=January 2005| publisher=Kessinger Publishing| isbn=978-1-4179-7413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinches noted "it was represented as a place to which access was forbidden, for 'no man entered its midst', as in the case of the garden of Eden after the fall." In a myth called the ''Incantation of Eridu'', it is described as having a "glorious fountain of the abyss", a "house of wisdom", sacred grove and a ''kiskanu''-tree with the appearance of lapis-lazuli.&lt;ref name="Fischer2008"&gt;{{cite book| first=Richard James| last=Fischer| title=Historical Genesis: from Adam to Abraham| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4qX0bQs0eEYC&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=16 June 2011|date=30 December 2008|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-3806-7|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuʼād Safar also found the remains of a canal running through Eridu in [[archaeological]] excavations of 1948 to 1949.&lt;ref name="SafarMuṣṭafá1981"&gt;{{cite book| first=Fuʼād| last=Safar| title=Eridu, Sumer 6, 28, 1950| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLttAAAAMAAJ| accessdate=19 June 2011| year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Foxwell Albright]] noted that "Eridu is employed as a name of the [[Abzu]], just as Kutu ([[Kutha]]), the city of [[Nergal]], is a common name of Aralu" highlighting the problems in translation where several places were called the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/528616 Albright, W. F., The Mouth of the Rivers, The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, Vol. 35, No. 4 (Jul., 1919), pp. 161-195]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Jeremias]] suggested that Aralu was the same as [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]] in the [[West Bank]] and signified both the mountain of the gods and a place of desolation.&lt;ref name="Jeremias1887"&gt;{{cite book| first=Alfred| last=Jeremias| title=Die babylonisch-assyriscen Vorstellungen vom Leben nach dem Tode: nach den Quellen mit Berücksichtigung der altestamentlichen Parallelen dargestellt| pages=121–123| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nqAHAAACAAJ| accessdate=18 June 2011| year=1887| publisher=Hinrichs'sche Buchandlung|trans-title=The Babylonian-Assyrian Ideas About Life After Death: Presented According to the Sources with Consideration to Old Testament Parallels}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the word [[Ekur]], this has suggested that ideas associated with the netherworld came from a mountainous country outside of Babylonia.&lt;ref name="Hastings2001"&gt;{{cite book| author=James Hastings| title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NyzDrkPG2nIC&amp;pg=PA437| accessdate=17 June 2011| date=15 October 2001| publisher=Elibron.com| isbn=978-1-4021-9433-7| page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Nippur'' ===

The myth of [[Enlil and Ninlil]] opens with a description of the city of [[Nippur]], its [[wall]]s, [[river]], [[canal]]s and [[water well|well]], portrayed as the home of the gods and, according to Kramer "that seems to be conceived as having existed before the creation of man." [[Andrew R. George]] suggests "Nippur was a city inhabited by gods not men, and this would suggest that it had existed from the very beginning." He discusses Nippur as the "first city" ([[URU (cuneiform)|uru]]-sag, ''"City-top (head)") of Sumer.&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book| first=A.

George also noted that a [[ritual]] garden was re-created in the "Grand Garden of [[Nippur]], most probably a sacred garden in the [[E-kur]] (or Dur-an-[[ki (cuneiform)|ki]]) temple complex, is described in a cult-song of Enlil as a "garden of heavenly joy".&lt;ref name="George1992"/&gt; Temples in [[Mesopotamia]] were also known to have adorned their [[ziggurat]]s with a sanctuary and [[sacred grove]] of trees, reminiscent of the [[Hanging gardens of Babylon]].&lt;ref name="DelumeauO'Connell2000"/&gt;

==Mythology==

=== ''Kesh temple hymn'' ===

In the ''[[Kesh temple hymn]]'', the first recorded description (c. 2600 BC) of a domain of the gods is described as being the color of a garden: "The four corners of heaven became green for Enlil like a garden."&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt; In an earlier translation of this myth by [[George Aaron Barton]] in ''[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]'' he considered it to read "In [[hursag]] the garden of the gods was green."&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book| first=George Aaron| last=Barton| title=Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions| page=52| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ| accessdate=23 May 2011| year=1918| publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Debate between sheep and grain'' ===

Another Sumerian [[creation myth]], the ''[[Debate between sheep and grain]]'' opens with a location "the hill of heaven and earth", and describes various agricultural developments in a pastoral setting. This is discussed by [[Edward Chiera]] as "not a poetical name for the earth, but the dwelling place of the gods, situated at the point where the heavens rest upon the earth. It is there that mankind had their first habitat, and there the Babylonian [[Garden of Eden]] is to be placed."&lt;ref name="Chieraottoman1924"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Edward| last1=Chiera| author2=Constantinople Musée Impérial Ottoman| title=Sumerian Religious Texts| page=26| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BF3QgAACAAJ| accessdate=23 May 2011| year=1924| publisher=University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerian word [[Edin (Sumerian term)|Edin]], means "steppe" or "plain",&lt;ref name="ThomasmaWeisstub2004"&gt;{{cite book| first1=David C.| last1=Thomasma| first2=David N.| last2=Weisstub| title=The Variables of Moral Capacity| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1j0AfVUQfKEC&amp;pg=PA110| accessdate=16 June 2011| year=2004| publisher=Springer| isbn=978-1-4020-2551-8| page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; so modern scholarship has abandoned the use of the phrase "Babylonian Garden of Eden" as it has become clear the "Garden of Eden" was a later concept.

=== Epic of Gilgamesh ===

The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' describes [[Gilgamesh]] travelling to a wondrous garden of the gods that is the source of a river, next to a mountain covered in cedars, and references a "[[Tree of life|plant of life]]". In the myth, paradise is identified as the place where the deified Sumerian hero of the flood, [[Utnapishtim]] ([[Ziusudra]]), was taken by the gods to live forever. Once in the garden of the gods, Gilgamesh finds all sorts of precious stones, similar to {{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:12|HE}}:

{{quote|text=There was a garden of the gods: all round him stood bushes bearing gems ... fruit of [[carnelian]] with the [[vine]] hanging from it, beautiful to look at; [[lapis lazuli]] leaves hung thick with fruit, sweet to see ... rare stones, [[agate]] and [[pearl]]s from out the sea.&lt;ref name="Sharpes2005"&gt;{{cite book| first=Donald K.| last=Sharpes| title=Lords of the Scrolls: Literary Traditions in the Bible and Gospels| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39fw6f689GgC&amp;pg=PA90| accessdate=16 June 2011| date=15 August 2005| publisher=Peter Lang| isbn=978-0-8204-7849-4| page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Enki and Ninhursag ===

The myth of ''[[Enki and Ninhursag]]'' also describes the Sumerian paradise as a garden, which [[Enki]] obtains water from [[Utu]] to [[irrigate]].&lt;ref name="DelumeauO'Connell2000"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Jean| last1=Delumeau| first2=Matthew| last2=O'Connell| title=History of Paradise: the Garden of Eden in Myth and Tradition| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubJDLvEV0vEC&amp;pg=PA5| accessdate=15 June 2011| date=20 April 2000| publisher=University of Illinois Press| isbn=978-0-252-06880-5| page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Song of the hoe ===

The ''[[song of the hoe]]'' features [[Enlil]] creating mankind with a hoe and the [[Anunnaki]] spreading outward from the original garden of the gods. It also mentions the Abzu being built in Eridu.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;

=== Hymn to Enlil ===

A ''[[Hymn to Enlil]]'' praises the leader of the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian pantheon]] in the following terms:

{{quote|text=You founded it in the [[Dur-an-ki]], in the middle of the four quarters of the earth. Its soil is the life of the Land, and the life of all the foreign countries. Its brickwork is red gold, its foundation is [[lapis lazuli]]. You made it glisten on high.&lt;ref name="Hess1999"&gt;{{cite book| first=Richard S.| last=Hess| title=Zion, city of our God| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lk_xLfQ_SRAC&amp;pg=PA100| accessdate=14 June 2011| date=June 1999| publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing| isbn=978-0-8028-4426-2| page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Later usage==

The word for [[Paradise garden]] in much later [[Persian language|Persian]] literature is ''apiri-Daeza'', meaning "garden" or "walled enclosure" or "[[orchard]]".&lt;ref name="GarryEl-Shamy2005"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Jane| last1=Garry| first2=Hasan M.| last2=El-Shamy| title=Archetypes and motifs in folklore and literature: a handbook| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cn6pWMverBIC&amp;pg=PA198| accessdate=14 June 2011| year=2005| publisher=M.E. Sharpe| isbn=978-0-7656-1260-1| page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for paradise or garden in the [[Qur'an]] is [[Jannah]] which literally means "concealed place". Two watercourses are supposed to flow underneath the jannah where large trees are described, mountains made of [[musk]], between which rivers flow in valleys of [[pearl]] and [[ruby]].&lt;ref name="EOI-j"&gt;"Jannah", [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online&lt;/ref&gt; Features of this garden of paradise are told in a [[parable]] in the {{Quran-usc|47|15|e=15|s=ns}}.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2002"&gt;{{cite book| first=Brannon M.| last=Wheeler| title=Moses in the Quran and Islamic exegesis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0an1HJE67MC&amp;pg=PA122| accessdate=15 June 2011| date=28 October 2002| publisher=Psychology Press| isbn=978-0-7007-1603-6| page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic garden]]s can further divide the watercourses into four, meeting at a spring and including a sanctuary for shade and rest.&lt;ref name="MacWeeneyNess2002"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Alen| last1=MacWeeney| author2=Caro Ness| title=A Space for Silence| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2PTw2GHchkAC&amp;pg=PA137| accessdate=15 June 2011| date=June 2002| publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd| isbn=978-0-7112-1656-3|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'BrienAllhoff2011"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Dan| last1=O'Brien| author2=Fritz Allhoff| author3=David E.

In myths of the [[Greater Iran]]ian culture and tradition, [[Jamshid]] is described as saving the world by building a magical garden on top of a mountain. This garden also features a tree of life and is the source of a river that brings fertility to the land. Jamshid is warned by [[Ahura Mazda]] about a freezing winter approaching and so creates this enclosure to protect the seeds of life when a climatic catastrophe strikes.&lt;ref name="Schomp2009"&gt;{{cite book| first=Virginia| last=Schomp| title=The Ancient Persians| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U21j7vDhCCIC&amp;pg=PA51| accessdate=15 June 2011| date=September 2009| publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-4218-9| page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grinberg Method''' is described as "a structured way of teaching through the body".&lt;ref name=Grinbass&gt;{{cite web|last=Grinberg|first=Avi|title=About the Grinberg Method|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/about-us.asp|publisher=International Association of GM Practitioners|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on [[process of embodiment (physical theatre)|body attention]], [[perception]] and the individual's direct personal experience. The goal is for people to learn to be attentive to themselves and their surroundings, and stop automatic limiting [[habit (psychology)|habits]] in order to increase their ability to recuperate, attain personal goals and [[well-being]]. The method was developed in the early 1980s by Avi Grinberg.&lt;ref name="Jewish Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Afra|first=Orit|title=Mind, body and sole|journal=Jewish Journal|date=2011-06-28|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/health/article/mind_body_and_sole_20110628|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The Grinberg Method was developed by Avi Grinberg, who claimed that people lacked the ability to use their natural capacity for self-healing and to prevent conditions that diminish their quality of life.&lt;ref name="about the founder"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the founder|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/about-the-founder.asp|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described his observations and reasoning in the book ''Fear, Pain and Some Other Friends''.&lt;ref name="about the founder" /&gt;

== Concepts of the method ==

=== Shifting attention from mind to body ===
His method focuses on body attention based on the view that life is experienced by the body - people's thoughts, actions, feelings and sensations are all expressed in and through the body.&lt;ref&gt;"The body gets specific emphasis because it is seen as the place and medium of all experience. The human being is anchored in the body and is in fact identical with it. Any experience is inseparable from the body, any mental or emotional process has physical correlates...". {{cite book|last=Viermann|first=Birte|title=Evaluation of treatments for the Neck and Shoulders according to the Grinberg Method - Effects of a Body-Oriented Method with a Pedagogic Approach|year=2003|publisher=University of Bielfeld, Germany|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body attention, on his view, is non-verbal and is the experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grinberg|first=Avi|title=Fear, Pain and some other friends|year=1994|publisher=Astrolog|location=Hod Hasharon|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his  method, uninterrupted, the body will display the natural, inherent inclination to take care of itself, heal, adapt to an ever-changing reality, develop and be fulfilled, thus constantly aiming to reach closer to a state of [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|well-being]].&lt;ref name="Lowen, M.D. 1980 42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowen, M.D.|first=Alexander|title=Fear of Life - A Therapy for Being|year=1980|publisher=Bioenergetics Press|location=USA|isbn=0-9743737-0-2|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stopping patterns of behavior ===
The methodology consists of noticing and clarifying what is happening routinely and "then having the willingness and ability to stop it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic concepts|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/basic-concepts.asp|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method focuses on a recurring reaction and pattern of behavior of the individual in relation to a routine situation which one wants to alter, maintaining that what a person can really control and be responsible for, is his own reaction. ''Stopping'' is a physical act done with body attention, will and choice, to discontinue the part of the experience that one can perceive and control. For example: a person is scared while studying for an exam and reacts with shallow breathing, contracting the shoulders and diaphragm, locking the knees, becoming worried, and disliking situation. By paying attention to one's body and learning to purposefully reproduce and to stop all these behavior, "...the person can choose to refuse the reaction, relax the shoulders and diaphragm, unlock the knees, breathe differently and stop judging and blaming".&lt;ref name="Lowen, M.D. 1980 42"/&gt; ''Letting the body work'' is a term used to describe the act of allowing the body to function more freely and rebalance itself.&lt;ref&gt;"I remind my clients...to go back to their breathing, because it raises their level of energy and allows them to feel their bodies more". It's possible then that clients might start to cry or to tremble. "This is the language of the body when it is allowed to speak. Then the body is able to arrange itself with all the new energy" explains the Grinberg teacher". {{cite web|last=Hauner|first=Philipp|title=Die Grinberg-Methode. Massage für die Seele ("Massage for the Soul")|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/gesundheit/die-grinberg-methode-massage-fuer-die-seele/1357156.html|publisher=Der Tagesspiegel|accessdate=24 June 2012}}(translation: Emily Poel)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal history ===
According to Grinberg, to continue habits automatically is to repeat history, not to perceive reality directly now but rather through filters of the inner-world that include past conclusions and beliefs, old fear and pain, recurring moods etc. The idea of an unresolved or "open" issue actually refers to a state of past imbalance that was never corrected, and which resurfaces repeatedly, as an "open-ended [[gestalt therapy|gestalt]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grinberg|first=Avi|title=Foot Analysis. The Foot Path to Self-discovery|year=1993|publisher=Samuel Weiser|location=York Beach, Maine|isbn=978-0877287803|pages=320, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to personal history through the body is focused on stopping behaviors that are not relevant to one's present life.&lt;ref&gt;"Therapy cannot eradicate the past. It deals with the past in terms of its effect on the present". Lowen,1980, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fear ===
According to the method, [[fear]] is a natural protection mechanism, an integral capacity that enables recognition of potential threat. Fear triggers various physical responses that alert, energize and enable quick and relevant action in a dangerous situation. While fear appears at the moment danger arises, human beings can anticipate a fearful event that might happen and trigger a similar response although nothing dangerous is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Layton|first=Julia|title=Why Do We Fear?|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/fear3.htm|work=How Fear Works|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flowers|first=Alison|title=Fearing fear perpetuates fear, psychologist says|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=101455|work=Medill Reports -Chicago|publisher=Medill school|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Natasha|title=The stress buster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/08/healthandwellbeing.health2|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8/5/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fear in the Grinberg Method|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/episode/0,,16066632,00.html#16217183|work=Deutschen Welle radio show in English|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pain ===
Grinberg views [[pain]] as a major part of the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="Transforming Pain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transforming Pain|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/pdf/Transforming_pain.pdf|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims even though pain is a natural part of life, the body can accommodate and transform it. People often do not know how to let the body deal with pain, consequently it generates fear and efforts to avoid it.&lt;ref name="Transforming Pain" /&gt; Practicing the methodology is intended to teach people to gain control and stop trying to avoid the pain, to be fully attentive to their body and experience of it. When this occurs, energy is freed to deal with the pain and related sensations, giving the body an opportunity to mend and heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online personal lesson of working with pain|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nar6PYcGYeE|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This can be applied to any form of pain or discomfort, and regular focused practice can develop more confidence and courage to cope in painful circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pain in the Grinberg Method|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/episode/0,,16066506,00.html#16197111|work=Deutschen Welle radio show in English|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Profession ==
To qualify as a Grinberg Method practitioner, students complete a three years program of at least 990 academic hours of study and training. To advance to the second and third year of studies, students have to pass a supervision meeting with a Licensed Teacher, for which they get a certificate for their learning stage (Practitioner Level 1 and 2). At the end of their third year, students demonstrate their work with clients in two supervised meetings, submit two training programs and complete the graduation requirements as set by the Supervisory Academic Board of the Grinberg Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who we are|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/who-we-are.asp|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following satisfactory fulfillment of these conditions, they receive a Diploma of Qualified Practitioner, and can join the International Association of Grinberg Method Practitioners (IAGMP) and continue to post-graduate advanced courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Studies|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/professional-studies.asp|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In 2012 Danièle Muller, President of the Swiss Association for the Defense of the Family and the Individual (ASDFI), claimed to have received testimonials from people who have completed the training to become Grinberg trainers. According to Muller, they say that the leaders of the method intervened in their private lives, they drift from their friends and their families, investing all their time and money "in promoting the method."
A psychiatrist who deals with the treatment of victims of sectarian derivals claims to have worked with several former members and according to her at Grinberg this is what is taught: "Your body knows a truth about yourself that your head ignores, and me, the therapist, masseur, I will tell you what your body feels". For the psychiatrist it is destructive of any possible private sphere and there is no possibility to keep a safe distance between the patient and the therapist.&lt;ref name=UNADFI&gt;"[http://www.unadfi.org/d-anciens-praticiens-de-la-methode Union Nationale des Associations de Défense des Familles et de l'individu Victimes de Sectes]".

[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Star]]s in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], a [[dwarf galaxy]]. At a distance of 163,000 light-years, the LMC is the third closest galaxy to the Milky Way.]]
{{wpspace}}
'''Intergalactic travel''' is the term used for hypothetical [[Human spaceflight|manned]] or unmanned travel between [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Due to the enormous distances between our own galaxy the [[Milky Way]] and even its closest neighbors&lt;wbr&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;wbr&gt;hundreds of thousands to millions of light-years&lt;wbr&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;wbr&gt;any such venture would be far more technologically demanding than even [[interstellar travel]]. Intergalactic distances are roughly a hundred-thousandfold (five orders of magnitude) greater than their interstellar counterparts.{{efn| Between small galaxies, which are the majority of galaxies, distances are typically a few hundred thousand light-years. Between large galaxies like the Milky Way and M31, they are typically a few million light-years.}}

The technology required to travel between galaxies is far beyond humanity's present capabilities, and currently only the subject of speculation, hypothesis, and [[science fiction]].

However, theoretically speaking, there is nothing to conclusively indicate that intergalactic travel is impossible.

Due to the size of the distances involved any serious attempt to travel between galaxies would require methods of [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] far beyond what is currently thought possible in order to bring a large craft close to the [[speed of light]].

According to the current understanding of [[physics]], an object within space-time cannot exceed the speed of light,&lt;ref name="FRAME_PUSHING"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/090506-tw-warp-drive.html | title= Star Trek's Warp Drive: Not Impossible | website= space.com | date= 6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means an attempt to travel to any other galaxy would be a journey of millions of earth years via conventional flight.

Manned travel at a speed not close to the speed of light, would require either that we overcome our own mortality with technologies like radical [[life extension]] or traveling with a [[generation ship]]. If traveling at a speed closer to the speed of light, [[time dilation]] would allow intergalactic travel in a timespan of decades of on-ship time.

Additional constraints include the variety of unknowns regarding the durability of a spaceship for such complex travel. Fluctuating temperatures as in the [[warm-hot intergalactic medium]] could potentially disintegrate future spacecraft if not properly shielded.

These challenges also mean a return trip would be very difficult. Therefore, all future studies on the risks and feasibility of intergalactic travel would have to include a wide range of simulations to increase chances of a successful payload.

==Possible methods==
===Extreme long-duration voyages===
Voyages to other galaxies at sub-light speeds would require voyage times anywhere from hundreds of thousands to many millions of years. To date only one design such as this has ever been made.&lt;ref name="burruss"/&gt;

===Hypervelocity stars===

One of the mechanisms would be that the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of the [[Milky Way]] ejects stars from the galaxy at a rate of about one every hundred thousand years. Another theorized mechanism might be a supernova explosion in a binary system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

These stars travel at speeds up to about 3,000&amp;nbsp;km/second. However, recently (November 2014) stars going up to a significant fraction of the speed of light have been postulated, based on numerical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= The Fastest Unbound Stars in the Universe | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 806 | pages = 124 | author1 = Guillochon, James | author2= Loeb, Abraham | date= 18 Nov 2014 | arxiv= 1411.5022| bibcode= 2015ApJ...806..124G | doi= 10.1088/0004-637X/806/1/124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Called Semi-Relativistic Hypervelocity Stars by the authors, these would be ejected by mergers of [[supermassive black hole]]s in colliding galaxies.

These could be used by entering into an orbit around them and waiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.discovery.com/space/the-great-escape-intergalactic-travel-is-possible.html| title=The Great Escape: Intergalactic Travel is Possible| author=Villard, Ray| date=24 May 2010| publisher=Discovery News| accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Gilster, Paul | date= 26 June 2014 | url= http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=30936 | title= Intergalactic Travel via Hypervelocity Stars | website= centauri-dreams.org | accessdate= 16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stellar engines===
Another proposal is to [[Stellar engine#Class A .28Shkadov thruster.29|artificially propel a star]] in the direction of another galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Gilster, Paul| date=27 June 2014| url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=30941| title=Stars as Stellar Engines| website= centauri-dreams.org | accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Gilster, Paul| date=30 June 2014| url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=30948| title=Building the Bowl of Heaven| website= centauri-dreams.org | accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time dilation===
While it takes light approximately 2.54 million years to traverse the gulf of space between Earth and, for instance, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], it would take a much shorter amount of time from the point of view of a traveler at close to the speed of light due to the effects of [[time dilation]]; the time experienced by the traveler depending both on velocity (anything less than the speed of light) and distance traveled ([[length contraction]]). Intergalactic travel for humans is therefore possible, in theory, from the point of view of the traveller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Gilster, Paul| date=25 June 2014| url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=30929| title=Sagan's Andromeda Crossing| website= centauri-dreams.org | accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerating to speeds closer to the speed of light with a [[relativistic rocket]] would allow the on-ship travel time to be drastically lower, but would require very large amounts of energy. A way to do this is [[space travel using constant acceleration]]. Traveling to the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], 2 million light years away, would take 28 years on-ship time with a constant acceleration of 1g and a deceleration of 1g after reaching half way, to be able to stop.

Going to the Andromeda Galaxy at this acceleration would require 4 100 000&amp;nbsp;kg fuel per kg payload using the unrealistic assumption of a 100% efficient engine that converts matter to energy. Decelerating at the halfway point in order to stop dramatically increases the fuel requirements to 42 trillion kg fuel per kg payload. This is ten times the mass of Mt Everest required in fuel for each kg of payload. As the fuel contributes to the total mass of the ship, carrying more fuel also increases the energy required to travel at a certain acceleration and extra fuel added to make up for the increased mass would further contribute to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html|title=The Relativistic Rocket|author=|date=|website=math.ucr.edu|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fuel requirements of going to the Andromeda Galaxy with constant acceleration means that either the payload has to be very small, the spaceship has to be very large or it has to collect fuel or receive energy on the way through other means (e.g. using a [[Bussard ramjet]]).

===Possible faster-than-light methods===
The [[Alcubierre drive]] is a hypothetical concept that is able to impulse a spacecraft to speeds [[faster-than-light|faster than light]] (the spaceship itself would not move faster than light, but the space around it would). This could in theory allow practical intergalactic travel. There is no known way to create the space-distorting wave this concept needs to work, but the metrics of the equations comply with relativity and the limit of light speed.&lt;ref name="Christopher Pike"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alcubierre, Miguel|title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]] |year=1994|volume=11|pages=L73–L77|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001|arxiv = gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode = 1994CQGra..11L..73A|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaizen-2.svg|thumb|Kaizen in [[kanji]]]]

{{Nihongo|'''''Kaizen'''''|改善}} is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for "improvement". In business, kaizen refers to activities that [[Continual improvement process|continuously improve]] all functions and involve all employees from the [[CEO]] to the [[assembly line]] workers. It also applies to processes, such as purchasing and [[logistics]], that cross organizational boundaries into the [[supply chain]].&lt;ref name="ImaiMasaaki"&gt;{{cite book | last = Imai | first = Masaaki
 | title = Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success

By improving standardized programmes and processes, kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see [[lean manufacturing]]). Kaizen was first practiced in [[Economy of Japan|Japanese businesses]] after [[World War II]], influenced in part by American business and quality-management teachers, and most notably as part of [[The Toyota Way]]. It has since spread throughout the world and has been applied to environments outside business and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Europe Japan Centre, Kaizen Strategies for Improving Team Performance, Ed. Michael Colenso, London: Pearson Education Limited, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The Japanese word ''kaizen'' means "change for better", with inherent meaning of either "continuous" or "philosophy" in Japanese dictionaries and in everyday use. The word refers to any improvement, one-time or continuous, large or small, in the same sense as the English word "[[improvement]]".&lt;ref name="whatiskaizen"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.homejapan.com/2009/03/debunked-kaizen
| title = Debunked: "kaizen = Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement"
| accessdate = 2009-08-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the common practice in Japan of labeling industrial or business improvement techniques with the word "kaizen", particularly the practices spearheaded by Toyota, the word "kaizen" in English is typically applied to measures for implementing [[Continual improvement process|''continuous'' improvement]], especially those with a "Japanese philosophy". The discussion below focuses on such interpretations of the word, as frequently used in the context of modern management discussions. Two kaizen approaches have been distinguished:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Standardized Work with TWI: Eliminating Human Errors in Production and Service Processes|last=Misiurek|first=Bartosz|publisher=Productivity Press|year=2016|isbn=9781498737548|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Flow kaizen
* Process kaizen

The former is oriented towards the flow of materials and information, and is often identified with the reorganization of an entire [[production (economics)|production]] area, even a company. The latter means the improvement of individual workstands. Therefore, improving the way production workers do their job is a part of a process kaizen. The use of the kaizen model for continuous improvement demands that both flow and process kaizens are used, although process kaizens are used more often to focus workers on continuous small improvements. In this model, operators mostly look for small [[idea]]s which, if possible, can be implemented on the same day. This is in contrast to traditional models of work improvement, which generally have a long lag between concept development and project implementation.

Kaizen is a daily process, the purpose of which goes beyond simple productivity improvement. It is also a process that, when done correctly, humanizes the workplace, eliminates overly hard work ([[Muri (Japanese term)|''muri'']]), and teaches people how to perform experiments on their work using the [[scientific method]] and how to learn to spot and eliminate waste in business processes. In all, the process suggests a humanized approach to workers and to increasing productivity: "The idea is to nurture the company's people as much as it is to praise and encourage participation in kaizen activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tozawa|first=Bunji|author2=Japan Human Relations Association | title=The improvement engine: creativity &amp; innovation through employee involvement: the Kaizen teian system | publisher=Productivity Press|year=1995|page=34 | isbn=978-1-56327-010-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1vqyBirIQLkC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful implementation requires "the participation of workers in the improvement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laraia|first=Anthony C.|author2=Patricia E. Moody |author3=Robert W. Hall |title=The Kaizen Blitz: accelerating breakthroughs in productivity and performance|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1999|page=26|isbn=978-0-471-24648-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZgEBdQhjAAC|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People at all levels of an organization participate in kaizen, from the CEO down to janitorial staff, as well as external stakeholders when applicable. Kaizen is most commonly associated with manufacturing operations, as at Toyota, but has also been used in non-manufacturing environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Reasons to Implement Kaizen in Non-Manufacturing|url= http://www.6sigma.us/lean-six-sigma-articles/five-reasons-to-implement-kaizen-in-non-manufacturing/ |work=6sigma.us|accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format for kaizen can be individual, suggestion system, small group, or large group. At Toyota, it is usually a local improvement within a workstation or local area and involves a small group in improving their own work environment and productivity. This group is often guided through the kaizen process by a line supervisor; sometimes this is the line supervisor's key role.  Kaizen on a broad, cross-departmental scale in companies, generates [[total quality management]], and frees human efforts through improving productivity using machines and computing power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

While kaizen (at Toyota) usually delivers small improvements, the culture of continual aligned small improvements and standardization yields large results in terms of overall improvement in productivity. This philosophy differs from the "[[Command and control (management)|command and control]]" improvement programs (e.g., Business Process Improvement) of the mid-20th century.  Kaizen methodology includes making changes and monitoring results, then adjusting.  Large-scale pre-planning and extensive project scheduling are replaced by smaller experiments, which can be rapidly adapted as new improvements are suggested.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In modern usage, it is designed to address a particular issue over the course of a week and is referred to as a "kaizen blitz" or "kaizen event".&lt;ref name="Kaizen Event Fieldbook: Foundation, Framework, and Standard Work for Effective Events"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamel|first=Mark|title=Kaizen Event Fieldbook: Foundation, Framework, and Standard Work for Effective Events|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99Flh8fqCH0C|accessdate=20 April 2013|year=2010|publisher=Society Of Manufacturing Engineers|isbn=978-0-87263-863-1|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kaizen Event Planner|date=October 5, 2007|publisher=Productivity Press|isbn=1563273519|pages=240|url=|author=Karen Martin|author2=Mike Osterling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are limited in scope, and issues that arise from them are typically used in later blitzes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} A person who makes a large contribution in the successful implementation of kaizen during kaizen events is awarded the title of "Zenkai". In the 21st century, [[Business consultant|business consultants]] in various countries have engaged in widespread adoption and sharing of the Kaizen framework as a way to help their clients restructure and refocus their [[Business process|business processes]].

==History==

{{main|Industrial change in occupied Japan}}

The small-step work improvement approach was developed in the USA under [[Training Within Industry]] program (TWI Job Methods).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The TWI Workbook: Essential Skills for Supervisors|last=Graupp P., Wrona B.|first=|publisher=Productivity Press|year=2015|isbn=9781498703963|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of encouraging large, radical changes to achieve desired goals, these methods recommended that organizations introduce small improvements, preferably ones that could be implemented on the same day. The major reason was that during WWII there was neither time nor resources for large and innovative changes in the production of war equipment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The essence of the approach came down to improving the use of the existing workforce and technologies.

As part of the [[Marshall Plan#Aid to Asia|Marshall Plan]] after [[World War II]],  American occupation forces brought in experts to help with the rebuilding of Japanese industry while the Civil Communications Section (CCS) developed a management training program that taught statistical control methods as part of the overall material. [[Homer Sarasohn]] and [[Charles Protzman]] developed and taught this course in 1949-1950. Sarasohn recommended [[W. Edwards Deming]] for further training in statistical methods.

The Economic and Scientific Section (ESS) group was also tasked with improving Japanese management skills and Edgar McVoy was instrumental in bringing [[Lowell Mellen]] to Japan to properly install the [[Training Within Industry]] (TWI) programs in 1951.  The ESS group had a training film to introduce TWI's three "J" programs: Job Instruction, Job Methods and Job Relations.  Titled "Improvement in Four Steps" (''Kaizen eno Yon Dankai'') it thus introduced kaizen to Japan.

For the pioneering, introduction, and implementation of kaizen in Japan, the [[Emperor of Japan]] awarded the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] to Dr. Deming in 1960. Subsequently, the [[Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers]] (JUSE) instituted the annual [[Deming Prize]]s for achievement in quality and dependability of products.  On October 18, 1989, JUSE awarded the [[Deming Prize]] to [[Florida Power &amp; Light]] Co. (FPL), based in the US, for its exceptional accomplishments in process and quality-control management, making it the first company outside Japan to win the Deming Prize.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

The [[Toyota Production System]] is known for kaizen, where all line personnel are expected to stop their moving production line in case of any abnormality and, along with their supervisor, suggest an improvement to resolve the abnormality which may initiate a kaizen.

[[File:PDCA-Two-Cycles.svg|450px|thumb|The PDCA cycles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bulsuk.com/2009/02/taking-first-step-with-pdca.html |title=Taking the First Step with PDCA |date=2 February 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The cycle of kaizen activity can be defined as: "Plan → Do → Check → Act".  This is also known as the [[Shewhart cycle]], Deming cycle, or [[PDCA]].

Another technique used in conjunction with PDCA is the [[5 Whys]], which is a form of [[root cause analysis]] in which the user asks a series of five "why" questions about a failure that has occurred, basing each subsequent question on the answer to the previous.&lt;ref&gt;[[5 Whys]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/determine-root-cause-5-whys/ | title=Determine the Root Cause:5 Whys |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are normally a series of causes stemming from one root cause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bulsuk.com/2009/03/5-why-finding-root-causes.html |title=An Introduction to 5-Why |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they can be visualized using [[Ishikawa diagram|fishbone diagrams]] or tables. The Five Whys can be used as a foundational tool in personal improvement,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://blog.getswip.com/the-5-whys-and-5-hows-when-clarity-is-just-two-questions-away/ | title=The 5 Whys and 5 Hows – When Clarity Is Just Two Questions Away |accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a means to create wealth.&lt;ref&gt;http://northdenvernews.com/what-are-realistic-ways-to-become-rich/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Masaaki Imai]] made the term famous in his book ''Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success''.&lt;ref name="ImaiMasaaki" /&gt;

In the ''Toyota Way Fieldbook'', Liker and Meier discuss the kaizen blitz and kaizen burst (or kaizen event) approaches to continuous improvement. A kaizen blitz, or rapid improvement, is a focused activity on a particular process or activity. The basic concept is to identify and quickly remove waste. Another approach is that of the kaizen burst, a specific kaizen activity on a particular process in the [[Value stream mapping|value stream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the 1990s, Professor Iwao Kobayashi published his book 20 Keys to Workplace Improvement and created a practical, step-by-step improvement framework called "the 20 Keys". He identified 20 operations focus areas which should be improved to attain holistic and sustainable change. He went further and identified the 5 levels of implementation for each of these 20 focus areas. 4 of the focus areas are called Foundation Keys. According to the 20 Keys, these foundation keys should be launched ahead of the others in order to form a strong constitution in the company. The four foundation keys are:

* Key 1 - Cleaning and Organising to Make Work Easy, which is based on the 5S methodology. 
* Key 2 - Goal Alignment/Rationalising the System
* Key 3 - Small Group Activities
* Key 4 - Leading and Site Technology

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">'''Learned intermediary''' is a defense doctrine used in the legal system of the [[United States]].  This doctrine states that a manufacturer of a product has fulfilled his duty of care when he provides all of the necessary information to a "learned intermediary" who then interacts with the consumer of a product. This doctrine is primarily used by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers in defense of [[tort]] suits. 

In a clear majority of states, the courts have accepted this as a liability shield for pharmaceutical companies. 

This doctrine was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''Hollis v Dow Corning Corp.'', 129 DLR 609 (1995).

==History==
The use of the term "learned intermediary" was first used in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] decision of ''Sterling Drug v. Cornish'' (370 F.2d 82, 85), in 1966, and has now become the prevailing doctrine in the majority of jurisdictions in the United States.

==Dissent==
Recently, this doctrine has been called into question due to the increased use of [[Direct-to-consumer advertising|direct to consumer advertising]], whereby drug manufacturers market pharmaceutical products to individuals rather than to doctors. For example, in ''Rimbert v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'', 577 F. Supp. 2d 1174, 1218-19 (D. N.M. 2008), the District Court of New Mexico reasoned that the "dramatically increased marketing directed to consumers . . . would persuade the Supreme Court of New Mexico that the justification for the learned-intermediary doctrine is quickly becoming, if not already the case, outdated." However, other recent cases have declined to adopt this so-called "direct-to-consumer advertising" exception to the learned intermediary doctrine. ''See  DiBartolo v. Abbott Labs.'', 2012 WL 6681704 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.21, 2012),  ''Centocor Inc. v. Hamilton'', 372 S.W.3d 140, 161 (Tex. 2012), ''Calisi v. Abbott Labs.'', 2013 WL 5462274 (D. Mass. Feb. 25, 2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12870">The phrase '''man bites dog''' is a shortened version of an [[aphorism]] in [[journalism]] which describes how an unusual, infrequent event (such as a man biting a dog) is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences, such as a [[dog bite|dog biting a man]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ Owen Spencer-Thomas  ''News Values''. Accessed October 15, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; An event is usually considered more newsworthy if there is something unusual about it; a commonplace event is less likely to be seen as newsworthy, even if the consequences of both events have objectively similar outcomes. The result is that rarer events more often appear as news stories, while more common events appear less often, thus distorting the perceptions of news consumers of what constitutes normal rates of occurrence.

The phenomenon is also described in the journalistic saying, "You never read about a plane that did not crash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06257/721583-152.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=There's news in planes that don't crash | date=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was coined by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]] (1865–1922), a British newspaper magnate, but is also attributed to ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' editor John B. Bogart (1848–1921): "When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', 16th edition, ed. Justin Kaplan (Boston, London, and Toronto: Little, Brown, 1992), p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Luther Mott]] (1941) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G3tWmzirWwoC American Journalism. A History of Newspapers in the United States through 250 Years, 1690 to 1940]''&lt;/ref&gt; The quote is also attributed to [[Charles Anderson Dana]] (1819–1897).&lt;ref&gt;Recollections of the Civil War By Charles Anderson Dana, Charles E. Rankin pp. xvi, xix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Dushenko, K.

"Litres". 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider it a principle of [[yellow journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Serov, V. ''[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/encSlov/6/26.htm Encyclopedic dictionary of flying words and phrases (Энциклопедический словарь крылатых слов и выражений)]. Bibliotekar.ru.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marko Vuokola''' (born 1967) is a [[Finns|Finnish]] [[conceptual art]]ist. He lives and works in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].

==Early life and education==
Marko Vuokola was born in [[Toijala]], [[Finland]] as the youngest son of photographer [[Aimo Vuokola]] and Tuula Vuokola. He studied at the Department of Sculpture at the Finnish [[Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki]] from 1987 and received a BA in 1991, followed by studies in Media Arts at AKI, De Academie voor Kunst en Industrie in [[Enschede]], the [[Netherlands]] 1991-92. He graduated with an MA from the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anhava.com/cms/docs_100/Vuokola%20CV%202013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Marko Vuokola : CV |publisher=Anhava.com |accessdate=2015-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603142516/http://www.anhava.com/cms/docs_100/Vuokola%20CV%202013.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marko Vuokola 2012"&gt;Marko Vuokola. Edited by Märit Aronsson. Trondheim Kunstmuseum, Trondheim 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marko Vuokola 2008"&gt;Marko Vuokola. The Seventh Wave. Galerie Anhava, Helsinki 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Vuokola works across a wide variety of media and materials, departing often from a conceptual exploration of issues relating to time and space. Many works, particularly in his collaborations in the OLO collective (together with [[Pasi Eerik Karjula]]), have a strongly installational and site-related character. Despite his training as a sculptor, much of his artistic oeuvre is based on photography, video or computer animation. He is often mentioned as a photographer, although it is more proper to describe his work as based on ideas just as much as on materials. His works often also explore the optical and other aspects of his artistic media, like the camera or the video projector.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;Pontus Kyander, ”Shift. Marko Vuokola” in Marko Vuokola. The Seventh Wave. Galerie Anhava, Helsinki 2008, pp 10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold Thread, 1995===
During the summer of 1995, Vuokola spent five weeks in remote [[Palsinoja]] in the Finnish [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] digging for gold. The 4 grams of gold that he collected were stretched into a thin thread only 0,12&amp;nbsp;mm thick and approximately 7 m long. The work deals with time just as much as with the precious material, and also with the concepts of sculpture and visuality in art. The thread can hardly be seen when stretched across a wall, while it represents a considerable amount of physical work. The work was exhibited at [[Henry Moore Foundation|Henry Moore institute]], Leeds, in 1996 and later acquired by [[Kiasma]], the Finnish national museum of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?lang=en&amp;si=http%3A%2F%2Fkansallisgalleria.fi%2FE42_Object_Identifier%2FN-1997-45 |title=Vuokola, Marko : Untitled |publisher=Kokoelmat.fng.fi |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Seventh Wave, 2001- ===
In 2001 Vuokola started up the series of works that he is most known for, The Seventh Wave. In these photographic diptychs, each panel depicts what might seem an identical motive. The difference between the images can be described in terms of time, as an unknown amount of time has passed between the two exposures. The difference is also a matter of space and material, as the physical and light circumstances have changed, even if these differences might be very small. The camera remains in the same position during these exposures. Many of these works have been shot outdoors, but this does not mean it is a series of landscape images, as several interiors and even seemingly abstract motives are included in the series.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Johansson, ”On the Themes and Motives of the Seventh Wave Series by Marko Vuokola” in Marko Vuokola. The Seventh Wave. Galerie Anhava, Helsinki 2008, pp 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Seventh Wave includes landscapes from Finland, park views from the [[Versailles]] of [[Louis XIV]], the surroundings of [[Donald Judd]]’s [[Marfa, Texas|Marfa]] in [[Texas]], interiors and exteriors from [[Hong Kong]], [[Great Barrier Island]] in [[New Zealand]],  seascapes from [[Vietnam]], a car vendor’s display room and the artist’s home and neighbourhood. The title of the series comes from the popular belief, that on sea, the seventh wave tends to be the largest.&lt;ref name="Marko Vuokola 2012"/&gt;

===RGB Series, 1996- ===
Starting as an experiment with a projector displaying a video of the projector itself – very much in the spirit of [[Nam June Paik]]’s work – RGB-light (1996) became just as much a study of how projected light behaves when interacting with visitors. The projection itself is in black and white, but the light cast on the wall of the exhibition space is prismatically split into a variety of colours, depending on how the three [[Additive color|additive primary colours]] (red, green and blue) of the RGB projector are affected by the movement of visitors in the space.
A continued experimentation with the possibilities within these aspects of optics has resulted also in the prints RGB (1996-2012) and the computer animation RGB-information (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.av-arkki.fi/en/artists/marko-vuokola_en/ |title=Artist: Marko Vuokola &amp;#124; AV-arkki |publisher=Av-arkki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Anatomy of Images, 2012- ===
Originating in experiments with images of streaming water (Tammerkoski, 2012), Vuokola started exploring the very fundaments of digital photography. In Flora (sharpen), a large diptych of a Norwegian waterfall from the same year, a small selection of pixels from the center of each of the two digital files were enlarged to form a new diptych of their own. The connection in this case to landscape imagery is essential, as the work approaches the basics of the construction of visuality as well as digital images.&lt;ref&gt;Jyrki Siukonen, ”Chasing Falling Water” in Marko Vuokola. Edited by Märit Aronsson. Trondheim Kunstmuseum, Trondheim 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations==
Together with artist colleague [[Pasi Eerik Karjula]] Vuokola has formed the collective OLO since 1990. OLO is primarily working with site-engaged installations and commissions. The collaboration has resulted in over 50 works, most of them outside of Finland. The best known of these is the extensive public art work for Hietalahti Square in Helsinki (OLO No. 22, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamhelsinki.fi/en/sculpture/olo-no-22-pasi-karjula-marko-vuokola/ |title=Olo n:o 22 : Pasi Karjula, Marko Vuokola - HAM |publisher=Hamhelsinki.fi |date=2000-07-25 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another long term collaboration although less formalised is the collective [[Forest Camp]], which was formed in 1998. Forest Camp functions as a think tank for immaterial work and temporary public interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestcamp.info |title=Forest Camp |publisher=Forestcamp.info |date= |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Vuokola’s solo exhibitions include a major presentation at [[Sørlandets Art Museum|SKMU Sørlandets kunstmuseum]] in Norway in 2011, followed by a large intervention with his works installed together with the collection of [[Trondheim Kunstmuseum]] in 2012-13, for which a book was published documenting the installations.&lt;ref name="Marko Vuokola 2012"/&gt; He has shown extensively with Galerie Anhava in Helsinki since 1992.&lt;ref name="Marko Vuokola 2008"/&gt; He was in 1994 the youngest artist to be presented with a solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in [[Ateneum]], the Finnish National Gallery in Helsinki.&lt;ref&gt;Marko Vuokola. Studio N, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Vuokola's most important group exhibitions are [[Melbourne International Biennial 1999]] (in OLO collaboration with Pasi Eerik Karjula; curator Juliana Engberg); "Rock the Campo" organised by Frame Finnish Funf for Art Exchange at the 49th [[Venice Biennale]] 2001; "From Dust to Dusk" at [[Kunsthal Charlottenborg|Charlottenborg]] in Copenhagen 2003 (curator Pontus Kyander); "Gridlock: cities, structures, spaces" at [[Govett-Brewster Art Gallery]] in [[New Plymouth]], [[New Zealand]] (curator [[Simon Rees]]);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/gridlock-cities-structures-spaces/.&lt;/ref&gt; "Sense of the Real" at Ars 06, [[Kiasma]] in Helsinki 2006 (with collective [[Forest Camp]], curated by Tuula Karjalainen and Jari-Pekka Vanhala);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/ars-06-sense-of-the-real/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kiasma.fi/kiasma-lehti/pdf/k31_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestcamp.info/2006/nova.html&lt;/ref&gt; "Super Structures" a public art project by a little blah blah in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]], 2008 (curators Sue Hajdu &amp; Pontus Kyander);&lt;ref&gt;http://albbsaigon-2008.blogspot.fi&lt;/ref&gt; "Entr'acte" at Kukje Gallery in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] 2009 (curator Pontus Kyander);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kukjegallery.com/KJ_exhibitions_view_1.php?page=past&amp;ex_no=111&amp;v=1&lt;/ref&gt; "East of the Sun and West of the Moon" at Växjö Konsthall, Sweden 2012;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vaxjo.se/-/konsthall/Utstallningar/Utstallningar-2012/Oster-om-solen-vaster-om-manen/&lt;/ref&gt; and "Memories can’t wait – Film without film", 60th [[International Short Film Festival Oberhausen]], Germany (curator [[Mika Taanila]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzfilmtage.de/fileadmin/Kurzfilmtage/Kurzfilmtage_2014/KFO60__Festivalkatalog__klein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Vuokola is represented in many public collections in Finland, such as the [[Kiasma|Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art]], [[Helsinki City Art Museum]], [[EMMA – Espoo Museum of Modern Art]], The Collection of the Finnish State, [[The Finnish Museum of Photography]] in Helsinki, Tampere Museum of Contemporary Art, and [[Sara Hildén Art Museum]] in Tampere.

His works are included also in the [[Malmö Art Museum]] in Sweden, the collection of [[Public Art Agency Sweden]], Stockholm, [[Sørlandets Art Museum|SKMU Sørlandets Kunstmuseum]] in [[Kristiansand]], Norway and [[Trondheim Kunstmuseum]], Norway.

==Art market==
Vuokola's works have only rarely surfaced on the secondary market, but when a mid-size (125 x 125&amp;nbsp;cm x 2) diptych from The Seventh Wave-series depicting the Versailles park in France was auctioned on [[Christie's]] in London in 2008, the price reached 15,625 GBP (23,375 USD), twice over estimate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/photographs/marko-vuokola-the-seventh-wave-4-2002-5132958-details.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meeting of the minds''' (also referred to as '''mutual agreement''', '''mutual assent''' or '''''consensus ad idem''''') is a phrase in [[Contract|contract law]] used to describe the intentions of the parties forming the contract. In particular, it refers to the situation where there is a common understanding in the formation of the contract. Formation of a contract is initiated with a proposal or offer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/08/what-is-offer-or-proposal-under.html What is an Offer or proposal under the Contract Law?], available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Covenant (law)|condition]] or element is considered a requirement to the formation of a [[contract]] in some jurisdictions.

== History ==
Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the idea of 'meeting of minds' may come from a misunderstanding of the Latin term ''consensus ad idem'', which actually means 'agreement to the [same] thing'.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker, 'Gilmore and the Strange Case of the Failure of Contract to Die After All' (2002) 18 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; There must be [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] that the parties had each, from an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] perspective, engaged in conduct manifesting their [[wiktionary:assent|assent]], and a contract will be formed when the parties have met such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Lord Steyn, 'Contract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men' (1997) 113 LQR 433; c.f. § 133 BGB in Germany, where "the actual will of the contracting party, not the literal sense of words, is to be determined"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept in academic work==
{{Contract law}}
German jurist, [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] is usually credited with developing the [[will theory of contract]] in his work ''[[System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Carl von Savigny, ''[http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/books/%22199236%22 System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]'', 8 vols. (Berlin: Veit, 1840–9) online, in German&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]] is one person known for expounding the idea of a contract based on a meeting of minds, at which time it gained much support in the courts.

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote in 1897 that a meeting of minds was really a fiction.

{{cquote|In the law of contract the use of moral phraseology led to equal confusion, as I have shown in part already, but only in part. Morals deal with the actual internal state of the individual's mind, what he actually intends. From the time of the Romans down to now, this mode of dealing has affected the language of the law as to contract, and the language used has reacted upon the thought. We talk about a contract as a meeting of the minds of the parties, and thence it is inferred in various cases that there is no contract because their minds have not met; that is, because they have intended different things or because one party has not known of the assent of the other. Yet nothing is more certain than that parties may be bound by a contract to things which neither of them intended, and when one does not know of the other's assent. Suppose a contract is executed in due form and in writing to deliver a lecture, mentioning no time. One of the parties thinks that the promise will be construed to mean at once, within a week. The other thinks that it means when he is ready. The court says that it means within a reasonable time. The parties are bound by the contract as it is interpreted by the court, yet neither of them meant what the court declares that they have said. In my opinion no one will understand the true theory of contract or be able even to discuss some fundamental questions intelligently until he has understood that all contracts are formal, that the making of a contract depends not on the agreement of two minds in one intention, but on the agreement of two sets of external signs — not on the parties' having meant the same thing but on their having said the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., [http://www.constitution.org/lrev/owh/path_law.htm 'The Path of the Law'] (1897) 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The English contracts scholar Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the concept into current times is based on a confusion of it with the concept of a ''consensus ad idem'' ("agreement to the same [thing]") which is an undoubted requirement of [[synallagmatic contracting]], and that this confusion may be the result of recent ignorance of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker, 'Gilmore and the Strange Case of the Failure of Contract to Die After All' (2002) 18 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in case law==
In ''[[Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant]]'' (1879) 4 Ex D 216, [[Thesiger LJ]] said, in the course of a judgment on the [[postal rule]],

{{cquote|Now, whatever in abstract discussion may be said as to the legal notion of its being necessary, in order to the effecting of a valid and binding contract, that the minds of the parties should be brought together at one and the same moment, that notion is practically the foundation of [[English law]] upon the subject of the formation of contracts. Unless therefore a contract constituted by correspondence is absolutely concluded at the moment that the continuing offer is accepted by the person to whom the offer is addressed, it is difficult to see how the two minds are ever to be brought together at one and the same moment...&lt;ref&gt;Thesiger LJ then refers to ''[[Adams v. Lindsell]]'' as supporting this proposition.&lt;/ref&gt; But on the other hand it is a principle of law, as well established as the legal notion to which I have referred, that the minds of the two parties must be brought together by mutual communication. An acceptance, which only remains in the breast of the acceptor without being actually and by legal implication communicated to the offerer, is no binding acceptance.}}

In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 1 QB 256, [[Bowen LJ]] said,

{{cquote|One cannot doubt that, as an ordinary rule of law, an acceptance of an offer made ought to be notified to the person who makes the offer, in order that the two minds may come together. Unless this is done the two minds may be apart, and there is not that consensus which is necessary according to the English law - I say nothing about the laws of other countries - to make a contract.}}

In ''[[Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States]]'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;261 U.S. 592, 597, 58 Ct.Cl. 709, 43 S.Ct. 425, 67 L.Ed. 816  (1923).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Supreme Court]] said an [[implied in fact contract]] is,

{{cquote|an agreement ...  founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express  contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light  of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding.}}

The [[reasoning]] is that a party should not be held to a [[contract]] that they were not even aware existed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A mutual [[promise]] between friends over simple personal matters should not be a situation where [[legal remedy|legal remedies]] are to be used.  Equally, any such agreement where the obligation is primarily a [[moral obligation|moral]] one rather than a legal one should not be enforceable. It is only when all parties involved are aware of the formation of a ''legal obligation'' is there a meeting of the minds.

However, the awareness of a legal obligation is established, not through each party's subjective understanding of the terms, but on "objective indicators," based on what each party said and did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Texas Contract law | url = http://www.gaddywells.com/TEXAS_CONTRACT_LAW.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ward v. Williams, Court of Appeals of Arkansas | url = http://courts.arkansas.gov/opinions/2002b/20021204/ca011209.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721032945/http://courts.arkansas.gov/opinions/2002b/20021204/ca011209.html | archivedate = 2011-07-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the '''formalist theory of contract''', every contract must have six elements: [[Offer and acceptance#Offer|offer]], [[Offer and acceptance#Acceptance|acceptance]], [[consideration]], ''meeting of the minds'', [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] and [[legality]].  Many other contracts, but not all types of contracts, also must be in writing and be signed by the responsible party, in an element called '''form'''.  {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Vices of consent==
Mutual assent is vitiated by actions such as [[fraud]], [[undue influence]], [[duress]] (see [[per minas]]), [[mutual mistake]], or [[misrepresentation]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} This may render a contract [[Void (law)|void]] or [[unenforceable]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6670">The '''Mental Deficiency Act 1913''' was an act of the United Kingdom which made provisions for the institutional treatment of people deemed to be "[[feeble-minded]]" and "moral defectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studymore.org.uk/mhhglo.htm#MentalDeficiency|title=Mental Health (History) Dictionary|publisher=studymore.org.uk|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It proposed an institutional separation so that mental defectives should be taken out of Poor Law institutions and prisons into newly established colonies."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Digby, "Contexts and perspectives" in{{cite book |title=From Idiocy to Mental Deficiency: Historical Perspectives on People With Learning Disabilities|editors=David Wright, Anne Digby|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=0-203-16224-2}} 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Idiots Act 1886]] made the legal distinction between "[[idiot]]s" and "[[imbecile]]s". It contained educational provisions for the needs of people deemed to be in these categories. In 1904 the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded was set up with the warrant "to consider the existing methods of dealing with idiots and epileptics, and with imbecile, feeble-minded, or defective persons not certified under the Lunacy Laws... to report as to the amendments in the law or other measures which should be adopted in the matter".&lt;ref name=royal-commission&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/reportroyalcomm00mindgoog |title=Report of the Royal Commission on the Care And Control of the Feebleminded |publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office |year=1908 |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission returned a lengthy report in 1908 which estimated that of a population of 32,527,843 British inhabitants 149,628 people (0.46%) were considered "mentally defective". It recommended the establishment of a board of control which would oversee local authority efforts aimed at "the well-being of the mentally defective".&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal #2485, Aug. 15, 1908, pp. 415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paget-1911&gt;{{cite book |pages=11-45 |url=https://archive.org/details/feeblemindedness00lapa |title=Feeblemindedness in Children of School-Age |author=Charles Paget Lapage |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1911 |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] spoke of the need to introduce compulsory labour camps for "mental defectives" in the House of Commons in February 1911. In May 1912 a Private Members' Bill entitled the "Feeble-Minded Control Bill" was introduced in the House of Commons, which called for the implementation of the Royal Commission's conclusions. It rejected sterilisation of the "feeble-minded", but had provision for registration and segregation.&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/594-churchill-and-eugenics |title=Churchill and Eugenics |author=Sir Martin Gilbert CBE |date=31 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215071541/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/594-churchill-and-eugenics |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few voices raised against the bill was that of [[G.K. Chesterton]] who ridiculed the bill, calling it the "Feeble-Minded Bill, both for brevity and because the description is strictly accurate".&lt;ref&gt;''Eugenics and Other Evils'', 1923, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was withdrawn, but a government bill introduced on 10 June 1912 replaced it, which would become the Mental Deficiency Act 1913.&lt;ref name="gilbert" /&gt;

==The Mental Deficiency Act==
The bill was passed in 1913 with only three MPs voting against it.&lt;ref name="gilbert" /&gt; One of them was [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood|Josiah Wedgwood]], who said of it, "It is a spirit of the Horrible Eugenic Society which is setting out to breed up the working class as though they were cattle."&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Woodhouse, "Eugenics and the feeble-minded: the Parliamentary debates of 1912-14", ''History of Education'' 11:2, 133&lt;/ref&gt; The new act repealed the Idiots Act 1886 and followed the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded. It established the [[Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency]] to oversee the implementation of provisions for the care and management of four classes of people,

:a) ''Idiots.'' Those so deeply defective as to be unable to guard themselves against common physical dangers.

:b) ''Imbeciles.'' Whose defectiveness does not amount to idiocy, but is so pronounced that they are incapable of managing themselves or their affairs, or, in the case of children, of being taught to do so.

:c) ''Feeble-minded persons.'' Whose weakness does not amount to imbecility, yet who require care, supervision, or control, for their protection or for the protection of others, or, in the case of children, are incapable of receiving benefit from the instruction in ordinary schools.

:d) ''Moral Imbeciles.'' Displaying mental weakness coupled with strong vicious or criminal propensities, and on whom punishment has little or no deterrent effect.&lt;ref&gt;Gattie, W. H., Holt-Hughes, T. H., "Note on the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913", ''The Law Quarterly Review'' 30 (1914) 202&lt;/ref&gt;

A person deemed to be an idiot or imbecile might be placed in an institution or under guardianship if the parent or guardian so petitioned, as could a person of any of the four categories under 21 years, as could a person of any category who had been abandoned, neglected, guilty of a crime, in a state institution, habitually drunk, or unable to be schooled.&lt;ref&gt;Gattie, W. H., Holt-Hughes, T. H., "Note on the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913", ''The Law Quarterly Review'' 30 (1914) 209&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of operation of the Mental Deficiency Act, 65,000 people were placed in "colonies" or in other institutional settings. The act remained in effect until it was repealed by the [[Mental Health Act 1959]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Walmsley, "Women and the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913: citizenship, sexuality and regulation", ''British Journal of Learning Disabilities'', 28 (2000), 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20275">The '''multislice''' algorithm is a method for the simulation of the interaction of an [[electron beam]] with matter,  including all multiple elastic scattering effects. The method is reviewed in the book by Cowley.&lt;ref name ="CowleyDP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diffraction Physics, 3rd Ed|author = John M. Cowley|year=1995|publisher=North Holland Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm is used in the simulation of high resolution [[Transmission electron microscopy]] micrographs, and serves as a useful tool for analyzing experimental images.&lt;ref name ="Kirkland"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Computing in Electron Microscopy|author = Dr. Earl J. Kirkland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we describe relevant background information, the theoretical basis of the technique, approximations used, and several software packages that implement this technique. Moreover, we delineate some of the advantages and limitations of the technique and important considerations that need to be taken into account for real-world use.

== Background ==

The multislice method has found wide application in electron crystallography. The mapping from a crystal structure to its image or diffraction pattern has been relatively well understood and documented. However, the reverse mapping from electron micrograph images to the crystal structure is generally more complicated. The fact that the images are two-dimensional projections of three-dimensional crystal structure makes it tedious to compare these projections to all plausible crystal structures. Hence, the use of numerical techniques in simulating results for different crystal structure is integral to the field of electron microscopy and crystallography. Several software packages exist to simulate electron micrographs.

There are two widely used simulation techniques that exist in literature: the Bloch wave method, derived  from Hans Bethe's original theoretical treatment of the Davisson-Germer experiment,  and the multislice method. In this paper, we will primarily focus on the multislice method for simulation of diffraction patterns, including multiple elastic scattering effects. Most of the packages that exist implement the multislice algorithm along with Fourier analysis to incorporate electron lens aberration effects to determine electron microscope image and address aspects such as phase contrast and diffraction contrast. For electron microscope samples in the form of a thin crystalline slab in the transmission geometry, the aim of these software packages is to provide a map of  the crystal potential, however this inversion process is greatly complicated by the presence of multiple elastic scattering.

The first description of what is now known as the multislice theory was given in the classic paper by Cowley and Moodie .&lt;ref name="Cowley"&gt;{{cite news|journal=Acta Crystallographica|author=J. M. Cowley and A. F. Moodie|year=1957|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, the authors describe scattering of electrons using a physical optics approach without invoking quantum mechanical arguments. Many other derivations of these iterative equations have since  been given using alternative methods, such as Greens functions, differential equations, scattering matrices or path integral methods.

A summary of the development of a computer algorithm from the multislice theory of Cowley and Moodie for numerical computation was reported by Goodman and Moodie.&lt;ref&gt;P. Goodman and A. F. Moodie, Acta Crystallogr. 1974, A30, 280&lt;/ref&gt; They also discussed in detail the relationship of the multislice to the other formulations. Specifically, using Zassenhaus's theorem, this paper gives the mathematical path from multislice to 1. Schroedingers equation (derived from the multislice),  2. Darwin's differential equations, widely used for diffraction contrast TEM image simulations - the Howie-Whelan equations derived from the multislice. 3. Sturkey's scattering matrix method. 4.  the free-space propagation case, 5. The phase grating approximation, 6. A new "thick-phase grating" approximation, which has never been used, 7. Moodie's polynomial expression for multiple scattering, 8. The Feynman path-integral formulation, and 9. relationship of multislice to the Born series. The relationship between algorithms is summarized in Section 5.11 of Spence (2013),&lt;ref name ="SpenceHREM"&gt;{{cite book|title=High-Resolution Electron Microscopy, 4th Ed.|author = [[John C. H. Spence]]|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see Figure 5.9).

== Theory ==

The form of multislice algorithm presented here has been adapted from Peng, Dudarev and Whelan 2003.&lt;ref name ="Peng"&gt;{{cite book|title=High-Energy Electron Diffraction and Microscopy|author = L. M. Peng, S. L. Dudarev and M. J. Whelan|year=2003|publisher=Oxford Science Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multislice algorithm is an approach to solving the Schrödinger wave equation:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2\Psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\Psi(x,t)
 &amp;=E\Psi(x,t)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In 1957, Cowley and Moodie &lt;ref name="Cowley"/&gt; showed that the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically to evaluate the amplitudes of diffracted beam. Subsequently, the effects of dynamical diffraction can be calculated and the resulting simulated image will exhibit good similarities with the actual image taken from a microscope under dynamical conditions. Furthermore, the multislice algorithm does not make any assumption about the periodicity of the structure, as a result this method can be used to simulate HREM images of aperiodic systems as well.

The following section will include a mathematical formulation of the Multislice algorithm. The Schrödinger equation can also be represented in the form of incident and scattered wave as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Psi({\mathbf{r}}) &amp;= \Psi_{0}({\mathbf{r}}) + \int{G({\mathbf{r,r'}})V({\mathbf{r'}})\Psi({\mathbf{r'}})d{\mathbf{r'}}}
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{r,r'})&lt;/math&gt; is the Green’s function that represents the amplitude of the electron wave function at a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; due to a source at point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r'}&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence for an incident plane wave of the form &lt;math&gt;\Psi(r)=\exp(i\mathbf{k\cdot r})&lt;/math&gt; the Schrödinger equation can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Psi({\mathbf{r}}) = \exp(i{\mathbf{k\cdot r}}) - \frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int\frac{\exp(ik\cdot {\mathbf{|r-r'|}})}{{\mathbf{|r-r'|}}}
  V({\mathbf{r'}})\Psi({\mathbf{r'}})dr'
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We then choose the coordinate axis in such a way that the incident beam hits the sample at (0,0,0) in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;-direction. Now we consider wave-function with a modulation function &lt;math&gt;\phi({\mathbf{r}})&lt;/math&gt; for the amplitude of the wave-function. Hence, the modulation function can be represented as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \phi({\mathbf{r}}) &amp;= 1 - \frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int{\frac{\exp[ik|{\mathbf{r-r'}}|-i{\mathbf{k}}\cdot({\mathbf{r-r'}})]}{|{\mathbf{r-r'}}|}V({\mathbf{r'})\phi({\mathbf{r'}})}dr'}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we make substitutions with regards to the coordinate system we have adhered.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      {\mathbf{k}} \cdot ({\mathbf{r-r'}}) &amp;= k(z-z') \quad  \&amp; \quad |{\mathbf{r-r'}}| 
      \approx (z-z') +  ({\mathbf{X-X'}})^2/{2(z-z')}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      \phi({\mathbf{r}})   =  1 -i\frac{\pi}{E\lambda}   \int \int \limits_{z'=-\infty}^{z'=z}
      V({\mathbf{X'}},z')     \phi({\mathbf{X'}},z')   \frac{1} {i\lambda (z-z')} \exp\left(ik\frac{|{\mathbf{X-X'}}|^2}{2(z-z')}\right)d{\mathbf{X'}}dz'
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 2\pi /k&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of the electrons with energy &lt;math&gt;(E) = \hbar^2k^2/{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

So far we have set up the mathematical formulation of wave mechanics without addressing the scattering in the material. The interaction constant is defined as

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      \sigma = \pi/E\lambda
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Further we also need to address the transverse spread which is done in terms of Fresnel propagation function

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      p({\mathbf{X}},z) = \frac{1}{iz\lambda} \exp\left(ik\frac{{\mathbf{X}}^2}{2z}\right)
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In multislice simulation the thickness of each slice over which the iteration is performed is usually small and as a result within a slice the potential field can be approximated to be constant &lt;math&gt;V({\mathbf{X'}},z)&lt;/math&gt;. Subsequently, the modulation function can be represented as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      \phi({\mathbf{X}},z_{n+1}) = \int p({\mathbf{X}}-{\mathbf{X'}}, z_{n+1}-z_{n}) \phi({\mathbf{X}},z_{n})\exp\left(-i\sigma\int\limits_{z_{n}}^{z_{n+1}}V({\mathbf{X'}},z')dz'\right)dX'
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can therefore represent the modulation function in the next slice

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \phi_{n+1} = \phi({\mathbf{X}},z_{n+1}) = [q_{n}\phi_{n}]*p_{n} 
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where, * represents convolution, &lt;math&gt;p_{n}=p({\mathbf{X}},z_{n+1}-z_{n})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_{n}({\mathbf{X}})&lt;/math&gt; defines the transmission function of the slice.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      q_{n}({\mathbf{X}})   =  \exp \{-i\sigma \int \limits_{z_{n}}^{z_{n+1}}   V({\mathbf{X}},z')dz'\}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the iterative application of the aforementioned procedure will provide a full interpretation of the sample in context. Further, it should be reiterated that no assumptions have been made on the periodicity of the sample apart from assuming that the potential &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{X},z)&lt;/math&gt; is uniform within the slice. As a result, it is evident that this method in principle will work for any system. However, for aperiodic systems in which the potential will vary rapidly along the beam direction, the slice thickness has to be significantly small and hence will result in higher computational expense.

== Practical Considerations ==

The basic premise is to calculate diffraction from each layer of atoms using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and multiplying each by a phase grating term. The wave is then multiplied by a propagator, inverse Fourier Transformed, multiplied by a phase grating term yet again, and the process is repeated. The use of FFTs allows a significant computational advantage over the Bloch Wave method in particular, since the FFT algorithm involves &lt;math&gt; N \log N&lt;/math&gt; steps compared to the diagonalization problem of the Bloch wave solution which scales as &lt;math&gt;N^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of atoms in the system.  (See Table 1 for comparison of computational time).

The most important step in performing a multislice calculation is setting up the unit cell and determining an appropriate slice thickness. In general, the unit cell used for simulating images will be different from the unit cell that defines the crystal structure of a particular material. The primary reason for this due to aliasing effects which occur due wraparound errors in FFT calculations. The requirement to add additional “padding” to the unit cell has earned the nomenclature “super cell” and the requirement to add these additional pixels to the basic unit cell comes at a computational price.

To illustrate the effect of choosing a slice thickness that is too thin, let us consider a simple example. The Fresnel propagator describes the propagation of electron waves in the z direction (the direction of the incident beam) in a solid:

&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}(\mathbf{u},z) = \tilde{\phi}(\mathbf{u},z=0)\exp(\pi i \lambda \mathbf{u}^2 z)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the reciprocal lattice coordinate, z is the depth in the sample, and lambda is the wavelength of the electron wave (related to the wave vector by the relation &lt;math&gt;k = 2\pi / \lambda&lt;/math&gt;). Figure [fig:SliceThickness] shows vector diagram of the wave-fronts being diffracted by the atomic planes in the sample. In the case of the small-angle approximation (&lt;math&gt;\theta \sim&lt;/math&gt; 100 mRad) we can approximate the phase shift as &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;. For 100 mRad the error &lt;math&gt;d - S &lt;/math&gt; is on the order of 0.5% since &lt;math&gt;\cos(0.1) = 0.995&lt;/math&gt;. For small angles this approximation holds regardless of how many slices there are, although choosing a &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; greater than the lattice parameter (or half the lattice parameter in the case of perovskites) for a multislice simulation would result in missing atoms that should be in the crystal potential.

[[File:MultisliceThickness.png|thumb|MultisliceThickness]]

Additional practical concerns are how to effectively include effects such as inelastic and diffuse scattering, quantized excitations (e.g. plasmons, phonons, excitons), etc. There was one code that took these things into consideration through a coherence function approach &lt;ref name ="Physik"&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D.|title=A Coherence Function Approach to Image Simulation|publisher=Vom Fachbereich Physik Technischen Universitat Darmstadt|author=Heiko Muller|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; called Yet Another Multislice (YAMS), but the code is no longer available either for download or purchase.

==Available Software ==

There are several software packages available to perform multislice simulations of images. Among these is NCEMSS, NUMIS, MacTempas, and Kirkland . Other programs exist but unfortunately many have not been maintained (e.g. SHRLI81 by Mike O’Keefe of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and Cerius2 of Accerlys). A brief chronology of multislice codes is given in Table 2, although this is by no means exhaustive.

== ACEM/JCSTEM ==

This software is developed by Professor Earl Kirkland of Cornell University. This code is freely available as an interactive Java applet and as standalone code written in C/C++. The Java applet is ideal for a quick introduction and simulations under a basic incoherent linear imaging approximation. The ACEM code accompanies an excellent text of the same name by Kirkland  which describes the background theory and computational techniques for simulating electron micrographs (including multislice) in detail. The main C/C++ routines use a command line interface (CLI) for automated batching of many simulation. The ACEM package also includes a graphical user interface that is more appropriate for beginners. The atomic scattering factors in ACEM are accurately characterized by a 12-parameter fit of Gaussians and Lorentzians to relativistic Hartree–Fock calculations. http://people.ccmr.cornell.edu/~kirkland/

== NCEMSS ==

This package was released from the National Center for High Resolution Electron Microscopy. This program uses a mouse-drive graphical user interface and is written by Dr. Roar Kilaas and Dr. Mike O’Keefe of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. While the code is no longer developed, the program is available through the Electron Direct Methods (EDM) package written by Professor Laurence Marks of Northwestern University. Debye-Waller factors can be included in as a parameter to account for diffuse scattering, although the accuracy is unclear (i.e. a good guess of the Debye-Waller factor is needed).

http://www.numis.northwestern.edu/edm/

== NUMIS ==

The Northwestern University Multislice and Imaging System (NUMIS) is a package is written by Professor Laurence Marks of Northwestern University. It uses a command line interface (CLI) and is based in UNIX. A structure file must be provided as input in order to run use this code, which makes it ideal for advanced users. The NUMIS multislice programs use the conventional multislice algorithm by calculating the wavefunction of electrons at the bottom of a crystal and simulating the image taking into account various instrument-specific parameters including &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; and convergence. This program is good to use if one already has structure files for a material that have been used in other calculations (for example, Density Functional Theory). These structure files can be used to general X-Ray structure factors which are then used as input for the PTBV routine in NUMIS. Microscope parameters can be changed through the MICROVB routine.

== MacTempas ==

This software is specifically developed to run in Mac OS X by Dr. Roar Kilaas of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is designed to have a user-friendly user interface and has been well-maintained relative to many other codes (last update May 2013). It is available (for a fee) from http://www.totalresolution.com.

== JMULTIS ==

This is a software for multislice simulation was written in FORTRAN 77 by Dr. J. M. Zuo, while he was a postdoc research fellow at Arizona State University under the guidance of Prof. [[John C. H. Spence]]. The source code was published in the book of Electron Microdiffraction.&lt;ref&gt;Electron Microdiffraction, [[John C. H. Spence|J.C. H. Spence]] and J. M. Zuo, Plenum, New York, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison between multislice and Bloch wave simulations for ZnTe was also published in the book. A separate comparison between several multislice algorithms at the year of 2000 was reported in &lt;ref&gt;Koch, C. and J.M. Zuo, “Comparison of multislicecomputer programs for electron scattering simulations and the Bloch wavemethod”, Microscopy and Microanalysis,Vol. 6 Suppl. 2, 126-127, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

== QSTEM: Quantitative TEM/STEM Simulations ==

Electron and Ion Microscopy, written by Professor Christopher Koch of Ulm University in Germany. Allows simulation of HAADF, ADF, ABF-STEM, as well as conventional TEM and CBED. The executable and source code is available as a free download at the Koch group website: https://archive.is/20130620044224/http://elim.physik.uni-ulm.de/?page_id=834

== STEM-CELL ==

This is a code written by Dr Vincenzo Grillo of the Institute for Nanoscience (CNR)  in Italy. This code is essentially a graphical frontend to the multislice code written by Kirkland, with more additional features. These include tools to generate complex crystalline structures, simulate HAADF images and model the STEM probe, as well as modeling of strain in materials. Tools for image analysis (e.g. GPA) and filtering are also available.
The code is updated quite often with new features and a user mailing list is maintained. Freely available at

Multi-slice image simulations for high-resolution scanning and coherent imaging transmission electron microscopy written by Dr. Juri Barthel from the [[Ernst Ruska-Centre]] at the [[Jülich Research Centre]]. The software comprises a graphical user interface version for direct visualization of STEM image calculations, as well as a bundle of command-line modules for more comprehensive calculation tasks. The programs have been written using Visual C++, Fortran 90, and Perl. Executable binaries for Microsoft Windows 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems are available for free from the website:

== Examples ==
One of the most common forms is dramatic action, which engages the reader into wondering what the consequences of the action will be.{{Example needed}}  This particular form has been recommended from the earliest days, stemming from [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]].{{Example needed}}

The use of action as the hook, and the advice to so use it, is so widespread as to sometimes lead to the use of the term to mean an action opening, but other things can be used for narrative hooks, such mysterious settings, or engaging characters, or even a thematic statement, as with [[Jane Austen]]'s opening line, "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." (''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'')

When a story does not lend itself to a good hook when it is laid out linearly, the writer may tell the story out of order to engage the reader's interest.  The story may begin with a dramatic moment and, once the reader is curious, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the history necessary to understand it.  Or it may be told as a [[story-within-a-story]], with the narrator in the [[frame story]] telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand latter actions. A famous early example of this technique was used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', in which the frame story consists of [[Sheherazade]] telling stories to King [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryar|Shahriyar]]; she must keep him 'hooked' to each of the stories, in order to prevent him from executing her the next morning.

=== ''In medias res'' ===
''[[In medias res]]'' is where the relating of a story begins at the midpoint, rather than at the beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=Tim|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of story telling might be used as a narrative hook. Narrative hooks often play an important role in [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thrillers]] and [[mystery fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Treat, America | year = 1982 | title = Mystery Writer's Handbook | publisher = Writer's Digest Books | page = 111 | isbn= 0898790808}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of both these occurrences is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in which a tale, "[[The Three Apples]]," begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body, thus keeping the reader interested in "[[whodunit]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5417">The '''National Association of Testing Authorities''', Australia ('''NATA''') was established in 1947 in response to a call for the formation of a national testing services body to ensure the [[munition]]s which the government was manufacturing during the [[Second World War]] met a sufficiently high standard.  

NATA is a private [[not-for-profit]] company, governed by a Board that has representation from its members, and from industry, government and professional bodies.

In 1988, NATA's role as an accreditation body was recognised by the [[Australian Government]] in a [[Memorandum of Understanding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/11-regulating-access-genetic-testing/laboratory-accreditation#_ftn4/|title=Regulating Access to Genetic Testing-Laboratory accreditation |publisher= Australian Law Reform Commission |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was renewed in 2014.

Its head office is situated in [[Rhodes, New South Wales]] and it has offices in four other capital cities of Australia. It employs 180 staff and over three thousand volunteer technical experts who assist NATA in the assessment of facilities and on its various technical committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nata.com.au/nata/about-nata/  |title=About NATA |publisher= National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
NATA provides accreditation services to inspection bodies and producers of certified reference materials.

[[File:At the nudist beach.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A group of naturists at a [[nude beach]] in [[Crimea]], 2008]]
'''Naturism''', or '''nudism''', is a [[cultural movement|cultural]] and [[political movement]] practicing, advocating, and defending personal and social [[nudity]], most but not all of which takes place on private property. The term may also refer to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudism.{{sfn|Choin|2002}} Naturism may take a number of forms. It may be practiced individually, within a family, socially, or in public. Additionally, there is also militant naturism, including campaigning, and extreme naturism is sometimes considered a separate category.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}

== Definition and lexicology ==
The XIV Congress of the [[International Naturist Federation]] ([[Cap d'Agde|Agde]], [[France]], 1974) defined naturism as:

: ''a way of life in [[harmony]] with [[nature]] characterised by the practice of [[#Social_nudism|communal nudity]] with the intention of encouraging [[self-respect]], respect for others and for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deschênes|first1=Stéphane|title=The Official INF-FNI Definition of Naturism|url=http://www.inf-fni.org/content/download/28259/1110928/file/Official%20INF-FNI%20Definition%20Of%20Naturism.pdf|website=INF-FNI|publisher=International Naturist Federation|accessdate=11 January 2016|format=PDF|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''
Several other terms ("social nudity", "[[public nudity]]", "[[skinny dipping]]", "sunning", and "clothes-free") have been proposed as alternative terms for naturism, but none has found the same widespread public acceptance as the older terms "naturism" and (in much of the United States) "nudism".

People interested in social nudity can attend [[nude beach|clothes-free beaches]] and other types of ad-hoc nudist events. At these venues, participants generally need not belong to a [[nudist club]].

Many contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations often oversimplify the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

[[File:Zwembad op naturistenterrein.JPG|thumb|Sign at a naturist [[swimming pool]] with a warning that no clothing (including underwear) is permitted.]]

The International Naturist Federation explains:

: '' "Each country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings."''{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}}{{efn|The Hannover based ''Bund für freies Lebensgestaltung'' wrote "Naturism is a new lifestyle caring for the body, the soul and the spirit in society. We live the ideal of freedom, conscious of its limits, taking up our responsibility. The expression of our will is nudity, our admission of sincerity.}}

The usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically.{{efn|In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'',{{sfn|Storey|2003|p=11}} author [[Mark Storey]] states "two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although, the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different connotations for those who prefer one to the other. In America people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed sex whenever weather permits and others are not offended generally refer to themselves as "nudists". In Europe such people more often than not refer to themselves as "naturists".}} Though in the United States, naturism and nudism have the same meaning,{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} in Britain there is a clear distinction.{{efn|The English version of the Agde definition was translated differently in ''Guide Mondial de Naturisme 96 97''.{{sfn|Anon|1997|p=}} ''Naturism (American "nudism") is a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and the environment.''}}

Nudism is the ''act of being naked'', while naturism is a ''lifestyle'' which at various times embraced nature, environment, respect for others, self-respect, crafts, healthy eating, vegetarianism, teetotalism, non-smoking, yoga, physical exercise and pacifism as well as nudity.{{efn|Ray Connett, Sunny Trails, in Sunbathing for Health Sept 1947 p 8, July 1957 p 14 writes that Naturism is a weasel word that can mean anything}}{{efn|Presently, [[Mark Storey]] is authoring an article detailing historical use of the terms naturism and nudism and how they differ between different cultures, countries, and time periods in history. In a telephone interview by Daniel Johnson on 15 April 2006 with Storey he stated that "a draft of the piece was posted on the "References" page of [[The Naturist Society]] [http://naturistsociety.com/ web site] for a few weeks". At the time of its former release in October 2004 it was titled ''Naturism, Nudism, or Nameless? A History of Terms'' He is planning on publishing a revised article as soon as additional information and errors are corrected.}}

In naturist parlance, ''[[wikt:textile|textile]]'' or ''textilist'' is a non-naturist person, non-naturist behaviour or non-naturist facilities. e.g. ''the textile beach starts at the flag'', ''they are a mixed couple&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; he is naturist, she is textile''.  ''Textile'' is the predominant term used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] ('textilist' is unknown in British naturist magazines including ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]''), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations.  ''Textilist'' is said to be used interchangeably, but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for ''textile''.{{sfn|Mars-Jones|1991|p=152}} ''Clothing optional'' and ''nude optional'' (US specific) describe a policy or a venue that allows or encourages nudity but tolerates the wearing of clothes. The opposite is ''clothing compulsory''; that is, prohibiting nudity. Adjectival phrases ''clothes free'' and ''clothing free'' prescribe where naturism is permitted in an otherwise textile environment, or define the preferred state of a naturist.

The social nudity movement includes a large range of variants including "naturism", "nudism", "[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK)", the "[[nude beach|free beach]] movement" as well as generalized "public lands/[[public nudity]]" advocacy. There is a large amount of shared history and common themes, issues and philosophy, but differences between these separate movements remain contentious.

==Personal and family nudity==

{{Main|Nudity#Private nudity}}
Many people are often nude in the privacy of their home or garden, either alone or with members of the family; naturists normally refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.

A United States study by [[Alfred Kinsey]] (1948&amp;ndash;1953) found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was "seldom" nudity in the home, 3% said "often", and 17% said that it was "usual". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.{{sfn|Bancroft|2003|p=}}

&lt;!-- Do not remove these images, Wikipedia is not censored and the current consensus is for this article to have images --&gt;
Gordon and Schroeder in 1995 reported that parental nudity varies considerably from family to family. They say that "there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They note that by ages 5 to 6 children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommend to parents who wish to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they limit such activities from that age onwards.{{sfn|Gordon &amp; Schroeder|1995|p=16}}

Barbara Bonner in 1999 cautioned against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.{{sfn|Bonner|2000|p=209-}}

In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.{{sfn|Okami|1995}} Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.{{sfn|Okami et al|1998}}

Smith and Sparks in their study on the effects of social nudity on children conclude that "the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign and totally harmless or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.{{sfn|Smith|Sparks|1986|p=183}}

== Social nudism ==
{{See also|Exhibitionism}}

The rhetoric of the nudism and anti-nudism movements emphasizes freedom from many of the normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with [[High- and low-context cultures|Hall's high-low context distinction]] and the [[Robert T. Francoeur|Francoeur]]'s hot-cool sexuality continuum.{{sfn|Smith|1980}}

=== Naturist facilities ===

At naturist organised events or venues clothing is usually optional, except by swimming pools or sunbathing lawns where complete nudity is expected, weather permitting. This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among some naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}

Facilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' naturist club is one that owns its own facilities, while non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, and rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

[[File:Outdoor bathing at Jhiben Hot Spring 20121110.jpg|thumb|Families bathing nude at a hot spring in Taiwan]] &lt;!-- Can we crop this to remove triangle --&gt;

Some clubs have stricter entrance requirements than some traditional 'country clubs', including the requirement to supply references, a sponsoring member, a trial membership, committee approval or, criminal background checks. UK clubs are now required to have child-protection policies in place, and designated child-protection officers. Many clubs promote frequent social activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs.{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}} [[Nudist colony]] is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria, and in meta-data on naturist websites.

A holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. The center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] card, that is, be a member of their national organization, but some have relaxed this restriction, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers can be quite small, just a couple of hectares or large occupying over 300 hectares.{{efn|The three biggest centres on the [[Médoc]] are Euronat 335 ha, CHM 175 ha with a 3 km beach, and La Jenny 127 ha}} In a large holiday centre there will be swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families will visit each year.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}}

A naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm. [[Cap d'Agde]] in France, naturist village [[Charco del Palo]] on Lanzarote, Canary Islands, [[Vera, Spain|Vera Playa]] in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vera Playa history article|url=http://www.veraplaya.info/history.html|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vritomartis{{sfn|Schneider|2009|p=41}} in Greece are examples. Some residents use these resorts as a year-round home.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In US usage, a naturist resort can mean a holiday centre.&lt;ref name="PalmSprings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |title=For a relaxed explanation |publisher=Sunnyfun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308025528/http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK) literally translated as 'free body culture' is the name for the general movement in [[Germany]]. The abbreviation is widely recognised all over Europe and often found on informal signs indicating the direction to a remote naturist beach.

=== Nude beaches ===
[[File:Chihuahua20 01 2007 2.jpg|thumb|A sign at a nude beach in Maldonado, Uruguay]]

Clothing is optional at [[nude beach]]es (or "free beaches"). A feature of bathing on a nude beach is the anonymity it offers, with membership of a club not being required, nor detailed application processes, nor pre-booking of visits.{{Original research inline|date=September 2014}}{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Naturism and sports ===
{{see also|Nude recreation|Nudity in sport}}

Naturism encourages a healthy life style, and many naturist clubs at times organize and encourage members to take part in local and international sport events and competitions. The [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]]  promotes recreational sports and is a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]).

=== Festival naturism ===
[[File:People pix in the village.jpg|thumb|Naturist couple at the [[Nambassa]] festival, New Zealand, 1981]]

From [[Woodstock]] to [[Edinburgh Festival|Edinburgh]], and [[Nambassa]] in the southern hemisphere communal nudity is commonly recorded at music and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] festivals.

The series of 1970s [[Nambassa]] [[hippie]] festivals held in New Zealand is a further example of non-sexualized naturism. Of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa 3 day [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] Festival an estimated 35% of festival attendees spontaneously chose to remove their clothing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nambassa.com/johnlowe.html |title=Public nudity at Nambassa |publisher=Nambassa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring complete or partial nudity.{{sfn|Jones &amp; Broadley|1979|p=}}'

[[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde festival]] in Denmark hosts a naked run, that has become one of the most popular events there.

Perhaps nowadays the biggest and most famous festival where participants spontaneously decide to go naked or take part in nude events is [[Burning Man]]: it's got its own naked bike ride aka 'Naked Pub Crawl', and a few camps organize activities in the nude, including the famous&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/naked-restaurant-paris-park-bunyadi-nude-cruise-nudist-resort-hotel-greece-pictures-a7346721.html|title=Naked ambition: 5 ways to holiday in the nude|date=2016-10-05|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil wrestling by camp [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://activenaturists.net/gymnasium-camp/|title=Gymnasium theme camp|date=2015-11-07|work=Active Naturists|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudist festivals are also held to celebrate particular days of the year, and in many such events nude [[bodypainting]] is also common, such as  [[Neptune Day Festival]] held in [[Koktebel]], [[Crimea]] to depict mythological events;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/degeneration-x-buck-naked-jazz-on-a-black-sea-beac.html deGeneration X: Buck Naked Jazz on a Black Sea Beach]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/140190277 Video of Nudist Neptune Festival 2014 in Crimea]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Solstice Cyclists]] nudist events celebrating the [[summer solstice]] held in [[Fremont, Seattle]], [[United States]]; the [[Naked Pumpkin Run]] held in US to celebrate [[Halloween]]; and the [[World Naked Gardening Day]] held to celebrate gardening.

===Summer naturism===
The prevalence of naturism tends to increase during the summer months especially when the temperature is higher with some regions experiencing first-time naturists and people who have transitioned to becoming a naturist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLellan | first1 = Josie | year = 2007 | title = State socialist bodies: East German nudism from ban to boom | url = | journal = The Journal of Modern History | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 48–79 | doi=10.1086/517544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have observed that among some of these naturists, they are clothed during other seasons, thus making them seasonal naturists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Casler | first1 = Lawrence | year = 1964 | title = Some sociopsychological observations in a nudist camp: A preliminary study | url = | journal = The Journal of social psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 307–323 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919569}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quiddity has caught the public perception and comprehension of public nudity, and thus it is frequently equated with summer destinations such as beaches.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Storm.

== History ==
{{Main|History of nudity|l1=Nudity in History}}
{{see also|Timeline of non-sexual social nudity}}
Nudity in social contexts has been practised in various forms by many [[culture]]s at all time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/how-it-used-to-be/ |title=nudity as a social norm |publisher=active naturists |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western society nowadays, social nudity is most frequently encountered in the contexts of [[bathing]], swimming and in [[sauna]]s, whether in single-sex groups, within the family or with mixed-sex friends, but throughout history and in many tropical cultures until now, nudity is a norm at many sports events and competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/nudity-ok2/ |title=naked sport events throughout history |publisher=active naturists |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to nominate exactly when naturism started as a movement. The word 'naturism' was used for the first time in 1778 by a French-speaking Belgian, Jean Baptiste Luc Planchon (1734–1781), and was advocated as a means of improving the ''hygiène de vie'' or healthy living.{{efn|"Le naturisme est la doctrine qui consiste à laisser agir la nature plutot que d'intervenir de manière artificielle".&lt;ref name="Planchon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Planchon|first=Jean Baptiste Luc |title=La naturisme, ou La nature considérée dans les maladies &amp; leur traitement conforme à la doctrine &amp; à la pratique d'Hippocrate et de ses sectateurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3ZEAAAAcAAJ|year=1778|publisher=Varlé}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest known naturist club in the "western" sense of the word was established in British [[India]] in 1891. The 'Fellowship of the Naked Trust' was founded by Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, a widower, who was a [[District Courts of India|District and Sessions Judge]] for the [[Bombay]] [[Indian Civil Service|Civil Service]]. The commune was based in [[Matheran]] and had just three members at the beginning; Crawford and two sons of an [[Anglican]] missionary, Andrew and Kellogg Calderwood.{{efn|Crawford wrote a series of letters discussing his new club and its philosophy to the socialist [[Edward Carpenter]] between 1891 and 1892. In his letters to Carpenter, Crawford described his daily activities.

: "Calderwood and I were up at Matheran having two days’ holiday to spend naked from breakfast to evening [...] in June, Calderwood and I had a grand day. We went away to a bungalow in the [[Tulsi Lake]] without servants and spent from dinner time Saturday till 5 pm Sunday in nature’s garb".

The club's dress code required full nudity, with exceptions made for accessories such as rings and glasses. Members of the club had to be plainspoken about sexual related matters and all [[taboo]]s were consciously discarded. Carpenter suggested that a female branch should be added to the commune, although this was not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/cover-story/Worlds-first-nudist-colony-was-in-Thane-and-this-man-proved-it/articleshow/16011435.cms|title=World's first nudist colony was in Thane (and this man proved it)|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The commune fell apart when Crawford was transferred to [[Ratnagiri]]; he died soon after in 1894.{{sfn|Farrar|2005}}

[[File:Koch, Max (1854-1925) - 1897 - Freilicht - vmp 01.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Max Koch]]'s ''Freilicht'', 1897]]

In 1902, a series of philosophical papers was published in [[Germany]] by Dr. [[Heinrich Pudor]], under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, who coined the term ''Nacktkultur''. In 1906 he went on to write a three volume treatise with his new term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in co-education and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} [[Richard Ungewitter]] (''Nacktheit'', 1906, ''Nackt'', 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh air bathing, and then adding the nudist philosophy, contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} Major promoters of these ideas included [[Adolf Koch]] and [[Hans Suren]]. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}

The wide publication of those papers and others, contributed to an explosive worldwide growth of nudism, in which nudists participated in various social, recreational, and physical fitness activities in the nude. The first organized club for nudists on a large scale, ''Freilichtpark'' (Free-Light Park), was opened near [[Hamburg]] in 1903 by Paul Zimmerman.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}
In 1919, German doctor [[Kurt Huldschinsky]] discovered that exposure to sunlight helped to cure [[rickets]] in many children, causing sunlight to be associated with improved health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26935867 10 inventions that owe their success to World War One]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in the early 20th century, the brothers [[Gaston Durville|Gaston]] and [[André Durville]], both of them physicians, studied the effects of psychology, nutrition, and environment on health and healing. They became convinced of the importance of natural foods and the natural environment on human well-being and health. They named this concept {{lang-fr|naturisme}}. The profound effect of clean air and sunlight on human bodies became evident to them and so nudity became a part of their naturism.

Naturism became a more widespread phenomenon in the 1920s, in [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and other European countries and spread to the [[United States]] where it became established in the 1930s.

By 1951, the national federations united to form the [[International Naturist Federation]] or [[International Naturist Federation|INF]].{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Some naturists preferred not to join clubs, and after 1945, pressure was put to designate beaches for naturist use.
From the middle of the 20th century, with changing leisure patterns, commercial organisations began opening holiday resorts to attract naturists who expected the same&amp;nbsp;– or better&amp;nbsp;– standards of comfort and amenity offered to non-naturists.  More recently, naturist holiday options have expanded to include cruises.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}

== Philosophy ==
[[File:Badstuga, efter illustration i Acerbis Travels, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|''Finnish Sauna'' (1802)]]
Naturism had many different philosophical sources and means many things to different people.&lt;ref name="Carter2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Michael|title=J.C. Flügel and the Nude Future|journal=Fashion Theory|volume=7|issue=1|year=2003|pages=79–101|issn=1362-704X|doi=10.2752/136270403778052203}}{{subscription|via=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no one definition. In 1974, the INF defined naturism as:

:: ''a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of social nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and for the environment.&lt;ref name="Definition" /&gt;

At one end of the spectrum are the nudists who just enjoy a nude life style, and at the other are the naturists, who have deeply held beliefs and see communal nudity as just one of many important principles.

The naturist philosophy has several sources, many of which can be traced back to early 20th century health and fitness philosophies in [[Germany]] and [[England]], although the concepts of returning to nature and creating equality have much deeper roots.

&lt;!-- moved from lead- needs integrating From Germany the idea spread to the rest of Europe and [[North America]] and beyond where a network of clubs developed. The model of [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German naturism]]  is to promote naturist family and recreational sports, with the [[DFK|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]] being a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]). [[France|French]] naturism developed on the basis of large [[vacation (travel)|holiday]] complexes. This in turn influenced [[Quebec]] and the United States. A subsequent development was [[tourism|tourist]] naturism, where nudist resorts would be built to cater for the nudist tourist, without any local base. This concept is most noticeable in the [[Caribbean]]. Nevertheless, most naturist activity takes place at local naturist clubs, especially in Western countries. --&gt;

=== Gymnosophy and religious nakedness ===
{{see also|Gymnosophist|American Gymnosophical Association}}

In the 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] encountered, in India, wandering groups of naked holy men whom he dubbed the ''naked philosophers''. (''Gr ''gymnos'': naked; ''sophist'': knowledge''). The philosopher [[Onesicritus]] investigated their beliefs and lifestyle. [[Pyrrho]] the [[Sceptic]] was impressed and incorporated nudity into his philosophy. The Gymnosophists were [[Hindu]]s, but [[Jain]] and [[Ajivika]] monks [[Nudity in religion|practiced nudity as a statement]] that they had given up all worldly goods. Nudity was not a new concept to the Greeks as the [[Olympic Games]] (founded in 776 BC) were exclusively male and nude events. 

Historically, the [[Adamites]], a [[Gnostic]] sect, practiced [[Nudity in religion|religious nudism]].
A religious sect in Canada that immigrated from Russia, the [[Sons of Freedom (political group)|Sons of Freedom]], went so far in the 1900s (1903-1950s) as to publicly strip in mass public demonstrations to protest against government policies which were meant to assimilate them.&lt;ref&gt;* Jim Hamm Productions Limited ''Spirit Wrestlers'', a 2002 documentary video and DVD about the Russian Christian sect called Freedomite Doukhobors,&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Christian naturism]] contains various members associated with most [[Christian denomination|denominations]].  Although beliefs vary, a common theme is that much of Christianity has misinterpreted the events regarding the [[Garden of Eden]], and God was displeased with [[Adam and Eve]] for covering their bodies with [[fig leaf|fig leaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figleafforum.com/resources_genesis.html |title="What Do The First Three Chapters Of Genesis Teach About Clothing?" by Ian B. Johnson, Fig Leaf Forum (note: articles such as this one are peer reviewed) |publisher=Figleafforum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English naturists adopted the name Gymnosophy as a thinly disguised euphemism for their pastime. The [[English Gymnosophical Society]] was formed in 1922 and became the [[New Gymnosophy Society]] in 1926; they purchased land at 'Bricketts Wood' to become Britain's first [[nudist colony]]. One of the first members was [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who in 1945 established the 'Five Acres Club' nearby, ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for [[Wicca]]ns, as [[witchcraft]] was illegal in England until 1951.

The [[Digambar]], one of the two main divisions of the [[Jainism|Jain]] religion of India, remain [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]], or naked, though generally it is practiced by males.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Digambar means 'clothed with the sky'. [[Wicca]]ns have adopted this wording and some practice their rituals skyclad.

=== Naturist writers ===
* [[Elton Raymond Shaw]] was a [[Methodist]] churchman and publisher who wrote on the Body Taboo.
* [[Heinrich Pudor]] wrote on methods to improve social hygiene in his book ''Nackende Menschen und Jauchzen der Zukunft'' (Naked people and the future of Mankind) and then ''[[Nacktkultur]]'' (Nude Culture). It prescribes an austere lifestyle and nudity.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Paul Zimmermann|Paul Zimmermann]] opened the Freilicht Park in Lübeck which was open to those who subscribed to Nacktkultur principles.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[Richard Ungewitter]] wrote ''Die Nacktheit'' (Nakedness) which sold 90,000 copies, prescribed a similar Utopian lifestyle, where everyone would be nude, eat only vegetables and abstain from alcohol and tobacco. In his Utopia, everyone was to be Germanic with blue eyes and blonde hair.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Adolf Koch|Adolf Koch]], a left-wing primary-school teacher, sought to use social nudity to free the people from 'authority fixated conditioning which held proletarians in deference of their masters: parental authority, paternalism of the church, the mass media and organs of law and order. He used Organic-Rhythmic exercises in Berlin schools in the 1920s. In 1932 there were about 100,000 Germans involved with Naturism, of which 70,000 were in Koch's ''Körperschülen'' schools.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Hans Suren|Hans Surén]] taught nude gymnastics to soldiers for five years, and on being forced to leave the army, he wrote in 1924, ''Mensch und die Sonne'' (Men and the Sun) which ran to 61 reprints.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} Later, in 1936, Surén proposed physical exercise and naturism as a means of creating a pure German race and of beauty. In the early 1940s he was out of favour and arrested. By 1945, he had turned full circle and was writing religious texts. Though never a member of any FKK club he was awarded honorary membership of the [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|DFK]] in 1952.
* [[:de:Werner Zimmermann|Werner Zimmermann]] was Swiss. He promoted [[Progressive education]], encouraging naked [[Physical education]] to eliminate body guilt and to encourage openness that would lift the repression of the human spirit, which he saw as the cause of sexual deviation. The basic position was that the human body, in and of itself, was neither sinful nor obscene. This was adopted into the emerging philosophy that created the modern Western nudist movement.

=== Naturist ideals ===
[[File:Nude people at Praia do Abricó.jpg|right|thumb|Family in Praia do Abricó, [[Brazil]]]]

Individuals have formed naturist groups for a variety of specific purposes.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} It is generally agreed by naturist organisations that [[eroticism]] and blatant sexuality have no place in naturism and are, in fact, antithetical to its ideals. Reasons that have at times been given:

* [[ecology|Ecological]] or [[environmentalist|environmental]]&amp;nbsp;— rapport with the natural world.
* [[Health]]&amp;nbsp;— bathing in the sun, fresh air and water ([[balneotherapy]], [[thalassotherapy]], [[heliotherapy]]). Sun is a form of medicine.
* [[Healthy diet|Diet]]&amp;nbsp;— Naturism has at times been associated with claims made for moderation with [[alcohol]], [[meat]], [[tobacco]], [[drug]]s; leading to a [[teetotal]], [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] lifestyle.
* [[Nude psychotherapy|Psychologically]] — rapport with other humans including equality and respect. Being nude in groups makes all feel more accepted&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; physically, intellectually and emotionally.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;
* [[Spirituality]]&amp;nbsp;— nudity, well being and direct contact to nature helps feel closer to the universe.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Pedagogy]]&amp;nbsp;— children should be respected as equals instead of being patronised{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Social equality|Equality]]&amp;nbsp;— clothes build social barriers. Social nudity leads to acceptance in spite of differences in age, body shape, fitness, and health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Discussed in:{{Citation | last = Veltheim| first = Andrew| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Naturism: Naked Beneath Your Clothing| year = | url = http://www.parama.com/html/naturism.html| accessdate =2012-04-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408070907/http://www.parama.com/html/body_naturism.html |archivedate=2010-04-08 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Liberty]]&amp;nbsp;— no one has the right to tell others or their children that they must wear clothes.

=== Naturism and the romantics ===
[[Walt Whitman]] American writer, A Sun-bathed Nakedness:

{{quote|Never before did I get so close to Nature; never before did she come so close to me... Nature was naked, and I was also... Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature! - ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability, that is indecent. There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nakedness and Nature|url=http://www.naturistplace.com/nudity19.htm|website=Naturist Place|date=8 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Henry David Thoreau]], ''In wildness is the preservation of the world.'', [[Walking (Thoreau)|Walking]]:

{{quote|We cannot adequately appreciate this aspect of nature if we approach it with any taint of human pretense. It will elude us if we allow artifacts like clothing to intervene between ourselves and this Other. To apprehend it, we cannot be naked enough.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}

Naturism was part of a literary movement in the late 1800s (see the writings of [[André Gide]]) which also influenced the art movements of the time specifically [[Henri Matisse]] and other [[Fauvism|Fauve]] painters. This movement was based on the French concept of ''[[joie de vivre]]'', the idea of reveling freely in physical sensations and direct experiences and a spontaneous approach to life.{{sfn|Harrison &amp; Perry|1993|p=}}

=== Naturism for health ===
[[Sunlight]] has been shown to be beneficial in some skin conditions and enables the body to make [[vitamin D]],&lt;ref name=bupa2004&gt;{{Citation| last =BUPA's Health Information Team| first =| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =Hot topic – Vitamin D, sunlight and cancer| date =24 March 2004| url =http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/261103vitd.html| accessdate =2007-12-02| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070203050901/http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/261103vitd.html| archivedate =3 February 2007| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with the increased awareness of [[skin cancer]], wearing of [[sunscreen]] is now part of the culture.&lt;ref name=bupa2004/&gt; Sun exposure prompts the body to produce [[nitric oxide]] that helps support the cardiovascular system and the feelgood brain-chemical [[serotonin]].&lt;ref name="LindqvistEpstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindqvist|first1=P.

===World Naked Bike Ride===
[[File:Naked Bike Ride - Holborn - 12 June 2016.JPG|thumb|WNBR passing [[Holborn tube station|Holborn underground station]] 11 June 2016]]
The [[World Naked Bike Ride]] (WNBR) is an international [[clothing-optional bike ride]] and exercise in [[public nudity]], that has developed outside the organised naturism movement. Participants plan, meet and ride together ''en masse'' on [[human-powered transport]] (the vast majority on [[bicycle]]s, but some on [[skateboard]]s and [[inline skates]]), to "deliver a vision of a cleaner, safer, body-positive world."&lt;ref name="WNBRwebsite"&gt;[http://worldnakedbikeride.org Official WNBR global web site] circa June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The WNBR shares some aspects of the philosophy of naturism in that it promotes a return to healthy exercise in unpolluted air at the same time promoting positive body image.

== Demographics ==
* In 1999, the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] commissioned a national survey on Canadian attitudes towards nudity&lt;ref name=fcnstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |title=1999 National Survey on Canadian Attitudes Towards Nudity |year=1999 |work=Federation of Canadian Naturists |publisher=Federation of Canadian Naturists |location=Ontario, Canada |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003072728/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which found that 8.9% of Canadian have visited or would visit a naturist facility. A further 11.6% have gone or would go skinny dipping in mixed company; that 39% go naked in their own homes; that naturists tend to have above average incomes; that urban dwellers are more likely to be naturist than country dwellers; and that the under 25s are the most likely to be naturists.
* In 1983, the Naturist Society in the United States sponsored a Gallup poll, which was repeated in 2000,{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} which found the following:

=== Croatia ===
Croatia has been an attractive naturist destination for five decades. Today there are more than 30 official naturist campsites, tourist villages, hotels, apartments, beaches and numerous more unofficial naturist bathing places.
Naturism is well accepted all along Croatian Adriatic coast. There are official naturist beaches which are sometimes within all naturist resorts and campings and sometimes there are special areas in textile resorts assigned for naturists. Often entrance is charged.
Then there are so called free beaches which are known to be naturist for many years, but not officially. Those places are mostly clothing optional.
And finally there are wild beaches where one can freely choose to be bare or to keep swimming suit on.
Naturist beaches are marked with signs saying "FKK" for "Freikörperkultur," German for Free Body Culture. Unofficial beaches are sometimes called free beaches. Croatia's naturist facilities often focus on different visitor categories, including families, adults, gays, and those where everyone is welcome. Beaches also often are sectioned into these categories.
Many naturist beaches (official or not) are within walking distance from centers of towns, villages or resorts. Many of the regular beaches have also a naturist section, usually at the end of the beach.
Croatia has long been popular for bare-all beach holidays, especially with German and Dutch nudists. Koversada, an island linked by bridge to the Istrian mainland, is the oldest among 30 official naturist resorts. All are indicated by "FKK" signs but there are also scores of unofficial strips.{{cn|date=November 2013}} --&gt;{{main|List of social nudity places in Europe}}

=== Finland ===
In [[Finnish culture]], nudism is considered to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's not unusual to see children playing naked in a kindergarten or family yard for example. Nudity as a whole is considered less taboo than many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mapes, Terri. [http://goscandinavia.about.com/od/finland/qt/nudism_finland.htm "Nudism in Finland"]. ''about travel''.

In 1903 la ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'' published a report on [[Freikörperkultur|German naturism]] and S. Gay created a naturist community at Bois-Fourgon. In 1907, supported by his superiors, Abbé Legrée encouraged the students at his Catholic college to bathe nude on the rocky beaches near [[Marseille]].

Marcel Kienné de Mongeot is credited with starting naturism in France in 1920. His family had suffered from tuberculosis, and he saw naturism as a cure and a continuation of the traditions of the ancient Greeks. In 1926, he started the magazine ''Vivre intégralement'' (later called ''Vivre'') and the first French naturist club, ''Sparta Club'' at Garambouville, near [[Evreux]].  The court action that he initiated, established that nudism was legal on private property that was fenced and screened.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

[[File:Nude hiking in Gard.jpg|thumb|left|Randonue in [[Les Concluses]], [[Gard]], 2008]]

Drs. André and Gaston Durville bought a 70 hectare site on the [[Île du Levant]] where they established the village of [[Île du Levant|Héliopolis]]. The village was open to the public. In 1925 Dr François Fougerat de David de Lastours wrote a thesis on [[heliotherapy]]. and in that year opened the ''Club gymnique de France''.  In 1936, the naturist movement was officially recognised.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Albert and Christine Lecocq were active members of many of these clubs, but after disagreements left and In 1944 Albert and Christine Lecocq founded the ''Club du Soleil'' with members in 84 cities. In 1948 they founded the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]], in 1949 they started the magazine, ''Vie au Soleil'' and in 1950 opened the [[CHM Montalivet]], the world's first naturist holiday centre where the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] was formed.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

The naturist village [[Leucate]] and [[Cap d'Agde]] offers a different form of social nudity. [[Euronat (naturist resort)|Euronat]] is the largest holiday centre (335ha) situated 10&amp;nbsp;km north of Montalivet. Naturism employs more than 3000 people, and is estimated to be worth 250 million Euro to the French economy.&lt;!-- ref needed --&gt; France is represented on the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] by the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]].

German naturism was part of the [[Lebensreform]] movement and the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement of 1896, from [[Steglitz]], [[Berlin]] which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time doctors of the [[:de:Naturheilbewegung|Natural Healing Movement]] were using [[heliotherapy]], treating diseases such as [[Tuberculosis|TB]], [[rheumatism]] and [[scrofula]] with exposure to sunlight.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}

[[File:Naked woman in inner city 3.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[nude]] woman moves in a busy market in Germany, while other people carry on with their routine activities, 2005.]]

Nacktkultur, a term coined in 1903 by [[Heinrich Pudor]], flourished.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}  Nacktkultur connected nudity, vegetarianism and social reform. It was practised in a network of 200 members clubs. The movement gained prominence in the 1920s as offering a health giving life-style with Utopian ideals. Germany published the first naturist journal between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}
It became politicised by radical socialists who believed it would lead to classlessness and a breaking down of society. It became associated with [[pacificism]].{{sfn|Hau|2003|p=}}

In 1926, [[Adolf Koch]] established a school of naturism in Berlin; encouraging a mixing of the sexes, open air exercises, and a programme of "sexual hygiene". In 1929, the Berlin school hosted the first International Congress on Nudity.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}

During the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' era, all naturist clubs had to register with the ''Reichsbund für Leibesübungen'', which meant excluding [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Communism|Communists]]. Also, they had to keep all activities hidden in the countryside where there was little chance of being seen by others. The status as a West German ''sports federation'' member gave the clubs rights and privileges (e.g. tax exemptions) so the naturist clubs remained in the federation after the war had ended.

After the war, [[East Germany|East Germans]] were free to practice naturism, chiefly at beaches rather than clubs (private organizations being regarded as potentially subversive). Naturism became a large element in DDR politics. The ''Proletarische Freikörperkulturbewegung'' subsection of the Workers Sports Organisation had 60,000 members.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}

=== Poland ===
First reported naturist society was established in 1897 in [[Grudziądz]]. In pre-war and post-war [[Poland]], naturism was practised in closed and secluded areas. Reported places for naturism were [[Zaleszczyki]] (in today's [[Ukraine]]) and [[Otwock]]. Under the [[communist|communism]] regime, Poland's naturism became unofficial and was practiced mostly by the artistic boheme near [[Krynica Morska]], [[Misdroy]] and Dębki.

In the early 1980s naturism became popular mostly due to increased interest in [[News media|media]]. As the [[pop music|pop]] song "Chałupy Welcome To" (about the naturist beach in Chałupy, featuring beach nudity in the clip) became the 1985 [[summer hit]] in Poland, the nude seaside locations like [[Chałupy]] or [[Rowy, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rowy]] became known to an average Polish sunbather. Polish Naturist Society was formed and after the number of [[lawsuit]]s, naturism became tolerated in selected "unofficial" beaches and distant spots.

In today's Poland naturism is practiced in number of the seaside and inland beaches. Most Polish beaches are actually [[Free beach|clothes-optional]] rather than naturist. Among the most popular locations are [[Misdroy|Misdroy-Lubiewo]], Grzybowo, [[Rowy, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rowy]], Dębki, [[Gdańsk|Gdańsk-Stogi]] and Piaski. The most popular inland locations include [[Warsaw]] (Wał Miedzeszyński), Kazimierz Dolny and Kryspinów near [[Kraków]]. In the winter season, naturism is practiced by organized groups in [[Warsaw]] and [[Tricity, Poland|Tri-City]].

=== Portugal ===
{{main|Naturism in Portugal}}
Naturism in Portugal had its first historical record around 1920, linked to the Portuguese Naturist Society, of which the anarcho-syndicalist José Peralta was a prominent member. Nudity was already being practiced on [[Costa da Caparica]] beaches. With the beginning of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]] authoritarian regime in the 1930s, the naturist movement was limited to vegetarian and alternative medicines, since nudity was banned and associated to the crime of "indecency". Only after the end of the New State regime in 1974 (April, 25th) the activities linked to the practice of nudity were resumed.

The ''Federação Portuguesa de Naturismo'' (Portuguese Naturist Federation) or FPN was founded on the March 1st, 1977, at a meeting in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|title=Home &gt; About Us &gt; Who We Are|publisher=Portuguese Naturist Federation|accessdate=2 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203081647/http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|archivedate=3 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the present, there are seven official naturist beaches in Portugal. Besides these, there are several dozens of beaches were the practice of naturism is common. There are also several naturist campings and resorts.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Slovenia ===
Beginnings of naturism in Slovenia started in the year 1852, when a 29 year old Swiss physician [[Arnold Rikli]] visited [[Bled]] for the first time. In the following years he started to promote healthy way of living, because he considered water, air and light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zupanic-Slavec|first1=Z|last2=Toplak|first2=C|title=Water, air and light--Arnold Rikli (1823-1906)|journal=Gesnerus|date=1998|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=58–69|pmid=9684537|doi=10.5169/seals-520867}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the source for his healing therapy. He continued to build [[spa]] centers which included [[light therapy]] and [[hydrotherapy]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resonantfm.com/a-very-brief-history-of-red-light/|title=A Very Brief History of Red Light|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first visitors were most likely [[pilgrim]]s from Slovenia and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region who visited the church on Bled island. When the word has spread across Europe, other visitors started visiting Bled known for Rikli's healing therapy. A method used in the healing therapy process included [[sunbathing]] and visitors were often seen walking nude in public. Rikli continued to promote his healing tourism for the next 52 years, when he lived in Bled.

=== Spain ===
[[File:Nudist-Textile couple in Cabo de Gata, Spain.jpg|thumb|Nudist man and textile woman on a beach in Spain.]]
Public nudity in Spain is not illegal since there is no law banning its practice. Spanish legislation foresees felony for exhibitionism but restricts its scope to obscene exposure in front of children or mentally impaired individuals, i.e. with sexual connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1995-25444&amp;tn=1&amp;p=20150428#a185|title=BOE.es - Documento consolidado BOE-A-1995-25444|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people do not normally use this right to be naked to do it anywhere, and most usually perform this activity in places where nudism is a tradition.

There are however some municipalities (like [[San Pedro del Pinatar, Spain|San Pedro del Pinatar]]) where public nudity has been regulated (banned) by means of [[By-law|by-laws]]. Other municipalities (like [[Barcelona]], [[Salou]], [[Platja de Palma]] and [[Sant Antoni de Portmany]]) have also used these provisions to regulate the practice of semi-nudism, forcing people to cover their torso on the streets. Some naturist associations have appealed these by-laws on the grounds that a fundamental right ([[freedom of expression]], as they understand that nudism is a way of self-expression) cannot be regulated with this mechanism. Some judicial instances have ruled in favour of nudist associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-federacion-espanola-naturismo-recurre-tsjc-prohibicion-nudismo-barcelona-20110717185055.html|title=La Federación Española de Naturismo recurre ante el TSJC la prohibición del nudismo en Barcelona|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2011-07-17|work=europapress.es|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elconfidencialdigital.com/la_buena_vida/tendencias/localidades-multan-vas-camiseta-calle_0_2300169989.html|title=Cuatro localidades donde te multan si vas sin camiseta por la calle|work=El Confidencial Digital|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudism in Spain is normally practised by the seaside, on beaches or small coves with a tradition on naturism. In [[Vera, Spain|Vera]] ([[Andalusia]]), there is a wide residential area formed by nudist urbanisations that constitute some kind of nudist town. Nudist organisations may organise some activities elsewhere in inner territory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturismo.org/adn/calendario.html|title=Calendario actividades 2017. ADN: Asociación para el Desarrollo del Naturismo de la Comunidad de Madrid|website=www.naturismo.org|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (like hiking on the mountains close to Madrid), but these kind of activities are negligible. Madrid municipality enables nudist use of some of their public swimming pools one day during summer.

Textile use of traditionally nudist public spaces (like beaches or streets nearby) is allowed, mainly due to lack of regulation. Mixed groups of nudist and textile individuals are frequent in these kind of spaces. In order to chase voyeuristic persons away, nudist people will normally clap their hands.

Legal aspects regarding topless are analogue to those regarding nudism, but social tolerance towards topless is higher. This let people not cover their breasts in public swimming pools and on any beach in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20170811/43474195994/espanolas-topless.html|title=Las españolas son las que más topless y nudismo hacen|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the first official nudist club was established in [[Wickford]], [[Essex]] in 1924. According to Michael Farrar, writing for [[British Naturism]] the club adopted the name "Moonella Group" from the name of the owner of the ground, ''Moonella'', and called its site [[The Camp (Naturism)|The Camp]]. Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the [[New Gymnosophy Society]]. This society had been founded a few years before by H.C. Booth, M.H. Sorensen and Rex Wellbye under the name of the [[English Gymnosophical Society]]. It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 [[High Holborn]] in London, the headquarters of the [[Women's Freedom League]]. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an "aristocracy" of the original members, all of whom had "club names" to preserve their anonymity. The club closed in 1926 because of building on adjacent land.&lt;ref name=bntimeline&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The history of naturism – a timeline |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019033149/https://british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bnmoonella&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The Moonella Group |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205201517/https://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}

By 1943 there were a number of these so-called "sun clubs" and together they formed the [[British Sun Bathers Association]] or BSBA. In 1954 a group of clubs unhappy with the way the BSBA was being run split off to form the Federation of British Sun Clubs or FBSC. In 1961, the BSBA Annual Conference agreed that the term nudist was inappropriate and should be discarded in favour of naturist.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; The two organisations rivalled each other before eventually coming together again in 1964 as the [[British Naturism|Central Council for British Naturism]] or [[British Naturism|CCBN]]. This organisation structure has remained much the same but it is now called [[British Naturism]] which is often abbreviated to BN.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; BN is currently a [[company limited by guarantee]].

The first official nude beach was opened at [[Fairlight Glen]] in Covehurst Bay near [[Hastings]] in 1978 (not to be confused with [[Fairlight Cove]], which is 2&amp;nbsp;km to the east) followed later by the beaches at [[Brighton]] and [[Fraisthorpe]]. [[Bridlington]] opened in April 1980.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt;

== In North America ==

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], individuals around the country became interested in nudism, skinny-dipping, and physical culture in the early part of the 20th century. After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, ''Sunbathing &amp; Health'', which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC.,{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.

Canadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

Most of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation&amp;nbsp;– Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1977 the [[La Fédération Québécoise de Naturisme|Fédération québécoise de naturisme]] (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Vaïs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet. In 1985 the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] (FCN) was formed with the support of the FQN. In 1988 the FQN and FCN formed the [[FQN-FCN Union]] as the official Canadian representative in the [[International Naturist Federation]] (INF).{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1925, Katherine and Herman Shoshinki were familiar with nudism from Germany from 1918 to 1923. Kurt Barthel founded the [[American League for Physical Culture]] in 1929 and organized the first nudist event. In about 1930 they organized the [[American Gymnosophical Association]]. Barthel founded America's first official [[nudist]] camp, Sky Farm in [[New Jersey]], in May, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ellensburg Daily Record, Aug 2, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1932, AGA established the [[Rock Lodge Club]] as a nudist facility in [[Stockholm, New Jersey]] and [[Ilsley Boone]], a [[Dutch Reformed]] minister, formed the [[Christian naturism]] movement. Naturism began expanding nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clothesfree.com/history.html |title=The History of Social Nudism – Nudist History |publisher=Clothesfree.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism History of Naturism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002734/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |title=Body Acceptance: A Brief History of Social Nudity |publisher=Lupinlodge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019234814/http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nef.oshkosh.net/Toni_Egbert_Library/US_District_Courts/Roberts_v__Clement/roberts_v__clement.html |title=Roberts v.

The [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) is the national naturist organization. [[Arnd Krüger]] compared nudists in Germany and the United States and came to the conclusion that in Germany the racial aspects (''Zuchtwahl'') were important for the breakthrough (e.g. the Commanding General of the Army served as patron for nudists events), while in the U.S. nudism was far more commercial and had thus more difficulties.{{sfn|Krüger|1992|p=343}} The AANR withdrew from the INF in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}&lt;!-- what's this mean to U.S. nudism? --&gt;

In 2008, a young adults group organized as Florida Young Naturists&lt;ref name="Florida Young Naturists FYN"/&gt; held their first Naked Bash which has since been repeated 3-4 times a year, growing into one of the largest young naturist gatherings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/music/top-10-reasons-to-get-totally-nude-at-the-florida-young-naturists-naked-spring-bash-nsfw-6424673|title=Top 10 Reasons to Get Totally Nude at the Florida Young Naturists' Naked Spring Bash|last=|first=|date=|website=New Times Broward-Palm Beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a campaign to promote Nudism in the United States occurred with an effort by AANR to record the largest simultaneous Skinny Dip at several U.S. Clubs and beaches, occurring on July 11 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wreckbeach.org/archive/AANRWorldRecordSkinnyDipFinal.pdf|title=The AANR World Record Skinny-Dip|last=|first=|date=|website=Wreck beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, A new organization formed called [[Young Naturists and Nudists America]] which was mostly focused around the younger generation as well as social issues, such as [[body image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fallon |first=Claire |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/25/nudism-problems_n_7647806.html |title=Take It Off!

In 2014, an organization called Unconstitutional Arkansas was created to highlight the unconstitutionality of laws that prohibit or impede nudism. The organization uses Arkansas law § 5-68-204 as a case study, but claims all anti-nudism laws infringe the constitutional right to assemble.&lt;ref name="UnconstitutionalArkansas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.UnconstitutionalArkansas.org |title=Arkansas Law § 5-68-204 Violates First Amendment Rights |publisher=UnconstitutionalArkansas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Asia ==

Generally, public nudity in Asia is not tolerated. However, some traditional, religious or cultural nudity has survived the introduction of Western moral values against nudity, such as the Jain Digambara monks in India, hot springs in Taiwan and Japan, and some traditional tribes in Papua. Nudism and naked recreation is slowly developing in some countries, mainly Indonesia (Bali) and Thailand. Nudists meet on the internet (e.g. Bareskinasia.com) and organize activities in remote or private locations. Several nudists also have their own blogs.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Indonesia ===
In the seventies, nudity on [[Bali]]'s remote and deserted beaches was common but with the massive growth of tourism, this practice has disappeared. In 2002, nudity was declared illegal on Petitenget Beach, the last beach in [[Seminyak]] that tolerated discreet nudity. Individuals began to practice nudity in private villas and resorts. Laki Uma Villa, the first naturist facility to open, was for gay men only. Bali au Naturel, the first adult-only nudist resort for both genders, opened its doors in 2004. It subsequently expanded from 3 to 15 rooms and added from two more swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unseen Bali|url=http://www.unseenbali.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nepal ===
Nudism is considered [[taboo]] in [[Nepal]]. Although there are no laws governing nudism, people may be detained, arrested and fined for public nudity. Nevertheless, many [[Hindu]] male sages practice nudism and they are not legally detained. Nudist sages can be seen in [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Thailand ===
Nudism was successfully introduced 10 years ago in [[Pattaya]] (Chan Resort), and six more nudist resorts have been created all over [[Thailand]]. Barefeet Resort in Bangkok, Lemon Tree in Phuket, Oriental Village in Chiangmai, Phuan Naturist Village in Huay Yai, and Family Naturist Camp in Petchaburi all belong to the Naturist Association of Thailand as well as other international naturist organizations. A gay hotel and sauna (Sansuk Hotel) located in Pattaya now also authorizes nudity in and around the swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 Nudity and naturism in Pattaya] Sawatdee Gay Thailand {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206045956/http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 |date=2014-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues in social nudity ==
{{main|Issues in social nudity}}
[[File:Naturism.jpg|thumb|A naturist  &lt;nowiki&gt;''au naturel''&lt;/nowiki&gt; ]]
Naturism addresses, challenges and explores a myriad of sometimes [[taboo]] subjects: stereotypes and mores relating to the nude appearance of the human body, mixed [[sex]] nudity, [[personal space]], [[human sexuality]], [[gymnophobia]], [[modesty]], [[physical attractiveness]], [[vanity]], [[objectification]],  exploitation and [[consent]]. It can thus be controversial. Descamps assembled a list of criticisms of naturism: it is too cold; normal bodies look ugly—it is only for the physically beautiful; it is too embarrassing; it is against the laws of nature, against the law, or against religion; "[[nudity and sexuality|nudism makes me think of sex]]"; it is for primitive people or animals.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Naturism can sometimes contain aspects of eroticism, although the debate about this is often simplified and seen negatively in the media and the public mind and by many modern naturists and naturist organisations. Historically the experience and discussion of erotic feelings during naturist activities such as dance and gymnastics played an important part in early Germanic naturism and formed part of its 'positive' connection with nature. However, it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression and discussion of eroticism within naturism became frowned upon.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

Smith states {{quote|the main reason younger people are not becoming naturists is the inability of modern naturism to engage with the issue of sexuality. While it is true that "naturism became popular in Germany...as a healthy outdoor lifestyle", this lifestyle also included a recognition that, socially, nudity could sometimes be erotic. It was only when naturism arrived in a more sexually conservative Britain that sexual feelings were censored out to make naturism culturally acceptable.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}  }}  This statement is in response to the quote "The world of naturism is in trouble. Membership is falling, and fewer young people than ever are getting involved. Has the great nude adventure run its course? "{{sfn|Barkham|2007}}

Smith and King pose the [[Issues in social nudity#Sexual wellbeing|further points]] in their 2009 peer reviewed paper ''Naturism and Sexuality:broadening our approach to sexual wellbeing ''{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

=== Issues for the naturist community ===
Many countries and states have laws which adversely affect naturists. Oftentimes, these laws are intended to address "indecent exposure", but are so broadly written that they criminalize ordinary, non-sexual nudity. Some laws, however, specifically target naturism. For example, in [[Arkansas]] in the United States, not only is nudism illegal (even on private property), it is a crime to "promote" or "advocate" (i.e. express a favourable opinion about) nudism.&lt;ref name="UnconstitutionalArkansas.org"/&gt;

Any social group is said to go through four phases:
[[Forming-storming-norming-performing|forming, storming, norming, performing]], wrote [[Bruce Tuckman]] in 1965. In this context one can understand some of the current pressures on various aspects of naturism:

* Naturist club isolation: established clubs excluding new members and rejecting new ideas.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* A family movement in a time of social change: a change in needs and expectations, away from one of a permanent commitment towards one of change and choice.
* Multi-gen preferences: each generation is a specific social group which needs to have its own norms that are consistent with common rules.
* Clubs vs. holiday centres: organizations with different roots find it difficult to establish common rules. The contention between those espousing a year-round commitment to an ideal, and those who see it as summer-only recreation. Club naturism is declining, while the number of people that assume naturist facilities will be available at any holiday resort is rising. The number of users of free beaches may exceed the number of people who wish to join a club.&lt;!-- Please add a statistic --&gt;
* Paid staff and volunteers: many clubs were established as cooperatives, but the values change when a few members put in the capital or work needed.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} This became more difficult when some members were paid to act as site managers.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* Infiltration by other groups: for many years clubs had strict "No singles" policies to maintain the family nature of the club.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Many other social groups practice non-family nudism, whether it be social singles, [[Homosexuality|gay]] naturists or [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]].
* [[Exhibitionism|Exhibitionists]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]]: as unwelcome in a naturist community as in a clothed community.&lt;ref name="CCBN172"&gt;{{Citation  | last =Boura  | first =Malcolm    | title = Campaigning  | journal =British Naturism  | volume =BN 172  | issue =  | page = 31  | date =Summer 2007  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | issn = 0264-0406}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Risk of being filmed in nude without permission, such as at nude beach. Such photos and videos can then be put on internet.
* Sunburn and skin cancer.
*Large numbers of clothed people visit clothing optional and nudist beaches and make the naturists feel uncomfortable, "like they've become a spectacle".&lt;ref name="abc2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Broome nudists in battle for beach as naturism declines | last = Parke | first = Erin | work = ABC News | date = 24 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-24/is-public-nudity-on-the-wane-in-australia/7653938 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc._Getn"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Get naked or take a hike, angry nudists tell 'lookie-loos' | author =  | work = CBC News | date = 21 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/nudists-canada-overexposure-turf-war-1.3689094 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thes_Hanl"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hanlan’s Point nudists want beach-goers to bare all | last = Botelho-Urbanski | first = Jessica | work = Toronto Star | date = 20 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/07/20/hanlans-point-nudists-want-beach-goers-to-bare-all.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An issue, a decade ago in naturist resorts like [[Cap d'Agde]] has been the clash between "fundamentalist" naturists and the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|échangistes]] who are sexually open &lt;!--(including those who do [[oral sex]], [[group sex]] or practise [[BDSM]])--&gt; on the naturist beaches and bars.&lt;ref name="outrage"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Outraged villagers protest over open-air sex at naturist beach | author =  Kim Willsher | work = Guardian News | date = 7 Nov 2010 | accessdate = 28 Dec 2017 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/07/open-air-sex-nudist-beach }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
Magazines published by, for or purportedly about naturists can be grouped:

* Magazines published by an "official" national organisation, such as ''BN'' ([[British Naturism]]), ''Going Natural/Au naturel'' ([[Federation of Canadian Naturists|FCN/FQN]]), ''Nude &amp; Natural Magazine'' [[The Naturist Society|TNS]], ''gonatural'' (New Zealand Naturist Federation).
* Independent magazines published for naturists, such as ''Naturally'', ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]'' and ''TAN'' (acronym of ''The Australian Naturist'').
* Magazines that print photographs only or primarily of young female professional models, which are disapproved of by many naturists and non-naturists alike.

Magazines in the second and, occasionally, third grouping feature naturist editorial and advertising, while some naturists argue over which magazines belonged in which of these categories&amp;nbsp;– these views may change as publishers and editors change. Many clubs and groups have benefitted from magazines which, while not exclusively or even predominantly naturist in character, made naturist information available to many who would not otherwise have been aware of it.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}  (These days, the information and advertising provided online, and the wide availability of free online porn, has meant the disappearance of old-style 'skin' magazines presenting significant glamour content masquerading as or alongside naturist content.  Naturist magazines have to appeal strongly to naturists to succeed&amp;nbsp;– they cannot sit on the fence between naturism and glamour.)
Some naturists still feel that the worthwhile editorial content in some magazines is not a fair balance for the disapproved-of photographic content.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

=== Photography, films and videos ===
Some naturist clubs have been willing to allow filming by the media on their grounds, though content that proved not to be of genuine naturism can end up being parodied by the media as the norm.&lt;ref name=telegraph &gt;{{Citation | last = Edwards| first = Adam| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =  Stark naked ambition| date = 10 May 2006 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/05/10/ftnude10.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2006/05/10/ixartright.html | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | publisher = [[Sunday Telegraph]]}} gives a history of naturism, written in a personal style that attempts to use this type of humour.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commercial 'naturist' DVDs are dominated by imagery of naked children.  Such material can be marketed in ways that appear to appeal directly to paedophile inclinations, and ownership of these DVDs (and their earlier video cassette incarnations) has resulted in successful British prosecutions for possession of indecent images of children.&lt;ref name=crowther1&gt;{{Citation | title = Gay reverend fined over 'indecent' images of boys | url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gay-reverend-fined-over-indecent-images-of-boys-26300917.html | accessdate = 3 April 2014 | work = Irish Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crowther2&gt;{{Citation|title=Rector found guilty over indecent images |date=29 June 2007 |url=http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |accessdate=4 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304193047/http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |archivedate= 4 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocarroll1&gt;{{Citation | title = Paedophile campaigner walks free | work = BBC News online | date = 26 November 2002 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2516383.stm | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case was appealed, unsuccessfully, to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=ocarroll2&gt;{{Citation | title = O'Carroll vs the United Kingdom | date = 15 May 2005 | url=http://echr.ketse.com/doc/35557.03-en-20050315/view/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precedents set by the court cases mean that possession in Britain of any naturist image of a child is, potentially, grounds for prosecution.

Photo shoots, including major high-profile works by [[Spencer Tunick]], are done on public places including beaches.{{efn|Photography in public nude beaches

Nudists who visit public nude beaches may be photographed by [[street photography|street photographers]], [[social documentary photography|social documentary photographers]], [[photojournalism|photojournalists]] or other kinds of photographers without the nudists' knowledge and in the United States and most democratic countries the photographers have the law on their side as no individual has an [[expectation of privacy]] in a [[public place]] and photographers are not required to have the naturists' consent before photographing them or publishing and selling the pictures or videos.{{sfn|NJ|2011}} In many countries there exist private nudist areas in which photography is not allowed and naturists who wish to not be photographed can enjoy their activities there. However, naturists who wish to not be photographed in public nude beaches have found various ways to make the photographers leave the beach, such as photographing the photographer and publishing such photos.

Some nude beaches provide fences that block the view from nearby streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g147317-d155079-i25617439-Club_Ambiance-Runaway_Bay_Saint_Ann_Parish_Jamaica.html Trip Advisor]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- ==Terminology==
* ''Clothist'' is a term describing someone who does not practice social nudity.-- Is there a reference for this term?-- Never heard it used in Europe. Supported by Korky Day
* ''[[Gymnophobia]]'' is an irrational fear or anxiety about being seen naked, or about seeing others naked.

=== Humour ===
* A ''cottontail'' is a term describing someone whose [[buttocks]] are paler than his or her legs and back, caused by [[sun tanning]] while wearing a swimsuit. (US specific)
* In uniform, ie nude.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}
* A ''[[acomoclitism|shaved]]'' individual or ''smoothie'' is one who shaves off much of his/her body hair, including the pubic hair. This is so common now- does the word still exist? It sounds derogatory
* ''[[Topfree]]'' means bare-chested (leaving chest and breasts uncovered), or a place that allows uncovered female and male chests. The term was coined by activists to use instead of the term "topless", which has a negative connotation to some, in part because it is used by strip clubs. Naturist women felt they'd rather be "free" than "less". Topless is also used. Is this not a historical term that is no longer current? --&gt;
&lt;!-- Recent research has begun to explore this complex and historical relationship while highlighting how erotic experiences within naturism may actually enhance sexual wellbeing and be a positive force within naturism.&lt;ref name=smithking/&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- {{POV-statement|date=November 2008}} Summary of chapter 1, of Descamps which is referenced above-- this subsection is about opinions- please suggest  better wording on the talk page --&gt;
&lt;!-- See talk page for discussion of Nikki Craft- and her display of disturbing links --&gt;
&lt;!-- Those inexperienced in social nudity often say that they fear that it contributes to an imbalance of power between men and women. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} They say that women and children are more vulnerable when nude, and can be exploited.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} While that might be true in a situation of commercial nudity, such as a strip club, women advocates of social nudity assert the opposite, especially in an established nude group. The men are nude there as well, no money is changing hands, nor is anyone in any sense giving a "performance". No one pays to be nude and no one is being paid to be nude. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  Padding --&gt;
&lt;!-- Move to new page: * [[Arkansas]], which calls itself "The Natural State" on its licence plates, has made it illegal for people to advocate nudism under code 5-68-204 section C which states:
: "''It is unlawful for any:
: ''(1)  Person, club, camp, corporation, partnership, association, or organization to advocate, demonstrate, or promote nudism; or  ''
: ''(2)  Person to rent, lease, or otherwise permit his or her land, premises, or buildings to be used for the purpose of advocating, demonstrating, or promoting nudism.''" its none too easy to do in Saudi Arabia either --&gt;
&lt;!-- Some people believe that the naked human body is to be accepted, respected, cherished, and enjoyed. They believe it is not inherently shameful, corrupting, degrading, or dangerous. Many of them enjoy clothes free activities. They reject views that being naked with other people is morally wrong ([[indecent exposure|indecent]]), [[sexual]] ''per se'' ([[erotic]] or [[pornographic]]). They argue that nakedness is a healthy, [[nature|natural]] state, that being nude is to be in the purest form, since everyone was [[birth|born]] nude. They generally find that they quickly become so accustomed to being nude among nudes that it no longer seems very remarkable. It is, rather, simply one part of their [[lifestyle]].
 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Practitioners say that they are not pruriently interested in seeing others naked (which, if for sexual pleasure, is called [[voyeurism]]) or in being seen naked by others (likewise: [[exhibitionism]]). --&gt;

The institute also houses the Laura Bush Library and Resource Center and was funded by a $5 million grant from the [[Task Force for Business and Stability Operations|U.S. Department of Defense Task Force for Business and Stability Operations]].&lt;ref name="bush"&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Wie|first=Sara |title=Laura Bush Resource Center and Library Opens in Kabul |date=5 June 2013|url=http://www.bushcenter.org/blog/2013/06/05/laura-bush-resource-center-and-library-opens-kabul |accessdate=2 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902140735/http://www.bushcenter.org/blog/2013/06/05/laura-bush-resource-center-and-library-opens-kabul |archivedate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the center focuses on providing the tools and resources necessary to promote women's rights and opportunities in business and government in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="mwa"&gt;{{cite web|title=November luncheon features Afghan women's rights activists |url=http://mwawashingtondc.org/november-luncheon-welcomes-afghan-womens-rights-activists/ |accessdate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time with ICAWED she has met with several dignitaries, including United States [[Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] &lt;ref name="kerry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan Women Help Drive Resurgent Economy |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/afghan-women-help-drive-recurrent-economy/1628696.html |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has focused largely on advocating at the national and international level for improvements in public policies involving the rights of women and peaceful economic and political transition.

Speaking of the future of women's rights in a [[Voice of America]] interview Sakhi noted that the next generation of women have strong role models in current Afghan society,&lt;blockquote&gt;“Looking at women talking about their political rights in parliament, looking at women entering into business and having trade in Malaysia and Dubai, and looking at women who are successful personalities internationally of raising Afghanistan voices. This gives an image.”&lt;ref name="voa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan Fashion Designer Creates Dresses, Jobs |date=9 June 2013 |url=http://m.learningenglish.voanews.com/a/afghan-fashion-designer/1677486.html |accessdate=2 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902135140/http://m.learningenglish.voanews.com/a/afghan-fashion-designer/1677486.html |archivedate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5570">'''Nominative use''', also "nominative fair use", is a legal [[doctrine]] that provides an [[affirmative defense]] to [[trademark]] infringement as enunciated by the [[United States]] [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]],&lt;ref name=Doellinger&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/njtip/v1/n1/5/Doellinger.pdf |first=Chad J. |last = Doellinger|title=Nominative Fair Use: Jardine and the Demise of a Doctrine | year= 2003|volume=1|issue=1|accessdate=2007-12-02 |format= pdf|journal=Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property|publisher=Northwestern University}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which a person may use the trademark of another as a reference to describe the other product, or to compare it to their own. Nominative use may be considered to be either related to, or a type of "trademark fair use" (sometimes called "classic fair use" or "statutory fair use").  All "trademark fair use" doctrines, however classified, are distinct from the [[fair use|fair use doctrine in copyright law]].  However, the fair use of a trademark may be protected under copyright laws depending on the complexity or creativity of the mark as a design logo.&lt;ref name='Pratt'&gt;Pratt, Jacqueline Levasseur.  "Not All Is Fair (Use) in Trademarks and Copyrights."  ''INTA Bulletin'', Vol 67, No 16. International Trademark Association, 15 September 2012.  &lt;http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/NotAllIsFair(Use)inTrademarksandCopyrights.aspx&gt;. 6 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nominative use test essentially states that one party may use or refer to the trademark of another if:

# The product or service cannot be readily identified without using the trademark (e.g. trademark is descriptive of a person, place, or product attribute).
# The user only uses as much of the mark as is necessary for the identification (e.g. the words but not the font or symbol).
# The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.  This applies even if the nominative use is commercial, and the same test applies for [[metatags]].

Furthermore, if a use is found to be nominative, then by the definition of non-trademark uses, it can not dilute the trademark.&lt;ref name="isbn1-57018-313-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=David S. Welkowitz |title=Trademark Dilution: Federal, State, and International Law |publisher=BNA Books (Bureau of National Affairs) |location= |year= 2002|isbn=1-57018-313-9 |quote=Since nominative fair uses are nontrademark uses, no dilution can occur|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominative use does ''not'' require that ownership of the trademark be acknowledged, for example by use of a sentence such as "UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open Group". Such statements may, however, be required by the terms of a license agreement between the parties, and they may be prudent (and courteous) as a way of preventing misunderstandings or allegations of [[passing off]].

==History of the doctrine==
The nominative use doctrine was first enunciated in 1992 by the U.S. [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in ''[[New Kids on the Block v. News America Publishing, Inc.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Kids on the Block v. News America Publishing, Inc.]]'', [[Case citation|971 F.2d 302]] ([[9th Cir.]] 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''New Kids on the Block'', the court had examined a "[[New Kids on the Block]] [[opinion poll|survey]]" performed by the [[defendant]], and found that there was no way to ask people their opinion of the band without using its name.  For instance, one could refer to the Minnesota Twins as "that professional baseball team from Minnesota," but it is much more acceptable to just refer to them by their trade name.&lt;ref name='Pratt' /&gt;

ITn ''[[Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles]]'', [[Case citation|279 F.3d 796]] ([[9th Cir.]] 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Playboy Playmate]] [[Terri Welles]] was sued for using the trademarked term "Playmate of the Year" in a [[Meta keywords|meta keyword]] within the [[HTML]] code of her [[website]]. The court found that Welles had to use the term to completely describe herself, as she had been given that title by the trademark holder. In other words, individuals are not compelled by trademark law to use "absurd turns of phrase" simply to avoid trademark liability.&lt;ref name='Pratt' /&gt; 

In ''New Kids'' and in ''Playboy v. Welles'', the courts examined older cases, identifying a unifying principle that they then named "nominative use".  Among the older cases cited by the Court in ''Playboy v. Welles'' was ''Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church'',&lt;ref&gt;''Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church'', 411 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Ninth Circuit had ruled that an independent auto repair shop that specialized in repairing Volkswagen cars and mentioned that fact in their advertising was not liable for trademark infringement so long as they did not claim or imply that they had any business relationship with the Volkswagen company. In the case of ''Yue v. MSC Software Corporation'',&lt;ref&gt;''Yue v. MSC Software Corporation'', Case No. 15-cv-5526-PJH  (N.D. Cal. 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
the Northern District of California held that the nominative fair use defense is a burden-shifting defense properly decided at the summary judgment stage and would be premature to raise in a motion to dismiss.

{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar|expanded=theology}}
'''''Ousia''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|uː|z|i|ə|,_|ˈ|uː|s|i|ə|,_|ˈ|uː|ʒ|ə|,_|ˈ|uː|ʃ|ə}}; {{lang-el|οὐσία}}) is a [[philosophical]] and [[theological]] term, originally used in [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], and also in [[Christian theology]]. It was used by various Ancient Greek philosophers, like [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], as a primary designation for philosophical concepts of ''[[essence]]'' or ''[[substance theory|substance]]''. In [[contemporary philosophy]], it is analogous to [[English language|English]] concepts of ''[[being]]'' and ''[[ontic]]''. In [[Christian theology]], the concept of θεία ουσία (''divine essence'') is one of the most important doctrinal concepts, central to the development of [[trinitarian doctrine]].{{sfn|Athanasopoulos|Schneider|2013|p=}} 

The [[Ancient Greek]] term ''Ousia'' was translated in [[Latin]] as ''essentia'' or ''substantia'', and hence in English as ''[[essence]]'' or ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CD0IRPg4roC&amp;pg=PA29 Commentary on Aristotle's Physics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''οὐσία'' is an [[Ancient Greek]] noun, formed on the [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] present [[participle]] of the verb [[wiktionary:εἰμί|εἰμί]], ''eimí'', i.e., "to be, I am". In [[Latin]], it was translated as ''essentia'' or ''substantia''. Ancient Roman philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and rhetorician [[Quintilian]] used ''essentia'' as equivalent for ''οὐσία'', while [[Apuleius]] rendered ''οὐσία'' both as ''essentia'' or ''substantia''. In order to designate ''οὐσία'', [[Early Christian]] theologian [[Tertullian]] favored the use of ''substantia'' over ''essentia'', while [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Boethius]] took the opposite stance, preferring the use of ''essentia'' as designation for ''οὐσία''.{{sfn|Owens|1951|p=137-154}}{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=276}} Some of the most prominent Latin authors, like [[Hilary of Poitiers]], noted that those variants were often being used with different meanings.{{sfn|Weedman|2007|p=}} Some modern authors also point out that the Greek term ''οὐσία'' is properly translated as ''essentia'' ([[essence]]), while ''substantia'' has a wider spectrum of meanings.{{sfn|Pásztori-Kupán|2006|p=59-60}}

From οὐσία (essence), philosophical and theological term οὐσιότης (essentiality) was also derived. It was used by [[Platonists]], like [[Alcinous (philosopher)|Alcinous]], as designation for one of the basic properties of divinity or godhead.{{sfn|Bracht|2009|p=111}}

==Philosophy==
[[Aristotle]] defined ''protai ousiai'' (πρῶται οὐσίαι), "[[primary substances]]", in the ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' as that which is neither ''said of'' nor ''in'' any subject, e.g., "this human" in [[particular]], or "this ox". The genera in biology and other [[natural kind]]s are substances in a secondary sense, as [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[hylomorphism|formally]] defined by the [[essence|essential qualities]] of the primary substances; i.e., the individual members of those kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/433/catlec.htm |title=Lecture on Categories |year=2004 |first=S. Marc |last=Cohen |quote=Primary substances are fundamental in that "if they did not exist it would be impossible for any of the other things to exist". [''Categories'', 2b5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book IV of ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' Aristotle explores the nature and attributes of being (ousia). Aristotle divides the things that there are, or "beings," into categories. Aristotle calls these substances and argues that there are many senses in which a thing may be said "to be" but it is related to one central point and is ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arpast.org/newsevents/articles/article47.pdf|title=Metaphysics|author=Aristotle|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Aristotle]] states that there are both primary and secondary substances. In ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' Aristotle argues that primary substances are ontologically based and if the primary substances did not exist then it would be impossible for other things to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/Substances.pdf|title=Substances|last=Cohen|first=Mark|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other things are regarded as the secondary substances (also known as accidents). Secondary substances are thus ontologically dependent on substances. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/Substances.pdf|title=Substances|last=Cohen|first=Mark|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]],'' [[Aristotle]] states that everything which is healthy is related to health (primary substance) as in one sense because it preserves health and in the other because it is capable of it. Without the primary substance (health) we would not be able to have the secondary substances (anything related to health). While all the secondary substances are deemed "to be" it is in relation to the primary substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arpast.org/newsevents/articles/article47.pdf|title=Metaphysics|author=Aristotle|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The question, what is being, is seeking an answer to something "that is." A contemporary example in rhetoric would be to look at a color. Using white as an example, when we define a color, we define it by association. Snow is white. Paper is white. A cow is white. But what is white? While we are saying things that are white, we are not defining what white is without qualification. Ousia is thus the answer to the question of "what is being" when the question is without qualification. The unqualified answer of what is white is the ousia of white. 

Much later, [[Martin Heidegger]] said that the original meaning of the word ''ousia'' was lost in its translation to the Latin, and, subsequently, in its translation to modern languages. For him, ''ousia'' means ''Being'', not ''substance'', that is, not some ''thing'' or some ''being'' that "stood" (-stance) "under" (sub-). Moreover, he also used the binomial [[parousia]]–[[apousia]], denoting ''presence–absence'',{{Clarify|date=October 2011}} and [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] denoting ''existence''.{{sfn|Heidegger|1996|p=}}

==Christian theology==
The concept of θεία ουσία (''divine essence'') is one of the most important concepts in [[Christian theology]]. It was developed gradually, by [[Early Church Fathers]] during the first centuries of [[Early Christianity|Christian History]]. Central debates over the doctrinal use and meaning of ουσία were held during the 4th century, and also continued later, some of them lasting up to the present day.{{sfn|Athanasopoulos|Schneider|2013|p=}} 

===New Testament===
The word ''ousia'' is used in the New Testament only in relation to the ''substance'' in the sense of ''goods'', twice in the [[parable of the Prodigal Son]] where the son asked his father to divide to him his inheritance, and then wasted it on riotous living.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mozley ''The creed or a philosophy'' 1893 p. 303 "III 'OUSIA' IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The only appearance of this word in the New Testament is in two successive verses of the Parable of the Prodigal Son. It there designates first the 'living' which the Prodigal Son compelled his father..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3776&amp;t=KJV Luke 15:12-13 Greek]&lt;/ref&gt;

An apparently related word, ''[[epiousios]]'' (affixing the prefix ''[[wikt:epi-|epi-]]'' to the word), is used in the [[Lord's Prayer]], but nowhere else in the scriptures. Elsewhere, it was believed to be present in one papyrus (a list of expenses) among expenses for chick-peas, straw, etc., and for material.&lt;ref&gt;Kittel, G., Bromiley, G. W., &amp; Friedrich, G. (Eds.). (1964–). Theological dictionary of the New Testament (electronic ed., Vol. 2, pp. 590–591). Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, according to a xerographic copy of a papyrus found in the Yale Papyrus Collection (from the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library) inventory 19 (a.k.a. ''P.C.+YBR inv 19''), it was suggested that the document had been transcribed differently from other early manuscripts and that the actual word used in that particular papyrus was ''elaiou'', meaning "oil".&lt;ref name=ibiblio&gt;[http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/b-greek/2005-June/034639.html Discussion on the B-Greek mailing list.] Tue Jun 7 15:43:35 EDT 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Christianity===
[[Origen]] (d. 251) used ''ousia'' in defining God as ''one genus of ousia'', while being three, distinct species of [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]]: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The [[Synods of Antioch]] condemned the word ''[[homoousios]]'' (same essence) because it originated in pagan Greek philosophy.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] entry for [[Paul of Samosata]] states:
{{quote|It must be regarded as certain that the council, which condemned Paul, rejected the term ''homoousios''; but, naturally, only in a false sense, used by Paul; not, it seems, because he meant by it a unity of Hypostasis in the Trinity (so St. Hilary), but because he intended, by it, a common essence, out of which both Father and Son proceeded, or which it divided between them — so St. Basil and St. Athanasius; but the question is not clear. The objectors to the Nicene doctrine in the fourth century made copious use of this disapproval of the Nicene word by a famous council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11589a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 325, the [[First Council of Nicaea]] condemned [[Arianism]] and formulated [[Nicene creed|a creed]], which stated that in the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] the Son was ''Homoousios'' (same in essence) of the Father. However, controversy did not stop and many Eastern clerics rejected the term because of its earlier condemnation in the usage of Paul of Samosata. Subsequent Emperors [[Constantius II]] (reigned 337-361) and [[Valens]] (reigned 364-378) supported Arianism and theologians came up with alternative wordings like ''Homoios'' (similar),  ''[[Homoousian|homoiousios]]'' (similar in essence), or ''Anomoios'' (unsimilar). While the ''Homoios'' achieved the support of several councils and the Emperors, those of an opposing view were suppressed. The adherents of the ''Homoiousios'' eventually joined forces with the (mostly Western) adherents of the ''Homoousios'' and accepted the formulation of the [[Nicene creed]].

The generally agreed-upon meaning of ''ousia'' in [[Eastern Christianity]] is "all that subsists by itself and which has not its being in another" - in contrast to ''hypostasis'', which is used to mean "reality" or "existence".{{sfn|Lossky|1976|p=51}} [[John Damascene]] gives the following definition of the conceptual value of the two terms in his Dialectic: Ousia is a thing that exists by itself, and which has need of nothing else for its consistency. Again, ousia is all that ''subsists'' by itself and which has not its being in another.{{sfn|Lossky|1976|p=50}}

'''''Peace Magazine''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] magazine on [[disarmament]] and [[peacebuilding]] issues, published by Canadian Disarmanent Information Service (CANDIS).

==History and profile==
''Peace Magazine'' was launched in 1985 as a continuation of an earlier CANDIS publication, ''The Peace Calendar'', which appeared monthly between February 1983 and January 1985. Originally a simple listings sheet for Toronto-area peace events, ''The Peace Calendar'' had expanded into a 12-page tabloid with articles and analysis in addition to Canada-wide listings in the period immediately before the ''Peace Magazine'' launch.

The magazine published monthly from March to December 1985; bimonthly from January–February 1986 to May–June 1999; and quarterly since July–September 1999. There has been formal and informal cooperation with other Canadian and international [[peace]] organizations throughout the magazine's history; from 1993–2006 the magazine included a section produced in collaboration with [[Science for Peace]]. 

''Peace Magazine'' was one of the first Canadian magazines to be produced with desktop publishing software. Its website has been online since 1997, includes a full set of archives from 1983 to the end of the preceding calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemagazine.org/ Peace Magazine homepage], Retrieved 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine has had a strong editorial emphasis on [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and the technical aspects of [[disarmament]]. Its writers are roughly equally distributed between activists and academics, with considerable overlap between these two spheres. The editor is retired sociologist and peace activist [[Metta Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemagazine.org/info.htm Peace Magazine website, "About Peace Magazine"], Retrieved 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Persecution of Jewish people''' has been a major part of [[Jewish history]], prompting shifting [[Jewish refugees|waves of refugees]] throughout the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora communities]].

Altars to Greek gods were set up and animals prohibited to Jews were sacrificed on them.  The Olympian [[Zeus]] was placed on the altar of the Temple. Possession of [[Torah|Jewish scriptures]] was made a capital offense.

In the [[Middle Ages]] [[antisemitism in Europe]] was [[Religious antisemitism|religious]]. Although not part of [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|Catholic dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing [[Jesus]]. As stated in the ''[[Boston College]] Guide to Passion Plays'', "Over the course of time, Christians began to accept … that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus Christ's death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of [[Jewish deicide|deicide]], or "god-killing". For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in [[Europe]] and [[Americas|America]]."&lt;ref name=Paley&gt;Paley, Susan, and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110301033826/http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/ViewersGuide.pdf "A Viewer's Guide to Contemporary Passion Plays"], accessed March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[High Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]] there was full-scale persecution in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]]. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Jews were frequently massacred and exiled from various European countries.  The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[First Crusade]] (1096) flourishing communities on the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] and the [[Danube River|Danube]] were utterly destroyed, a prime example being the [[Rhineland massacres]]. In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in [[France]] were subject to frequent massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]]. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including in 1290, [[Edict of Expulsion|the banishing of all English Jews]]; in 1396, 100,000 Jews were expelled from France; and, in 1421 thousands were expelled from [[Austria]]. Many of the expelled Jews fled to [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |title=Why the Jews? – Black Death |publisher=Holocaustcenterpgh.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429065613/http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than a half of the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence in the [[Black Death persecutions]]. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by [[papal bull]] on July 6, 1348 - with another following later in 1348 - several months afterwards, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burnt alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague hadn't yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de Histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p.47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study finds that Jewish persecutions and expulsions increased with negative economic shocks and climactic variations in Europe over the period 1100-1600.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jewish Persecutions and Weather Shocks: 1100-1800|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12331/abstract|journal = The Economic Journal|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1468-0297|pages = n/an/a|doi = 10.1111/ecoj.12331|language = en|first = Robert Warren|last = Anderson|first2 = Noel D.|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Mark|last3 = Koyama}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this stems from people blaming Jews for misfortunes and weak rulers going after Jewish wealth in times of fiscal crisis. The authors propose several explanations for why Jewish persecutions significantly declined after 1600:
* (1) there were simply fewer Jewish communities to persecute by the 17th century;
* (2) improved agricultural productivity, or, better-integrated markets may have reduced vulnerability to temperature shocks;
* (3) the rise of stronger states may have led to more robust protection for religious and ethnic minorities;
* (4) there were fewer negative temperature shocks.
* (5) the impact of the Reformation and the Enlightenment may have reduced antisemitic attitudes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In the [[Papal States]], which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called [[ghetto]]s.  Until the 1840s, they were required to regularly attend sermons urging their conversion to Christianity.  Only Jews were taxed to support state [[boarding school]]s for Jewish converts to Christianity.  It was illegal to convert from Christianity to Judaism.  Sometimes Jews were baptized involuntarily, and, even when such baptisms were illegal, forced to practice the Christian religion.  In many such cases, the state separated them from their families, of which the [[Edgardo Mortara]] account is one of the most widely publicized instances of acrimony between Catholics and Jews in the Papal States in the second half of the 19th century.

[[File:Banu Qurayza.png|thumb|200px|The [[Banu Qurayza|massacre of the Jewish Banu Qurayza]] in Arabia.]]
According to Mark R. Cohen, during the rise of [[Islam]], the first encounters between [[Muslim]]s and Jews resulted in friendship when the Jews of [[Medina]] gave [[Muhammad]] refuge. Conflict arose when Muhammad expelled certain Jewish tribes after they refused to swear their allegiance to him and aided the Meccan Pagans. He adds that this encounter was an exception rather than a rule.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Mark R. ''Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages'', [[Princeton University Press]], 1994, p. 163. {{ISBN|0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Jews living in Muslim lands, known as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religion and administer their internal affairs but were subjects to certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]] (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-00807-8}} pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; They had to pay the [[jizya]] (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1987), p. 9, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the [[Qur'an]] did not allow Muslims to force Jews to wear distinctive clothing. [[Obadiah the Proselyte]] reported in 1100 AD, that the [[Caliph]] had created this rule himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Scheiber|Scheiber, A.]] "The Origins of Obadiah, the Norman Proselyte" ''Journal of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford), Vol. 5, 1954, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment toward Jews perceived as having attained too lofty a position in Islamic society also fueled antisemitism and massacres. In [[Moorish Spain]], ibn Hazm and [[Abu Ishaq]] focused their anti-Jewish writings on this allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the [[1066 Granada massacre]], when "[m]ore than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day",&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist–Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 714-ff. (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Damascus affair]] occurred in 1840 when a French [[monk]] and his servant disappeared in [[Damascus]]. Immediately following, a charge of [[ritual murder]] was brought against a large number of Jews in the city including children who were tortured.

There was a massacre of Jews in [[Baghdad]] in 1828.&lt;ref name="Morris10"/&gt; There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

In 1839, in the eastern [[Persia]]n city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish Quarter]], burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]]. This is known as the [[Allahdad incident]].

In Palestine there were riots and pogroms against Jews in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]] and [[Jaffa riots|1921]].

In 1941, following [[Rashid Ali]]'s pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] coup, riots known as the ''[[Farhud]]'' broke out in [[Baghdad]] in which approximately 180 Jews were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Itamar (2001).

During the [[Holocaust]], the [[Middle East]] was in turmoil. Britain prohibited Jewish immigration to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. In [[Cairo]] the Jewish [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] (also known as the Stern Gang) assassinated [[Lord Moyne]] in 1944 fighting as part of its campaign against British closure of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to Jewish immigration, complicating British-Arab-Jewish relations. While the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] were fighting for the [[oil]]-rich region, the Mufti of Jerusalem [[Amin al-Husayni]] staged a pro-Nazi coup in [[Iraq]] and organized the [[Farhud]] pogrom which marked the turning point for about 150,000 Iraqi Jews who, following this event and the hostilities generated by the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war|war with Israel in 1948]], were targeted for violence, persecution, boycotts, confiscations, and near complete expulsion in 1951. The coup failed and the mufti fled to [[Berlin]], where he actively supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. In [[Egypt]], with a Jewish population of about 75,000, young [[Anwar Sadat]] was imprisoned for conspiring with the Nazis and promised them that "no British soldier would leave Egypt alive" (see [[Military history of Egypt during World War II]]) leaving the Jews of that region defenseless. In the French [[Vichy France|Vichy]] territories of [[Algeria]] and [[Syria]] plans had been drawn up for the liquidation of their Jewish populations were the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] powers to triumph.

The tensions of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] were also a factor in the rise of animosity to Jews all over the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled as [[Jewish refugees|refugees]], the main waves being soon after the 1948 and 1956 wars. In reaction to the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of Jewish communities of Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today.

On March 2, 1974, the bodies of four [[Syrian Jewish]] girls were discovered by border police in a cave in the [[Zabdani Mountains]] northwest of Damascus. Fara Zeibak 24, her sisters Lulu Zeibak 23, Mazal Zeibak 22 and their cousin Eva Saad 18, had contracted with a band of smugglers to flee from Syria to Lebanon and eventually to Israel. The girl’s bodies were found raped, murdered and mutilated. The police also found the remains of two Jewish boys, Natan Shaya 18 and Kassem Abadi 20, victims of an earlier massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Saul S. (1989).

{{main|The Holocaust}}
[[File:Massacre of Jews in Lietūkis garage.jpeg|thumb|[[Kaunas pogrom]] in [[German occupation of Lithuania during World War II|German-occupied Lithuania]], June 1941]]
The persecution of Jews reached its most destructive form in the policies of [[Nazi Germany]], which made the destruction of the Jews a priority, culminating in the killing of approximately 6,000,000 Jews during [[the Holocaust]] from 1941 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Dawidowicz|Dawidowicz, Lucy]]. ''The War Against the Jews'', Bantam, 1986.p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, the Nazis used death squads, the [[Einsatzgruppen]], to conduct massive open-air killings of Jews in territory that they conquered. By 1942, the Nazi leadership decided to implement the [[Final Solution]], the [[genocide]] of the Jews of [[Europe]], and to increase the pace of the Holocaust by establishing [[extermination camps]] specifically to kill Jews as well as other undesirables such as people who openly opposed Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Manvell, Roger ''Goering'' New York:1972 Ballantine Books – War Leader Book #8 Ballantine's Illustrated History of the Violent Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6724481.stm |title=Ukrainian mass Jewish grave found |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an industrial method of genocide. Millions of Jews who had been confined to diseased and massively overcrowded [[ghettos]] were transported (often by train) to [[extermination camps|death camps]], where some were herded into a specific location (often a [[gas chamber]]), then killed with either gassing or shooting. Other prisoners simply committed suicide, unable to go on after witnessing the horrors of camp life.  Afterward, their bodies were often searched for any valuable or useful materials, such as [[gold]] fillings or [[hair]], and their remains were then buried in mass graves or burned. Others were interned in the camps where they were given little food and disease was common.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum103&gt;Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know," United States Holocaust Museum'', 2006, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Escapes from the camps were few, but not unknown. The few [[Auschwitz]] escapes that succeeded were made possible by the Polish underground inside the camp and local people outside.&lt;ref name=Linn20&gt;[[Ruth Linn|Linn, Ruth]]. ''Escaping Auschwitz. A culture of forgetting'', Cornell University Press, 2004, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the Auschwitz commandant reported that "the local population is fanatically Polish and … prepared to take any action against the hated [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] camp personnel. Every prisoner who managed to escape can count on help the moment he reaches the wall of a first Polish farmstead."&lt;ref name=Swiebocki505&gt;Swiebocki, Henryk.

== Russia and the Soviet Union ==
{{main|History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union}}

===Czarist Russia===
{{main|Antisemitism in the Russian Empire}}
For much of the 19th century, [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], which included much of [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]] and [[Baltic states]], contained the world's largest Jewish population. From [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]'s reign until the end of [[Tsar]]ist rule in Russia, many Jews were often restricted to the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] and they were also banned from many jobs and locations.  Jews were subject to racist laws, such as the [[May Laws]], and they were also targeted in hundreds of violent anti-Jewish riots, called [[pogrom]]s, which received unofficial state support. It was during this period that a hoax document alleging a global Jewish [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]], ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', was created.

The Czarist government implemented programs which ensured that the Jews would remain isolated. However, the government tolerated their religious and national institutions as well as their right to emigrate. The restrictions and discriminatory laws drove many Russian Jews to embrace [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] causes. However, following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] many politically active Jews forfeited their Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the-jews-in-the-soviet-union-since-1917--by-nora-levin--the-jews-of-the-soviet-union--by-benjamin-pinkus-7646nska4.html |title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917, by Nora Levin; The Jews of the Soviet Union, by Benjamin Pinkus |publisher=Commentarymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Leon Trotsky]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Jews] considered themselves neither Jews nor Russians but socialists. To them, Jews were not a nation but a class of exploiters whose fate it was to dissolve and assimilate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the aftermath of Czarist Russia, Jews found themselves in a tragic predicament. Conservative Russians saw them as a disloyal and subversive element and the radicals viewed the Jews as a doomed social class.&lt;ref&gt;The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917, Nora Levin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
{{main|Antisemitism in the Soviet Union}}
Even though many of the [[Old Bolshevik]]s were ethnically Jewish, they sought to uproot [[Judaism]] and [[Zionism]] and established the ''[[Yevsektsiya]]'' in order to achieve this goal. By the end of the 1940s, the [[Communist]] leadership of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had liquidated almost all Jewish organizations, with the exception of a few [[tokenism|token]] [[synagogue]]s. These synagogues were then placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informants{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

The campaign of 1948–1953 against so-called "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]s," the alleged "[[Doctors' plot]]," the rise of "[[Zionology]]" and subsequent activities of official organizations such as the [[Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public]] were officially carried out under the banner of "[[anti-Zionism]],", and by the mid-1950s the state persecution of Soviet Jews emerged as a major [[human rights]] issue in the West as well as domestically.

==Apartheid South Africa==
{{Main|Antisemitism in South Africa}}
During the 1930s, many Nationalist Party leaders and wide sections of the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner people]] came strongly under the influence of the Nazi movement which dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. There were many reasons for this. Germany was the traditional enemy of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and whoever opposed Britain was seen as a friend of the Nationalists. Many Nationalists, moreover, believed that the opportunity to re-establish their lost republic would come with the defeat of the [[British Empire]] in the international arena. The more belligerent Hitler became, the higher hopes rose that a new era of Afrikanerdom was about to dawn.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715031456/http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html|title=The Rise of the South African Reich - Chapter 4|date=15 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of D F Malan closely associated itself with the policies of the Nazis. Jewish immigration from [[Eastern Europe]] was controlled under the Aliens Act and it soon came to an end during this period. Although Jews were accorded status as Europeans, they were not accepted into white society. The Kelvin Grove sports club, for example, had an exclusive Europeans Only and No Jews policy until recent times. Some 11 such sports clubs had similar policies. Many Jews lived in mixed race areas such as District Six, from where they were forcibly removed in order to make way for a whites-only development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1936, [[Hendrick Verwoerd]] joined a deputation of six professors who were protesting against the admission to South Africa of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. Following the demands of the Nationalist Party, Eric Louw, later Foreign Minister, introduced another anti-Semitic bill that strongly resembled Nazi legislation - the Aliens Amendment and Immigration Bill of 1939. His bill was a means of suppressing all Jews. This bill suggested that Jews threatened to overpower [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in the business world, that they were innately cunning and manipulative and that they were also a danger to society. To support his claim, Louw maintained that Jews were involved in the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] and therefore intended to spread [[Communism]] worldwide. This bill defined Jews as anyone with parents who were at least partly Jewish regardless of actual religious faith or practices." &lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Lee Jamison, The Nazi Influence in the Formation of Apartheid in South Africa, Concord Review
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organization with which the Nationalists found much in common during the thirties was the 'South African Gentile National Socialist Movement', headed by [[Johannes von Strauss von Moltke]], whose objective was to combat and destroy the alleged 'perversive influence of the Jews in [[economics]], [[culture]], [[religion]], [[ethics]], and [[Power (international relations)|statecraft]] and to re-establish European [[Aryan race|Aryan]] control in South Africa for the welfare of the Christian peoples of South Africa'.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

During the 1960s, [[Oswald Mosley]], the British fascist leader, was a frequent visitor to South Africa, where he was received by the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet. At one time, Mosley had two functioning branches of his organization in South Africa, and one of his supporters, Derek Alexander, was stationed in [[Johannesburg]] as his main agent.

Upon Verwoerd's [[assassination]] in 1966, [[BJ Vorster]] was elected by the National Party to replace him. While Vorster had been a supporter of Hitler during WWII, his policy towards Jews in his own country, however, can best be described as ambivalent.
 
The 1980s saw the rise of [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups such as the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] under [[Eugene Terreblanche]]. The AWB modeled itself after Hitler's National Socialist Party replete with fascist regalia and an emblem resembling the [[swastika]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|300px|What does it take for a person to persist from moment to moment—for the same person to exist at different moments?]]

In [[philosophy]], the matter of '''personal identity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/person-i/|title=Personal Identity - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903032724/http://www.iep.utm.edu/person-i/|archivedate=3 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with such questions as, "What makes it true that a person at one time is the same thing as a person at another time?" or "What kinds of things are we persons?" Generally, personal identity is the unique [[numerical identity]] of a [[person]] in the course of time.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/ Personal Identity] (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity/ Identity] (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the {{em|same}} person, persisting through time.{{efn|or, the essence of a self-conscious person, that which enables the person to be uniquely what him- or herself, and which further persists over time, despite superficial modifications, making him or her same person at different times.}}

In contemporary [[metaphysics]], the matter of personal identity is referred to as the ''[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] problem'' of personal identity.{{efn|{{lang-el|Διαχρονικός|Diachronikos}}}}&lt;ref&gt;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding; Volumes 1–3. By [[John Locke]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] problem'' concerns the question of what features and traits characterize a person at a given time. In [[continental philosophy]] and in [[analytic philosophy]], enquiry to the nature of Identity is common. Continental philosophy deals with conceptually maintaining identity when confronted by different philosophic [[proposition]]s, [[postulate]]s, and [[presupposition]]s about the world and its nature.&lt;ref&gt;Self and Subjectivity; "Identity, Sex, and the Metaphysics of Substance".

One concept of personal persistence over time is simply to have continuous bodily existence.&lt;ref&gt;The Human Animal: Personal Identity Without Psychology. By [[Eric T. Olson (philosopher)|Eric T. Olson]] Lecturer Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the [[Ship of Theseus]] problem illustrates, even for inanimate objects there are difficulties in determining whether one physical body at one time is the same thing as a physical body at another time. With humans, over time our bodies age and grow, losing and gaining matter, and over sufficient years will not consist of most of the matter they once consisted of. It is thus problematic to ground persistence of personal identity over time in the continuous existence of our bodies. Nevertheless, this approach has its supporters which define humans as a biological organism and [[Logical assertion|asserts]] the [[proposition]] that a [[Property (philosophy)|psychological relation]] is not necessary for personal continuity.{{efn|See also: [[Disjunctive syllogism]], [[Affirming a disjunct]], [[Proof by assertion]].}} This personal identity [[ontology]] assumes the [[relational theory]]&lt;ref&gt;What Are We? : A Study in Personal Ontology: A Study in Personal Ontology.

Derek Parfit's [[teletransportation problem]] is designed to bring out [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuition]]s about corporeal continuity. This thought experiment discusses cases in which a person is [[teleported]] from Earth to Mars.

In another concept of [[mind]], the set of [[Cognition|cognitive faculties]]{{efn|These faculties enable [[consciousness]], [[perception]], [[thinking]], [[judgement]], and [[memory]].}} are considered to consist of an [[soul|immaterial substance]], separate from and independent of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The Christian Library, Volumes 3-4. By [[Jonathan Going]]. 1835. p786+. (cf., [https://books.google.com/books?id=aOkWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA803 p803] "Now all would believe in the separate existence of the soul if they had experience of its existing apart from the body. But the facts referred to proves that it does exist apart from one body with which it once was united, and though it is in union with another, yet as it is not adherent to the same, it is shown to have an existence separate from, and independent of that body.")&lt;/ref&gt; If a person is then identified with their mind, rather than their body—if a person is considered to {{em|be}} their mind—and their mind is such a non-physical substance, then personal identity over time may be grounded in the persistence of this non-physical substance, despite the continuous change in the substance of the body it is associated with.

One of the aims of philosophers who work in this area is to explain how a non-material mind can influence a material body and vice versa.

However, this is not uncontroversial or unproblematic, and adopting it as a solution raises questions. [[Perception|Perceptual experiences]] depend on [[stimulation|stimuli]] which arrive at various [[Sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in [[Mental representation|mental state]]s; ultimately causing [[Sensation (psychology)|sensation]].{{efn|This may be pleasant, unpleasant, or [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutral]].}} A [[desire]] for food, for example, will tend to cause a person to move their body in a manner and in a direction to obtain food. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of an organ (the [[human brain]]) possessing electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause [[neuron]]s of the brain to fire and muscles to contract in the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[Epistemology|epistemologists]] and [[Philosophy of mind|philosophers of mind]] from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].

===Continuity of consciousness===
====Locke's conception====
[[File:Locke Essay 1690.jpg|thumbnail|[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]] in four books (1690) by [[John Locke]] (1632–1704)]]
[[John Locke]] considered personal identity&lt;ref&gt;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding; Volumes 1–3. By John Locke&lt;/ref&gt; (or the [[self (philosophy)|self]]) to be founded on [[consciousness]] (viz. [[memory]]), and not on the [[substance theory|substance]] of either the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or the [[Human body|body]]. Book II Chapter XXVII entitled "[[On Identity and Diversity]]" in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) has been said to be one of the first modern conceptualizations of consciousness as the repeated self-identification of [[self (philosophy)|oneself]]. Through this identification, [[moral responsibility]] could be attributed to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] and punishment and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] could be justified, as critics such as [[Nietzsche]] would point out.

According to Locke, personal identity (the self) "depends on consciousness, not on substance" nor on the soul. We are the same person to the extent that we are conscious of the past and future thoughts and actions in the same way as we are conscious of present thoughts and actions. If consciousness is this "thought" which "goes along with the substance&amp;nbsp;[...] which makes the same person", then personal identity is only founded on the repeated act of consciousness: "This may show us wherein personal identity consists: not in the identity of substance, but&amp;nbsp;[...] in the identity of consciousness". For example, one may claim to be a [[reincarnation]] of Plato, therefore having the same soul substance. However, one would be the same person as Plato only if one had the same consciousness of Plato's thoughts and actions that he himself did. Therefore, self-identity is not based on the soul. One soul may have various personalities.

Neither is self-identity founded on the body substance, argues Locke, as the body may change while the person remains the same. Even the identity of animals is not founded on their body: "animal identity is preserved in identity of life, and not of substance", as the body of the animal grows and changes during its life. On the other hand, identity of humans is based on their consciousness.{{efn|Take for example a prince's mind which enters the body of a cobbler: to all exterior eyes, the cobbler would remain a cobbler. But to the prince himself, the cobbler would be himself, as he would be conscious of the prince's thoughts and acts, and not those of the cobbler. A prince's consciousness in a cobbler's body: thus the cobbler is, in fact, a prince.}}

But this interesting border-case leads to this problematic thought that since personal identity is based on consciousness, and that only oneself can be aware of his consciousness, exterior human judges may never know if they really are judging—and punishing—the same person, or simply the same body. In other words, Locke argues that may be judged only for the acts of the body, as this is what is apparent to all but God; however, are in truth only responsible for the acts for which are conscious. This forms the basis of the [[insanity defense]]: one cannot be held accountable for acts from which one was [[unconsciousness|unconscious]]—and therefore leads to interesting philosophical questions:

{{quote|personal identity consists [not in the identity of substance] but in the identity of consciousness, wherein if Socrates and the present mayor of Queenborough agree, they are the same person: if the same Socrates waking and sleeping do not partake of the same consciousness, Socrates waking and sleeping is not the same person. And to punish Socrates waking for what sleeping Socrates thought, and waking Socrates was never conscious of, would be no more right, than to punish one twin for what his brother-twin did, whereof he knew nothing, because their outsides were so like, that they could not be distinguished; for such twins have been seen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=205&amp;fk_files=3276103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Or again:

{{quote|PERSON, as I take it, is the name for this self. Wherever a man finds what he calls himself, there, I think, another may say is the same person. It is a forensic term, appropriating actions and their merit; and so belong only to intelligent agents, capable of a law, and happiness, and misery. This personality extends itself beyond present existence to what is past, only by consciousness,—whereby it becomes concerned and accountable; owns and imputes to itself past actions, just upon the same ground and for the same reason as it does the present. All which is founded in a concern for happiness, the unavoidable concomitant of consciousness; that which is conscious of pleasure and pain, desiring that that self that is conscious should be happy. And therefore whatever past actions it cannot reconcile or APPROPRIATE to that present self by consciousness, it can be no more concerned in it than if they had never been done: and to receive pleasure or pain, i.e. reward or punishment, on the account of any such action, is all one as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without any demerit at all. For, supposing a MAN punished now for what he had done in another life, whereof he could be made to have no consciousness at all, what difference is there between that punishment and being CREATED miserable? And therefore, conformable to this, the apostle tells us, that, at the great day, when every one shall 'receive according to his doings, the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open.' The sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all person shall have, that THEY THEMSELVES, in what bodies soever they appear, or what substances soever that consciousness adheres to, are the SAME that committed those actions, and deserve that punishment for them.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=3276103&amp;pageno=209&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Henceforth, Locke's conception of personal identity founds it not on the substance or the body, but in the "same continued consciousness", which is also distinct from the soul since the soul may have no consciousness of itself (as in [[reincarnation]]). He creates a third term between the soul and the body—and Locke's thought may certainly be meditated by those who, following a [[scientist]] [[ideology]],{{efn|Not to be confused with [[scientism]].}} would identify too quickly the brain to consciousness. For the brain, as the body and as any substance, may change, while consciousness remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Volume 18.

====Philosophical intuition====
[[Bernard Williams]] presents a thought experiment appealing to the [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuitions]] about what it is to be the same person in the [[future]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Williams, The Self and the Future, in Philosophical Review 79. No. 2. (Apr., 1970), p. 161–180&lt;/ref&gt;  The thought experiment consists of two approaches to the same experiment.

For the ''first approach'' Williams suggests that suppose that there is some process by which subjecting two persons to it can result in the two persons have "[[Body swap|exchanged]]" bodies. The process has put into the body of person B the [[memories]], [[Dispositional affect|behavioral dispositions]], and [[Big Five personality traits|psychological characteristics]] of the person who prior to undergoing the process belonged to [[Research subject|person A]]; and conversely with [[Research subject|person B]]. To show this one is to suppose that before undergoing the process person A and B are asked to which resulting person, A-Body-Person or B-Body-Person, they wish to receive a punishment and which a reward. Upon undergoing the process and receiving either the punishment or reward, it appears to that A-Body-Person expresses the memories of choosing who gets which treatment as if that person was person B; conversely with B-Body-Person.

This sort of approach to the thought experiment appears to show that since the person who expresses the psychological characteristics of person A to be person A, then intuition is that ''psychological continuity'' is the criterion for personal identity.

The ''second approach'' is to suppose that someone is told that one will have [[Memory erasure|memories erase]]d and then one will be [[torture]]d. Does one need to be [[Fear|afraid]] of being tortured? The intuition is that people will be afraid of being tortured, since it will still be one despite not having one's memories. Next, Williams asked one to consider several similar [[scenarios]].{{efn|The synoptical collage of an event or series of actions and events are: 
* One has memories erased, and are given new [[False memory|"fake" memories]] ([[counterfeit]]), and then one is to be tortured; 
* have one's memories erased, are given copies of another's memories, and then are to be tortured; 
* have one's memories erased, are given another's genuine memories, and then one is to be tortured; 
* have one's memories erased, are given another's genuine memories, that person is given one's memories, and then one is to be tortured.}}
Intuition is that in all the scenarios one is to be afraid of being tortured, that it is still one's self despite having one's memories erased and receiving new memories. However, the last scenario is an [[Law of identity|identical]] scenario to the one in the first scenario.{{efn|With the supposed superfluous information included in the last scenario.}}

In the first approach, intuition is to show that one's ''psychological continuity'' is the criterion for personal identity, but in second approach, intuition is that it is one's ''bodily continuity'' that is the criterion for personal identity. To resolve this conflict Williams feels one's intuition in the second approach is stronger and if he was given the choice of distributing a punishment and a reward he would want his body-person to receive the reward and the other body-person to receive the punishment, even if that other body-person has his memories.

====Psychological continuity====
In [[psychology]], personal continuity, also called ''personal persistence'' or ''self-continuity'', is the uninterrupted connection concerning a particular person of his or her private life and [[personality psychology|personality]]. Personal continuity is the union affecting the facets arising from personality in order to avoid [[:wikt:discontinuity|discontinuities]] from one moment of [[time]] to another time.{{efn|For more, see: [[consciousness]].}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/mar2009/identity-self-image.html Identity and self-image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827233126/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/mar2009/identity-self-image.html |date=2013-08-27 }}. martinfrost.ws.

Associations can result from [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], similarity, or contrast. Through contiguity, one associates ideas or events that usually happen to occur at the same time. Some of these events form an [[autobiographical memory]] in which each is a personal representation of the general or specific events and personal facts.

===Bundle theory of the self===
[[File:A Treatise of Human Nature by David Hume.jpg|thumbnail|A Treatise Of Human Nature: Being An Attempt To Introduce The Experimental Method Of Reasoning Into Moral Subjects. For John Noon, 1739]]
[[David Hume]] undertook looking at the [[mind–body problem]]. Hume also investigated a person's character, the relationship between human and animal nature, and the nature of agency. Hume pointed out that we tend to think that we are the same person we were five years ago. Though we've changed in many respects, the same person appears present as was present then. We might start thinking about which features can be changed without changing the underlying self. Hume, however, denies that there is a distinction between the various features of a person and the mysterious self that supposedly bears those features. When we start introspecting, "we are never intimately conscious of anything but a particular perception; man is a [[bundle theory|bundle]] or collection of different perceptions which succeed one another with an inconceivable rapidity and are in perpetual flux and movement".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise of Human Nature'', I, IV, vi&lt;/ref&gt;

It is plain that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one idea to any other that resembles it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. It is likewise evident that as the senses, in changing their objects, are necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they lie contiguous to each other, the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects.&lt;ref name="bond-of-union"&gt;''A Treatise of Human Nature'', 4.1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note in particular that, in Hume's view, these perceptions do not ''belong to'' anything. Hume, similar to the [[Buddha]],&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism: Way of Life &amp; Thought. By [[Nancy Wilson Ross]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eqdbDZaW1QAC&amp;pg=PA29 p29].&lt;/ref&gt; compares the soul to a [[Commonwealth#Etymology|commonwealth]], which retains its identity not by virtue of some enduring core substance, but by being composed of many different, related, and yet [[System dynamics|constantly changing elements]]. The question of personal identity then becomes a matter of characterizing the [[Cohesion (computer science)|loose cohesion]]{{efn|See also: [[structural cohesion]]}} of one's [[personal experience]].{{efn|In the Appendix to the ''Treatise'', Hume stated that he was dissatisfied with his account of the self, yet he never returned to the issue.}}

In short, what matters for Hume is not that 'identity' exists but that the relations of causation, contiguity, and resemblances obtain among the perceptions. [[Bundle theory#Compresence objection|Critics]] of Hume state in order for the various states and processes of the mind to seem unified, there must be something which perceives their unity, the existence of which would be no less mysterious than a personal identity. Hume solves this by considering substance as engendered by the ''togetherness'' of its properties.

===No-self theory===
The "no-self theory"{{efn|See also: [[Nihilism]], [[Post-left anarchy#Self-theory|Post-left anarchy theory of self]]&lt;br /&gt;''Not to be confused with [[Anatta]]''.}} holds that the self [[Irreducible|cannot be reduced]] to a bundle because the concept of a self is incompatible with the idea of a [[Bundle theory|bundle]]. [[Propositional]]ly, the idea of a bundle implies the notion of bodily or psychological relations that do not in fact exist. [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]], a principal exponent of this view, argues that the ''no-self'' or ''eliminativist theory'' and the bundle or [[reductionist]] theory agree about the non-existence of a [[substantive]] self. The reductionist theory, according to Giles, mistakenly [[dict:revival|resurrects the idea]]{{efn|And, presumably, [[resurrection]].}} of the self&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/The%20No-Self%20Theory%20-%20Hume,%20Buddhism,%20and%20Personal%20Identity%20-%20James%20Giles.pdf The No-Self Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051956/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/The%20No-Self%20Theory%20-%20Hume,%20Buddhism,%20and%20Personal%20Identity%20-%20James%20Giles.pdf |date=2014-08-08 }}: Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity. James Giles&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of various accounts about [[Object relations theory|psychological relations]].{{efn|See also: [[Psychological entropy]].}} The no-self theory, on the other hand, "lets the self lie where it has fallen".&lt;ref&gt;
James Giles, ''No Self to be Found: The Search for Personal Identity'', University Press of America, 1997, p. 10
&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the no-self theory rejects all theories of the self, even the bundle theory. On Giles' reading, Hume is actually a no-self theorist and it is a mistake to attribute to him a reductionist view like the bundle theory. Hume's [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|assertion]] that personal identity is a [[fiction]] supports this reading, according to Giles.

The Buddhist view of personal identity is also a no-self theory rather than a reductionist theory, because [[the Buddha]] rejects attempts to [[Anatta#Developing the self|reconstructions in terms of consciousness, feelings, or the body in notions of an eternal/permanent, unchanging Self]]&lt;ref&gt;
James Giles, 'The No-Self Theory: Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity, ''Philosophy East and West'', 42, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; since our thoughts, personalities&lt;!--,environments/externals?--&gt; and bodies are never the same from moment to moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wrasman|first1=Andy|title=Contradict: They Can't All Be True|publisher=WestBowPress|isbn=9781490829814|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dYkNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=15 January 2017|language=en|date=2014-01-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116191138/https://books.google.de/books?id=dYkNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|archivedate=16 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this line of criticism, the [[Agency (philosophy)|sense of self]] is an [[Biocultural evolution|evolutionary artifact]],{{efn|See also: [[Phenotypic trait]]s, [[Society]] ([[Social artifact]]), [[Culture]] ([[Cultural artifact]]), [[evolutionary psychology]] ([[criticism of evolutionary psychology]]).}} which saves time in the circumstances it evolved for. But sense of self breaks down when considering some events such as [[memory loss]],{{efn|See also: [[Alzheimer]]}} [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality disorder]], [[brain damage]], [[brainwashing]], and various [[thought experiment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophersnet.com/games/identity.htm "Staying alive game - Examples of thought experiments on personal identity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011024327/http://www.philosophersnet.com/games/identity.htm |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When presented with [[Information|imperfection]]s in the intuitive sense of self and the consequences to this concept which rely on the [[Strictly positive measure|strict concept]] of self, a tendency to [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|mend the concept]] occurs, possibly because of [[cognitive dissonance]].{{efn|Though, this does not address the ''loose cohesion of self'' and other similar [[Epistemology|epistemological]] views.}}

'''Positive mental attitude''' ('''PMA''') is a concept first introduced in 1937 by [[Napoleon Hill]] in the book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]''.  The book never actually uses the term, but discusses about the importance of [http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/chi-primetime-pma-022611-story.html positive thinking] as a contributing factor of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Napoleon|title=Think and grow rich|year=1960|publisher=Fawcett Crest|location=Greenwich, Conn.|isbn=0449214923|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Napoleon, along with [[W. Clement Stone]], founder of [[Combined Insurance]], later wrote ''Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude,'' defines positive mental [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] as comprising the 'plus' characteristics represented by words as faith, integrity, hope, optimism, courage, initiative, generosity, tolerance, tact, kindliness and good common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Napoleon|title=Success through a positive mental attitude|year=1987|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=0671743228|author2=Stone, W. Clement Stone  |author3=preface by Og Mandino  |author4= with a new introduction by W. Clement }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kotekar|first=Vivek|date=2017|title=Positive Mental Attitude: A Need of Time|url=http://www.ijip.in/Archive/v4i2/18.01.053.20170402.pdf|journal=The International Journal of Indian Psychology|volume=4|pages=97-102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4760272/ Positive mental attitude] is that philosophy which asserts that having an [[Optimism|optimistic]] disposition in every situation in one's life attracts positive changes and increases achievement. Adherents employ a state of mind that continues to seek, find and execute ways to win, or find a desirable outcome, regardless of the circumstances.  This concept is the opposite of negativity, defeatism and hopelessness. Optimism and hope are vital to the development of PMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=edited by Edward C.|title=Optimism &amp; pessimism implications for theory, research, and practice|year=2001|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-55798-691-6|pages=101–125|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
PMA is under the umbrella of [[positive psychology]].  In positive psychology, high self-efficacy can help in gaining learned optimism which ultimately leads to PMA.  PMA is considered an internal focus of control that influences external factors.  Research has shown that through emotional intelligence training and positive psychology therapy, a person's attitudes and perceptions can be modified to improve one's personal and professional life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Ross|author2=Ryan, J. A.|title=Emotional Intelligence and Positive Psychology: Therapist Tools for Training/Coaching Clients to Move Beyond Emotional Relief|journal=Annals of the American Psychotherapy Assn|year=2005|volume=8|issue=3|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
A study of [[Major League Baseball]] players indicated that a key component that separates major league players from the minor leagues and all other levels is their ability to develop mental characteristics and mental skills.  Among them were mental toughness, confidence, maintaining a positive attitude, dealing with failure, expectations, and positive self-talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Kimberly|title=The mental skills and characteristics related to a major league baseball player's performance: A qualitative study|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|year=2011|volume=71|issue=8-B|pages=5150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Many studies have been done regarding PMA and its effects on health, specifically with people of serious illnesses such as cancer and kidney disease. Cancer specifically has received a lot of attention since Lance Armstrong, along with other survivors, have given their stories.  People with PMA have a significantly higher chance of survival and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rom|first=S. A.|author2=Miller, L. |author3=Peluso, J. |title=Playing the game: Psychological factors in surviving cancer|journal=International Journal of Emergency Mental Health|year=2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=25–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study comparing people with chronic kidney disease with people kidney disease free showed that there was a significant difference between the groups.  The kidney disease free group rated much higher in PMA.  There was no difference found in spirituality and females with chronic kidney disease were found to be significantly more superstitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Subha|first=T. G.|author2=Mukherjee, Tilottama|title=Optimism, superstitious beliefs and spirituality in chronic kidney disease|journal=Indian Journal of Community Psychology|date=September 2010|volume=6|issue=2|pages=262–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A study done with HIV-positive individuals found that a high health self-efficacy, a task-oriented coping style, and a positive mental attitude were strong predictors for a health-promoting lifestyle which has a significant effect on overall health (coping and surviving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larry|first=R. S.|title=Exploring the relationships between perceived health self-efficacy, coping and health-promoting behaviors among non-substance abusing vs. substance abusing patients with HIV disease|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|year=2010|volume=71|issue=1-B|pages=661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Critics of PMA argue that it is not the secret to success but a by-product of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=G.|title=Positive mental bulldust|journal=Australian Journal of Clinical Hypnotherapy|date=March 1980|volume=1|issue=1|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "self-help" industry has been criticized as a scam for authors to make money due to its simplistic writing and principles.  There is little evidence, however, that self-help books, life coaching, and motivational speaking are harmful; a study of 100 psychotherapy patients found that of the 43 patients reading books (e.g. PMA, religious texts, Alcoholics Anonymous texts, etc.) 4 reported "mild harm or distress" while 34 reported "benefit without harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halliday|first=G.|title=Psychological self-help books--How dangerous are they?|journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training|year=1991|volume=28|issue=4|pages=678–680|doi=10.1037/0033-3204.28.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29000">'''Precycling''' is the practice of [[waste reduction|reducing waste]] by attempting to avoid bringing items which will generate [[waste]] into home or business. The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) also cites that precycling is the preferred method of integrated [[solid waste management]] because it cuts waste at its source and therefore trash is eliminated before it is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|pages=1382–1390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the EPA, precycling is also characterized as a decision-making process on the behalf of the consumer because it involves making informed judgments regarding a product’s waste implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=5|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications that are taken into consideration by the consumer include: whether a product is [[Reuse|reusable]], [[durable]], or [[repairable]]; made from renewable or [[non-renewable resource]]s; [[over-packaged]]; and whether or not the container is reusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=6|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Precycling has the ability to build industrial, social, environmental, and economic circumstances that allow for old products to be converted into new resources &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1385}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Industrial: increasing the independence from accumulative substances, such as heavy metals, fossil fuels, synthetics, etc.
*Economic: create a [[circular economy]]
*Ecological/environmental: allowance for more extensive and diverse [[natural habitat]]s where the resources are returned to nature
*Societal: extend the capacity of precycling to meet everyone’s needs
The concept of ‘precycling’ was coined in 1988 by [[social marketing]] executive Maureen O’Rorke in a public waste education campaign for the City of Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=DiChristina|first1=Mariette|title=How We Can Win The War Against Garbage|magazine=Popular Science|year=1990|volume=237|issue=4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The application of precycling is not limited to large corporations, but can be administered on smaller scales in local communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The reason precycling is effective on large scales and on small scales stems from the idea that it shares a common language between experts and non-experts, buyers and sellers, economists and environmentalists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, it is important to consider that waste prevention systems, such as precycling, require the collaborative effort from several working parts.  These parts include prevention targets, producer responsibility, householder charging, funding for pilot projects, public involvement, engagement of private and third sectors, and public campaigns that spread awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|pages=193–219|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration of waste management==
The original three-pronged push for [[waste management]] is "[[Reduce, Reuse, Recycle]]." Precycling emphasizes "reducing and reusing", while harnessing and questioning the momentum and popularity of the term "recycle." In addition to this strategy, precycling incorporates four supplementary R’s: [[Repair]], Recondition, [[Remanufacturing|Remanufacture]] and Refuse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|pages=257–267|url= http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/ |doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste is a resource that can be reused, recycled, recovered, or treated.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1646|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precycling differs from other singular forms of waste prevention because it encompasses not one behavior, but many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=212|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduce===
Reduce is a form of precycling that allows for the preservation of [[natural resources]] and also saves money on behalf of the manufacturer, the consumer, and the waste manager.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, effective source reduction slows the [[resource depletion|depletion of environmental resources]], prolongs the life of waste management facilities, and makes combustion and [[landfill]]s safer by removing [[toxic waste]] components.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Reuse===
[[Reuse]] is a form of precycling that reinvents items after their initial life and avoids creating additional waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushnell|first1=Kristen|last2=Harpster|first2=Amy|last3=Simchuk|first3=Sarah|last4=Manckia|first4=Jen|last5=Stevens|first5=Cathy|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle|date=2009|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although precycling harnesses the familiarity of the term recycling, it is still important to note the difference between recycling and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since precycling focuses on the prevention of waste production, this entails that measures are taken before a substance, material, or product has become waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas recycling is a type of precycling that involves taking action before existing waste is abandoned to nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Recycling is a process where discarded materials are collected, sorted, processed, and used in the production of new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=263|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every time a person engages in the act of recycling, they help increase the market and bring the cost down.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt; However, current research from the American Plastics Council states that only 25% of the nation’s recycling capabilities are being utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krug|first1=Donna|last2=County Agency|first2=Barton|title=It's Easy to be Green|date=2009|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally [[recycling]] requires large amounts of energy to "melt down" and then re-manufacture items. While this may cut down on the amount of trash that is going into [[landfill]]s, it is not sustainable unless the underlying energy supply is sustainable. In addition, recycling often means [[downcycling]] and always involves at least some loss of the original material, so primary extraction is still required to make up the difference. Precycling reduces these problems by using less material in the first place, so less has to be recycled.

===Repairing===
[[Repair]] is a type of precycling that corrects specified faults in a product, however the quality of a repaired product is inferior to reconditioned or remanufactured items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; One survey found that 68% of the respondents believed repairing was not cost efficient and sought alternative methods such as reconditioning or remanufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconditioning===
[[Reconditioning]] is a type of precycling that requires the rebuilding of major components to restore a product’s working condition, which is expected to be inferior to the original product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remanufacturing===
[[Remanufacturing]] is another type of precycling that involves the greatest degree of work content, which results in superior quality of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to remanufacture a product, it requires a total dismantling of the product and the subsequent restoration and replacement of its parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remanufacturing is a preferred method of waste reduction compared to repairing and reconditioning because it preserves the [[embodied energy]] that has been used to shape the components of a product for their first life and it only requires 20-25% of the initial energy used in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refuse===
Refusal to buy certain products due to detrimental impacts on the environment or wasteful packaging is another type of precycling because the rejection of such items paves the way for products that can be reduced, reused, or recycled.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt;

==Zero-waste strategy==
A [[zero waste]] approach aims to prevent rather than just reduce accumulated waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero-waste goes beyond recycling to include the whole system, which includes the flow of resources and waste through human society.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This “design principle” works to maximize recycling, minimize waste, reduce consumption and ensures that products are reused, repaired or recycled back into nature or the market.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This preventative approach is more manageable and effective than incremental approaches that focus on gradually reducing the amount of impact because it is less complex and contains less information, which permits wider public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
In regards to sustainability, the term itself is often associated with resource constraints and maintenance of the status quo rather than growth and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the implementation of a zero-waste management strategy, sustainable practices can push the status quo in order to create a society that is capable of development, technically and culturally advanced, dynamic in population and production, thoughtful with the use of non-renewable resources, and diverse, democratic, and challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic effects===
Increased waste production is often negatively associated with increased [[economic growth]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; However, a zero-waste management strategy allows for economic growth that works cohesively with sustainability rather than against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of a zero-waste strategy is part of an economic goal-set that aims to create a circular economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A circular economy refers to a closed-loop socio-economic system that focuses on minimizing wastes while simultaneously maximizing stocks of resources for the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closed-loop design diverts linear (open-loop) waste disposal streams into new raw material streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=259|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a circular economy, one way to minimize waste is through the employment of precycling insurance, which allows for a full range of financed waste prevention opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of insurance would set premiums related to the risk of a product ending up as waste, and these premiums would serve to fund actions concerning waste prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; When establishing a premium for precycling insurance several factors need to calculated: recyclability or biodegradability; provision of infrastructure, habitat or collaborations for the generation of the product from new resources; the ecosystem concentrations of product components above natural levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of precycling insurance is plausible considering the aim of insurance industries is to avoid losses rather than paying for losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order for this idea to work, private and third sectors need to be involved and engaged in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, a third sector refers to small charities and a handful of societal enterprises that coordinate with charity shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=204|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental effects===
According to the “Extended Producer Responsibility” principle,  impacts are substantially determined at the point of design where key decisions are made on materials, production process, and how products are used and disposed of at the end of life-cycle, which falls on the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=258|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a circular economy there is the recognition that nature’s capacity needs to be maximized through the reprocess of biodegradable wastes produced by industries and human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task is accomplished through the procurement and funding of precycling insurance premiums that invest in systematic preservation of endangered habitats, careful harvesting of biological resources and expansions of productive ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in terms of climate change, precycling insurance offers a flexible alternative to the binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions and international taxation on mineral fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[waste management]] systems, the environment benefits from the reparation of products to the greatest degree because less energy is required and the majority of the original material is kept intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=265|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal effects===
The social structure operating under a circular economy is referred to as a circular society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of a circular society is to create a cooperative culture by means of problem-prevention, resource-availability and fuller participation, with reference to precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One critique of this approach, in terms of waste management, is that it is difficult to maintain a cooperative culture within a society because it is constantly evolving and changing.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt;

==Raising awareness==
There is an increasing [[public awareness]] on the need for [[sustainable production]] and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopewell|first1=Jefferson|last2=Dvorak|first2=Robert|last3=Kosior|first3=Edward|title=Plastics recycling: challenges and opportunities|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2009|volume=364|issue=1526|page=2124|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0311|pmid=19528059|pmc=2873020}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campaign that aimed at raising awareness of precycling focused on whether people’s self-reported behaviors were affected by exposure to precycling advertisements on the radio, television, or in-store flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=12|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that the most effective results stemmed from the inclusion of social rewards that invoke an intrinsic motivation to engage in precycling behaviors.&lt;ref name=gillian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=16|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to raise awareness is through statistics that highlight the potential impacts that can be achieved through waste prevention. For instance, if 70 million Americans bought a half-gallon [[plastic-coated carton]] container of milk each week (instead of two quarts), then 41.6 million pounds of paper discards and 5.7 pounds of plastic discards would be reduced annually.  This transition from two quarts to a half-gallon would save $145.6 million on packaging each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In order to effectively implement precycling practices and behaviors, the public needs to feel "enabled", "engaged", "encouraged", and "exemplified" in their efforts to partake in precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=196|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can the average consumer practice precycling, but industries can also participate. Purchasing from parts suppliers, reuse of chemicals, and reduction of unnecessary packaging are some methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Precycling|work=Environmental Encyclopedia|publisher=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some companies and countries that have taken it upon themselves to implement more sustainable practices that align with precycling principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1647|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Fonterra]] reduced its packaging through the implementation of bulking, reuse and redesign.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt; Further, [[Waste in New Zealand|Waste Management New Zealand]] created Recycle New Zealand, which provided a subsidiary focusing on the collection of materials that could be diverted and sorted prior to the operations of reducing, recycling, or recovering.  Moving forward, free-trade organizations can further implement precycling practices by exploring this strategy as a new way to reduce regulations and to promote greater industrial freedom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the individual consumer can develop precycling habits by engaging in the following practices and behaviors:

==="Enviro-shopping"===
Enviro-shopping is considered shopping with the environment and implements a precycling strategy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Bringing one's own grocery bag or bring old ones back to the store 
*Buying packages with the least amount of packaging 
*Buying in bulk, but not buying more than one will use
*Looking for products with reusable dishes

===Product selection===
Products to choose from in accordance with precycling principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plastic milk jugs or glass milk containers (no cartons)
*Fresh fruit and vegetables
*Concentrated products that involves less packaging
*Recycled products
*[[Rechargeable battery|Rechargeable batteries]]

===Behaviors===
In addition to shopping practices that implement precycling principles, there are also behaviors that can be undertaken to prevent waste:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=200|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Home [[compost]]ing
*Avoid [[Advertising mail|junk mail]]
*Buy [[used good|second-hand]]
*One way to participate in precycling is to carry a "precycling kit". Include a [[Tupperware]] or non-[[disposable]] container, [[silver (household)|silverware]] set, a [[napkin|cloth napkin]] or [[handkerchief]], and a [[thermos]] or water-bottle within a [[cloth]] bag that can double as a [[grocery bag|grocery/shopping bag]].

In [[mathematics]], more precisely in [[formal language theory]], the profinite words are the generalization of the notion of finite words into a [[Cauchy completion|complete topological space]]. This notion allows to use [[topology]] to study languages and finite semigroups. For example, profinite words are used to give an alternative characterization to the algebraic notion of [[variety of finite semigroups]].

==Definition==

Let '''A''' an [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]. The set of profinite words over '''A''' consists in the [[Completion (topology)|completion]] of a metric space defined on the set &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt; of words over '''A'''. The distance used to define this metric space is defined using a notion of separation of words. Those notions are now defined.

===Separation===
Let '''M''' and '''N''' [[monoid]]s, let '''p''' and '''q''' be elements of the monoid '''M'''. Let '''φ''' a [[morphism]] of monoid from '''M''' to '''N'''. It is said that the morphism φ separates '''p''' and '''q''' if &lt;math&gt;\phi(p)\ne\phi(q)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z, w\mapsto |w|&lt;/math&gt; sending a words to the parity of its length separates the words '''ababa''' and '''abaa'''. Indeed &lt;math&gt;\phi(ababa)=1\ne0=\phi(abaa)&lt;/math&gt;. 

It is said that '''N''' separates '''p''' and '''q''' if there exists a morphism of monoid φ from '''M''' to '''N''' which separates '''p''' and '''q'''. Using previous example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; separates '''ababa''' and '''abaa'''. More generally, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; separates any words whose size are not congruent modulo '''n'''. In general, any two distinct words can be separated, using the monoid whose elements are the factors of '''p''' plus a fresh element 0. The morphism sends prefixes of '''p''' to themselves and everything else to 0.

===Distance===
The distance between two distinct words '''p''' and '''q''' is defined as the inverse of the size of the least morphism '''N''' separating '''p''' and '''q'''. Thus, the distance of '''ababa''' and '''abaa''' is &lt;math&gt;\frac12&lt;/math&gt;. The distance of '''p''' and itself is defined as 0.

This distance '''d''' is ultrametric, and furthermore it satisfies &lt;math&gt;d(uw,vw)\le d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(wu,wv)\le d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since any word '''p''' can be separated from any other word using a monoid with '''|p|+1''' elements, where '''|p|''' is the length of '''p''', it follows that the distance between '''p''' and any other word is at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|p|}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the topology defined by this metric is discrete. 
===Profinite topology===
The profinite topology over '''A''', denoted &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;, is the [[Completion (topology)|completion]] of the set of finite words under the distance defined above. It should be noted that the completion preserve the monoid structure.

The topology &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt; is compact.

Any monoid morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to M&lt;/math&gt;, with '''M''' finite can be extended uniquely into  a morphism &lt;math&gt;\hat\phi:\hat A^*\to M&lt;/math&gt;, and this morphism is uniformly continuous.  Furthermore, it is the least topological space with this property.

===Profinite word===
A profinite word is an element of the profinite topology. And a profinite language is a set of profinite word. Each finite words are profinite words. A few examples of profinite words which are not finite are now given.

For '''m''' any word, let &lt;math&gt;m^\omega&lt;/math&gt; denote &lt;math&gt;\lim_{i\to\infty}m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy sequence]]. Intuitively, to separate &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m^{i'!}&lt;/math&gt;, a monoid should count at least up to &lt;math&gt;\min(i,i')&lt;/math&gt;, hence requires at least &lt;math&gt;\min(i,i')&lt;/math&gt; elements. Since &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy sequence]], &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a profinite word.

Furthermore, the word &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is idempotent. This is due to the fact that, for any morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to N&lt;/math&gt; with '''N''' finite, &lt;math&gt;\phi(m^{i!})=\phi(m)^{i!}=n^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; for some '''n''' belonging to '''N'''. Since '''N''' is finite, for '''i''' great enough, &lt;math&gt;n^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is idempotent, and the sequence is constant. 

Similarly, &lt;math&gt;m^{\omega+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m^{\omega-1}&lt;/math&gt; are defined as &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}m^{n!+ 1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}m^{n!-1}&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

==Profinite languages==
The notion of profinite languages allow to relate notions of [[semigroup theory]] to notions of topology. More precisely, given  '''P''' a profinite language, the following statements are equivalent:
*'''P''' is clopen.
*'''P''' is [[recognizable_set|recognizable]],
*The [[syntactic congruence]] of '''P''' is clopen, as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*\times\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Similar statements also holds for languages '''P''' of finite words.  The following conditions are equivalent.
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is recognisable (as a subset of &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt;),
*the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of '''P''', &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt;, is recognisable (as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;), where 
*&lt;math&gt;P=K\cap A^*&lt;/math&gt;, for some clopen '''K''',
*&lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt; is clopen.

Those characterisations are due to the more general fact that, taking the closure of a finite language, and restricting a profinite language to finite words are inverse operations, when they are applied to recognisable languages.

'''Reactive inhibition''' is a phrase coined by [[Clark L. Hull]] (1951) in his postulate X.A.:&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever a reaction ''R'' is evoked from an organism there is left an increment of primary negative drive ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; which inhibits to a degree according to its magnitude the reaction potential&lt;sub&gt; ''S''&lt;/sub&gt;''E''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; to that response (Hull, 1951, p. 74).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Hull's postulate X.B. inhibition ''I'' dissipates exponentially with time ''t'':.:&lt;blockquote&gt;With the passage of time since its formation ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; spontaneously dissipates approximately as a simple decay function of the time ''t'' elapsed, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;I'_R = I_R x 10^{-at}&lt;/math&gt; (Hull, 1951, p. 74).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hull's decay formula is somewhat awkward and might give rise to confusion. For example, ''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; does not refer to the derivative of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;. A more convenient way of writing the formula would be as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = I(0) e^{-bt}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;b = a \ln (10)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;I(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the inhibition at the beginning the time interval [0,''t'']. Note, that if one takes the natural logarithm of both sides one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(t) = Y(0) - bt&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y(t) = \ln  I(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y(0) = \ln  I(0)&lt;/math&gt;. The last formula is used in [[inhibition theory]].

Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables, was higher in developing countries, with $156 billion invested, mainly in China, India, and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;FS-UNEP Collaborating Centre, [http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf Global trends in renewable energy investment], 2016 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developing countries have abundant [[renewable energy]] resources, including [[solar energy]], [[wind power]], [[geothermal energy]], and [[biomass]], as well as the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these. By developing such energy sources developing countries can reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas, creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises. In many circumstances, these investments can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems.&lt;ref name=mdg&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, [[electricity grid]] extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the [[diesel generator]]s that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as [[kerosene lamp]]s and [[biomass|traditional biomass]].&lt;ref name=reeee/&gt;

[[Kenya]] is the world leader in the number of [[solar power]] systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small [[solar panel]]s, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"&gt;http://en.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=38323&amp;TId=97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for renewable energy==
In 2009, about 1.4 billion of people in the world lived without electricity, and 2.7 billion relied on wood, charcoal, and dung for home energy requirements. This lack of access to modern energy technology limits income generation, blunts efforts to escape poverty, affects people's health, and contributes to global deforestation and climate change. Small-scale renewable energy technologies and [[distributed energy]] options, such as onsite solar power and improved cookstoves, offer rural households
modern energy services.&lt;ref name=verlaw&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2198045 |title=Deploying Off-Grid Technology to Eradicate Energy Poverty |author=Sovacool, Benjamin K., |date=5 October 2012 |work=Science (vol. 338, 47-48)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from [[fossil fuels]] can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf Power for the People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120425/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf |date=2012-03-30 }} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy doesn't always have to come from a developing country. The Developing Areas Study Group session is a group of speakers from all over the energy businesses discusses the potential ideas to get developing countries the renewable energy that they need. Papers written by W. Morgan, R. Moss and P. Richard discuss the opportunities of renewable resources that lie within the developing country as well. Morgan and Richard claim firewood and agriculture could play a great role in an alternative energy solution in developing countries, while Richards claims that efficient use of agriculture could lead to renewable energy. Morgan also points out that green plants could play a great role in producing synthetic fuel alcohol, which would not only impact the developing country but the world as a whole in providing an alternative fuel source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor= 20001554 |title= Energy in Developing Countries |last= McDonald |first= Paul |date= 1980 |journal= Area |accessdate= |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in renewable energies has increased in recent years due to environmental concern about [[global warming]] and [[air pollution]], reduced costs of the technologies themselves, and improved efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt; In recent years, supportive programs from governments, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and community cooperatives have expanded access to these off-grid technologies and the energy services they provide. Program planners should select “low-hanging fruit” first, aiming for maximum access to modern energy services with the least effort.&lt;ref name=verlaw/&gt;

==Use of renewables==
Collectively, developing countries have more than half of global renewable power capacity. China and India are rapidly expanding markets for renewable energy. Brazil produces most of the world’s sugar-derived ethanol and has been adding new biomass and wind power plants. Many renewable markets are growing at rapid rates in countries such as Argentina, Costa Rica, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=ren9&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, electricity grid extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the diesel generators that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass.&lt;ref name="reeee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Renew_Policies.pdf |title=Renewable Energy |author=IEA |year=2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |author= Kevin Bullis |date= January 27, 2012 |work= Technology Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.&lt;ref name=re10&gt;REN21 (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf |title=The Rise of Renewable Energy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-hydro systems configured into village-scale or county-scale mini-grids serve many areas. More than 30 million rural households get lighting and cooking from biogas made in household-scale systems. These stoves are being manufactured in factories and workshops worldwide, and more than 160 million households now use them.&lt;ref name = re10/&gt;

===Poverty alleviation===
{{See also|Energy poverty}}
Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty alleviation]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

===Education===
Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children spend out of school collecting fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/grameen08 |title=Grameen Shakti installs efficient stoves as well as solar home systems |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
2.4 billion people use only traditional biomass, such as wood, residues and dung, for cooking and heating. The constant use of these types of energy sources exposes them to indoor particulate and carbon monoxide concentrations many times higher than [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) standards. "Traditional stoves using dung and charcoal emit large amounts of carbon monoxide and other noxious gases. Women and children suffer most, because they are exposed for the longest periods of time. Acute respiratory illnesses affect as much as 6% of the world population. The WHO estimates that 2.5 million women and young children in developing countries die prematurely each year from breathing the fumes from indoor biomass stoves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull442/44204002429.pdf|title=IAEA BULLETIN, 44/2/2002|pages=28, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Renewable energy can improve this situation by reducing exposure to indoor pollutants.

Furthermore, renewable can also provide energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment in rural areas where the access to electricity is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/kxn |title=PV-powered vaccine fridges |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also provide power to supply the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

==Government policies==
{{Further|Renewable energy policy}}
More developing countries are implementing the public policies needed for the widespread development of renewable energy technologies and markets, which have traditionally been dominated by Europe, Japan, and North America. The exceptions include countries like Brazil, which has built the world’s leading [[biofuel]]s industry, [[Renewable energy in China|China]], India, which are leaders in developing decentralized renewable sources such as [[small hydro]], small wind, biogas, and solar water heating.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;
However, policies like [[feed-in tariff]] are applied. Besides, with the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the program called the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) that allows for industrialized nations to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/adaptation_fund/items/3659.php Adaptation Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing-country Governments need to steer resources mobilized for large-scale investments into new production sectors and new technologies. Some argue that policies should base on active industrial policies, combining large scale investments and active policy interventions. There is a need of subsidizing these type of energy services to make them affordable to the major part of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/desa/desalert/2009/WESS_overview_en.pdf|title=World Economic and Social Survey 2009 Promoting Development, Saving, 2009, the Planet|pages=4, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bangui Wind Mills.JPG|thumb|[[Bangui Wind Farm]] in [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Philippines]]]] The [[Philippines|Philippine]] government sees the growth of the renewable energy sector essential for national energy security. The Philippines' fossil fuel sector is unsustainable, being dependent on the import of nonrenewable fuel, including petroleum, but has significant potential in the renewable energy sector. Based on a report of an Australian consulting firm, International Energy Consultants, the Philippines has the highest electricity rate in Asia, followed by [[Japan]]. Transmitting power and transporting fuel throughout the Philippine archipelago is problematic due to very high cost.&lt;ref name=manila.b&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/325264/the-right-mix-the-philippines-achieving-its-renewable-energy-goals&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines could be considered a world leader in renewable energy, with its 30 percent of its power generation being powered by the renewable energy sector. the Philippines is the world's second largest generator of geothermal energy and was the first [[Southeast Asia]]n nation to invest in large-scale solar and wind technologies.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;

Promotion and support of renewable energy in the country was intensified with the passing of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 which made a feed-in-tariff and a renewable portfolio standard. The Philippines aims to triple renewable energy supply by 2030.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/06/14/11/philippines-lifts-2030-renewable-energy-target&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the government has concluded agreements with private developers for extensive projects in Oriental Mindoro with an eventual output of 48 MW, with plans for even larger development in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://samueldalsanto.com/2012/04/14/samuel-helps-philippines-wind-power-project-get-presidential-approval/&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite government efforts, some investors have criticized the government's lack of firmness in its feed-in-tariff policy, and the solar industry accused the government for hampering its progress in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbiz.asia/story/policy-problems-hamper-philippine-renewables-growth&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Kenya}}
In [[Kenya]], the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum&lt;ref&gt;The Ministry of Energy http://www.energy.go.ke/?page_id=2&lt;/ref&gt; is in charge of renewable energy policies. In March 2008, the country adopted the [[feed-in tariff]] policy. In January 2010, the policy was revised to urge private sectors to invest in electricity generation from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/feed%20in%20tarriffs2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"/&gt; The only other country in Africa utilising geothermal power is [[Ethiopia]].

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans are turning to solar power every year rather than making connections to the country’s electric grid. This is due to the high connectivity costs and the fact that there is an abundance of solar power in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf The Rise of Renewable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renewable energy]] accounted for more than 85.4% of the domestically produced electricity used in Brazil, according to preliminary data from the 2009 National Energy Balance, conducted by the Energy Research Corporation (EPE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2009/12/brazils-wind-power-auction-spurs-more-clean-energy-development.html Renewable energy in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt; After the oil shocks of the 1970s, Brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy, mainly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|sugarcane ethanol]]. Its large sugarcane farms helped. In 1985, 91% of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol. The success of [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, introduced in 2003, together with the mandatory E25 blend throughout the country, have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by February 2008.&lt;ref name="ANP07_2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|title=ANP: consumo de álcool combustível é 50% maior em 2007|author=Agência Brasil|date=2008-07-15|publisher=Invertia|accessdate=2008-08-09|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226014527/http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|archivedate=2008-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redebrasilatual.com.br/temas/economia/gabrielli-etanol-reduzira-mercado-de-gasolina-a-17-ate-2020 90% of cars produced in Brazil are Flexfuel]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''resident register''' is a [[government database]] which contains information on the current [[Residency (domicile)|residence]] of persons. In countries where registration of residence is compulsory, the current place of residence must be reported to the [[registration office]] or the [[police]] within a few days after establishing a new residence. In some countries, residence information may be obtained indirectly from [[voter registration|voter register]]s or registers of [[driver license]]s. Besides a formal resident registers or population registers, residence information needs to be disclosed in many situations, such as voter registration, passport application, and updated in relation to drivers licences, motor vehicle registration, and many other purposes. The [[Domicile (law)|permanent place of residence]] is a common criterion for taxation including the assessment of a person's [[income tax]].

== Africa ==

=== South Africa ===
[[South Africa]] introduced the ''Population Registration Act'' in 1950, which created a national population register, and required the classification of residents based on race, and the issuing of identity cards.{{sfn|Clark|Worger|2004|pp=46-47}} This system formed an important part in the [[pass laws]], one of the dominant features of South Africa's [[apartheid]] system, after the ''Native Laws Amendment Act'' and the ''Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents Act'' of 1952 regularized their use.{{sfn|Clark|Worger|2004|pp=46-47}} The apartheid system effectively ended in 1986.

== Americas ==

=== Canada ===
Canada does not have compulsory registration of residence, though residence information needs to be disclosed in many situations, such as voter registration, passport application, provincial health care card, and updated in relation to drivers licences, motor vehicle registration, and many other purposes.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

=== United States ===
Neither the [[federal government of the United States]] nor any [[U.S. state]] has formal resident registration systems. Refusing or neglecting to answer questions for the [[United States Census]], such as current address, is punishable by fines of $100, for a property or business agent to fail to provide correct names for the census is punishable by fines of $500, and for a business agent to provide false answers for the census is punishable by fines of $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|13|221}}-224&lt;/ref&gt; Registrants in the [[Selective Service System]] ([[conscription in the United States]]) must notify Selective Service within 10 days of any changes to any of the information he provided on his registration card, like a change of address.&lt;ref name="ack"&gt;[http://www.sss.gov/ack.htm Proof of Registration &amp; Change of Address], Selective Service System.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|32|1621|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[California]], anyone with a driver's license must notify [[California Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] of a change of address within 10 days or face a typical fine of $214,&lt;ref&gt;California Vehicle Code § 14600&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sacgrandjury0910"&gt;[[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]] [[grand juries in the United States#California|Grand Jury]] [http://www.sacgrandjury.org/reports/09-10/Sac%20County%20Grand%20Jury%20Report%202010%20Complete.pdf 2009-2010 Final Report], pp. 171-173&lt;/ref&gt; and anyone who has applied for or received a [[vehicle registration]] must notify DMV of a change of address within 10 days or face a typical fine of $178.&lt;ref name="sacgrandjury0910"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Vehicle Code § 4159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voter registration in the United States|Voter registration]] has a residency requirement and is used for [[jury]] assignments and other government tasks.

A person's current address is often registered for state-issued [[identification card]]s and [[driver license]]s. In some jurisdictions a "non-driver's license" or "non-driver photo identification card" is issued as a document containing residence details. Each state has their own requirements for keeping documents up-to-date and may require persons moving into the state to obtain a driver's license from that state within a given period of time (generally 10–90 days).{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Aliens in the United States staying for more than thirty days are generally required to register with the Federal government pursuant to the [[Smith Act]] and carry proof of registration at all times; for permanent residents, the proof of registration comes in the form of a [[Permanent residence (United States)|Permanent Residence Card]] ("Green card") while, for other aliens, this can be in the form of either an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) or the [[I-94 (document)|I-94]] card together with a valid passport.

== Europe ==

=== European Union ===
Within the Europe Union a regulation for the European-wide [[census]] was agreed that allows for a ''register-based census'' that may use the continuously updated information from the national resident registers with a statistical correction drawn from a sample census performed at another magnitude of the census poll. The first register census was performed in 1981 in Denmark, joined later by other Nordic countries. Germany, Austria and Switzerland intend to use a register-based census model for the [[2011 European Union census|EU Census scheduled for 2011]].&lt;ref name="census-bw"&gt;[http://www.statistik-bw.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/essay.asp?xYear=2006&amp;xMonth=06&amp;eNr=02 Statistische Monatshefte Baden-Württemberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618135031/http://www.statistik-bw.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/essay.asp?xYear=2006&amp;xMonth=06&amp;eNr=02 |date=2009-06-18 }}, issue 06/2006 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Given the financial benefit it is expected that more countries will switch to a register census model.

=== Austria ===
The residence reporting requirement ({{lang|de|Meldepflicht}}) requires a change of address to be registered and deregistered within 3 days.&lt;ref name="ummeldung-at"&gt;[http://zmr.bmi.gv.at/pages/meldepflicht.htm ZMR Meldepflicht], Bundesministerium des Innern&lt;/ref&gt; The current place of residence is reported by means of a registration form ({{lang|de|Meldezettel}}) sent to the local administrative authority ({{lang|de|Gemeindeamt}} or {{lang|de|Magistratisches Bezirksamt}} in cities).

On 1 March 2002 the regional resident registers were centrally stored on the newly established {{lang|de|Zentrales Melderegister}} (ZMR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.gv.at/presse/2002-02-27.asp Pressekonferenz Zentrales Melderegister]. BM.I, 2002-02-27&lt;/ref&gt; Some larger cities continue to run their own local resident registers ({{lang|de|Lokales Melderegister}} or LMR), which are synchronized with the central database. A residence document from the database is called {{lang|de|Meldeauskunft}}, and includes information about third persons unless those have filed to restrict public access ({{lang|de|Auskunftsperre}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ris2.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR40050278/NOR40050278.html § 18 Meldegesetz]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006 the ZMR was extended to include additional personal details from the civil registers; It is envisaged to include records from even more government databases.

Permanent access to the ZMR is granted to some profession that require regular residence checks like lawyers, banks, professional associations and collection agencies.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, a change of address must be declared to the municipality within eight days of its occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belgium.be/nl/huisvesting/verhuizen/adreswijziging|title=Adreswijziging|date=2015-03-10|newspaper=Belgium.be|language=nl|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belgium.be/fr/logement/demenagement/changement_d_adresse|title=Changement d'adresse|date=2015-03-10|newspaper=Belgium.be|language=fr|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality verifies the change of address by sending a police or municipal officer to the new address. If the change of residence is confirmed it is registered in the municipal and national registers and the resident or residents concerned must present themselves to the municipal administration to have their national identity card and any motor vehicle registration papers updated. The change of address is forwarded by the municipality to social security agencies.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
The compulsory resident register was handled separately by the regional offices even before Yugoslavia was split into sovereign states.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

=== Denmark ===
The compulsory resident register is run by the ''folkeregister'' which hands out a CPR-Number (Central Person Register number). Foreigners need to register when intending to stay longer than six months.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

=== Finland ===
The compulsory resident register is run by the [[Population Register Centre (Finland)|Population Register Centre]], a government agency that also hands out the [[National identification number#Finland|Personal Identity Code]], which consists of eleven characters: six digits for the birth date, one character for the birth century, three additional digits and a checksum character. Many companies and societies have registered for direct access to the resident register. Upon relocation, one only needs to declare the new address to the resident register and these companies will update their address registers accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vaestorekisterikeskus.fi/default.aspx?id=41 | title=Customers updating address information from the Population Information System | accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this makes it easier to handle the administrative tasks of taking a new home it has also been criticized for its lack of personal [[data privacy]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== France ===
France utilizes a [[national identity card (France)|national identity card]] ({{lang|fr|carte nationale d’identité sécurisée}} or CNIS), an official non-compulsory identity document. The address information on the card is merely derived from other documents like electricity bills. There is no requirement to notify change of address, which leads to the situation that the current address is often verified by showing bills relating to the current home.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

There are plans to introduce a new identity card ({{lang|fr|carte d'identité nationale électronique sécurisée}} or INES) that was to be implemented starting in 2007, but they are still in the legislative process. The scheme bears many similarities to the British ID card.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Germany ===
The resident registration is a task of the community which do often create a separate resident registration offices to run the resident register ({{lang|de|Einwohnermelderegister}} or {{lang|de|Melderegister}}). The resident register is a public register in Germany — within the limits of resident privacy ({{lang|de|Meldegeheimnis}}) laws and regulations. Since 2007 the registration office will electronically de-register at the registration office of the old residency. The concept of the registered primary residence ({{lang|de|[[Hauptwohnsitz]]}}) has special legal ramifications, primarily involving [[tax]].

Although Germany (similarly to Austria and Switzerland) has a strict registration system for centuries, there had been a strong opposition towards a single [[National identification number#Germany|identification number]]. All registration numbers were local to the [[Registration Office]] — even split within a single community to the office for civil register, tax office, etc. In 2008 a new system was introduced with a national tax payer number. It is still debated how much more information will be attached to the national identification number when the federal resident register is activated.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no central administration of resident registration in Germany. The exception is the registration of resident aliens (see [[Central Register of Foreign Nationals (Germany)]]). Registration is organized by 5283 local offices throughout Germany.&lt;ref name="Deutschland-Online"&gt;[https://archive.is/20110809101446/http://www.deutschland-online.de/DOL_Internet/broker.jsp?uMen=c9110eca-0f05-1114-fbf1-b1ac0c2f214a&amp;page=1&amp;pagesize=5&amp;_ic_menu=true&amp;all=true&amp;press=truevgl. BMI:''Bundesmelderegister'' auf Deutschland-Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2009, the legal requirements pertaining to resident registration were governed by [[States of Germany|state]] legislation, which differed in terms of the period allowed to register a change of address (immediately in [[Rheinland-Pfalz|RP]]; within 1 week in [[Baden-Württemberg|BW]], [[Bavaria|BY]], [[Hamburg|HH]], [[Hessen|HE]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|MV]], [[Niedersachsen|NI]], [[Nordrhein-Westfalen|NW]], [[Saarland|SL]], [[Sachsen-Anhalt|ST]], [[Thuringia|TH]]; and within two weeks in [[Berlin|BE]], [[Brandenburg|BB]], [[Bremen|HB]], [[Schleswig-Holstein|SH]], and [[Sachsen|SN]]). Each state was able to produce its own laws and regulations governing access to personal information in the register and the fees for providing a residency document ({{lang|de|Melderegisterauskunft}} for oneself or for a third person.

The "Federalism Reform", which became effective on 1 September 2006, has moved the legislation for resident registration to the federal level. The [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] was preparing a federal law to replace the state laws on resident registration which scheduled to get effective by 2010. The new law would assign that a Federal Resident Register (''Bundesmelderegister'') shall be created to be run in parallel with the local resident registers.&lt;ref name="Deutschland-Online"/&gt; The nationwide register shall assemble a number of personal identifying information drawing from multiple sources including resident registers, civil registers and taxation offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datenschutzbeauftragter-online.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/bmr.pdf Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Fortentwicklung des Meldewesens]&lt;/ref&gt; During a scandal with list brokers obtaining large amounts of addresses from catalog selling company databases in 2008, the coalition split up over the question — [[Brigitte Zypries]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) opposed the plans of the ministry of interior led by [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]). She proposed that the current local registration offices should be networked instead. In the new government of CDU and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] the plans are blocked, as such a central database is in clear opposition to the FDP's aim to increase data privacy.

===Greece===
EU citizens who plan to reside in Greece for a period of more than 90 days are required to register themselves at the Department of Foreigners ({{lang-gr|Πίνακας Αδειών Αλλοδαπών/Διεύθυνση Αλλοδαπών}} located at the police stations, in the area of residency ({{lang-gr|Τμήμα Αλλοδαπών}}), where a Certificate of Registration ({{lang-gr|βεβαίωσης εγγραφής πολιτών της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωση}}) in beige color is issued. According to the Greek law, EU citizens who do not register are subject to a fine. However, it is very rare that this certificate is ever requested. Some Greek authorities are not even aware of the European Union directive and do not know that this certificate exists. In many cases, the tax identification number (AFM) ({{lang-gr|(Αριθμός Φορολογικός Μητρώου (ΑΦΜ)}}) is used as proof of residency.
EU citizens living in Greece for more than 5 years can apply for Permanent Residence Certificate ({{lang-gr|Eγγραφο Πιστοποίησης Μόνιμης Διαμονής Πολίτη}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingincrete.net/ResidencePermit.html Residence / Registration Certificate in Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===
The compulsory resident register is run by ''Központi Adatfeldolgozó, Nyilvántartó és Választási Hivatal, Igazgatási és Felügyeleti Föösztály'' in Budapest. Hungarian citizens will declare their residency to the local administration while foreigners will register in the immigration office.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Iceland ===
Iceland has a central register of residents. Registration is compulsory.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Italy ===
In Italy the registration of residence is compulsory and the records are kept on a decentralized system. Unlike other countries a reported place of residence is physically checked by government officials as well as the de-registration of a previous residence. Hence, the official confirmation may take up to four months. Residents moving to a new place of residence abroad are recorded as expatriates on the database "Anagrafe degli Italiani Residenti all'Estero (A.I.R.E.)" (Registry of Italians Resident Abroad).  When they return to Italy, they are de-registered from A.I.R.E and their new residence is registered by the local administrative authority.

A.I.R.E. enrolment is obligatory for citizens who take up residence in a foreign country for more than 12 months and for citizens residing abroad either as a result of being born there or having obtained Italian citizenship for any reason whatsoever. Enrolment in the A.I.R.E. is done by means of a declaration (special form available) made to the locally competent consular office within 90 days of transfer abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registry of Italians Resident Abroad (A.I.R.E.)|url=http://www.esteri.it/mae/en/italiani_nel_mondo/serviziconsolari/aire.html/|website=Farnesina - Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luxembourg ===
A change of address or move must be declared to the local authorities of the new place of residence within eight days (including arrivals by EU/EEA citizens). Non-EU citizens, however, must declare their arrival to the local authorities within three days, regardless of their intended duration of stay. A permanent or indefinite departure from Luxembourgish territory must also be declared to the local authorities no later than the day before the departure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guichet.public.lu/citoyens/fr/citoyennete/installation-demenagement-luxembourg/declaration-arrivee/depart-arrivee-commune/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
The compulsory resident register was run by the ''Bureau Vestigingsregister'' in The Hague until 1994.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Since 1994 the Municipal Basic Administration of Personal Information (Gemeentelijke Basisadministratie Persoonsgegevens or GBA) is used.  This is a central database fed into by all Dutch municipalities.  All residents of the Netherlands (citizens and non-citizens alike) are required to register with their municipality.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Norway ===
The Norwegian register of residents is ''Det sentrale folkeregisteret (DSF)'', otherwise commonly called ''Folkeregisteret''. The English translation is the ''National Population Register''.

This register is compulsory for all inhabitants of Norway, but foreigners only need to register when they intend to stay longer than 3 months.

The [[Norwegian Tax Administration]] is responsible for ensuring that the register is complete and up-to-date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skatteetaten.no/en/Person/ | title=Skatteetaten - Person | accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Register contains the following person information: birth date, name, paternity and parental responsibility, residence address, marital status, possible death date, citizenship and several other information elements. It tracks both the current value of these elements and historical versions. It is also used as basis for the tax register, the electoral register and is used for population statistics. Information from the Register is used by most other government agencies, such as the [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration]] (NAV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skatteetaten.no/en/Person/National-Registry/This-is-the-National-Registry/ | title=Skatteetaten - This is the National Registry | accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portugal ===
There is no resident register in Portugal.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Romania ===
Romania utilizes the national [[Romanian identity card|identity card]] ({{lang|ro|carte de identitate}} or CI) system, based on an official compulsory identity document for the registration of all residents. The service is locally administered under the co-ordination of the Directorate for Persons Record and Databases Management (from the Ministers of Administration and Interior). There is a requirement to notify any change of address.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Russian Federation ===

{{main|Registration in Russia}}

Residence registration is compulsory in Russian Federation. There are separate registers for [[Citizenship of Russia|Russian citizens]] and foreign citizens or stateless persons, both administered by the [[Main Directorate for Migration Affairs (Russia)|Main Directorate for Migration Affairs]] which is a department of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]. Anyone may request address information for a specific person from these registers, but a consent for the address disclosure from the latter is obligatory and will be checked by the register operator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gosuslugi.ru/ru/card/index.php?coid_4=3&amp;poid_4=89&amp;soid_4=294&amp;toid_4=484&amp;info_4=1&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases government offices will refuse to provide services to people who are not registered in districts where these offices are located, although the law does not allow to do so to people who are not registered at all.

Russian citizens must register their permanent residence within 7 days, temporary residence must be registered after staying in the same place for more than 90 days.

Foreign citizens and stateless persons who have residence permits are obliged to register their permanent residence within 7 days. Temporary residence of foreign citizens and stateless persons is registered on an application from their host (including an employer, hotel administration, etc.). Such an application should be filed within 7 days.

Applications are delivered to Main Directorate for Migration Affairs offices by communal services companies, by applicants themselves, by post or by means of electronic government.&lt;ref&gt;http://epgu.gosuslugi.ru/foreign/?userLang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian citizens who fail to register in time can be fined 2000-2500 rubles ($70–$80). Russian hosts who fail to register their foreign guests in time can be fined 2000-500000 rubles ($70–$17000). Foreign citizens who fail to register in time can be fined 2000-5000 rubles ($70–$170).

=== Serbia ===
The compulsory resident register was handled separately by the regional offices even before the Yugoslavia was split into sovereign states.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Sweden ===
The mandatory [[population registration in Sweden|Swedish population register]] ({{lang|sv|folkbokföringsregister}}) is administered by the [[Swedish Tax Agency]] ({{lang|sv|Skatteverket}}), which also administers the [[personal identity number (Sweden)|Swedish personal identity number]] ({{lang|sv|personnummer}}), the [[national identification number]].

Almost all companies have registered for direct access to the resident register like telephone companies, electricity companies and so on. This leads to the situation that upon relocation one does only need to declare the new address to the resident register and all bills will be rerouted automatically to the new location. Although this makes it easier to handle the administrative tasks of taking a new home it has also been criticized for its lack of personal [[data privacy]].{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Switzerland and Liechtenstein ===
The compulsory resident registration is called ''Einwohnerkontrolle'' (residents' control) in Liechtenstein and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland. The residents' registers are subject to the local authority named ''Einwohneramt'' (residency office), ''Einwohnerkontrolle'' (residents registry office) or ''Personenmeldeamt'' (persons' registration office). Foreign residents are subject to the federal residents' register run by the immigration office. Each relocation must be declared to the residents' register including notice of departure when moving abroad.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom there is no resident registration as such. The head of a household is required to [[voter registration|register]] eligible voters in the household, although mandatory individual registration pursuant to the [[Political Parties and Elections Act 2009]] is planned;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Individual voter ID plan brought forward to 2014 | date= 15 September 2010 | work= [[BBC News]] | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11312362}}&lt;/ref&gt; registration is mandatory pursuant to section 23 of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/341/regulation/23/ Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 (No. 341)]. Completion of the [[Census in the United Kingdom|Census]] is mandatory pursuant to section 8 of the [[Census Act 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= 120 people convicted for not filling in census form | first= Dan | last= Glaister | work= BBC News | date= 27 January 2012 | url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/27/120-convicted-census-forms-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] provided for the introduction of British ID cards which were to be linked to a system of resident registration which would also contain any information deemed necessary by the government; however, following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]] this scheme was abolished by the [[Identity Documents Act 2010]].

=== Australia ===
Australia does not have compulsory registration of residence, though residence information needs to be disclosed in many situations, such as voter registration, passport application, state health care card, and updated in relation to drivers licences, motor vehicle registration, and many other purposes.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== China ===
In China the [[Hukou system]] is used for resident registration and civil registration. This system was inherited from imperial times and there is an interest to reform the legislation about it.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Japan ===
In Japan the ''[[koseki]]'' system is used to record Japanese families and the ''[[juminhyo]]'' system is used to record individual residents. Foreigners need to register within 90 days under the premises of the laws for [[alien registration in Japan]] that creates a separate database for alien residents.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The [[Residents Basic Registry Network]] or "Juki Net“ was introduced in 2003. This is introduced to increase government efficiency with 264 government tasks to be attached to the new system. In the new system a [[National identification number|person identification number]] is handed out consisting of eleven digits that can be used as a replacement for other identification documents.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan the [[NADRA]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nadra.gov.pk&lt;/ref&gt; system is used to record Pakistani families and the District Council system is used to record individual residents. Foreigners need to register within 90 days under the premises of the laws for alien registration in Pakistan that creates a separate database for alien residents.

=== South Korea ===
The [[resident registration number (South Korea)|resident registration number in South Korea]] consist of 13 digits that is also shown on the ID cards. Foreigners will receive a replacement number on their alien registration cards. The usage of the registration number is abundant including one third of the national internet websites require sign-up with the registration number and another third being unable to accept the alien registration card number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/01/19/2010011900857.html "Korean Websites Try Patience of Foreigners"], Park Hae-hyun, published in Chosun Ilbo, Jan. 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In political science, a '''revolution''' ([[Latin]]: ''revolutio'', "a turn around") is a fundamental and relatively sudden change in political power and political organization which occurs when the population revolt against the government, typically due to perceived oppression (political, social, economic).&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition (1999), Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds. pp. 754–46&lt;/ref&gt; In book V of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) described two types of political revolution:
# Complete change from one constitution to another
# Modification of an existing constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.5.five.html ''The Politics'' V]. Accessed 2013/4/24&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutions have occurred through human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration and motivating [[ideology]]. Their results include major changes in culture, economy and [[social institution|socio]]-[[political institution]]s, usually in response to perceived overwhelming [[autocracy]] or [[plutocracy]].

Scholarly debates about what does and does not constitute a revolution center on several issues. Early studies of revolutions primarily analyzed events in [[European history]] from a psychological perspective, but more modern examinations include global events and incorporate perspectives from several social sciences, including [[sociology]] and [[political science]]. Several generations of scholarly thought on revolutions have generated many competing theories and contributed much to the current understanding of this complex phenomenon.

Notable revolutions during later centuries include the creation of the [[United States]] through the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775-1783), the [[French Revolution]] (1789-1799), the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 European Revolutions]], The [[Russian Revolutions]] in March and November 1917.  


==Etymology==
The word ''"revolucion"'' is known in [[French language|French]] from the 13th century, and "revolution" in [[English language|English]] by the late fourteenth century, with regard to the revolving motion of celestial bodies. "Revolution" in the sense of representing abrupt change in a [[social order]] is attested by at least 1450.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] vol Q-R p. 617 1979 Sense III states a usage "Alteration, change, mutation" from 1400 but lists it as "rare". "c. 1450, Lydg 1196 ''Secrees'' of Elementys the Revoluciuons, Chaung of tymes and Complexiouns." It's clear that the usage had been established by the early 15th century but only came into common use in the late 17th century in England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=revolution onlineetymology.com ]&lt;/ref&gt; Political usage of the term had been well established by 1688 in the description of the replacement of [[James II of England|James II]] with [[William III of Orange|William III]]. This incident was termed the ''"[[Glorious Revolution]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''[http://chagala.com/russia/pipes.htm A Concise History of the Russian Revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511130014/http://chagala.com/russia/pipes.htm |date=2011-05-11 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;


==Types==
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]] in [[Madrid]]. The development of the [[steam engine]] propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain and the world. The steam engine was created to pump water from [[coal mine]]s, enabling them to be deepened beyond [[groundwater]] levels.]]

There are many different typologies of revolutions in social science and literature.

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] differentiated between; 
* [[political revolution]]s, sudden and violent revolutions that seek not only to establish a new political system but to transform an entire society, and; 
* slow but sweeping transformations of the entire society that take several generations to bring about (such as changes in religion).&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Boesche]], ''Tocqueville's Road Map: Methodology, Liberalism, Revolution, and Despotism'', Lexington Books, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7391-1665-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fLL6Bil2gtcC&amp;pg=PA86 p.86]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of several different [[Marxism|Marxist]] typologies &lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} J. Topolski, "''Rewolucje w dziejach nowożytnych i najnowszych (xvii-xx wiek)''", ''Kwartalnik Historyczny'', LXXXIII, 1976, 251-67&lt;/ref&gt; divides revolutions into; 
* pre-capitalist 
* early bourgeois, 
* bourgeois, 
* bourgeois-democratic, 
* early proletarian 
* socialist

[[Charles Tilly]], a modern scholar of revolutions, differentiated between; 
* [[coup d'état]] (a top-down seizure of power) 
* [[civil war]] 
* revolt, and 
* "great revolution" (a revolution that transforms economic and social structures as well as political institutions, such as the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], or [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tilly]], ''''European Revolutions, 1492-1992'', Blackwell Publishing, 1995, {{ISBN|0-631-19903-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IJBNvCsXfnIC&amp;pg=PA16 Google Print, p.16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html Bernard Lewis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429144545/http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html |date=2007-04-29 }}, "Iran in History", Moshe Dayan Center, Tel Aviv University&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Katz]]&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p4&lt;/ref&gt; identified six forms of revolution;
* rural revolution
* urban revolution
* Coup d'état, e.g. Egypt, 1952
* revolution from above, e.g. Mao's [[Great leap forward]] of 1958
* revolution from without, e.g. the allied invasions of Italy, 1944 and Germany, 1945.
* revolution by osmosis, e.g. the gradual Islamization of several countries.

These categories are not mutually exclusive; the [[Russian revolution of 1917]] began with urban revolution to depose the Czar, followed by rural revolution, followed by the [[Bolshevik]] coup in November. Katz also cross-classified revolutions as follows;
* Central; countries, usually [[Great powers]], which play a leading role in a [[Revolutionary wave]]; e.g. the [[USSR]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[Iran]] since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aspiring revolutions, which follow the Central revolution
* subordinate or puppet revolutions
* rival revolutions, e.g. communist Yugoslavia, and China after 1969

A further dimension to Katz's typology&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p12&lt;/ref&gt; is that revolutions are either '''against''' (anti-monarchy, anti-dictatorial, anti-communist, anti-democratic) or '''for''' (pro-fascism, communism, nationalism etc.).In the latter cases, a transition period is often necessary to decide on the direction taken.

Other types of revolution, created for other typologies, include the [[social revolution]]s; [[proletarian revolution|proletarian]] or [[communist revolution]]s (inspired by the ideas of Marxism that aims to replace [[capitalism]] with [[Communism]]); failed or abortive revolutions (revolutions that fail to secure power after temporary victories or large-scale mobilization); or violent vs. [[nonviolent revolution]]s.

The term ''revolution'' has also been used to denote great changes outside the political sphere. Such revolutions are usually recognized as having transformed in society, culture, philosophy, and technology much more than [[political system]]s; they are often known as [[social revolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Irving E. Fang, ''A History of Mass Communication: Six Information Revolutions'', Focal Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-240-80254-3}}, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Some can be global, while others are limited to single countries. One of the classic examples of the usage of the word ''revolution'' in such context is the [[Industrial Revolution]], or the [[Commercial Revolution]]. Note that such revolutions also fit the "slow revolution" definition of Tocqueville.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Warwick E. ''Geographies of Globalization''. Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-31800-9}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-3Vq3aadTYC&amp;pg=PA226 p.226]&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar example is the [[Digital Revolution]].

==Political and socioeconomic revolutions==
Perhaps most often, the word "revolution" is employed to denote a change in social and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"&gt;[[Jack Goldstone]], "Theories of Revolutions: The Third Generation'', ''[[World Politics]]'' 32, 1980:425-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forantorr"&gt;[[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], "Theories of Revolution Revisited: Toward a Fourth Generation", ''[[Sociological Theory (journal)|Sociological Theory]]'' 11, 1993:1-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kroeber"&gt;Clifton B. Kroeber, "Theory and History of Revolution, ''[[Journal of World History]]'' 7.1, 1996: 21-40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Goodwin]] gives two definitions of a revolution. First, a broad one, including
&lt;blockquote&gt;any and all instances in which a state or a political regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular movement in an irregular, extraconstitutional and/or violent fashion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Second, a narrow one, in which

&lt;blockquote&gt;revolutions entail not only [[mass mobilization]] and [[regime change]], but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic and/or cultural change, during or soon after the struggle for state power.&lt;ref name="NOWO:9"&gt;Goodwin, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jack Goldstone]] defines a revolution as
&lt;blockquote&gt;an effort to transform the political institutions and the justifications for political authority in society, accompanied by formal or informal mass mobilization and non-institutionalized actions that undermine authorities.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"&gt;Jack Goldstone, "Towards a Fourth Generation of Revolutionary Theory", ''[[Annual Review of Political Science]]'' 4, 2001:139-87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political and socioeconomic revolutions have been studied in many [[social sciences]], particularly [[sociology]], [[political science]]s and [[history]]. Among the leading scholars in that area have been or are [[Crane Brinton]], [[Charles Brockett]], [[Farideh Farhi]], [[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], [[John Mason Hart]], [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], [[Jack Goldstone]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], [[Ted Roberts Gurr]], [[Fred Halliday]], [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Tim McDaniel]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffery Paige]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Terence Ranger]], [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]], [[Theda Skocpol]], [[James C. Scott|James Scott]], [[Eric Selbin]], [[Charles Tilly]], [[Ellen Kay Trimberger]], [[Carlos Vistas]], [[John Walton (sociologist)|John Walton]], [[Timothy Wickham-Crowley]], and [[Eric Wolf]].&lt;ref name="NOWO:5"&gt;[[Jeff Goodwin]], ''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991.'' Cambridge University Press, 2001, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of revolutions, like [[Jack Goldstone]], differentiate four current 'generations' of scholarly research dealing with revolutions.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt; The scholars of the first generation such as [[Gustave Le Bon]], [[Charles A. Ellwood]], or [[Pitirim Sorokin]], were mainly descriptive in their approach, and their explanations of the phenomena of revolutions was usually related to [[social psychology]], such as Le Bon's [[crowd psychology]] theory.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

Second generation theorists sought to develop detailed theories of why and when revolutions arise, grounded in more complex [[social behavior]] theories. They can be divided into three major approaches: psychological, sociological and political.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

The works of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], [[Ivo K. Feierbrand]], [[Rosalind L. Feierbrand]], [[James A. Geschwender]], [[David C. Schwartz]], and [[Denton E. Morrison]] fall into the first category. They followed theories of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[frustration-aggression theory]] and saw the cause of revolution in the state of mind of the masses, and while they varied in their approach as to what exactly caused the people to revolt (e.g., modernization, recession, or discrimination), they agreed that the primary cause for revolution was the widespread frustration with socio-political situation.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

The second group, composed of academics such as [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Neil Smelser]], [[Bob Jessop]], [[Mark Hart]], [[Edward A. Tiryakian]], and [[Mark Hagopian]], followed in the footsteps of [[Talcott Parsons]] and the [[structural-functionalist]] theory in sociology; they saw society as a system in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems (political, cultural, etc.). As in the psychological school, they differed in their definitions of what causes disequilibrium, but agreed that it is a state of a severe disequilibrium that is responsible for revolutions.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

Finally, the third group, which included writers such as [[Charles Tilly]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], [[Peter Ammann]], and [[Arthur L. Stinchcombe]] followed the path of [[political sciences]] and looked at [[pluralist theory]] and [[interest group conflict theory]]. Those theories see events as outcomes of a [[power struggle]] between competing [[advocacy group|interest groups]]. In such a model, revolutions happen when two or more groups cannot come to terms within a normal [[decision making]] process traditional for a given [[political system]], and simultaneously have enough resources to employ force in pursuing their goals.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

The second generation theorists saw the development of the revolutions as a two-step process; first, some change results in the present situation being different from the past; second, the new situation creates an opportunity for a revolution to occur. In that situation, an event that in the past would not be sufficient to cause a revolution (e.g., a war, a riot, a bad harvest), now is sufficient; however, if authorities are aware of the danger, they can still prevent a revolution through reform or repression.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

Many such early studies of revolutions tended to concentrate on four classic cases: famous and uncontroversial examples that fit virtually all definitions of revolutions, such as the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], and the [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese Revolution (also known as the Chinese Civil War)]] (1927–1949).&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt; In his ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', however, the Harvard historian [[Crane Brinton]] focused on the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', revised ed. (New York, Vintage Books, 1965). First edition, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolutions (see [[List of revolutions and rebellions]]), and differences in definitions and approaches gave rise to new definitions and explanations. The theories of the second generation have been criticized for their limited geographical scope, difficulty in empirical verification, as well as that while they may explain some particular revolutions, they did not explain why revolutions did not occur in other societies in very similar situations.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

The criticism of the second generation led to the rise of a third generation of theories, with writers such as [[Theda Skocpol]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffrey Paige]], and others expanding on the old [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[class conflict]] approach, turning their attention to rural agrarian-state conflicts, state conflicts with autonomous elites, and the impact of interstate economic and military competition on domestic political change Particularly Skocpol's ''[[States and Social Revolutions]]'' became one of the most widely recognized works of the third generation; Skocpol defined revolution as "rapid, basic transformations of society's state and class structures [...] accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below", attributing revolutions to a conjunction of multiple conflicts involving state, elites and the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

[[File:West and East Germans at the Brandenburg Gate in 1989.jpg|thumb|left|The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and most of the events of the [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe, 1989, were sudden and peaceful.]]
From the late 1980s a new body of scholarly work began questioning the dominance of the third generation's theories. The old theories were also dealt a significant blow by new revolutionary events that could not be easily explain by them. The [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian]] and [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]s of 1979, the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] and the 1989 [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe saw multi-class coalitions topple seemingly powerful regimes amidst popular demonstrations and [[General strike|mass strikes]] in [[nonviolent revolution]]s.

Defining revolutions as mostly European violent state versus people and [[class struggle]]s conflicts was no longer sufficient. The study of revolutions thus evolved in three directions, firstly, some researchers were applying previous or updated [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories of revolutions to events beyond the previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts. Secondly, scholars called for greater attention to conscious [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] in the form of ideology and culture in shaping revolutionary mobilization and objectives. Third, analysts of both revolutions and social movements realized that those phenomena have much in common, and a new 'fourth generation' literature on contentious politics has developed that attempts to combine insights from the study of social movements and revolutions in hopes of understanding both phenomena.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

Further, social science research on revolution, primarily work in political science, has begun to move beyond individual or comparative case studies towards large-N empirical studies assessing the causes and implications of revolution. Initial studies generally rely on the Polity Project’s data on [[democratization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PolityProject|url = http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html|website = www.systemicpeace.org|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such analyses, like those by Enterline,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Regime Changes, Neighborhoods, and Interstate Conflict, 1816-1992|url = http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/42/6/804|journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 1998-12-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 804–829|volume = 42|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/0022002798042006006|language = en|first = A. J.|last = Enterline}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeev Maoz|Maoz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Domestic sources of global change|last = Maoz|first = Zeev|publisher = University of Michigan Press|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Ann Arbor, MI|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mansfield and Snyder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electing to Fight: Why Emerging Democracies go to War|last = Mansfield|first = Edward D.|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Snyder|first2 = Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; identify revolutions based on regime changes indicated by a change in the country’s score on Polity’s autocracy to democracy scale. More recently, scholars like Jeff Colgan have argued that Polity, which measures the degree of democratic or autocratic authority in a state's governing institutions based on the openness of executive recruitment, constraints on executive authority, and political competition, is inadequate because it measures democratization, not revolution, and fails to account for regimes which come to power by revolution but fail to change the structure of the state and society sufficiently to yield a notable difference in Polity score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Revolution|url = http://cmp.sagepub.com/content/29/4/444|journal = Conflict Management and Peace Science|date = 2012-09-01|issn = 0738-8942|pages = 444–467|volume = 29|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0738894212449093|language = en|first = Jeff|last = Colgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Colgan offers a new data set on revolutionary leaders which identifies governments that "transform the existing social, political, and economic relationships of the state by overthrowing or rejecting the principal existing institutions of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Data - Jeff D Colgan|url = https://sites.google.com/site/jeffdcolgan/data|website = sites.google.com|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This most recent data set has been employed to make empirically-based contributions to the literature on revolution by identifying links between revolution and the likelihood of international disputes.

Revolutions have also been approached from anthropological perspectives. Drawing on Victor Turner’s writings on ritual and performance, [[Bjorn Thomassen]] has argued that revolutions can be understood as "liminal" moments: modern political revolutions very much resemble rituals and can therefore be studied within a process approach.&lt;ref name="Thomassen" /&gt; This would imply not only a focus on political behavior "from below", but also to recognize moments where "high and low" are relativized, made irrelevant or subverted, and where the micro and macro levels fuse together in critical conjunctions.

Economist [[Douglass North]] argued that it is much easier for revolutionaries to alter formal political institutions such as laws and constitutions than to alter informal social conventions. According to North, inconsistencies between rapidly changing formal institutions and slow-changing informal ones can inhibit effective sociopolitical change. Because of this, the long-term effect of revolutionary political restructuring is often more moderate than the ostensible short-term effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=Douglass C|title=Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance|date=1992|publisher=ICS Press|location=San Francisco|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While revolutions encompass events ranging from [[Revolutions of 1989|the relatively peaceful revolutions that overthrew communist regimes]] to the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|violent Islamic revolution in Afghanistan]], they exclude ''coups d'état'', civil wars, revolts, and rebellions that make no effort to transform institutions or the justification for authority (such as [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 or the [[American Civil War]]), as well as peaceful transitions to [[democracy]] through institutional arrangements such as [[plebiscite]]s and [[Election#Difficulties with elections|free elections]], as in [[Spain]] after the death of [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

[[Image:Sabling the Champagne bottle.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Sabrage: Sabering the champagne bottle]]
'''Sabrage''' {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɑː|ʒ}} is a technique for opening a champagne bottle with a [[saber]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2010/10/27/wine-101-the-art-of-sabering/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Amy | last=Ma | title=Wine 101: The Art of Sabering | date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for ceremonial occasions. The wielder slides the saber along the body of the bottle to break the top of the neck away, leaving the neck of the bottle open and ready to pour. The force of the blunt side of the blade hitting the lip breaks the glass to separate the collar from the neck of the bottle. One does not use the sharp side of the blade. The cork and collar remain together after separating from the neck.

== History==
The technique became popular in France when the army of [[Napoleon]] visited many of the aristocratic domains. It was just after the [[French Revolution]] and the saber was the weapon of choice of Napoleon's light cavalry (the [[Hussar#Hussars of the Napoleonic Wars|Hussar]]s). Napoleon's spectacular victories across all Europe gave them plenty of reason to celebrate. During these parties the cavalry would open the champagne with their sabers. Napoleon, who was known to have said, "Champagne! In victory one deserves it; in defeat one needs it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wineintro.com/champagne/quotes.html|title=Lisa Shea's WineIntro – Basic Wine Tips, FAQS, Information|work=''wineintro.com''|accessdate=23 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922095844/http://www.wineintro.com/champagne/quotes.html|archivedate=22 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have encouraged this.

There are many stories about this tradition. One of the more spirited tales is that of [[Madame Clicquot]], who had inherited her husband's small champagne house at the age of 27. She used to entertain Napoleon's officers in her vineyard, and as they rode off in the early morning with their complimentary bottle of champagne, they would open it with their saber to impress the rich young widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Sabrage|url=http://www.theartofsabrage.com/|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US| number = US8376161| status = patent| title = Novelty associated with beverages| gdate = 19 February 2013| fdate = 2010-08-09| invent1 = Golden, Andrew P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Champagne sword==
[[Image:Champagne sword.jpg|thumb|250px|A champagne sword]]
A champagne sword (''sabre à champagne'') is an instrument specially made for sabrage. Some swords have short blades, around {{convert|30|cm|in|0}} long&lt;ref name="sabreachampagne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sabreachampagne.com/products.html |title=Sabre à Champagne Selection |publisher=SabreaChampagne.Com |accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resemble large knives, although others have longer blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.champagner-saebel.de/english/index.html |title=WKC Champagne Sword |publisher=WKC|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The side of the blade used should be blunt—a sharpened edge is unnecessary because in sabrage it is the impact that is important.&lt;ref name="sabreachampagne" /&gt; If using a sword with a sharp blade then the flat blunt back of the blade is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.champagnesword.co.uk |title=www.champagnesword.co.uk |author=The Champagne Lounge Ltd |year=2014 |accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A champagne [[bottle]] can be opened with a spatula using the same method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

The bottle neck is held at an angle of approximately 20 degrees and the [[sword]] is cast down on it. The experienced ''[[sommelier]]'' can open the bottle with little loss of champagne. However, it is advised to allow a small flow in order to wash away any loose shards of glass that may be adhering to the neck. The first glass poured should also be checked for small glass shards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

==Physics==
A champagne bottle holds a considerable amount of pressure. With early designs, bottles tended to explode and the manufacturers kept making them thicker until they could contain the pressure caused by the release of [[carbon dioxide]] during the secondary fermentation. The inside pressure of a typical champagne bottle is around {{convert|620|kPa}}. The diameter of the opening is {{convert|18|mm}}, so there is a force of about {{convert|160|N}} trying to push the cork out of the bottle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

At the opening of the bottle, there is a lip that creates a [[stress concentration]]. On the vertical seam of the bottle there is a thin, faintly visible, prepared seam, which creates a second stress concentration. At the intersection of the seam and the lip, both stress concentrations combine and the strength of the glass is reduced by more than fifty percent. The impact of the saber on this weak point creates a crack that rapidly propagates through the glass, fueled by the momentum of the saber and the pressure in the bottle. Once the crack has severed the top from the bottle, the pressure inside the bottle and the transferred momentum from the saber will send the top flying, typically for a distance of {{convert|5|-|10|m}}.

==Records==
The greatest number of champagne bottles sabered in one minute to be officially recognized by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] is 66 and was achieved by Ashrita Furman (USA) at the Sri Chinmoy Centre, [[Jamaica, Queens]], on 2 August 2015.{{fact|date=February 2018}} Ashrita used an "Arabian sabre" with a 13-inch blade. He beat the previous record of 47 held by Mirko Rainer, who managed this feat on 6 September 2014 in [[Mendrisio, Switzerland]].{{fact|date=February 2018}} 

The greatest number of champagne bottles sabered simultaneously was 630. It was officially recognised a world record by an occasion of the Sciabolata del Santero in Santo Stefano Belbo in Italy on June 2016.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3432">'''Satitherapy''' is an integrative [[psychotherapy]], which uses [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] (sati) as the key principle within a [[person centered approach]] developed by [[Carl R. Rogers]]. In this approach, it is the client who defines the goals of therapy and attains them with therapist's ethically skillful help (kusala). Satitherapy is grounded on respecting all life ([[ahimsa]]) and takes as its base the bodily anchored experiencing that is beyond the words. For this, it integrates the techniques of [[psychodrama]] developed by [[Jacob L. Moreno]] and expressive media for therapeutic acting-out, as well as the procedures of Buddhist [[insight meditation]] (satipatthána-vipassaná) and satidrama for therapeutic acting-in.

The theoretical training of satitherapists uses both the conceptual frame of Western psychology of mindfulness (cf. Germer, Siegel, Fulton, 2005; Didonna, 2009) and the system of psychology and ethics elaborated in the ancient Asian teachings of [[Abhidhamma]] (Frýba 1989; Frýba, 1996). Most of the practical skills and techniques are derived from the Abhidhamma. Thus the format of satitherapy includes theoretical knowledge and therapeutic skills from both Western and Asian sources.

There are two things unique to satitherapy:

*the use of ethics as the explanatory principle of suffering and as the basic paradigm of skilful coping
*the practical principle of skilful setting or removing of conditions (vatta-pativatta) so as to enable the upheaval of reality (dhamma-uddhacca) against the pathogenic wrong views (ditthi).
These two paradigms of satitherapy are derived from Abhidhamma and they are not found in any other psychotherapy, which was developed within Western Euro-American culture.

{{political anthropology}}
'''State formation''' is the process of the development of a centralized government structure in a situation where one did not exist prior to its development.  State formation has been a study of many disciplines of the [[social science]]s for a number of years, so much so that Jonathan Haas writes that "One of the favorite pastimes of social scientists over the course of the past century has been to theorize about the evolution of the world's great civilizations."{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=1}} The study of state formation is divided generally into either the study of early states (those that developed in [[Stateless society|stateless societies]]) or the study of modern states (particularly of the form that developed in Europe in the 17th century and spread around the world). Academic debate about various theories is a prominent feature in fields like Anthropology, Sociology, Economics and Political Science.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=523}}

==The state==
{{main|State (polity)}}
A state is a political system with a centralized government, a military force, a civil service, an arranged society, and literacy. Though, there is no clear agreement on the defining characteristics of a state and the definition can vary significantly, based upon the focus of the particular definition.{{sfn|Haas|1982|pp=2-3}} The state is considered to be territoriality bound and is distinct from tribes or units without centralized institutions.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=2-5}}

According to Painter &amp; Jeffrey, there are 5 distinctive features of the modern state:

1) They are ordered by precise boundaries with administrative control across the whole;

2) They occupy large territories with control given to organized institutions;

3) They have a capital city and are endowed with symbols that embody state power;

4) The government within state creates organizations to monitor, govern and control its population through surveillance and record keeping;

5) They increase monitoring over time.{{sfn|Painter|Jeffrey|2009|pp=22-24}}

Additionally, Herbst holds that there is another relevant characteristic of modern states: [[nationalism]]. This feeling of belonging to a certain territory plays a central role in state formation since it increases citizens' willingness to pay taxes.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

==Explaining early states and explaining modern states==
Theories of state formation have two distinct focuses, depending largely on the field of study:

# The early transition in human society from tribal communities into larger political organizations.  Studies of this topic, often in [[anthropology]], explore the initial development of basic administrative structures in areas where states developed from stateless societies.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=129}} Although state formation was an active research agenda in anthropology and archaeology until the 1980s, some of the effort has changed to focus not on why these states formed but on how they operated.{{sfn|Marcus|Feinman|1998|p=3}} 
# In contrast, studies in [[political science]] and in [[sociology]] have focused significantly on the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=131}}

States are minimally defined by anthropologist David S. Sandeford as socially stratified and bureaucratically governed societies with at least four levels of settlement hierarchy (e.g., a large capital, cities, villages, and hamlets). Primary states are those state societies that developed in regions where no states existed before. These states developed by strictly internal processes and interaction with other non-states societies.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}} The exact number of cases which qualify as primary states is not clearly known because of limited information about political organization before the development of writing in many places,{{sfn|Wright|1977|p=386}} but Sandeford lists ten likely cases of primary state formation in Eurasia, the Americas, and the Pacific.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}}

Studies on the formation of '''early states''' tend to focus on processes that create and institutionalize a state in a situation where a state did not exist before. Examples of early states which developed in interaction with other states include the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations]] and the [[Malagasy culture#Madagascar|Malagasy civilization in Madagascar]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=306}} Unlike primary state formation, early state formation does not require the creation of the first state in that cultural context or development autonomously, independently from state development nearby. Early state formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=50}}

===Modern state formation===
Theories on the formation of modern states focus on the processes that support the development of modern states, particularly those that formed in late-medieval Europe and then spread around the world with colonialism. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, with [[decolonization]] processes underway, attention began to focus on the formation and construction of modern states with significant bureaucracies, ability to tax, and territorial sovereignty around the world.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=153}}{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=132}} However, some scholars hold that the modern state model formed in other parts of the world prior to colonialism, but that colonial structures replaced it.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=13}}

==Theories about early state development==
There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others. Other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.{{sfn|Spencer|Redmond|2004|p=174}}

===Voluntary theories===
[[File:City context.svg|thumb|right|Uruk one of the prime sites for research into early state formation]]
Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation.  The argument is that such pressures result in integrative pressure for rational people to unify and create a state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=21}} Much of the [[social contract]] philosophical tradition proposed a voluntary theory for state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=21-23}}

One of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the ''hydraulic hypothesis'', which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}} The theory was most significantly detailed [[Karl August Wittfogel]]'s argument that, in arid environments, farmers would be confronted by the production limits of small-scale irrigation. Eventually different agricultural producers would join together in response to population pressure and the arid environment, to create a state apparatus that could build and maintain large irrigation projects.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}}

In addition to this, is what Carneiro calls the ''automatic hypothesis'', which contends that the development of agriculture easily produces conditions necessary for the development of a state. With surplus food stocks created by agricultural development, creation of distinct worker classes and a division of labor would automatically trigger creation of the state form.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}}

A third voluntary hypothesis, particularly common with some explanations of early state development, is that long distance trade networks created an impetus for states to develop at key locations: such as ports or oases. For example, the increased trade in the 16th century may have been a key to state formation in West African states such as [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]], [[Dahomey]], and the [[Benin Empire]].{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Conflict theories===
Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}} In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others. A number of different theories rely on conflict, dominance, or oppression as a causal process or as a necessary mechanism within certain conditions and they may borrow from other approaches. In general the theories highlight: ''economic stratification'', ''conquest of other peoples'', conflict in ''circumscribed areas'', and the neoevolutionary growth of bureaucracy. 
[[File:Panorama of Monte Alban from the South Platform.jpg|thumb|center|650px|Panorama of Monte Albán in present-day Mexico, seen from the South Platform. Archeologists oftentimes look for evidence of such "large-scale construction projects, trade networks, and religious systems" to identify early states.{{sfn|Haas|1981|p=82}}]]

:*'''''Economic stratification'''''
:: [[Friedrich Engels]] articulated one of the earliest theories of the state based on anthropological evidence in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' (1884).{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=6}} The theory of Engels developed from study of ''Ancient Society'' (1877) by [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and from the sketches of this work by [[Karl Marx]] on the [[Asiatic mode of production]].{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=25-26}} Engels argues that the state developed as a result of the need to protect private property. The theory contended that surplus production as a result of the development of agriculture created a division and specialization of labor: leading to classes who worked the land and to those who could devote time to other tasks. Class antagonism and the need to secure the private property of those living on the surplus production produced by agriculturalists resulted in the creation of the state.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=7}} The anthropologist [[Morton Fried]] (1923-1986) further developed this approach, positing social stratification as the primary dynamic underlying the development of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}}

:*'''''Conquest theories'''''
:: Similar to the economic stratification theories, the conquest theory contends that a single city establishes a state in order to control other tribes or settlements it has conquered. The theory has its roots in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406) and of [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596), but it was first organized around anthropological evidence by [[Franz Oppenheimer]] (1864-1943).{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Gross|1999|p=5}} Oppenheimer argues that the state was created to cement inequality between peoples that resulted from conquest.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=10}}

:*'''''Carneiro's circumscription theory'''''
[[File:Macchupicchu.jpg|thumb|right|The mountain [[Huayna Picchu]] overlooks the ruins of [[Machu Picchu]]. The [[Andes]] mountains circumscribed much of the region.]] 
:{{main|Carneiro's circumscription theory}}
::[[Robert Carneiro]] developed a theory (1970){{sfn|Carneiro|1970}} aiming to provide a more nuanced understanding of state formation by accounting for the fact that many factors (surplus agriculture, warfare, irrigation, conquest, etc.) did not produce states in all situations. He concluded that while population pressure and warfare were mechanisms of state formation, they only created states in geographic regions circumscribed, or walled off from the surrounding area.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=13}} Geographic barriers (or in some cases barriers created by nomadic raiders or by rival societies) create limitations on the ability of the people to deal with production shortfalls, and the result is that warfare results in state creation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}} In situations of unlimited agricultural land (like the Amazon or the Eastern United States), Carneiro believes that the pressures did not exist and so warfare allowed people to move elsewhere and thus did not spur creation of a state.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|pp=734-735}}

:*'''''Neoevolutionary theories'''''
:{{further|Neoevolutionism}}
::A number of different theories, sometimes connected with some of the processes above, explain state formation in terms of the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolution]] of [[leadership]] systems. This argument sees human society as evolving from [[tribe]]s or [[chiefdom]]s into states through a gradual process of transformation that lets a small group hierarchically structure society and maintain order through appropriation of [[symbol]]s of power.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=8}} Groups that gained power in tribal society gradually worked towards building the hierarchy and segmentation that created the state.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=9}}

::[[Elman Service]] (1915-1996) proposed that, unlike in economic stratification theories, the state largely creates stratification in society rather than being created to defend that stratification.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=38}} Bureaucracy evolves to support the leadership structure in tribes and uses religious hierarchy and economic stratification as a means to further increase its power.{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=73}} Warfare may play a key role in the situation, because it allows leaders to distribute benefits in ways that serve their interests, however it is a constant that feeds the system rather than an autonomous factor.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=51}} Similarly, anthropologist [[Henry T. Wright]] argues (2006) that competitive and conflictual environments produce political experimentation leading to the development of the state. As opposed to theories that the state develops through chance or tinkering, experimentation involves a more directed process where tribal leaders learn from organization forms of the past and from the outcomes they produced.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=316}}

===Other theories===
Other aspects are highlighted in different theories as of contributing importance. It is sometimes claimed that technological development, religious development, or socialization of members are crucial to state development. However, most of these factors are found to be secondary in anthropological analysis.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=61-68}} In addition to conquest, some theories contend that the need for defense from military conquest or the military organization to conquer other peoples is the key aspect leading to state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Discredited theories===
Some theories proposed in the 19th century and early 20th century have since been largely discredited by anthropologists. Carneiro writes that theories "with a racial basis, for example, are now so thoroughly discredited that they need not be dealt with...We can also reject the belief that the state is an expression of the 'genius' of a people, or that it arose through a 'historical accident.' Such notions make the state appear to be something metaphysical or adventitious, and thus place it beyond scientific understanding."{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} Similarly, [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] perspectives like those of [[Walter Bagehot]] in ''Physics and Politics'' argued that the state form developed as a result of the best leaders and organized societies gradually gaining power until a state resulted. Such explanations are not considered sufficient to explain the formation of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=42}}

==Theories about modern state development==
In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] (500-1400) in Europe, there were a variety of authority forms throughout the region. These included feudal lords, empires, religious authorities, free cities, and other authorities.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} Often dated to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], there began to be the development in Europe of modern states with large-scale capacity for taxation, coercive control of their populations, and advanced bureaucracies.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} The state became prominent in Europe over the next few centuries before the particular form of the state spread to the rest of the world via the colonial and international pressures of the 19th century and 20th century.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=535}} Other modern states developed in Africa and Asia prior to colonialism, but were largely displaced by colonial rule.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=12}}

Political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists began studying the state formation processes in Europe and elsewhere in the 17th century—beginning significantly with [[Max Weber]]. However, state formation became a primary interest in the 1970s. The question was often framed as a contest between state forces and society forces and the study of how the state became prominent over particular societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=525}} A number of theories developed regarding state development in Europe. Other theories focused on the creation of states in late colonial and post-colonial societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}  The lessons from these studies of the formation of states in the modern period are often used in theories about [[State-building]]. Other theories contend that the state in Europe was constructed in connection with peoples from outside Europe and that focusing on state formation in Europe as a foundation for study silences the diverse history of state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=8}}

Based on the model of European states, it has been commonly assumed that development is the natural path that states will eventually walk through. However, Herbst holds that in the case African states, as well as in developing countries of other regions, development need not be the natural step. States that struggle their consolidation could remain permanently weak.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

===Warfare theories===
[[File:Defenestration-prague-1618.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A woodcut of the [[Defenestrations of Prague]] in 1618—which began the [[Thirty Years' War]] and ended with the Peace of Westphalia that started the recognition of the modern state]]

Two related theories are based on military development and warfare, and the role that these forces played in state formation. [[Charles Tilly]] developed an argument that the state developed largely as a result of "state-makers" who sought to increase the taxes they could gain from the people under their control so they could continue fighting wars.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} According to Tilly, the state makes war and war makes states.{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=170}} In the constant warfare of the centuries in Europe, coupled with expanded costs of war with mass armies and gunpowder, warlords had to find ways to finance war  and control territory more effectively. The modern state presented the opportunity for them to develop taxation structures, the coercive structure to implement that taxation, and finally the guarantee of protection from other states that could get much of the population to agree.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527-528}} Taxes and revenue raising have been repeatedly pointed out as a key aspect of state formation and the development of state capacity. Economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]] emphasized on the importance of revenue raising and warned about the dangers of the dependence on foreign aid.{{sfn|Kaldor|1963}} Tilly argues, state making is similar to organized crime because it is a "quintessential protection racket with the advantage of legitimacy."{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=169}}

[[Michael Roberts (historian)|Michael Roberts]] and [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], in contrast, finds that the primary causal factor was not the "state-makers" themselves, but simply the military revolutions that allowed development of larger armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=5}} The argument is that with the expanded state of warfare, the state became the only administrative unit that could endure in the constant warfare in the Europe of this period, because only it could develop large enough armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=6}} 
This view—that the modern state replaced chaos and general violence with internal disciplinary structures—has been challenged as ethnocentric, and ignoring the violence of modern states.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=19}}

War has played a key role not only in the consolidation of European states but also of some third world states. According to Herbst, external security threats have had a fundamental role in the development of the [[South Korea]]n and [[Taiwan]]ese states.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}} A 2017 study which tests the predictions of warfare theories of Tilly and others found that the predictions do not match the empirical record.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The study found that median state size decreased from 1100 to 1800, and that the number of states increases rapidly between the twelfth and thirteen centuries and remained constant until 1800.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Commerce theories===
[[Stein Rokkan]] and others have argued that the modern territorial state developed in places that were peripheral to the commercial "city belt" ("a central regional band extending, roughly, in an arc from the Low Countries, through the Rhineland and into Northern Italy") that ran through Central Europe.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The existence of prosperous urban centers that relied on commerce in Central Europe prevented rulers from consolidaing their rule over others.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The elites in those urban centers could rely on their wealth and on collective security institutions (like the Hanseatic or Swabian league) with other urban centers to sustain their independence. A lower density of urban centers in England and France made it easier for rulers to establish rule over expansive territories.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Feudal crisis theories===
Another argument contends that the state developed out of economic and social crises that were prominent in late-medieval Europe. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the involvement of leaders in the domains of other leaders under religious reasons was the primary problem dealt with in the Peace of Westphalia.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} In addition, Marxist theory contends that the economic crisis of feudalism forced the aristocracy to adapt various centralized forms of organization so they could retain economic power, and this resulted in the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=529}}

===Cultural theories===
Some scholarship, linked to wider debates in Anthropology, has increasingly emphasized the state as a primarily cultural artifact, and focuses on how symbolism plays a primary role in state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=9}} Most explicitly, some studies emphasize how the creation of national identification and citizenship were crucial to state formation. The state then is not simply a military or economic authority, but also includes cultural components creating consent by people by giving them rights and shared belonging.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}

===Outside Europe===
While modern states existed without European influence around the world before colonialism,{{sfn|Ejogu|2011|p=595}} post-colonial state formation has received the most significant attention.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} While warfare is primary in theories about state formation in Europe, the development of the international norm of [[non-interventionism]] means that other processes of state formation have become prominent outside Europe (including colonial imposition, assimilation, borrowing, and some internal political processes.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=531}}{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} [[John W. Meyer|John W. Meyer's]] ''World Society Theory'' contends that the state form was exported from Europe, institutionalized in the United Nations, and gradually the modern nation-state became the basis for both those in power and those challenging power.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}} In addition, because many of the early modern states like the United Kingdom and France had significant empires, their institutional templates became standard for application globally.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}}

E. Kazdin|publisher=American Psychological Association and Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the physical characteristics of an object may not change, in an attempt to deal with our external world, our perceptual system has mechanisms that adjust to the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2006 82–90"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2006|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0-495-50629-X|pages=82–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual==
There are several types of perceptual constancies in [[visual perception]]:

[[File:Ponzo illusion.gif|250px|thumb|left|[[Ponzo illusion]]: Top line is perceived as larger than the bottom line, though they are identical in size.]]
* '''Size constancy''' is one type of visual subjective constancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|title=Psychology the Science of Behavior [4th Canadian ed.]|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, On. Canada|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a certain range, people’s perception of one particular object’s size will not change, regardless of changes in distance or the video size change on the retina. The perception of image is still based upon the actual size of the perceptual characteristics. According to optical principles, for the same object, the size of the image on the retina changes as the distance from the object to the observer changes. The greater the distance, the smaller the image is sensed by the retina. When someone is observing an object, although the distance of observation is different, the perceptional size is similar to the actual size. However, sensory and perception systems can be tricked by the use of illusions. Size constancy is related to distance, experience, and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zhijuehengchangxing_BaiduBaike|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/287477.htm|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of size constancy are [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] and [[Ponzo illusion]]. Another illusion experienced everyday is the size of the moon - when closer to the horizon, the moon appears larger. See [[moon illusion]]. Human perception is largely influenced by the environment; that is, the context in which the object is found.[[File:Shape constancy.gif|250px|thumb|right|'''Shape constancy''': We perceive the object to be a rectangular door opening but, if we drew this out, it is made up of varying shapes]]
* '''Shape constancy''' is similar to size constancy in that it relies largely on the perception of distance.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2006 82–90"/&gt; Regardless of changes to an object's orientation (such as a door opening), the shape of the object is perceived the same.

* '''Lightness constancy''' refers to the constancy of an object's lightness regardless of varying amounts of light cast upon it.

An example of this would be looking at a parked car as you walk towards a building; the car is perceived as remaining stationary as you move forward.

The '''Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)''' is a standard [[graphical representation]] intended to foster the efficient storage, exchange and reuse of information about signaling pathways, metabolic networks, and [[gene regulatory network]]s amongst communities of biochemists, biologists, and theoreticians. The system was created over several years by a community of [[biochemist]]s, [[Modelling biological systems|modelers]] and [[computer scientist]]s.&lt;ref name="Lenov2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Le Novère N, Hucka M, Mi H, Moodie S, Schreiber F, Sorokin A, etal | title=The Systems Biology Graphical Notation. | journal=Nat Biotechnol | year= 2009 | volume= 27 | issue= 8 | pages= 735–41 | pmid=19668183 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19668183 | doi=10.1038/nbt.1558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBGN is made up of three orthogonal languages for representing different views of biological systems: ''Process Descriptions'', ''Entity Relationships'' and ''Activity Flows''. Each language defines a comprehensive set of symbols with precise semantics, together with detailed syntactic rules regarding the construction and interpretation of maps.  Using these three notations, a life scientist can represent in an unambiguous way networks of interactions (for example [[biochemical]] interactions). These notations make use of an idea and symbols similar to that used by electrical and other engineers and known as the [[block diagram]]. The simplicity of SBGN syntax and semantics makes SBGN maps suitable for use at the high school level.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Some software support for SBGN is already available, mostly for the Process Description language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sbgn.org/Community#SBGN_Software |title=Community#SBGN_Software |publisher=sbgn.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67PufAQwM?url=http://www.sbgn.org/Community#SBGN_Software |archivedate=2012-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SBGN Process Description language ==

[[File:Example-SBGN-PD.png|thumb|right|example of SBGN Process Description map]] The SBGN Process Description (PD) language shows the temporal courses of biochemical interactions in a network. It can be used to show all the [[interactome|molecular interactions]] taking place in a network of biochemical entities, with the same entity appearing multiple times in the same diagram.&lt;ref name="Moodie2011"&gt;Moodie SL, Le Novère N, Demir E, Mi H &amp; Villéger A.

== SBGN Entity Relationship language ==

[[File:Example-SBGN-ER.png|thumb|right|example of SBGN Entity Relationship map]] The SBGN Entity Relationship (ER) language allows to see all the relationships in which a given entity participates, regardless of the temporal aspects. Relationships can be seen as rules describing the influences of entities nodes on other relationships.&lt;ref name="LeNovere2011"&gt;Le Novère N, Demir E, Mi H, Moodie S &amp; Villéger A.

== SBGN Activity Flow language ==

[[File:Example-SBGN-AF.png|thumb|right|example of SBGN Activity Flow map]] The SBGN Activity Flow (AF) language depicts the flow of information between biochemical entities in a network. It omits information about the state transitions of entities and is particularly convenient for representing the effects of perturbations, whether genetic or environmental in nature.&lt;ref name="Mi2009"&gt;Mi H, Schreiber F, Le Novère N, Moodie S, Sorokin A.

==History==

Work on defining a set of symbols to describe interactions and relationships of molecules was pioneered by Kurt Kohn at the [[National Cancer Institute]] with his [[Molecular Interaction Maps]] (MIM).&lt;ref name="Kohn2006"&gt;Kohn KW, Aladjem MI, Weinstein JN, Pommier Y. Molecular interaction maps of bioregulatory networks: a general rubric for systems biology.

The [http://sbgn.org/Events/SBGN-1 meeting that initiated] development of the Systems Biology Graphical Notation took place on February 11–12, 2006, at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), in Tokyo, Japan.

'''Tatramajjhattatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhist]] term that is translated as "equanimity", "neutrality of mind", etc. In the Theravada tradition, it is defined as a mental attitude of balance, detachment, and impartiality.&lt;ref name=bodhi1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hxopJgv85y4C&amp;q=neutrality+mind#v=snippet&amp;q=neutrality%20mind&amp;f=false Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), pp. 86]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tatramajjhattatā is identified as:
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Twenty-five beautiful mental factors|twenty-five beautiful mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings
* A synonym of [[upekkha]]

==Explanations==

===Theravada===
Bhikkhu Bodhi explains:
:The Pali term for this cetisaka literally means "there in the middleness." It is a synonym for equanimity ([[upekkha]]), not as neutral feeling, but as a mental attitude of balance, detachment, and impartiality. It has the characteristic of conveying consciousness and the mental factors evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, or to prevent partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be seen as the state of looking on with equanimity in the citta and cetasikas, like a charioteer who looks on with equanimity at the thoroughbreds progressing evenly along the roadway.&lt;ref name=bodhi1/&gt;

The [[Visuddhimagga]] (XIV, 153) states about equanimity:
: It has the characteristic of conveying citta and cetasikas evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, or its function is to inhibit partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be regarded as like a conductor (driver) who looks on with equanimity on thoroughbreds progressing evenly.&lt;ref name=gorkom1&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Equanimity.html#Equanimity Definition of Tatramajjhattatā ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nina van Gorkom explains:
:When there is equanimity there is neither elation nor depression. The object which is experienced is viewed with impartiality and neutrality, just as a charioteer treats with impartiality his well-trained horses. Equanimity effects the balance of the citta and the other cetasikas it arises together with. There is no balance of mind when akusala citta arises, when we are cross, greedy, avaricious or ignorant. Whereas when we are generous, observe morality (sīla), develop calm or develop right understanding of nāma and rūpa, there is balance of mind.&lt;ref name=gorkom1/&gt;

The Circumplex Model is a graphical representation of emotional states. Fundamentally, it is a circle with pleasant on the left, unpleasant on the right, activation on the top, and deactivation on the bottom. All the other emotions are placed around the circle as combinations of these four basic states. It is based on the theory that people experience emotions as overlapping and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2367156|year=2005|author1=Posner|first1=J|title=The circumplex model of affect: An integrative approach to affective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology|journal=Development and Psychopathology|volume=17|issue=3|pages=715–734|last2=Russell|first2=J.

S.|doi=10.1017/S0954579405050340|pmid=16262989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group dynamics are the distinctive behaviors and attitudes observed by people in groups, and the study thereof. It is of most interest in the business world, the workforce, or any other setting where the performance of a group is important. [[Joseph E McGrath]] enlarged the circumplex model to include group dynamics, based on the work of Shaw, Carter, Hackman, Steiner, Shiflett, Taylor, Lorge, Davis, Laughlin, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A CIRCUMPLEX MODEL OF GROUP TASK TYPES|url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/psyifp/aeechterhoff/wintersemester2011-12/vorlesungkommperskonflikt/mcgrath_groupinteractperfom_1984.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four quadrants in this model representing: generating a task, choosing correct procedure, conflict resolution, and execution, and again there are subtypes distributed around the circle. He used this model as a research tool to evaluate group task performance.

== Group dynamics ==
[[Group dynamics]] involve the influential actions, processes and changes that exist both within and between groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Group dynamics
| last = Forsyth
| first = D. R.
| publisher = Wadsworth
| year = 2009
| isbn = 
| location = New York
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group dynamics also involve the scientific study of group processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through extensive research in the field of group dynamics, it is now well known that all groups, despite their innumerable differences, possess common properties and dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychological researchers have attempted to organize these commonalities, in order to further understand the genuine nature of group processes.

For instance, social psychological research indicates that there are numerous goal-related interactions and activities that groups of all sizes undertake . These interactions have been categorized by [[Robert F. Bales]], who spent his entire life attempting to find an answer to the question, "What do people do when they are in groups?".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To simplify the understanding of group interactions, Bales concluded that all interactions within groups could be categorized as either a ''relationship interaction'' (or socioemotional interaction) or a ''task interaction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Bales
| first = R. F.
| publisher = Transaction
| year = 1999
| isbn = 
| location = New Brunswick, NJ
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Just as Bales was determined to identify the basic types of '''interactions''' involved in groups, [[Joseph E. McGrath]] was determined to identify the various '''goal-related activities''' that are regularly displayed by groups. McGrath contributed greatly to the understanding of group dynamics through the development of his '''circumplex model of group tasks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| location = Upper Saddle River, NJ
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As intended, McGrath's model effectively organizes all group-related activities by distinguishing between four basic group goals. These goals are referred to as the circumplex model of group task's four quadrants, which are categorized based on the dominant performance process involved in a group's task of interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakdown ===
The four quadrants are as follows: 
# '''''Generating''' ideas or plans''
# '''''Choosing''' a solution''
# '''''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict'' 
# '''''Executing''' a task''

To further differentiate the various goal-related group activities, McGrath further sub-divides these four categories, resulting in eight categories in total. The breakdown of these categories is as follows:

1. &lt;u&gt;'''''Generating''' ideas or plans''&lt;/u&gt;
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 1&lt;/u&gt;''' – Planning tasks''
** E.g. Generating plans
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 2&lt;/u&gt;''' – Creativity tasks''
** E.g. Generating ideas
2. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Choosing''' a solution&lt;/u&gt;''
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 3&lt;/u&gt;''' – Intellective tasks''
** E.g. Solving problems with correct answers
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 4&lt;/u&gt;''' – Decision-making tasks''
** E.g. Deciding issues with no right answer
3. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 5&lt;/u&gt;''' – Cognitive conflict tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of viewpoints 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 6&lt;/u&gt;''' – Mixed-motive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of interest 
4. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Executing''' a task&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 7&lt;/u&gt;''' – Contests/battles/competitive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of power 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 8&lt;/u&gt;''' – Performance/psychomotor tasks''
** E.g. Executing performance tasks

=== Details ===
According to [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] and [[Kravitz]] (1982),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the four most commonly represented tasks in the group dynamics literature are intellective tasks, decision-making tasks, cognitive conflict tasks and mixed-motive tasks.

The circumplex model of group tasks takes the organization of goal-related activities a step further by distinguishing between tasks that involve cooperation between group members, cooperation tasks (Types 1, 2, 3 and 8) and tasks that often lead to conflict between group members, conflict tasks (Types 4, 5, 6 and 7).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, McGrath's circumplex model of group tasks also distinguishes between tasks that require action (behavioural tasks) and tasks that require conceptual review (conceptual tasks). 'Behavioural tasks' include Types 1, 6, 7 and 8, while 'conceptual tasks' include Types 2, 3, 4 and 5.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Visual representation ==
The circumplex model of group tasks is, evidently, a very detailed and complex model. To allow for a more thorough understanding of its properties, a visual representation of the model has been developed. (Need a diagram of the model)

== Further explanation ==
Since the circumplex model of group tasks is quite detailed and complex, numerous social psychological researchers have attempted to describe the model in various ways to ensure readers obtain an optimal understanding of the model. For instance, according to Stratus and McGrath (1994),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal
