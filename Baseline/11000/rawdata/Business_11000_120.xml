'''Adolf Henrik Lundin''', (19 December 1932 – 30 September 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/oljemagnaten-adolf-lundin-ar-dod |title=Oljemagnaten Adolf Lundin är död |publisher=Dagens Nyheter |first=Anders |last=Hellberg |date=September 30, 2006|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Swedish oil and mining entrepreneur. From the 1970s through the 1990s Lundin established numerous natural resource companies both in the mining sector and the oil and gas sector, which in turn made a number of world class discoveries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and South America. Several of these deposits are still producing commercial quantities of oil, gas, gold, copper and other minerals; others are still under development. Lundin made a fortune in the 1970s when he came across huge natural gas fields in Qatar.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Adolf Lundin earned a master's degree in 1956 from the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]]. Between 1957 and 1960 he worked as a Petroleum Engineer for the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch Shell Group]] in South America. In 1961 he earned an [[MBA]] degree from the [[International Institute for Management Development|Centre d’Etudes Industrielles]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. Between 1961 and 1966 he was responsible for oil exploration activities in the [[North Sea]] and [[Portugal]] for the [[Nordstjernan|Ax:son Johnson Group]]. In 1966, he moved with his family to Geneva to work as assistant director of the Centre d’Etudes Industrielles (which later became the International Institute for Management Development).

Adolf's brother Bertil (1946-2005) was head of the [[Kontoret för Särskild Inhämtning]] (The Office for Special Collection). The KSI is Sweden's most secretive intelligence agency.

==Career==

In 1971, he started his career as an independent oil and mining entrepreneur on a global scale. His first successful venture was [[Gulfstream Resources]] which, in 1976, co-discovered the [[North Gas Field]], offshore [[Qatar]] - this field remains today as the single largest known gas accumulation in the world.

Lundin was an ardent [[anti-Communist]]. In the United States Lundin was involved with the right-wing think tank, [[The Heritage Foundation]] based in Washington, D.C. ([[Reagan Doctrine]]/ [[Kirkpatrick Doctrine]]). In 1980, Lundin sponsored [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|election campaign]]. Lundin and his wife Eva were invited to the Reagent inauguration in 1981. The program included an inauguration party with [[Frank Sinatra]] that the couple watched from the front row.&lt;ref name="thelocal22122011"&gt;[https://www.thelocal.se/20111222/38102 ''Lundin may have led Bildt to the heart of darkness''], [[The Local]], 22 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded [[Lundin Mining]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lundinmining.com/s/History.asp Company History] Lunding mining. Investors&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he was named ''[[International Swede of the Year]]'' by [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|His Majesty the King of Sweden]]. In 1999, Lundin Oil, made a major discovery of oil in the [[Thar Jath]] structure in an area in Sudan ([[Block 5A, South Sudan|Block 5A]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelocal.se/20161128/swedish-oil-bosses-quizzed-in-human-rights-probe-lundin-sudan Swedish oil bosses quizzed in six-year human rights probe]. The Local, 28 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Lundin invited the former prime minister (1991-1994) and EU envoy to the Balkans (1995) [[Carl Bildt]] to join his board of directors. In 2001 Lundin founded [[Lundin Petroleum]].

In 2002, he received an honorary doctorate from [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]] [[Russian Academy of Economics]] in [[Moscow]]. He became the honorary chairman of [[Lundin Petroleum AB]], the chairman of [[Vostok Nafta Investment Ltd]] and a director of [[North Atlantic Natural Resources AB]], [[Atacama Minerals Corp.]], [[Champion Resources Inc.]], [[South Atlantic Ventures Ltd]], [[Tenke Mining Corp.]] and [[Valkyries Petroleum Corp.]]

Adolf Lundin died in 2006, aged 73, from [[leukemia]]. He was survived by his wife, Eva Wehtje, whom he married in 1957, and their four children. His Lundin Group, continued by his sons Lukas and Ian Lundin. They have invested considerable resources in rebranding the Lundin Group to make it more socially acceptable. They started a philanthropic operation, "Lundin for Africa Foundation", and proclaimed in 2007 to donate $100 million to the [[Clinton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/news-and-media/press-releases-and-statements/press-release-lundin-group-commits-100-million-to-clinton-giustra-sustainable-gr.html Lundin Group Commits $100 Million to Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative], 6 Jule 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thelocal22122011" /&gt;

His grandfather was Alfred Sarasin-Iselin. His father was banker, Bernhard Sarasin, who died at an early age in 1950. Alfred E. Sarasin became successor in the management of the bank Sarasin. From 1954 to 2005, he worked well beyond his own business for the [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss banking]] industry, presided from 1965 to 1986 for the [[Swiss Bankers Association]] and was also President of the Bank Council of the [[Swiss National Bank]]. In 1987, the company [[J. Safra Sarasin|A. Sarasin &amp; Cie]] became a limited partnership with the newly converted name, Bank Sarasin &amp; Cie.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

After his death, the bank was sold in 2007 by the bankers Erik Sarasin, Andreas Sarasin and Yves Sarasin to the Dutch [[Rabobank]]. Rabobank sold the bank later to the [[Safra Group]] in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/newsticker/bloomberg/article106011835/Jahresgewinn-von-Sarasin-sinkt-20-Kapitalabfluesse-im-2-Hj.html |title=Jahresgewinn von Sarasin sinkt 20% |author=Giles Broom |date=23 February 2012 |publisher=WeltN24 |access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Josef Feinstein''' (born 16 March 1964) is a former [[South African]] politician who currently resides in the [[United Kingdom]], but remains a South African citizen.

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Cape Town]] to Ralph Josef Feinstein and Erika Hemmer. He graduated from [[Wynberg Boys' High School]] in 1981, and received further education at [[King's College, Cambridge]], the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and the [[University of Cape Town]]. He married Simone Sultana on 18 December 1993, and has a son and a daughter. His interests include reading, classical &amp; jazz music, cinema, theatre, watching rugby, cricket &amp; soccer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/andrew-feinstein-3673|title=Andrew Feinstein {{!}} Who's Who SA|website=www.whoswhosa.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
A member of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), his political life began when he served as an advisor to [[Gauteng]]'s then-MEC of Finance, [[Jabu Moleketi]], from 1994 to 1996. He also worked as an economic advisor to then-premier [[Tokyo Sexwale]]. He was elected as a member of the [[Parliament of South Africa|South African Parliament]]'s [[National Assembly of South Africa|lower house]] in 1997. 

During his time in office, he served as chair of its study group on public accounts and ANC's official spokesman on the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]]'s public accounts committee. Feinstein was at the time referred to as "one of its most vocal and talented MPs", who argued that a thorough investigation into the [[South African Arms Deal]] had to be done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://70.84.171.10/~etools/newsbrief/2001/news0130.txt ''ANC seeks to play down Feinstein demotion'', SAPA, 29 February 2001.]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he resigned in 2001 when the ANC refused to launch an investigation into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pr/2001/pr0830c.html ''Statement by Andrew Feinstein MP'' - 30 August 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323082152/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pr/2001/pr0830c.html |date=23 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Geoff Doidge]] in both positions.

==Immigration to the UK==
He now resides in [[London]], where he chairs the Aids charity Friends of the [[Treatment Action Campaign]], and lectures and writes on South Africa. He also works as a Securities Coordinator for [[Investec Bank]] UK Ltd.

He is now considered an ANC dissident and critic, with his memoirs, ''After the Party'', being severely critical of the political culture of the ANC.

In an interview with ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', he noted the ways in which the global arms trade was linked to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/12/26/as_us_faces_gun_epidemic_post |title=As U.S. Faces Gun Epidemic Post-Newtown, Obama Urged to Break With NRA &amp; Back Global U.N. Arms Treaty |date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Feinstein published ''The Shadow World'', an investigation into the global [[arms industry]].  He reported "that the [[Arms industry|trade in weapons]] accounts for around 40 percent of all corruption in all world trade The .. trade in weapons is extremely closely tied into the mechanics of government. The defence manufacturers, those who make the weapons, are closely tied in to governments, to militaries, to intelligence agencies and crucially to political parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Is society inherently corrupt?

'''''Asian Private Banker''''' is an Asia-based intelligence, data and connections company which focuses on Asia's private wealth management communities.

==History==
Asian Private Banker was founded in November 2009.

The region’s first event to focus on the private banking advisory community, ''Asian Private Banker''’s Investment Advisory Summit, was held in Hong Kong in June 2010. It led to a sister event in Singapore in October 2010, and the two events have since been held annually. Asian Private Banker was also the first to hold the Fund Selection Nexus in Hong Kong in 2012, followed by its sister event in Singapore – those events are also held annually. A number of industry functions and thought-leadership events are now hosted by Asian Private Banker. 

Asian Private Banker released its first Asia AUM (Assets Under Management) League Table for the top 20 private banks in Asia in April 2012, followed by the Asia RM (Relationship Managers) Headcount League Table. These league tables are updated annually (in March) and are a result of investigative journalism and data collation. Asian Private Banker’s AUM and RM League Tables are used by mainstream financial media (Bloomberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-15/deutsche-bank-looking-to-grow-asia-wealth-unit-with-new-hires|title=Deutsche Bank Looking to Grow Asia Wealth Unit With New Hires|last=Chanjaroen|first=Chanyaporn|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e2818d30-012c-11e6-ac98-3c15a1aa2e62.html#axzz45mHLWmXA|title=JPMorgan cuts 20% of relationship managers at Asia private bank|last=Weinland|first=Don|date=2016-04-13|last2=Hughes|first2=Jennifer|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reuters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barclays-ocbc-wealth-idUSKCN0X400H|title=OCBC grabs Barclays Asia wealth business after poaching concerns spook rival|date=2016-04-07|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Business Times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/stocks/ocbc-pays-us320m-cash-for-barclays-private-bank-business-in-singapore-hk|title=OCBC pays US$320m cash for Barclays' private bank business in Singapore, HK|last=Sen|first=Siow Li|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Axess''' (アクセス国際ネットワーク) is a [[Computer reservations system]] based in Japan which provides its services in the Japanese market. It originated as the IT department of [[Japan Airlines]] called Jalinfotech. In 1991 it was established as an independent company it began to be marketed to travel agencies in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axess.co.jp/eng/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Axess partnered with [[Sabre Holdings]] in order to provide travel agencies in Japan with booking and ticketing capabilities for a wider range of international airlines.

On April 23 2012 Travelport, the business services provider to the global travel industry, announced a long-term agreement with AXESS International Network, the leading Japanese GDS owned by Japan Airlines (JAL).  Under the new agreement, AXESS will be hosted by Travelport in its Atlanta data center as a partition of the Travelport global distribution system.  The new upgraded AXESS GDS system, which will provide enhanced functionality to connected travel agency users, will be implemented by 2013.

By adopting Travelport's technology infrastructure, the AXESS GDS system will be enhanced with improved connectivity to airlines and a significant increase in the range of fares, shopping, hotel and car rental capabilities available for use by Japanese travel agencies and corporations. 

AXESS confirmed it had selected Travelport as its partner due to the two companies' mutual alignment on strategic thinking and saw the agreement as a significant step forward in reinforcing AXESS's position as the GDS of choice in the Japanese travel industry.

'''Bay Street''' is a major thoroughfare in [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It is the centre of [[Toronto]]'s [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] and is often used by [[metonymy]] to refer to [[Economy of Canada|Canada's financial services industry]] since succeeding [[Montreal]]'s [[Saint Jacques Street|St. James Street]] in that role in the 1970s.

Bay Street begins at [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queens Quay]] ([[Toronto Harbour]]) in the south and ends at Davenport Road in the north. The original section of Bay Street ran only as far north as [[Queen Street West]]. Sections north of Queen Street were renamed Bay Street as several other streets were consolidated and several gaps filled in to create a new thoroughfare in the 1920s. The largest of these streets, Terauley Street, ran from Queen Street West to Grenville Street. At these two points, there is a curve in Bay Street.

"Bay Street" is frequently used as a metonym to refer to Toronto's Financial District and the Canadian financial sector as a whole, similar to [[Wall Street]] in the United States. "Bay Street banker", as in the phrase "cold as a Bay Street banker's heart", was a term of opprobrium especially among Prairie farmers who feared that Toronto-based financial interests were hurting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Partridge|author2=Tom Dalzell|author3=Terry Victor|title=The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UIjVGcSe8MC&amp;pg=PA154|date= 2007|publisher=Psychology Press|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the legal profession, the term Bay Street is also used colloquially to refer to the large, full-service business law firms of Toronto.

==History==
The street was originally known as '''Bear Street''' because of frequent bear sightings in the early history of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;City of Toronto Archives, Bay Street index card&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 19: A Sketch of the Grange|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/a-sketch-of-the-grange|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto Revisited}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed Bay Street in 1797 from the fact that it connected Lot Street (present-day [[Queen Street West]]) to a bay at the [[Toronto Harbour]]. In the 19th century the intersection of Bay and [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]] was home to Toronto's major newspapers: the [[The Mail Building (Toronto)|Mail Building]], the [[old Toronto Star Building]], and the [[William H. Wright Building]] (old ''Globe and Mail'' headquarters) were all located near the intersection.

Until 1922, the section of Bay running north from Queen Street and ending at [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] was known as '''Terauley Street''' (named after the Terauley estate of [[John Simcoe Macaulay]] near Bay and Queen Streets). Several discontinuous streets existed north of College Street to [[Davenport Road]]. By-Law 9316 joined these streets together as far north as Scollard Street in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;City of Toronto. ''By-Law No. 9316''. "Appendix 'B{{'"}} to the Minutes of Proceedings to the Council of the Corporation for the City of Toronto for the year 1922: Volume Two. Toronto: The Carswell Co. 1922. p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, By-Law 9884, enacted on January 28, 1924, changed the name of Ketchum Avenue to Bay Street, extending it to Davenport Road.&lt;ref&gt;City of Toronto. ''By-Law No. 9884''. "Appendix 'B{{'"}} to the Minutes of Proceedings to the Council of the Corporation for the City of Toronto for the year 1924: Volume Two. Toronto: The Carswell Co. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a short street called '''Terauley Lane''' running west of Bay from Grenville Street to Grosvenor Street.

==Points of interest==
The intersection of Bay and [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]] is often seen as the centre of Canadian banking and finance.  Four of Canada's five major banks have office towers at the intersection&amp;nbsp;— the [[Bank of Montreal]] at [[First Canadian Place]], [[Scotiabank]] at [[Scotia Plaza]], the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] (CIBC) at [[Commerce Court]], and [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] at the [[Toronto-Dominion Centre]]&amp;nbsp;— and the fifth, the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Bank]] at [[Royal Bank Plaza]], is one block south.  Historically, Bay and King was known as the "MINT Corner" from '''M'''ontreal, '''I'''mperial, '''N'''ova Scotia, and '''T'''oronto, &lt;!--not Toronto-Dominion until 1955 --&gt; but since 1961 the [[Imperial Bank of Canada|Imperial Bank]] has been part of CIBC and the Bank of Nova Scotia has rebranded itself, so this nickname is no longer widely used.  The core cluster of towers has crept north with the addition of the 50-storey [[Bay Adelaide Centre]] and [[The Adelaide Hotel Toronto]].

Significant [[condominium]] development on Bay, north of the financial district, boomed during the 1990s and construction continues on large, 40-plus storey condominiums and multi-use buildings today.  The area is defined by Dundas Street to the south and Bloor/Yorkville to the north and crosses through Toronto's [[Discovery District]] and [[Mink Mile]].

The area attracts many who work in the financial district and those who work in the Discovery District, nearby hospitals and schools (Ryerson University and the University of Toronto). More than 67% (or 10,380) of residents in this area are in the working ages of 25-64, significantly higher than the City of Toronto's average of 58%.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/demographics/cns_profiles/2006/pdf1/cpa76.pdf Gender and Age]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable buildings include:
* [[Toronto Coach Terminal]]
* [[Residences of College Park]]
* [[College Park (Toronto)|777 Bay]]
* [[Murano, Toronto|Murano]]
* [[Ontario Government Buildings]]
* [[Sutton Place Hotel]]
* [[Manulife Centre]]
* [[Nathan Phillips Square]]
* Flagship store of [[Hudson's Bay Company]]

Another prominent intersection is the one nearest [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] at Bay and [[Bloor Street|Bloor]], the centre of an expensive shopping district.
 
The intersection of Bay and Bloor is the location of the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]'s [[Bay station (Toronto)|Bay subway station]]. Bay Street is served by the [[List of Toronto Transit Commission bus routes|route 6 Bay bus]], which is one of the few downtown bus routes. The street used to be served by [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcars lines]], which were gradually phased out after the north-south [[Yonge–University–Spadina line|Yonge and University subway lines]] opened in 1954 and 1963 respectively. The remaining streetcar tracks between Dundas and College Streets are now used for short turns and diversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/streetcar/4117.shtml |title=The Dupont and Bay Streetcars (Deceased) |author=James Bow |date=November 10, 2006 |work= |publisher=Transit Toronto |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bloomberg TV Canada''' was a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[English language]] [[Category B Services|Category B]] [[specialty channel|television channel]] owned by [[Channel Zero (company)|Channel Zero]]. It was a localized version of the U.S. financial news channel [[Bloomberg Television]]; its programming was largely identical, but also featured [[Regional variation|opt-outs]] for domestic programs covering Canadian business news. 

The channel launched on November 17, 2015, replacing the American version that was readily available in Canada. The channel shut down on October 5, 2017 and Bloomberg subsequently partnered with its established Canadian competitor [[Business News Network]] (now BNN Bloomberg).

==History==
On February 26, 2015, Channel Zero announced it had reached an agreement with [[Bloomberg L.P.]] to launch a localized Canadian business news channel as an offshoot of its original American Bloomberg Television channel which was currently being distributed in Canada for several years at the time. It was later announced that the channel was expected to launch on November 16, 2015 with its studios located in [[downtown Toronto]] in the city's financial district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chch.com/bloombergchannel-zero-launch-24-7-business-news-channel/ Bloomberg/Channel Zero to launch 24-7 Business News channel] CHCH February 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/amanda-lang-to-host-evening-show-for-bloomberg-tv-canada/article26820472/&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Bloomberg TV Canada 2015.png|right|200px|thumb|Original logo used from 2015 to 2016]]
The channel launched one day later than expected on November 17, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/media-alert---bloomberg-tv-canada-launches-delivering-business-and-financial-news-to-more-than-six-million-canadian-households-551093121.html  Media Alert - Bloomberg TV Canada Launches, Delivering Business and Financial News to more than Six Million Canadian Households] Canada News Wire 11-17-15&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of launch, the American service was withheld from being distributed by Canadian television service providers at the request of its owners, although it remained a legally authorized channel for distribution in Canada by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).

Programming on the service largely mirrored the American channel's schedule, with the additional programs such as ''Bloomberg North'' and ''The Daily Brief'', which were later cancelled and replaced with ''Bloomberg Markets: Canada'' in January 2017, and [[Infomercial|paid programming]].

Originally launched as an exempt discretionary service that did not require a [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]]-granted television licence as it did not at launch have the required 200,000 subscribers, the channel was granted a CRTC licence on August 17, 2017 after reaching that subscriber level in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2017/2017-288.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2017-288], CRTC, 08-17-17&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day Channel Zero was granted its licence for Bloomberg TV Canada by the CRTC, Channel Zero announced in a statement that it would be cancelling all Canadian original productions for the channel and laying off 22 members of its staff relating to those productions, leading to speculation of how Channel Zero would maintain its required Canadian content quotas with no original Canadian productions. The statement referred to September 1, 2017 as the date the channel will be "changing the focus" of its programming, however, still maintaining that the channel will focus on business news and information, with reporting from Bloomberg studios in Canada and around the world, suggesting the channel will remain in operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globeinvestor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/GAM/20170818/RBCDBLOOMBERGTV Bloomberg TV Canada slashes its two original shows], GlobeInvestor.com, 08-18-17&lt;/ref&gt; However, on October 5, 2017, the channel was discontinued and replaced with the American Bloomberg Television service,&lt;ref&gt;[https://community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-13285 Oct 5 | Bloomberg TV Canada rebrands to Bloomberg TV], Shaw Support, 10-04-17&lt;/ref&gt; the channel Bloomberg TV Canada replaced at its launch in 2015. The CRTC granted a request by Channel Zero to revoke the broadcasting licence for Bloomberg TV Canada on December 8, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2017/2017-436.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2017-436], CRTC, 12-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Bloomberg partnered with [[Bell Media]]'s [[Business News Network]] (BNN), renaming it [[BNN Bloomberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/bnn-to-become-bnn-bloomberg-in-new-deal-between-bell-media-and-bloomberg-media|title=BNN to become BNN Bloomberg in new deal between Bell Media and Bloomberg Media|date=2018-01-08|work=Financial Post|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bnn.ca/bnn-to-rebrand-as-bnn-bloomberg-through-new-bell-media-bloomberg-media-partnership-1.961761|title=BNN to rebrand as 'BNN Bloomberg' through new Bell Media-Bloomberg Media partnership|date=2018-01-08|work=BNN|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personalities==
On October 13, 2015, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] announced Amanda Lang was leaving for Bloomberg TV Canada. The network also hired former [[Business News Network|BNN]] journalists Pamela Ritchie as anchor of ''The Daily Brief'' and Michael Bancroft as executive producer of the channel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/amanda-lang-to-host-evening-show-for-bloomberg-tv-canada/article26820472/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/15/amanda-lang-bloomberg-canada_n_8303028.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bloomberg TV Canada launched, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] reporter/anchor [[Danielle Bochove]] joined her former colleague at Bloomberg TV Canada primarily on a part-time basis, serving as substitute anchor for ''Bloomberg North'' and, occasionally, ''The Daily Brief'', in addition to occasional reporting duties covering Canadian financial markets alongside her colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/daniellebochove&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/bloomberg-tv-canada-launches-new-weekday-show-bloomberg-north-featuring-all-star-anchor-ensemble-amanda-lang-pat-kiernan-and-rudyard-griffiths-569834751.html Bloomberg TV Canada Launches New Weekday Show Bloomberg North Featuring All-Star Anchor Ensemble: Amanda Lang, Pat Kiernan and Rudyard Griffiths], Newswire, 02-23-16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Channel Zero (company)|Channel Zero]] shuffled around its ''Bloomberg North'' anchor team, reducing [[Amanda Lang]] to Tuesdays &amp; Wednesdays and luring away her fellow [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[Business News Network|BNN]] colleague [[Rudyard Griffiths]] as anchor of the Monday program along with another former Lang colleague, [[Pat Kiernan]], who returned to Canada to join Bloomberg TV Canada and who previously worked for [[CNNfn]] anchoring ''The Money Gang'' with Lang, [[Christine Romans]] and [[Ali Velshi]] between 2000-2004, anchoring on Thursdays. Griffiths, Lang and Kiernan rotate on Fridays anchoring an "encore"-type show recapping the week's business news stories and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/rudyardg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/patkiernan&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, [[Global Television Network|Global National]] business and consumer affairs reporter [[Jamie Sturgeon]] left to join Bloomberg TV Canada as a general assignment reporter covering Canadian financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/jasturgeon&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, former [[National Post]] newspaper reporter [[Eric Lam]] for their [[Financial Post]] business and markets section joined Bloomberg TV Canada as another general assignment reporter covering Canadian financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/ericlamTO&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2016, former [[TechTV]] ''Call For Help'' co-host and [[Business News Network|BNN]] ''App Central'' co-host [[Amber MacArthur]] has been seen occasionally filling in as a substitute co-anchor of ''Bloomberg North'' alongside [[WIND Mobile]] co-founder [[Anthony Lacavera]], including the program on August 16, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/ambermac&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/TonyLacavera&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, former [[Reuters TV]] journalist, Lily Jamali joined Bloomberg TV Canada to host a new daily Bloomberg Markets: Canada, a 30-minute program recapping the day's market news.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lily-jamali-joins-bloomberg-tv-133000780.html Lily Jamali Joins Bloomberg TV Canada], Yahoo Finance, 01-19-17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Life &amp; Education ==

Dhillon's family comes from [[Tallewal]] in the district of [[Barnala]] [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/canadas-top-businessman-bob-singh-dhillon-donates-10-mn-to-university-of-lethbridge/articleshow/63315128.cms|title=Canada's top businessman Bob Singh Dhillon donates $10 mn to University of Lethbridge|last=|first=|date=|work=The Economic Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a trader, left for [[Hong Kong]] for business reasons and set-up the North China Shipping Company.

At the age of 12, Dhillon migrated to Canada where he continued his education in Calgary, Alberta. After graduating from University, he went to complete his master's degree ([[MBA]]) at [[Richard Ivey School of Business]] in [[London, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/entrepreneurship/about/advisory-council/bob-dhillon/|title=Bob Dhillon, EMBA '98|last=|first=|date=1998|website=University Of Western Ontario {{!}} Ivy School Of Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhillon began his career in real estate at the age of 19 finding under-valued property and repositioning it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/calgarys-bob-dhillon-reinvents-the-apartment-building-business/article559701/|title=Calgary's Bob Dhillon reinvents the apartment-building business|last=Sthankiya|first=Nayan|date=October 27, 2011|work=The Globe &amp; Mail|access-date=March 26, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting by buying a pair of houses in Calgary; renovating and selling them for a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mainst.biz/investors/management-team|title=Mainstreet Equity (MEQ) Management Team|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mainstreet Equity Corporation==
[[File:Mainstreet Tower in Edmonton.jpg|alt=Mainstreet Tower in Edmonton, Alberta|thumb|Mainstreet Tower in Edmonton, Alberta]]
Dhillon founded [https://mainst.biz Mainstreet Equity Corp] which was listed as a [[Lists of companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange|Canadian publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange]] listed on the TSX as MEQ. Bob Dhillon is the corporation's largest shareholder, founder, [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] &amp; president. Mainstreet Equity Corp. is  based out of [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]] and engages in the acquisition, redevelopment, repositioning and management of mid-market Canadian apartment complexes. Mainstreet Equity currently has properties in Alberta (Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge, Fort Saskatchewan &amp; Cochrane), British Columbia (Surrey, Abbotsford &amp; New Westminster) and Saskatchewan (Saskatoon &amp; Regina)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.tmxmoney.com/company.php?qm_symbol=MEQ|title=TMX Money (TSX)|last=|first=|date=April 4, 2018|website=TMX Money|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with current asset value exceeding $1.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/mainstreet-equity-corp-releases-q1-2018-results-673897953.html|title=[MEQ] Mainstreet Equity Q1 2018 Results|last=|first=|date=Feb 13, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its conception in 2000 Mainstreet has grown its portfolio from 272 units with an approximate market value $17 million to 11,566 units and approximately $1.8 billion market value in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mainst.biz/investors/company-overview|title=Mainstreet Equity Company Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years, Dhillon and Mainstreet Equity have become a value creator through purchasing under-performing [[real estate]], and renovating the properties to meet a higher standard.

Under Dhillon, Mainstreet has achieved a 1,270% return on investment from September 2003 to September 2014, making it Canada's highest performing real estate company. The company's assets consist of over 12,000 apartment units in [[Western Canada]].

Mainstreet Equity Corporation differs from other real estate companies as it is a corporation and not a [[Real estate investment trust|REIT]], operating as a add-value consolidator of mid-market multi-family apartment buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/investing/mainstreet-equity/|title=Stock pick: Mainstreet Equity Corp (MEQ) buys fixer-upper rentals for double-digit growth|last=Borzykowski|first=Bryan|date=May 26, 2014|work=Canadian Business|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstreet Equity has positioned itself in the Canadian market place to specialize in the acquisition of mid-market multi-family properties. The term "[[Mid market price|Mid-market]]" is used to define a property by size, location, condition, and management. Generally, in the Canadian marketplace mid-market properties have less than 100 units, making them less attractive to large institutional investors. Buildings that are considered to be 'mid-market' are often mismanaged and left in relatively poor condition, often requiring renovations or upgrades to bring them to the market standard. Mainstreet Equity is able to attract renters and tenants to their properties through their innovative approach, providing renovated apartment rentals that are often below the standard market price and branded as boutique apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mainst.biz/investors/company-overview|title=Mainstreet Equity (MEQ) Company Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dhillon School Of Business Logo.jpg|alt=Dhillon School Of Business Logo|none|thumb|Dhillon School Of Business Logo]]

In March 2018, Dhillon with the University of Lethbridge established the Dhillon School of Business, which aims to provide innovative approaches to education with an emphasis on futuristic learning.

Dhillon's generous gift of $10 million to the University of Lethbridge came with the goal of transforming the University of Lethbridge's faculty of management into one of the leading fintech schools in the country focusing on progressive and innovative fields like; blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and artificial intelligence.

The Dhillon School of Business is looking to add to the university's curriculum with the study of disruptive financial technologies such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[blockchain]], and cryptocurrencies like [[Bitcoin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/the-university-of-lethbridges-10-million-fintech-transformation/|title=The University of Lethbridge's $10-million fintech transformation|last=Davis|first=Anthony A.|date=March 26, 2018|work=Maclean's Magazine|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dhillon is the [[Consul (representative)|Honorary Consul General]] for Belize in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.embassypages.com/missions/embassy8971/|title=Embassy Pages|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently owns a 3,000-acre private island in Belize located near Belize's largest island, [[Ambergris Caye]], and the popular Caribbean destination of [[San Pedro Town]].

Dhillon is currently developing the island into a world-class tourist resort. Outside of active investment in Belize, Dhillon has further interest in Belize as he is the published author of the book 'Business and Retirement Guide to Belize' currently in its second edition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1383">The [[computer graphics]] supervisor, or '''CG Supervisor''', is a person involved in the production of [[computer generated imagery]], be it [[animation]] or [[visual effects]]. Due to the variety of productions and duties required, most CG supervisors are specialized in one area such as [[art]], [[computer programming|programming]], or management. On large productions, there might be several CG Supervisors, each concentrating on a specific area.

Typical duties of the CG supervisor include:

*Designing and implementing the technical, artistic pipeline and [[workflow]] of a production.
*Designing and possibly implementing tools used in production.
*Assisting the [[movie producer|producer]] by reviewing [[budget]]s and schedules.
*Training the [[film crew|crew]] and making sure the tools required for the project are up to the task.
*Designing and supervising the creation of CG imagery.
*Leading the [[technical director]]s (TDs) in solving problems the production faces on a day-to-day basis.
*Assisting and supervising the [[artist]]s in achieving the artistic goals of the production.

Due to the variety of tasks and the obligations of [[problem solving]] as the "go-to person", the CG supervisor is usually able to handle any individual part of the production in addition to managing.

It is sold by [[Princes (company)|Princes Limited]], a British food producer owned by [[Mitsubishi]]. The brand is owned by '''Edible Oils Limited''', a joint venture between [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), an American food processing corporation, and Princes.  The product is produced at a factory in [[Erith]], England.

In October 2006, Cookeen and the other hard vegetable fats manufactured by Edible Oils Limited were reformulated to remove hydrogenated vegetable oils, which contain [[trans fat]], due to health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home baking brands remove hydrogenated vegetable oil|url=http://www.princesgroup.com/news/home-baking-brands-remove-hydrogenated-vegetable-oil/|accessdate=19 November 2013|date=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
He attended [[Bundaberg State High School]] and [[Queensland University]] graduating in economics, and at [[Cambridge University]] on a Shell Postgraduate Scholarship to [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] gaining a further degree with First Class Honours.

==Career==
Two years as Associate Professor of Economics at the [[University of Calgary]], Canada and then lecturing in Economics at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=D. A.|title=A Comment on Professor Kaldor's Comparison of an Expenditure and an Income Tax|journal=The Journal of Political Economy|date=September 1968|volume=76|series=5|issue=September/October|pages=1085–1087|jstor=1830040|doi=10.1086/259471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was seconded from the ANU to the [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Department of the Treasury]] (6 months), then three years with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in Washington DC focusing on taxation issues in [[Thailand]], [[Kenya]], [[Barbados]] and [[Swaziland]] all resulting in detailed reports.&lt;ref&gt;for example, ''Report on Taxation in Swaziland'' (with Dr Harold C. Wilkenfeld; submitted to the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland, 8 March 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consultant to Treasury he worked on a Taxation Review and in various [[Public servant|public service]] positions in taxation and [[public finance]]. Key roles included Research Director of the Committee of Inquiry into Inflation and Taxation (chaired by Professor Russell Mathews)&lt;ref&gt;''Report: Inflation and Taxation'' Committee of Inquiry into Inflation and Taxation, Australian Government Publishing Service, 1975. (The Matthews Report)&lt;/ref&gt;  and assisting Professor [[Trevor Swan]] with the Review of the [[personal income tax]] system for the 1975–76 Hayden Budget.

From 1978 until 1986, he was Policy Co-ordinator for the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat and continued as Head of this Policy Co-ordination Unit. Significant policy papers and reports include ''Alternative strategies to meet the income needs of the aged''&lt;ref&gt;Daryl Dixon, Chris Foster and Phil Gallagher, (1982), ''Alternative strategies to meet the income needs of the aged'', Social Welfare Policy Secretariat, AGPS&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tax credits and reform of the tax and social security systems''.&lt;ref&gt;Daryl Dixon, (1985), ''Tax credits and reform of the tax and social security systems'' Australian Tax Research Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1986, he has been an independent writer and consultant. He has worked for the Australian Commission for the Future comparing the savings policies of Australia and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;The report highlights the successful scheme which allows Singaporeans to borrow funds from their [[Central Provident Fund]] (superannuation) account for use as a deposit in Public Housing projects resulting in an increase in the [[home ownership]] rate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saving for the future: a comparative study of "savings policies" in Singapore and Australia'' (with Georgina Carnegie), Australian Commission for the Future Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daryl also worked as a consultant to the Social Welfare Policy branch of the [[Brotherhood of St Laurence]] producing significant published [[discussion paper]]s including ''The way ahead in fiscal policy''.&lt;ref&gt;''Unemployment: the economic and social costs''1988 &amp; 1992 and with the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Public Sector Management Institute, Mondash University, ''The way ahead in fiscal policy'', 1991 and ''Superannuation: the costs and benefits'', 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Daryl began writing the many [[newspaper article]]s and published books on personal investment, taxation and superannuation for which he became widely known in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Articles published in ''The National Times'', ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', ''The Australian'', ''Canberra Times'', ''The Age'' and many others&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Daryl started Dixon Advisory, then Daryl Dixon Writer and Consultant.

In 2007 there was a playful reference in [[The Canberra Times]] newspaper to his understanding of superannuation in Australia which claimed that there were only three people who really understood super in Australia – "one is dead, one went mad and the other is Daryl Dixon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Dr Jenny|title=Demystifying Superannuation|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A play on words from Lord Palmerston who is reported to have said: “Only three people have ever really understood the Schleswig-Holstein business—the Prince Consort, who is dead, a German professor, who has gone mad, and I, who have forgotten all about it.")

In 2012, The Strategic Super Investor magazine made Daryl the subject of their annual in Focus profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coye|first=Jackey|title=Love your Work|journal=The Strategic Super Investor|date=December 2012|volume=1|series=2|issue=Summer 2012 – 13|pages=34–37|url=http://strategicsuperinvestor.com.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020003232/http://www.strategicsuperinvestor.com.au/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1676">'''Sir John Derek Alun-Jones ''' (6 June 1933 &amp;ndash; 19 January 2008) was a British businessman and chairman of [[Ferranti]] at the time of its merger with US company  [[International Signal and Control]] (ISC).

He was educated at [[Lancing College]] and [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], where he read Law.  He began his career with [[Philips Industrial]] in 1957, and became managing director of [[Expandite]] in 1966. He moved to [[Burmah Oil]] in 1971, and became a director of Burmah Oil Trading before moving to Ferranti in 1975.

Alun-Jones was appointed chairman of Ferranti in 1982 and oversaw the £420 million merger with the [[Pennsylvania]] based company International Signal &amp; Control in 1987.  However, it soon became apparent that a subsidiary of ISC had been involved in a huge fraud which had inflated the value of ISC at the time of the merger.  Ferranti went into receivership in 1993.

He remained a director of several companies after leaving Ferranti and was chairman of the governors of Lancing College from 1986 to 1999. He was knighted in 1987.

'''Hubs and nodes''' is a geographic model explaining how linked regions can co-operate to fulfill elements of an industry's [[value chain]] and collectively gain sufficient mass to drive [[innovation]] growth. The model of hubs and nodes builds on [[Porter's cluster]] model which served well in the past, but as businesses and regions around the world have adjusted to the realities of [[globalization]], the concept of clusters is becoming outdated.

==Disaggregation of clusters==
Companies are realizing that they may not require a particular stage of production to be in close geographic proximity. As barriers to long-distance national and global transactions have fallen through advances in [[technology]] and [[logistics]], such as the growth of the [[Internet]] and [[Courier|overnight package services]], it has become increasingly possible to relocate operations such as [[research]], [[New product development|product development]], and [[manufacturing]] to countries and regions with relevant expertise and lower costs. It is common among [[consumer goods]], for example, to have concept generation centered in one locale, product testing and refinement in another, and manufacturing and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] in still others. Elements of development, production and distribution are being more and more completed beyond the borders of historical clusters. 

As more companies progress beyond the cluster model, they increasingly expand and diversify their operations to locations where their investments will be most profitable. For companies adequately prepared for the rapid globalization process, their [[research and development]], manufacturing and distribution stages fare better as these businesses are able to reduce their costs and potentially realizing new efficiencies and increased speeds of product development. The spirit of the cluster model may remain intact, and the various stages of production will still be shared by a number of different entities, but geographical proximity need no longer bind the entities together

== Biography ==
Gharajedaghi obtained his BA in Systems Engineering from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1963.

Gharajedaghi's research interests has evolved from his "early training in information systems ... to operations research, behavioral sciences, and finally, for the last 25 years to the development design thinking as the third generation of systems thinking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domresearchlab.com/profile/jamshid-gharajedaghi Jamshid Gharajedaghi] at ''domresearchlab.com.'' Accessed 03-03-2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Modeling of social systems ===
In the 1988 article "Mechanisms, organisms and social systems" Gharajedaghi and [[Russell L. Ackoff|Ackoff]] argue, that there is a fundamental flaw in the traditional way to think about [[social system]]s. They argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To think about anything requires an image or concept of it, a model. To think about a thing as complex as a social system most people use a model of something similar, simpler and more familiar. Traditionally, two types of models have been used in efforts to acquire information, knowledge and understanding of social systems: mechanistic and organismic. But, in a world of accelerating change, increasing uncertainty and growing complexity, it is becoming apparent that these are inadequate as guides to decision and action. The growing number of social crises and dilemmas that we face should be clear evidence that something is fundamentally wrong with the way we think about social systems.&lt;ref name="GA 1988"&gt;Gharajedaghi and Ackoff (1988, p. 289)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their paper they have tried to describe and explain 

&lt;blockquote&gt;the deficiencies of the two traditional ways of thinking about social systems. We then develop a third type of model, one we believe does not suffer from these inadequacies, a social system model which seeks to penetrate beyond the nature of machine and organisms to understand social systems in their own right.&lt;ref name="GA 1988"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Systems thinking ===
Gharajedaghi present his work as third generation of systems thinking. In the first chapter of his 1999 book "Systems thinking" he explains his point of view: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The analytical approach has remained essentially intact for nearly four hundred years, but systems thinking has already gone through three distinct generations of change. The first generation of systems thinking (operations research) dealt with the challenge of interdependency in the context of mechanical (deterministic) systems. The second generation of systems thinking (cybernetics and open systems) dealt with the dual challenges of interdependency and self-organization (neg-entropy)4 in the context of living systems. The third generation of systems thinking (design) responds to the triple challenge of interdependency, self-organization, and choice in the context of sociocultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gharajedaghi (2005, p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Business architecture ===
{{see also|History of business architecture}}
In the 1990s the [[information age]] was unfolding&lt;ref&gt;[[Zachman, John A.]] "[http://www.cioindex.com/nm/articlefiles/63503-EAIssueForTheCenturyZachman.pdf Enterprise architecture: The issue of the century]." ''Database Programming and Design'' 10.3 (1997): 44-53.&lt;/ref&gt; changing the global market economy. With the businesses adapting, the new concept of business architecture was presented as promising alternative. Gharajedaghi (1999) explained the context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a global market economy with ever-increasing levels of disturbance, a viable business can no longer be locked into a single form or function. Success comes from a self-renewing capability to spontaneously create structures and functions that fit the moment. In this context, proper functioning of self-reference would certainly prevent the vacillations and the random search for new products/markets that have, over the past years, destroyed so many businesses.&lt;br&gt;In fact, the ability to continuously match the portfolio of internal competencies with the portfolio of emerging market opportunities is the foundation of the emerging concept of new business architecture ...&lt;ref&gt;Gharajedaghi (1999/2005, p. 152)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bodine and Hilty (2009) "important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]]'s book ''Reengineering the Corporation'', which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The [[Balanced Scorecard]] developed by [[Robert S. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]] and [[David P. Norton|David Norton]] at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions."&lt;ref name="BH 2009"&gt;Paul Arthur Bodine and Jack Hilty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6355">[[File:Chongqing 005.jpg|thumb|A view of the Jiefangbei CBD skyline in Yuzhong district]]

'''Jiefangbei''' CBD ({{zh|s=解放碑中央商务区|w=Jie-Fang-Bei|p=Jiefangbei Zhongyang Shangwuqu}}), also known as '''Jiefangbei Shangye Buxingjie''' (重庆解放碑步行街), is the ultra-dense, urbanized downtown and [[central business district]] in the city of [[Chongqing]], China, that is centred on a large [[pedestrian mall]] with a landmark monument tower (Jiefangbei) surrounded by collections of tall skyscrapers.

==Overview==
The area surrounding the Jiefangbei monument tower makes up the main [[central business district]] of the [[Yuzhong District]] of Chongqing city and is the most prominent CBD in the interior west of China. Thousands of shops, bars, and restaurants are located in Jiefangbei CBD including numerous large international [[department store]]s, upscale designer boutiques, local street food stalls, movie theatres, bars, and dance clubs; all clustered in pedestrian only streets surrounding the Jiefangbei monument and pedestrian square.

The Jiefangbei pedestrian square itself is lined with numerous giant mega-shopping malls with jumbo-tron [[LED screen]]s and illuminated advertising [[billboard]]s along with the city's tallest commercial [[skyscraper]]s, world class international hotels, and luxurious residential accommodations. According to [[Women's Wear Daily]], in 2013, Jiefangbei Square was popular with "young, stylish people to meet and shop at stores like [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], [[Ermenegildo Zegna]], [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Gucci]] and [[Rolex]]."&lt;ref name="area 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/they-are-wearing/they-are-wearing-summer-shopping-in-western-china-7071014 | title=They Are Wearing: Summer Shopping in Western China | publisher=WWD | date=31 July 2013 | accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jiefangbei Shopping Square was completed in 1997.

==Geography==
Jiefangbei consists of a large pedestrian square&lt;ref name="area 2013"/&gt; surrounding the 27.5-metre tall '''People's Liberation Monument''' (World War II victory). The 25,000-square-metre shopping square is flanked by a large number of large multi-floor international department stores, streetfront luxury boutiques and upscale restaurants, and commercial super-tall skyscrapers with podiums offering additional retail options street side and underground.

Jiefangbei is at the centre of Chongqing city&lt;ref name="area 2013"/&gt; immediately uphill from the Chaotianmen Port; which itself is at the confluence of the [[Jialing River|Jialing]] and [[Yangtze River]]s.

'''Avram Joel Spolsky''' (born 1965) is a software engineer and writer. He is the author of ''Joel on Software'', a blog on software development, and the creator of the project management software [[Trello]].&lt;ref name="tri"&gt;{{Triangulation|277|Joel Spolsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Program Manager on the [[Microsoft Excel]] team between 1991 and 1994. He later founded [[Fog Creek Software]] in 2000 and launched the ''Joel on Software'' blog. In 2008, he launched the [[Stack Overflow]] programmer Q&amp;A site in collaboration with [[Jeff Atwood]]. Using the Stack Exchange software product which powers Stack Overflow, the [[Stack Exchange|Stack Exchange Network]] now hosts over 170 Q&amp;A sites.

==Biography==
Spolsky was born to [[Jewish]] parents and grew up in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], New Mexico, and lived there until he was 15.&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html |title=About Joel Spolsky |first=Joel |last=Spolsky |date=October 30, 2005 |work=Joel on Software |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved with his family to [[Israel]], where he attended high school and completed his military service in the [[Paratroopers Brigade]].&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; He was one of the founders of the [[kibbutz]] [[Hanaton]] in [[Lower Galilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joel.spolsky.com/ |title=Joel Spolsky |first=Joel |last=Spolsky |work=joel.spolsky.com |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, he returned to the United States to attend college. He studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] for a year before transferring to [[Yale University]], where he was a member of [[Pierson College]] and graduated in 1991 with a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in [[Computer Science]].&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

Spolsky started working at [[Microsoft]] in 1991&lt;ref name="FoundersAtWork"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.foundersatwork.com/joel-spolksy.html |chapter=Interview: Joel Spolsky Co-Founder, Fog Creek Software |first=Jessica |last=Livingston |year=2007 |title=[[Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days]] |publisher=[[Apress]] |isbn=9781590597149 |authorlink=Jessica Livingston |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a Program Manager on the [[Microsoft Excel]] team, where he designed [[Visual Basic for Applications|Excel Basic]] and drove Microsoft's [[Visual Basic for Applications]] strategy.&lt;ref name="softletter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.softletter.com/SMS_archives/joel_spolsky.shtml |title=An Interview with Joel Spolsky |work=SoftLetter.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809211704/http://www.softletter.com/SMS_archives/joel_spolsky.shtml |archivedate=August 9, 2007 |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] in 1995 where he worked for [[Viacom]] and [[Juno Online Services]].&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; In 2000, he founded Fog Creek Software and created the ''Joel on Software'' blog.&lt;ref name="FoundersAtWork"/&gt; ''Joel on Software'' was "one of the first blogs set up by a business owner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/columns/howhardcoulditbe/index.html |title=How Hard Could it Be |work=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]] |first=Joel |last=Spolsky |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Spolsky co-produced and appeared in ''[[Aardvark'd: 12 Weeks with Geeks]]'', a documentary documenting Fog Creek's development of [[Project Aardvark]], a remote assistance tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2290953/ |title=Joel Spolsky |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spolsky also co-founded [[Stack Overflow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introducing Stackoverflow.com |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001101.html |work=Coding Horror |date=April 16, 2008 |authorlink=Jeff Atwood |first=Jeff |last=Atwood |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a question and answer community website for software developers, with [[Jeff Atwood]]. He is now CEO of the resulting [[Stack Overflow]] and the Stack Exchange Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stackexchange.com/about/management |title=Management Team |work=[[Stack Exchange Network]] |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Spolsky launched [[Trello]], an online project management tool inspired by [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/01/06.html |title=How Trello is different |date=January 6, 2012 |first=Joel |last=Spolsky |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Spolsky announced the appointment of [[Anil Dash]] as Fog Creek Software's new CEO, with Spolsky continuing as Stack Overflow's CEO and as a Fog Creek Software board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/06/anil-dash-is-the-new-ceo-of-fog-creek-software/|first=Joel|last=Spolsky|date=December 6, 2016|title=Anil Dash is the new CEO of Fog Creek Software
|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of five books, including ''User Interface Design for Programmers'' and ''Smart and Gets Things Done''. He is also the creator of "The Joel Test".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html The Joel Test]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spolsky coined the term ''fix it twice'' for a process improvement method. It implies a quick, immediate solution for fixing an incident and a second, slower fix for preventing the same problem from occurring again by targeting the [[Root cause analysis|root cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html |title=Seven steps to remarkable customer service |date=February 19, 2007 |first=Joel |last=Spolsky |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His use of the term ''Shlemiel the painter's algorithm'', referring to an algorithm that is not scalable due to performing too many redundant actions, was described by ''salon.com'''s Scott Rosenberg as an example of good writing "about their insular world in a way that wins the respect of their colleagues and the attention of outsiders."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{citation|last=Rosenberg|first=Scott|title=The Shlemiel way of software|date=December 9, 2004|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2004/12/09/spolsky/|publisher=salon.com}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spolsky recently made an appearance at the WeAreDevelopers Conference 2017, stating how developers are writing the script for the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVHMZGnTmTs&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, Spolsky talks about how software is eating the world, how it is becoming more evident in everyday life as people interact with more software on a day-to-day basis, and how developers are helping to shape how the world will work as technology keeps evolving. He uses the metaphor "we are just little vegetables floating in software soup", referring to our constant use of software for the most mundane activities, including work, social networking, and even taking a cab.

===Personal life===
Spolsky announced his marriage to his husband, Jared, on social media and his blog.&lt;ref name=JoelSpolskyNYC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html|accessdate=27 June 2015|title=About Joel Spolsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=stackoverflow|url=http://meta.stackoverflow.com/revisions/297871/1|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Untitled (Joel Spolsky on Twitter)|url=https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/265081187427569665|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lives on the [[Upper West Side (Manhattan)|Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=JoelSpolskyNYC/&gt;

==Schlemiel the Painter's algorithm== &lt;!-- Anchor from [[Schlemiel the Painter's algorithm] redirect; caution. --&gt;
In software development, a ''Shlemiel the painter's algorithm'' (sometimes, ''Shlemiel the painter algorithm'', not to be confused with "[[Painter's algorithm]]") is a method that is inefficient because the programmer has overlooked some fundamental issues at the very [[High and low level|lowest levels]] of [[software design]]. The term was coined in 2001 by Spolsky, who used a [[Yiddish]] joke to illustrate a certain poor programming practice: Schlemiel (also rendered Shlemiel) is to paint the dotted lines down the middle of a road. Each day, Schlemiel paints less than he painted the day before, and complains that it is because each day he gets farther away from the paint can, and it takes him longer to go back and put paint on his brush.&lt;ref name="basics"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Spolsky |first=Joel |title=Back to Basics |date=December 11, 2001 |website=Joel on Software |publisher=[[WP:SPS|Self-published]] |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inefficiency to which Spolsky was drawing an analogy was the poor programming practice of repeated [[concatenation]] of [[C (programming language)|C]]-style [[null-terminated string]]s.&lt;ref name="basics" /&gt; The first step in every implementation of the [[C standard library]] function for concatenating strings is determining the length of the first string by checking each character to see if it is the terminating [[null character]]. Next, the second string is copied to the end of the first.

In Spolsky's example, the "Schlemiels" occur when multiple strings are concatenated together:
&lt;source lang="c" line&gt;
    strcat( buffer, "John" );    // Here, the string "John" is appended to the buffer
    strcat( buffer, "Paul" );    // Now the string "Paul" is appended to that
    strcat( buffer, "George" );  // ... and "George" is appended to that
    strcat( buffer, "Ringo" );   // ... and "Ringo" is appended to that
&lt;/source&gt;
After "Paul" has been appended to "John", the length of "JohnPaul" (or, more precisely, the position of the terminating null character) is known within the [[Scope (programming)|scope]] of &lt;code&gt;[[strcat]]()&lt;/code&gt; but is discarded upon the end of function. Afterwards, when &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt; is told to append "George" to "JohnPaul", &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt; starts at the very first character of "JohnPaul" (which is "J") all over again just to find the terminating null character. Each subsequent call to &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt; has to compute the length again before concatenating another name to the &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt;. Analogous to Schlemiel not carrying the paint bucket (or the string's length) with him, all the subsequent &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt;s have to "walk" the length of the string again to determine where the second string should be copied. As more data is added to &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; with each call to &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt;, that terminating null character also gets farther away from the beginning, meaning subsequent calls are increasingly slower.

The problems illustrated by Spolsky's example are not noticed by a programmer who is using a high-level language and has little or no understanding of how the language implementation works, including some basic knowledge of its underlying principles and functions.&lt;ref&gt;'''NOTE:''' For purposes of this discussion, an appropriate level of understanding of how the "language implementation" works, would usually include: having some knowledge of the "time complexity" of the compiler generated code -- including code that is ''invoked by'' the compiler generated code, such as subroutine libraries and class libraries. Understanding the relevant algorithms used within that compiler generated code, and within library routines called by it, does not necessarily mean having the knowledge required to (design, and) '''write''' that code; but it would include knowing enough to be able to '''read''' that code intelligently. When we talk about the "language implementation", typically we include the material that is provided when someone downloads the compiler and run-time package[s], and documentation, and licenses, after having decided to use (or to evaluate) a certain programming language. That material may include not only the run-time libraries that are formally part of the language implementation, but also some other subroutine libraries and class libraries that may influence some users' decisions about which language to use, even if those software packages are themselves written [or, "mostly" written] in the same language that they serve to enhance the usefulness of. There might not be a clear dividing line between "language implementation" [-type] run-time package[s], and other software that may well be [[Free and open-source software]] ([[Free and open-source software|FLOSS]]) that happens to be callable from (and "associated with") a certain language.&lt;/ref&gt; "Some of the biggest mistakes people make even at the highest architectural levels come from having a weak or broken understanding of a few simple things at the very lowest levels."&lt;ref name="basics" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9212">'''Kichimatsu Kishi''' (岸 吉松 ''Kishi Kichimatsu'', ?–1956) was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrant to the [[United States]] who worked as a farmer and businessman. Along with fellow immigrants from Japan, his impact on rice farming in the southern United States would change the agricultural industry of the region. Kishi would establish an [[agricultural]] colony in [[Southeast Texas]] and would own an oil company. Born as one of eight children to a Japanese banker, he attended [[Hitotsubashi University]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], but was taken from his studies in 1904 to fight in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/txtext/japanese/htms/6.htm The Japanese Texans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901160958/http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/txtext/japanese/htms/6.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was eventually sent to [[Manchuria]] on the mainland of [[China]] where he remained until the Japanese victory in 1905. He considered remaining there, but the high cost of land and lawlessness prompted him to return to his homeland. Years earlier, [[Sadatsuchi Uchida]] (Japan’s consul to the United States) toured the southern United States in 1902. Uchida reported back to Japan with promising news that the rice farming was underdeveloped and showed potential for large profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/txtext/japanese/htms/2.htm The Japanese Texans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901160920/http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/txtext/japanese/htms/2.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the dense population of Japan and limited workable land meant that many rice farmers would never own their own land. This sparked Kishi’s interest in migrating to the United States in 1906.

==Travel to the United States==
Kishi looked for suitable land, starting in [[California]] and moving on to the [[Carolinas]], and finally discovering the area near the town of Terry in central [[Orange County, Texas]] ideal. Located as one of the stops of the [[Texas and New Orleans Railroad]], Terry was a [[lumber]] and agricultural town with nearby bayous that could be tapped for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hvt19 Handbook of Texas Online - TERRY, TX&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
It was here that Kishi would establish what is now known as the Kishi Colony. He purchased a land tract of approximately {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} with borrowed money in 1907, and by the following year, his family would reside there with the first rice crop established.&lt;ref name="hvk49"&gt;"[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hvk49 Kishi Colony, Texas]" [[Handbook of Texas Online]]. Retrieved on 2009-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, when the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]] was dredged for ships nearby, the saltwater of the nearby gulf was allowed to flow into the bayou used to irrigate the rice field, destroying the crop.&lt;ref name="hvk49" /&gt;
Kishi then diversified his farm to grow other vegetables such as cotton, corn, and cabbage. The Kishi Colony attracted other Japanese immigrants from states like California that at the time, prohibited people such as Japanese and other foreigners from owning land there.&lt;ref name="brady2"&gt;[http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/hiddenhistory/Pages1/brady2.htm Japanese Rice Colonies on the Gulf Coast&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916153823/http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/hiddenhistory/Pages1/brady2.htm |date=2006-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also not uncommon to see people of different heritages such as Mexicans, Cajuns, and African-Americans working within the colony. After the passage of the [[California Alien Land Law of 1913]], many more Japanese would begin to migrate to Texas. Though the Japanese were initially welcomed, hostility arose against their moving in. The [[Texas Legislature]] passed a law similar to California's, but many of the Japanese-Texans had enough political influence to weaken it, while still maintaining their land ownership.&lt;ref name="brady2" /&gt;

==Kishi’s oil business==
The discovery of [[oil]] on the Kishi property in 1919 attracted the interest of [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], who in 1921 was touring the United States oil producing facilities in response to Japan’s growing navy. Yamamoto’s meeting with Kishi would help spark his interest in forming the Orange Petroleum Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southeasttexaslive.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=13112405&amp;BRD=2287&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=512588&amp;rfi=8 The Beaumont Enterprise - Recalling Kishi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006132848/http://www.southeasttexaslive.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=13112405&amp;BRD=2287&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=512588&amp;rfi=8 |date=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, it seemed Kishi would succeed greatly. He did make enough money to pay back his debtors. During this time Kishi would continue to purchase land. Yamamoto visited the site again in 1924 and found the oil production doing well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~hirasaki2/Kishi_Colony/Yamamoto.htm Yamamoto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930203502/http://home.att.net/~hirasaki2/Kishi_Colony/Yamamoto.htm |date=2005-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only several years later, the wells would run dry and the oil venture finally ended in 1925. Afterward, the [[Great Depression]] would also have a negative impact on the Kishi colony.&lt;ref name="terry"&gt;[http://www.wtblock.com/wtblockjr/Terry.htm Old Ghost Town Once Was Home To Great Pioneer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Crop disease along with harsh weather destroyed the produce of the farm. In September 1931, Kishi lost his land to foreclosure. His son Taro, who had been working with a Japanese shipping company at the time, helped support his family by buying a small farm near [[Orange, Texas|Orange]]. The Kishi family managed to lease a portion of their former land as well.

Years later, Kichimatsu Kishi was detained by authorities and kept for two months at Camp Kenedy near [[San Antonio]] after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], most likely due to his previous contact with Yamamoto.&lt;ref name="terry" /&gt; With the influence of the prominent businessmen of Orange such as the Stark and Sims families, he was released back to the community without restriction.

== Taro Kishi ==
Kichimatsu’s son Taro would become [[Texas A&amp;M University]]’s first Asian student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=1a000e53fba |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007081103/http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=1a000e53fba |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a highly regarded football player, Taro Kishi helped Texas A&amp;M win a [[Southwest Conference]] championship and was one of the early great APA athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~hirasaki2/Taro_Kishi/A_M.htm A&amp;M&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905231002/http://home.att.net/~hirasaki2/Taro_Kishi/A_M.htm |date=2005-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1926 with a degree in agriculture.

==Markers of recognition and controversy==
The [[Texas Historical Commission]] has constructed a marker on road FM 1135 seven miles (11 km) southeast of [[Vidor, Texas]] in recognition of the accomplishments of Kishi and his colony to the region. In this same area, a road that runs through the central part of [[Orange County, Texas|Orange County]] was named "Jap Lane" years back, supposedly in honor of the Japanese for the positive impact on the agriculture of the region.{{cn|date=November 2016}} However, the word [[Jap]] is now considered a [[racial slur]] and the road's name has been targeted by civil rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacl.org/about_policies_1-1.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002222404/http://www.jacl.org/about_policies_1-1.php |archivedate=2006-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napost.com/news/community/march/mar30/tanamachi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328081944/http://www.napost.com/news/community/march/mar30/tanamachi.html |archivedate=2006-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2005, [[Orange County, Texas|Orange County]] has changed it to Duncanwoods Lane, Japanese Lane and Cajun Way. In 2007, FM 1135 received a new recognition as "Kishi Road" with a marker.

{{For|the film|The Last Shot}}
In the law of [[contracts]], under the '''last shot rule''', a party implicitly assented to and thereby accepted a [[counter-offer]] by conduct indicating lack of objection to it. In addition to being based on a questionable notion of implied assent, the last shot rule tended in practice to favor sellers over buyers, because sellers normally “fire the last shot” – i.e., send the last form.

'''Low rate initial production (LRIP)''' is a term commonly used in [[military]] [[weapon]] projects/programs to designate the phase of initial, small-quantity [[Manufacturing|production]]. The prospective first buyer and operator (i.e., a country's defense authorities and the relevant military units) gets to thoroughly test the weapons system over some protracted amount of time&amp;mdash;in order to gain a reasonable degree of confidence as to whether the system actually performs to the agreed-upon requirements before contracts for [[mass production]] are signed.  At the same time, manufacturers can use the LRIP as a production test-phase where they develop the assembly line models that would eventually be used in mass production. Therefore, the LRIP is commonly the first step in transitioning from highly customized, hand-built prototypes to the final mass-produced end product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://acc.dau.mil/adl/en-US/716926/file/78952/Instruction%20-%20USD%20(AT_L),%20DoDI%205000.02,%20Operation%20of%20DAS,%207%20Jan%202015.pdf|title = DoDI 5000.02, January 2015 - Operation of Defense Acquisition Strategy|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, either the production capability or the weapons system itself can be unready during the LRIP phase. This can mean that systems produced during LRIP are built significantly differently both in terms of technique and cost owing to the immaturity of the production line or changes in the weapons system's design, necessitating a large degree of hand-assembly and trial-and-error typically associated with the prototyping stage.  Furthermore, the cost of each LRIP system can be much greater than the final mass production unit cost, since the LRIP cost can include both the R&amp;D and setup cost for production, although the goal is that this additional cost is spread out over future production carried out by the assembly capacity developed during LRIP.

The term is also applied in fields other than weapons production, most commonly in non-weapon military equipment programs.

Immaturity in a system's design or its method of production discovered during LRIP phase can result in additional LRIP phases to verify corrections/improvements, or project cancellation. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has found that the [[United States Department of Defense]] rarely achieves projected cost savings because too many programs fail to move from LRIP to full-scale production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.fas.org/man/gao/ns97103.htm | publisher = FAS | title = Defense Aircraft Investments: Major Program Commitments Based on Optimistic Budget Projections | type = testimony | date = 3 May 1997 | id = GAO/T-NSIAD-97-103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8412">'''Microthermoforming''' is the abbreviation for [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] or microscale [[thermoforming]], or, more precisely, for thermoforming of microproducts or [[microstructure]] products. Microstructure products means products that have structures in the [[micrometre]] range and have their technical function provided by the shape of the microstructure [1]. Thermoforming [2] in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]] films or plates with their edges fixed by three-dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the films or plates into female moulds (negative forming) or over male moulds (positive forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro [[injection moulding]] or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer.

Moulds for polymer microreplication in general and in particular for microthermoforming can be fabricated by various methods such as mechanical micromachining, lithographic based methods in combination with electroplating (see also the so-called '[[LIGA]]' process) and wet or dry etching. And they can be fabricated of various materials such as metal, silicon and glass.

== State of the art ==
For several years now, at [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), a pressure or high pressure (thermo)forming process is used to fabricate film microchips for [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) [3–5] and for three-dimensional cell cultivation [6–8]. The process is derived from the macroscopic trapped sheet forming process [2]. This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as [[polycaprolactone]] (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100&amp;nbsp;µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.

First examples of processes coming near to something that could be called 'microthermoforming' originate from the second half of the nineties. So, in 1993, dome shaped polymer microstructures for use in electrical membrane switches were fabricated [9]. This was done between a mating upper and lower metal emboss die with a concave and a convex detail, respectively, first in a hot, then in a second cold press. And in 1999, corrugated sheet like polymer microstructures for use e.g. in electrostatic actuators were fabricated [10]. This was also done between heated tools and counter tools, namely in discontinuous processes between stamps or in continuous processes between rollers. Partly, the counter tool was a soft one in the form of a thicker, unpatterned film or plate made from an easily deformable, e.g. [[elastomeric]] material which is able to assume the shape of the hard, metallic tool. In 2006, at the School of Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering (PTFE) of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (GIT), the same technology approach was used to fabricate similar corrugated sheet like structures in a so-called 'rubber-assisted hot embossing process' [11].

== Features and applications ==
The microthermoforming process including its products can have all the advantageous properties of the powerful macroscopic production process. Moreover, the thermoformed microparts have additional, specific properties appearing only in microscale dimensions and resulting from their unusual morphology. Thermoformed e.g. [[microfluidic]] structures have free standing microcavities such as channels and reservoirs and they are thin walled partly in the range of a few micrometers. Specific properties of thermoformed microparts are, amongst others, their high flexibility, their small volume and mass, their low thermal resistance and heat capacity, and their low light absorbance and background fluorescence. Morphology and properties of these microparts now can result in improved or even new, so far unthought of applications.

Compared to the other microreplication processes, in microthermoforming, modifications of the film to be formed remain preserved beyond the forming step due to the already mentioned material coherence during this secondary forming process. This enables surface and bulk modification and functionalisation of the three-dimensionally formed films or membranes, namely as highly resolved micro- and nanopatterns, and all side, i.e. on hardly accessible side walls and even behind [[undercut (manufacturing)|undercuts]]. Thus, e.g. thermoformed chips for three-dimensional cell cultivation can be provided with pores, cell adhesion patterns [6–8], surface topologies and electrodes [12].

Future application fields for microthermoforming are expected to be

* generally life sciences, e.g. flexible film microchips such as [[µTAS]] (Micro Total Analysis Systems) and LOC ([[Lab-on-a-chip]]) devices, possibly in continuous format and combined with polytronic circuits, also as human implants
* especially [[tissue engineering]], e.g. film substrates or scaffolds for three-dimensional cell cultivation in fundamental research, medical diagnosis, pharmaceutical active substance research, and clinical research and therapy, particularly if integrated in standard laboratory platforms such as petri dishes and microtitre plates
* micropackaging, e.g. micro sensor and actuator housings or caps
* [[smart textiles]] etc.

A '''mixed economy''' is variously defined as an [[economic system]] blending elements of [[Market economy |market economies]] with elements of [[planned economies]], [[free market]]s with [[state interventionism]], or [[private enterprise]] with [[public enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

The first of these definitions refers to a mixture of markets with state interventionism, referring to [[capitalist]] [[market economies]] with strong [[Regulation|regulatory]] oversight, interventionist policies and governmental provision of [[public service]]s. The second definition is apolitical in nature and strictly refers to an economy containing a mixture of private enterprise with public enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown |first= Douglas | title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School | publisher= Routledge|date= November 11, 2011 |isbn= 978-0415608794 |pages = 10–11 |quote= The apolitical definition of 'mixed economy' generally refers to the mix of public and private ownership forms...Here 'mixed economy' itself does not specify a political form. it means an economy characterized by a combination of public and private ownership as well as planning and markets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, and particularly with reference to Western economies, the term "mixed economy" refers to a capitalist economy characterized by the predominance of private ownership of the [[means of production]] with profit-seeking enterprise and the [[accumulation of capital]] as its fundamental driving force.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In such a system, markets are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and governments wield indirect [[macroeconomic]] influence through [[Fiscal policy| fiscal]] and [[Monetary policy| monetary policies]] with a view to counteracting capitalism's history of [[Business cycle| boom/bust cycles]], [[unemployment]] and [[Economic inequality |income disparities]]. In this framework, varying degrees of public utilities and essential services operate under public ownership and state activity is often limited to providing public goods and universal civic requirements - such as [[healthcare]], [[physical infrastructure]] and management of [[public lands]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollin, Robert. 2007.

''New Left Review'' 46:July–August.  pp. 141–142. http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/other_publication_types/NLR28008.pdf.  "The underlying premise behind the mixed economy was straightforward. Keynes and like-minded reformers were not willing to give up on capitalism, and in particular, two of its basic features: that ownership and control of the economy's means of production would remain primarily in the hands of private capitalists; and that most economic activity would be guided by ‘market forces’, that is, the dynamic combination of material self-seeking and competition. More specifically, the driving force of the mixed economy, as with free-market capitalism, should continue to be capitalists trying to make as much profit as they can. At the same time, Keynes was clear that in maintaining a profit-driven marketplace, it was also imperative to introduce policy interventions to counteract capitalism’s inherent tendencies—demonstrated to devastating effect during the 1930s calamity—toward financial breakdowns, depressions, and mass unemployment. Keynes's framework also showed how full employment and social welfare interventions could be justified not simply on grounds of social uplift, but could also promote the stability of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Rees |first= Merlyn |title= [[The Public Sector in the Mixed Economy]] |publisher= Bratsford|date= 1973 |isbn= 978-0713413724 |pages = 240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to [[post-war]] Western and Northern European economic models as championed by [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]], the mixed economy is defined{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} as a form of capitalism where most industries are privately owned with only a small number of public utilities and essential services under public ownership. In the [[post-war era]], European social democracy became associated with this economic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Craig |first= Edward |title= [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Volume 8 | publisher= Routledge|date= June 1998 |isbn= 978-0415187138 |pages = 827|quote= In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Political ideology |economic ideal]], mixed economies are supported by people of various political persuasions, typically [[Centre-left politics| centre-left]] and [[Centre-right politics| centre-right]], such as social democrats&lt;ref&gt;

or Christian democrats.

The label "mixed economy" can also refer to [[socialist]] economies with a substantial role for non-[[Social ownership|social]] or non-public forms of ownership in the means of production, or to [[Soviet-type economic planning | Soviet-type planned economies]] that have been reformed to allow a greater role for [[market forces]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Etymology==
There is not only one definition of a mixed economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;oi=defmore&amp;q=define:mixed+economy A variety  of definitions for mixed economy.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are generally two major definitions, one being political and the other apolitical.

The political definition of a mixed economy refers to the degree of [[state interventionism]] in a market economy, portraying the state as encroaching onto the market under the assumption that the market is the "natural" mechanism for allocating resources. The political definition is limited to capitalistic economies and precludes an extension to non-capitalist systems, being concerned with [[public policy]] and state influence in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown|first= Douglas |title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School |publisher= Routledge|date=November 11, 2011|isbn= 978-0415608794|pages = 10–11 |quote= There are in general two broad yet distinguishable definitions of 'mixed economy': a political definition and an apolitical definition. The political definition refers to the degree of state intervention in what is basically a market economy. Thus this definition 'portray[s] the phenomenon in terms of state encroaching upon the market and thereby suggest[s] that market is the natural or preferable mechanism...The political definition of 'mixed economy' precludes extending it to non-capitalist systems }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the apolitical definition relates to patterns of ownership and management of economic enterprises in an economy.

The apolitical definition of mixed economy strictly refers to a mix of public and private ownership of enterprises in the economy and is unconcerned with political forms and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown|first= Douglas |title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School |publisher= Routledge|date=November 11, 2011|isbn= 978-0415608794|pages = 10–11 |quote= The apolitical definition of 'mixed economy' generally refers to the mix of public and private ownership forms...Here 'mixed economy' itself does not specify a political form. it means an economy characterized by a combination of public and private ownership as well as planning and markets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The term "mixed economy" arose in the context of political debate in the [[United Kingdom]] in the postwar period, although the set of policies later associated with the term had been advocated from at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reisman, David A. |title=Theories of the Mixed Economy (Theories of the mixed economy) |publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto Ltd |location= |year= |pages= |isbn=1-85196-214-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the mixed economy, including [[R. H. Tawney]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-04-323014-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tawney, R. H. |title=Equality |publisher=Allen and Unwin |location=London |year=1964 |pages= |isbn=0-04-323014-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Crosland]]&lt;ref name="isbn0-8371-9586-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Crosland, A. |title=The Future of socialism |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-8371-9586-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Shonfield]] were mostly associated with the [[British Labour Party]], although similar views were expressed by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] including [[Harold Macmillan]]. Critics of the mixed economy, including [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]], argued that there can be no lasting middle ground between economic planning and a market economy and any move in the direction of socialist planning is an unintentional move toward what Hilaire Bloc called "[[The Servile State|the servile state]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin. ''Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener'' St. Martin's Press (1991), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy==
In the apolitical sense, the term "mixed economy" is used to describe economic systems which combine various elements of [[Market (economics)|market economies]] and [[planned economy|planned economies]]. As most political-economic [[ideology|ideologies]] are defined in an idealized sense, what is described rarely—if ever—exists in practice. Most would not consider it unreasonable to label an economy that, while not being a perfect representation, very closely resembles an ideal by applying the rubric that denominates that ideal. When a system in question, however, diverges to a significant extent from an idealized [[Model (macroeconomics)|economic model]] or ideology, the task of identifying it can become problematic. Hence, the term "mixed economy" was coined. As it is unlikely that an economy will contain a perfectly even mix, mixed economies are usually noted as being skewed towards either [[private ownership]] or [[public ownership]], toward [[capitalism]] or [[socialism]], or toward a [[market economy]] or [[command economy]] in varying degrees.&lt;ref name=vn&gt;Vuong, Quan-Hoang. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/3639233832 Financial Markets in Vietnam's Transition Economy: Facts, Insights, Implications.] {{ISBN|978-3-639-23383-4}}, [[VDM Verlag]], Feb. 2010, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catholic social teaching ===
Jesuit author [[David Hollenbach]], S.J. has argued that [[Catholic social teaching]] calls for a "new form" of mixed economy. He refers back to [[Pope Pius XI]]'s statement that government "should supply help to the members of the social body, but may never destroy or absorb them".&lt;ref&gt;Pius XI, [http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19310515_quadragesimo-anno.html ''Quadragesimo Anno''], para 79, published 15 May 1931, accessed 12 August 2018; the papal text refers to "every social activity", not only to government.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollenbach writes that a socially just mixed economy involves labour, management and the state working together through a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] system that distributes economic power widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=132–133|author1=David Hollenbach, S.J.|chapter=Unemployment and Jobs: A Theological and Ethical Perspective|editor-last=Houck|editor-first=John||editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Oliver|title=Catholic social teaching and the United States economy: working papers for a bishops' pastoral|publisher=University Press of America|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, subsequent scholars have noted that conceiving of subsidiarity as a "top-down, government-driven political exercise" requires a selective reading of 1960s encyclicals. A more comprehensive reading of Catholic social teaching suggests a conceptualization of subsidiarity as a "bottom-up concept" that is "rooted in recognition of a common humanity, not in the political equivalent of ''noblese oblige''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=454|author1=Denis O'Brien|chapter=Subsidiarity and Solidarity|editor-last=Booth|editor-first=Phillip|||title=Catholic social teaching and the market economy|publisher=The Institute of Economic Affairs|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European social democracy ===
{{Social democracy sidebar}}
In the early [[post-war]] era in Western Europe, social democratic parties rejected the Stalinist political and economic model then current in the Soviet Union, committing themselves either to an alternate path to socialism or to a compromise between capitalism and socialism.{{sfn|Adams|1993|pp=102-103|ps=: "The emergence of social democracy was partly a result of the Cold War. People argued that if the Stalinist Soviet empire, where the state controlled everything, showed socialism in action, then socialism was not worth having. [...] The consensus policies of a mixed and managed economy and the welfare state, developed by the post-war Labour government, seemed in themselves to provide a basis for a viable socialism that would combine prosperity and freedom with social justice and the possibility of a full life for everyone. They could be seen as a compromise between socialism and capitalism."}} In this period, social democrats embraced a mixed economy based on the predominance of private property, with only a minority of essential utilities and public services under public ownership. As a result, social democracy became associated with [[Keynesian economics]], state interventionism and the welfare state, while abandoning the prior goal of replacing the capitalist system (factor markets, [[private property]] and [[wage labour]]){{sfn|Weisskopf|1992|p=10|ps=: "Thus social democrats do not try to do away with either the market or private property ownership; instead, they attempt to create conditions in which the operation of a capitalist market economy will lead to more egalitarian outcomes and encourage more democratic and more solidaristic practices than would a more conventional capitalist system."}} with a qualitatively different socialist [[economic system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=827}}: "In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=1410|ps=: "In addition, particularly since World War II, distinctions have sometimes been made between social democrats and socialists on the basis that the former have accepted the permanence of the mixed economy and have abandoned the idea of replacing the capitalist system with a qualitatively different socialist society."}}{{sfn|Heywood|2012|pp=125–128|ps=: "As an ideological stance, social democracy took shape around the mid-twentieth century, resulting from the tendency among western socialist parties not only to adopt parliamentary strategies, but also to revise their socialist goals. In particular, they abandoned the goal of abolishing capitalism and sought instead to reform or ‘humanize’ it. Social democracy therefore came to stand for a broad balance between the market economy, on the one hand, and state intervention, on the other."}}

=== Fascism ===
Although [[fascism]] is primarily a political ideology that stresses the importance of cultural and social issues over economics, fascism is generally supportive of a broadly capitalistic mixed economy. Fascism supports a state interventionism into markets and private enterprise, alongside a [[corporatist]] framework referred to as the "[[third position]]" that ostensibly aims to be a middle-ground between socialism and capitalism by mediating labour and business disputes to promote national unity. 20th century fascist regimes in Italy and Germany adopted large public works programs to stimulate their economies, state interventionism in largely private-sector dominated economies to promote re-armament and national interests. Scholars have drawn parallels between the American [[New Deal]] and public works programs promoted by fascism, arguing that fascism similarly arose in response to the threat of socialist revolution and similarly aimed to "save capitalism" and private property.&lt;ref&gt;''The Political Economy of Fascism'', by Gupta, Dipankar. 1977. Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 12, No. 25 (Jun. 18, 1977), pp. 987-992 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialism ===
"Mixed economies" as a mixture of socially-owned and private enterprise have been predicted and advocated by various socialists as a necessary transitional form between capitalism and socialism. Additionally, a number of proposals for socialist systems call for a mixture of different forms of enterprise ownership including a role for private enterprise. For example, [[Alexander Nove]]'s conception of "feasible socialism" outlines an economic system based on a combination of state-enterprises for large industries, worker and consumer cooperatives, private enterprises for small-scale operations and individually owned enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Feasible Socialism: Market or Plan – Or Both: http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Ratner/Feassoc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The social democratic theorist [[Eduard Bernstein]] advocated a form of mixed economy, believing that a mixed system of [[Public enterprise|public]], [[cooperative]] and [[private enterprise]] would be necessary for a long period of time before capitalism would evolve of its own accord into socialism.&lt;ref name="Steger, Manfred B. 1997. pg. 146"&gt;Steger, Manfred B.  ''The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein And Social Democracy''. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pg. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[People's Republic of China]] adopted a [[socialist market economy]], which represents an early stage of socialist development according to the [[Communist Party of China]]. The Communist Party takes the [[Marxism|Marxist]] position that an economic system containing diverse forms of ownership—but with the public sector playing a decisive role—is a necessary characteristic of an economy in the preliminary stage of developing socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/article/topic/bizchina/economicsystem/200406/20040600239133.shtml|title=Socialist Market Economic System |last= |first= |publisher=Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China |date=June 25, 2004 |website= |access-date=February 8, 2018|quote= The development of the economic system with public ownership playing a dominant role and diverse forms of ownership developing side by side is a basic characteristic of the socialist economic system at the preliminary stage. This is decided by the quality of socialism and the national situation in preliminary stage: first, China, as a socialist country, should persist in public ownership as the base of the socialist economy; second, China, as in its preliminary stage, should develop diverse forms of ownership on condition that the public ownership plays a dominant role }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] describes its economy as a "[[socialist-oriented market economy]]" that consists of a mixture of public, private and cooperative enterprise—a mixed economy that is oriented toward the long-term development of a socialist economy.

== Typology ==
=== Mix of free markets and state intervention ===
This meaning of a mixed economy refers to a combination of market forces with state intervention in the form of regulations, macroeconomic policies and social welfare interventions aimed at improving market outcomes. As such, this type of mixed economy falls under the framework of a capitalistic market economy, with macroeconomic interventions aimed at promoting the stability of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Pollin, Robert. 2007. '"Resurrection of the Rentier", book review of Andrew Glyn's ''Capitalism Unleashed:Finance, Globalization and Welfare''. ''New Left Review'' 46:July–August.  pp. 141–142. http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/other_publication_types/NLR28008.pdf.  "The underlying premise behind the mixed economy was straightforward. Keynes and like-minded reformers were not willing to give up on capitalism, and n particular, two of its basic features: that ownership and control of the economy’s means of production would remain primarily in the hands of private capitalists; and that most economic activity would be guided by ‘market forces’, that is, the dynamic combination of material self-seeking and competition. More specifically, the driving force of the mixed economy, as with free-market capitalism, should continue to be capitalists trying to make as much profit as they can. At the same time, Keynes was clear that in maintaining a profit-driven marketplace, it was also imperative to introduce policy interventions to counteract capitalism’s inherent tendencies—demonstrated to devastating effect during the 1930s calamity—toward financial breakdowns, depressions, and mass unemployment. Keynes’s framework also showed how full employment and social welfare interventions could be justified not simply on grounds of social uplift, but could also promote the stability of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of common government activity in this form of mixed economy include [[environmental protection]], maintenance of [[employment standards]], a standardized [[welfare]] system and [[competition law|maintenance of competition]].

Most contemporary market-oriented economies fall under this category, including the [[economy of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.usembassy.de/economy-conditions.htm U.S. Economy - Basic Conditions &amp; Resources]. U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany. "The United States is said to have a mixed economy because privately owned businesses and government both play important roles." Accessed: October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120114051146/http://infopedia.usembassy.or.kr/ENG/_f_030401.html (4)Outline of the U.S. Economy – (2)How the U.S. Economy Works]. U.S. Embassy Information Resource Center. "As a result, the American economy is perhaps better described as a "mixed" economy, with government playing an important role along with private enterprise. Although Americans often disagree about exactly where to draw the line between their beliefs in both free enterprise and government management, the mixed economy they have developed has been remarkably successful." Accessed: October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe the economies of countries that feature extensive [[welfare state]]s, such as the [[Nordic model]] practiced by the [[Nordic countries]], which combine free-market capitalism with an extensive welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Lahti, Arto. ''Globalization &amp; the Nordic Success Model: Part II.'' 2010. Arto Lahti &amp; Ventus Publishing ApS. p 60. {{ISBN|978-87-7681-550-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eds.

The German [[social market economy]] is the economic policy of modern Germany that steers a middle path between the goals of social democracy and capitalism within the framework of a private market economy and aims at maintaining a balance between a high rate of economic growth, low inflation, low levels of unemployment, good working conditions, public welfare and public services by using state intervention. Under its influence, Germany emerged from desolation and defeat to become an industrial giant within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

The [[American School (economics)|American School]] (also known as the National System) is the economic philosophy that dominated United States national policies from the time of the [[American Civil War]] until the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1061.html "The Progressive Movement"]. United States History. Retrieved February 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of three core policy initiatives: protecting industry through high tariffs (1861–1932; changing to subsidies and reciprocity from 1932–1970s), government investment in infrastructure through [[internal improvements]] and a national [[bank]] to promote the growth of productive enterprises. During this period, the United States grew into the largest economy in the world, surpassing the United Kingdom (though not the [[British Empire]]) by 1880.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Modern British Politics'', [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Political Economy, Robert O'Brien and Marc Williams&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Gill: "By 1880 the United States of America had overtaken and surpassed the UK as industrial leader of the world.: (from ''Trade Wars Against America: A History of United States Trade and Monetary Policy'' Chapter 6 titled "America becomes Number 1" pg. 39–49 – published 1990 by Praeger Publishers in the USA – {{ISBN|0-275-93316-4}})
* Lind: "Lincoln and his successors in the Republican party of 1865–1932, by presiding over the industrialization of the United State, foreclosed the option that the United States would remain a rural society with an agrarian economy, as so many Jeffersonians had hoped." and "Hamiltonian side … the Federalists; the National Republicans; the Whigs, the Republicans; the Progressives." (from ''Hamilton's Republic'' Introduction pg. xiv–xv – published 1997 by Free Press, Simon &amp; Schuster division in the USA – {{ISBN|0-684-83160-0}})
* Lind: "During the nineteenth century the dominant school of American political economy was the "American School" of developmental economic nationalism. … The patron saint of the American School was Alexander Hamilton, whose Report on Manufactures (1791) had called for federal government activism in sponsoring infrastructure development and industrialization behind tariff walls that would keep out British manufactured goods...The American School, elabourated in the nineteenth century by economists like Henry Carey (who advised President Lincoln), inspired the "American System" of Henry Clay and the protectionist import-substitution policies of Lincoln and his successors in the Republican party well into the twentieth century." (from ''Hamilton's Republic'' Part III "The American School of National Economy" pg. 229–230 published 1997 by Free Press, Simon &amp; Schuster division in the USA – {{ISBN|0-684-83160-0}})
* Richardson: "By 1865, the Republicans had developed a series of high tariffs and taxes that reflected the economic theories of Carey and Wayland and were designed to strengthen and benefit all parts of the American economy, raising the standard of living for everyone.

Chase, was an ex-Democrat, but of the moderate cariety on economics, one whom Joseph Dorfman could even describe as 'a good Hamiltonian, and a western progressive of the Lincoln stamp in everything from a tariff to a national bank.'"

=== Mix of private and public enterprise ===
This type of mixed economy specifically refers to a mixture of private and public ownership of industry and the means of production. As such, it is sometimes described as a "middle path" or transitional state between capitalism and socialism, but it can also refer to a mixture of [[state capitalism]] with private capitalism.

Examples include the economies of [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore]], [[Economy of Norway|Norway]], [[Economy of Vietnam|Vietnam]] and [[Socialist market economy|China]]—all of which feature large state-owned enterprise sectors operating alongside large private sectors. The French economy featured a large state sector from 1945 until 1986, mixing a substantial amount of state-owned enterprises and nationalized firms with private enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press |date=|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 187|quote=After World War II a wave of nationalizations occurred, affecting the Bank of France, the four largest commercial banks, the four leading groups of insurance companies, all electric power and gas producers, the coal mining industry, Air France, and the Renault automobile company (the last specifically because of wartime collabouration with the Nazis by its owner). Until 1981 no other firms  were nationalized, although occasionally new public enterprises were created from scratch or the government bought part of ownership, as it did with Dassault Aircraft in 1978. Until 1986 none of these industries were denationalized.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Chinese economic reforms initiated in 1978, the Chinese economy has reformed its state-owned enterprises and allowed greater scope for private enterprise to operate alongside the state and collective sectors. In the 1990s, the central government concentrated its ownership in strategic sectors of the economy, but local and provincial level state-owned enterprises continue to operate in almost every industry including information technology, automobiles, machinery and hospitality. The latest round of state-owned enterprise reform initiated in 2013 stressed increased dividend payouts of state enterprises to the central government and "mixed ownership reform" which includes partial private investment into state-owned firms. As a result, many nominally private-sector firms are actually partially state-owned by various levels of government and state institutional investors; and many state-owned enterprises are partially privately owned resulting in a "mixed ownership" economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2015/02/09/the-long-march-to-the-mixed-economy-in-china/ |title=The long march to the mixed economy in China |last= Fan|first= He|publisher=East Asia Forum |date=January 9, 2015 |website= East Asia Forum |access-date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mix of markets and economic planning ===
This type of mixed economy refers to a combination of economic planning with market forces for the guiding of production in an economy and may coincide with a mixture of private and public enterprise. It can include capitalist economies with indicative macroeconomic planning policies and socialist planned economies that introduced market forces into their economies, such as in [[Goulash Communism|Hungary]].

[[Dirigisme]] was an economic policy initiated under [[Charles de Gaulle]] in France, designating an economy where the government exerts strong directive influence through [[Indicative planning|indicative economic planning]]. In the period of Dirigisme, the French state used indicative economic planning to supplement market forces for guiding its market economy. It involved state control of industries such as transportation, energy and telecommunication infrastructures as well as various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain projects. Under its influence France experienced what is called "Thirty Glorious Years" of profound economic growth.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;(Gardner)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary inaugurated the [[New Economic Mechanism]] reforms in 1968 that introduced market processes into its planned economy. Under this system, firms were still publicly-owned but not subject to physical production targets and output quotas specified by a national plan. Firms were attached to state ministries which had the power to merge, dissolve and reorganize them, and which established the firm's operating sector. Enterprises had to acquire their inputs and sell their outputs in markets, eventually eroding away at the Soviet-style planned economy.

==Criticism==

Numerous economists have questioned the validity of the entire concept of a "mixed economy" when understood to be a mixture of socialism and capitalism.

In ''[[Human Action]]'', [[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that there can be no mixture of capitalism and socialism—either market logic or economic planning must dominate an economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mises|first= Ludwig |title= Human Action: A Treastise on Economics|publisher= Liberty Fund|date=|isbn= 978-0865976313|page = 259|quote= There is no mixture of the two systems possible or thinkable; there is no such thing as a mixed economy, a system that would be in part capitalistic and in part socialist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mises elabourated on this point by contending that even if a market economy contained numerous state-run or nationalized enterprises, this would not make the economy "mixed" because the existence of such organizations does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the market economy. These publicly owned enterprises would still be subject to market sovereignty, would have to acquire [[capital good]]s through markets, strive to maximize profits (or at the least try to minimize costs) and utilize monetary accounting for economic calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mises|first= Ludwig |title= Human Action: A Treastise on Economics|publisher= Liberty Fund|date=|isbn= 978-0865976313|page = 259|quote= The fact that the state or municipalities own and operate some plants does not alter the characteristic features of a market economy. These publicly owned and operated enterprises are subject to the sovereignty of the market. They must fit themselves, as buyers of raw materials, equipment, and labour, and as sellers of goods and services, into the scheme of the market economy. They are subject to the laws of the market and thereby depend on the consumers who may or may not patronize them. They must strive for profits, or at least, to avoid losses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical Marxism|Classical]] and [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] theorists also dispute the viability of a mixed economy as a "middle ground" between socialism and capitalism. Irrespective of enterprise ownership, either the capitalist [[law of value]] and [[accumulation of capital]] drives the economy, or conscious planning and [[Calculation in kind|non-monetary forms of valuation]] ultimately drive the economy. Therefore from the Great Depression onward extant "mixed economies" in the Western world are still functionally capitalist because they operate on the basis of capital accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch20.htm |title=The Limits of the Mixed Economy |author=Paul Mattick |date=1969 |publisher=Marxism.org |accessdate=17 January 2014 |quote= To be sure, 'orthodox Marxism' maintains that the mixed economy is still the capitalism of old, just as 'orthodox' bourgeois theory insists that the mixed economy is a camouflaged form of socialism. Generally, however, both the state-capitalist and mixed economies are recognized as economic systems adhering to the principle of progress by way of capital accumulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile enterprise asset management''' (or mobile EAM) refers to the mobile extension of work processes for maintenance, operations and repair of corporate or public-entity physical [[assets]], equipment, buildings and grounds. It involves management of [[work orders]] (planned, break/fix or service requests) via communication between a mobilized workforce and computer systems to maintain an organization’s facilities, structures and other assets.

The idea behind mobile EAM as a business practice is that it enables remote workers – employees who spend part or all of their time away from a central office – access to data from the organization’s computer [[application software]] for [[enterprise asset management]] (commonly referred to as an [[enterprise system]], EAM system or backend system), typically using a [[handheld]] or other mobile computer. This is to distinguish from the term [[mobile asset management]], which refers more broadly to the actual tools, instruments and containers organizations use to track and secure equipment and other such assets frequently on the move.

In the mobile EAM process, the organization eliminates a need for paper forms or other [[data reporting]] and communication methods ([[push-to-talk]] and radio) to move work order information to and from the point where the work is being performed.

While [[enterprise asset management]] encompasses the management of an organization’s entire asset portfolio across processes including equipment addition/ reduction, replacement, over-hauling, redundancy setup and maintenance budgets, mobile enterprise asset management is focused, by definition, strictly on the [[wireless]] automation of asset management data for such processes.

== Mobile EAM technology ==

When viewed and used on a handheld device, mobile work order applications provide details such as location, stepwise job plans, safety alerts, [[lock-outs]] and prior work history on the asset, giving a maintenance technician or other remote worker more detailed asset information as well as the ability to transmit work data to the organization’s enterprise system when completed – through a [[wireless network]], [[docking station]] or other synchronization method.

Using computer software to achieve standard mobile EAM practices, organizations often report such advantages as an increase in timely, accurate data flow between their remote workers and central management such as planners and schedulers, which thereby improves capital and labor allocation decision processes (including an ability to schedule more planned/[[preventive maintenance]] work).  
 
With the proliferation of [[smartphone]] and other mobile computing technologies, asset managers can expect an ever more tech-savvy workforce, lower costs in mobile devices and a higher propensity of feature-rich, workflow-specific mobile applications.

== Challenges ==
Nearly all challenges in mobile EAM practices can be traced to two factors: time and labor resources (including IT or [[information technology]] management) and investment costs.

Developing and implementing a mobile application architecture on the enterprise scale is not an easy undertaking by any means, as mobile applications are faced with a diversity of device [[operating systems]], output media (voice and data) and connectivity methods, contrasting with a PC ([[personal computer]]) environment where in most cases software requires relatively few, if major, updates and lower upfront costs. Organizations looking to implement mobile EAM applications often seek the help of [[technology consulting]] firms and spend months researching, planning and selecting an implementation strategy.

== Industries using mobile EAM ==
The use of [[mobile enterprise]] application platforms (MEAPs),&lt;ref name=gartner&gt;http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=172728&lt;/ref&gt; designed around [[service-oriented architecture]] principles for multiple [[systems integration]] and custom modification, and other forms of wireless computing technology for mobile EAM solutions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobileenterprisemag.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=MultiPublishing&amp;mod=PublishingTitles&amp;mid=B4771C6F22F34E4CA3FFFDA61E0EA2C5&amp;tier=4&amp;id=CEFEEBFEA2484118849FC7820858E920&lt;/ref&gt; is growing rapidly, particularly in industries where physical assets form a significant cost proportion of organizations’ total assets. These industries can include:
 
* [[Facilities management]]
* [[Utilities]]
* [[Life sciences]]
* [[Government organizations]]
* [[Manufacturing]]
* [[Oil and gas industry]]
* [[Transportation industry]]

In such high-value asset scenarios, the asset lifecycle improvements introduced by the increase in enterprise data flow of mobile EAM processes can bring significant savings, particularly when part of an enterprise-wide capital and labor management strategy that integrates multiple systems in an [[enterprise architecture]] (EAM system, mobile EAM application, labor dispatch/[[Employee scheduling software|scheduling software]], [[GIS]], etc.).

== Market growth ==
In a 2009 study,&lt;ref name=gartner/&gt; market analyst [[Gartner]], Inc. forecasted, “for the MEAP and packaged mobile application market…we now expect market growth annually of 15 to 20% through 2013.” Gartner attributes this anticipated growth to enterprises’ increasing willingness (and ability) to extend decision-relevant information to employees, who are themselves increasingly mobile.

For EAM practices as a whole, this means that an increasing proportion of organizations in capital-intensive industry sectors (such as those above) are adopting mobile technology as an integral part of their enterprise asset management strategy – corresponding with an enterprise-wide emphasis on whole life planning, life cycle costing, planned and proactive maintenance and other industry [[best practices]].

==2017 presidential election==
{{main|Singaporean presidential election, 2017}}
On May 31, 2017, he announced his intention to run for the Presidency of Singapore, which will be reserved for Malay candidates.
Mr Salleh said "I believe I have done well for myself in business and would like to step up and give back to society in a much larger way." and that he "can also fulfill the call of most Singaporeans who desire a truly independent Elected President, one who is untainted by party politics".

Salleh applied on the premise that although Second Chance Properties' shareholder equity was between $254.3 million and $263.25 million in the past three financial years, which fells short of the $500 million required for automatic qualification as a candidate, it did not prevent the Presidential Elections Committee to qualify him, if it is satisfied that he has the experience and ability to effectively carry out the functions and duties of the office of the President. Nonetheless, on 11 September 2017, the Committee rejected his application, issuing only one Certificate of Eligibility to [[Halimah Yacob]].

== Personal life ==
Salleh is married to Sapiyah Abu Bakar. They have four children, Radiah, Nadia, Sofia and Amal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/family-presidential-hopeful-salleh-marican-gears-election-campaign-112444292.html|title=Family of presidential hopeful Salleh Marican gears up for election campaign|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-SG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed bin Hammam''' ({{lang-ar|محمد بن همّام}}; born 8 May 1949) is a [[Qatari]] who was a football administrator and president of the [[Asian Football Confederation]] from 1 August 2002 to 14 June 2011, and a member of FIFA's 24-man executive committee from 1996 to 2011 for more than 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/exco.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528104818/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/exco.html |date=28 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2011, Bin Hammam was banned for life from all [[FIFA]] and football related activities by an action of the [[FIFA Ethics Committee]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/bin-hammam-handed-lifetime-ban-from-football-2319420.html Bin Hammam Banned, The Independent, 24 July 2011], The Independent 24 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Hammam challenged this sanction in the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the ban was subsequently annulled on 19 July 2012 due to lack of sufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18901316|title=BBC Sport - Mohamed Bin Hammam wins appeal against Fifa ban|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just 5 months later in December 2012, FIFA handed bin Hammam a second life ban from football after "conflicts of interest" were identified in his role as president of the AFC.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20762363|title=BBC Sport - Fifa ban Mohammed Bin Hammam for life after he quits football|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the subject of an [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] published by the British newspaper the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' in June 2014. The newspaper published leaked email documents which showed that bin Hammam had paid members of other nations' Football Associations in the run up to his FIFA presidential election campaign and prior to the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids]] decision that took place in December 2010.

==Early life==
He was born on 8 May 1949 in [[Doha]], Qatar. His father was a businessman, and his mother was a nurse. He has eleven children. He worked in Qatar's football confederation from 1972 to 1996.

==Presidency of AFC==
During his time at the helm, he oversaw the creation of the [[AFC Champions League]] and the acceptance of [[Football Federation Australia|Australia]] into the AFC. He also initiated the strategic development program called Vision Asia extreme golf club. He has been a [[FIFA]] Executive Member since 1996.
He has opposed the participation of the [[Wellington Phoenix FC|Wellington Phoenix]] team in the [[Asian Champions League]]. He was re-elected once again on 5 January 2011.

In March 2011, he called upon [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] nations to play the [[Palestine national football team]] at the [[Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium]]: "I hope that all Arab and Muslim teams will come here to play matches against [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] at their own home ground". A number of regional football squads had rejected the idea of playing there as it could be seen as tantamount to accepting the Israeli right to the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ezzedine|first=Hossam|title=Thailand defeat Palestine on penalties|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gnysB3qf5FSZhOtoRwomK8RFCV6Q?docId=CNG.2776ffab64034117966c14297a983fe4.2c1|publisher=AFP|accessdate=12 March 2011|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being the president of the Asian Football Confederation, he was also the chairman of the Fifa Goal Bureau, whose grants provide financial support for member associations across the world. He was also influential in bringing the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] to his native Qatar.

===2011 FIFA presidential election===
{{Main|61st FIFA Congress}}
In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Mohammed bin Hammam stated he might run against the incumbent president [[Sepp Blatter]] for the [[List of Presidents of FIFA|presidency of FIFA]] which will be decided during the [[61st FIFA Congress]] between 31 May and 1 June 2011. He told the ''Guardian'': "People have to try change. Change is good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/10/mohamed-bin-hammam-fifa-presidency | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matt | last=Scott | title=Mohamed bin Hammam set to run against Sepp Blatter for Fifa presidency | date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Hammam said that Blatter was "an experienced person, he has made significant contribution to football worldwide but I believe there is a time limit for everything. There is now a time for a new face and a new heir."&lt;ref name="hammam-confirms"&gt;{{Cite news |date=5 May 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/18/mohamed-bin-hammam-fifa-president|title=Mohamed bin Hammam confirms intention to run for Fifa presidency|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Hammam had supported Blatter's 1998 and 2002 presidential campaigns but admitted that he had fallen out with Blatter over issues within the [[FIFA Executive Committee]]. In August 2010 Bin Hamman had vowed not to run against Blatter saying that "I will be backing him to remain in office for a new mandate. He is my very good friend".&lt;ref name="said-done"&gt;{{Cite news |date=13 March 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/13/fifa-sepp-blatter|title=Said &amp; Done|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 10 May 2011 meeting of the [[Caribbean Football Union|CFU]], [[Chuck Blazer]] a [[FIFA]] Executive Committee member and General Secretary of [[CONCACAF]] initiated an investigation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahamasb2b.com/news/2011/05/bahamian-blows-whistle-on-fifa-corruption-9044.html Bahamian officials alert CONCACAF to bribery allegations], Bahamas B2bB, 31 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; into allegations of attempted bribery despite not being in attendance. As a result of the investigations preliminary findings, Bin Hammam was charged with offering bribes for votes and appeared before FIFA's ethics committee on 29 May. Bin Hammam withdrew from the presidential race the day before the ethics committee meeting, leaving Blatter to run unopposed.&lt;ref name="hammam-withdraws"&gt;{{Cite news |date=29 May 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/29/mohamed-bin-hammam-withdraws-fifa-race|title=Mohamed bin Hammam withdraws from FIFA presidential race|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2011, FIFA's ethics committee suspended Bin Hammam and [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] temporarily from all football-related activity pending the outcome of a full inquiry into accusations that they offered financial incentives to members of the [[Caribbean Football Union]].&lt;ref name=ESPN_1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/924368/sepp-blatter-escapes-as-jack-warner,-mohammed-bin-hammam-suspended|title=Blatter escapes, Bin Hammam banned|date=29 May 2011|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Hammam said that he would appeal against the committee's decision to provisionally ban him from football related activity, saying that "The way these proceedings have been conducted is not compliant with any principles of justice."&lt;ref name="hammam-appeal"&gt;{{Cite news |date=30 May 2011|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13590264.stm|title=Bin Hammam to appeal against Fifa suspension|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also issued a statement calling for his reinstatement as well as responding to the claims in detail.

While the appeals process is ongoing, Zhang Jilong is acting President of the Asian Football Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/news/8545764/Asian-Football-Association-vice-president-Zhang-Jilong-takes-the-reins-from-suspended-Mohamed-bin-Hammam.html Asian Football Association vice-president Zhang Jilong takes the reins from suspended Mohamed bin Hammam, Daily Telegraph, 30 May 2011], Daily Telegraph, 30 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2011, Bin Hammam was banned for life from all football activities by a five-member panel of the [[FIFA]] Ethics committee chaired by [[Petrus Damaseb]]. The committee found that his actions violated the organization' ethics rules after studying the reports of investigators and hearing the testimony of witnesses from the May 2011 meeting who were not available for cross examination by Bin Hammam's legal representatives.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/bodies/news/newsid=1479068/index.html|title=Ethics Committee bans football officials|date=23 July 2011|work=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://streamstudio.world-television.com/CCUIv3/streamSelect.aspx?ticket=645-676-10049&amp;target=en-default-&amp;status=ondemand&amp;browser=ns-0-0-0-10-0 Video of Damaseb/Ethics Committee statement on Bin Hamman--FIFA], FIFA Video of bin Hammam Press Conference, 24 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Hammam appealed against his ban, and was eventually rejected by the FIFA Appeal Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/bodies/news/newsid=1511253/index.html|title=Appeal Committee confirms Ethics Committee decision on Bin Hammam|date=15 September 2011|work=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Hammam took his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport which heard the appeal on 18–19 April 2012. His lifetime ban was annulled by the court on 19 July 2012.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://sports.ndtv.com/football/news/item/193825-bin-hammam-wins-appeal-in-fifa-bribery-case| title= Bin Hammam wins appeal in FIFA bribery case

In December 2012, FIFA handed bin Hammam a second life ban from football after "conflicts of interest" were identified in his role as president of the AFC.

'''Offshore custom software development''', also known as '''offshore custom software engineering''', is the type of activity (profession), and the process aimed at the establishment and maintenance of the software, using technologies and practices of [[information technology]], [[project management]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]] and other areas of expertise. Like other traditional engineering, software development deals with the problems of cost and reliability.
It is also a practice of hiring an external organization to perform some business functions in a country other than a customer’s country.

Offshore software development can include following services: product design and architecture, coding and testing; develops [[SaaS]], [[Internet]]/[[Intranet]] solutions, e-commerce, [[Customer relationship management|CRM]], project management and other special web-services (including Web 2.0 solutions).

The leaders in offshore custom software development are [[Russia]], [[India]], [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;http://itonews.eu/ukrainian-export-of-it-outsourcing-services-rises-by-40-percent-annually/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[China]]. Its business case should contain information covering five key aspects: strategic fit, options appraisal, commercial aspects, affordability and achievability.

== Recent trends in the sector ==

Given the rapid growth of this sector, several companies have started to use offshore development in China, India and other countries with a lower cost per developer model. Several new Web 2.0 platforms and sites are now developed offshore while the entrepreneurs and management is located in Western countries such as US, UK and EU. The advantages mostly revolve around better cost-control over the process, which means that there is lower cash-outflow (often the biggest struggle for startups). Furthermore, the time difference when working with India and China for the Western world allows work to be done round the clock adding a competitive advantage. Notable firms that are involved in development include [[Tata Consultancy Services]],  [[Infosys]],  [[Wipro]], and [[Mahindra Satyam|Satyam]].

'''''Pari passu''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that literally means "with an equal step" or "on equal footing". It is sometimes translated as "ranking equally",&lt;ref name="Harriman"&gt;{{cite book | title=Harriman's Financial Dictionary: Over 2,600 Essential Financial Terms | author=Briscoe, Simon | year=2007 | pages=348 | author2=Fuller, Jane | quote=Ranking equally, meaning literally 'with equal step'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; "hand-in-hand", "with equal force", or "moving together", and by extension, "fairly", "without partiality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pari passu|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/pari-passu.html|website=Business Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
:* ''[[Wiktionary:par#Inflection_2|pari]]'' is the [[ablative]] [[Singular number|singular]] [[masculine]] (since it must grammatically agree with ''passu'') of the [[adjective]] ''par'', "equal". If it were [[nominative]], "an equal step" it would be ''par passus''.
:* ''[[Wiktionary:passus#Inflection|passu]]'' is the [[ablative]] of the Latin noun ''passus'', "step".

This term is commonly used in law. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (8th ed., 2004) defines ''pari passu'' as "proportionally; at an equal pace; without preference". 

==Usage==
===In inheritance===
In inheritance, an ''in pari passu'' (''[[per capita]]'') distribution can be distinguished from a ''[[per stirpes]]'' (by family branch) distribution.&lt;ref name="per stirpes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black's Law Dictionary |url=http://thelawdictionary.org/per-stirpes/ |work=2nd Edition|publisher=West Publishing|accessdate=10 December 2012|author=Henry Campbell Black}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, suppose a [[testator]] had two children A and B. A has two children, and B has three. The testator leaves his entire estate to his grandchildren in equal shares ''in pari passu'', each grandchild would inherit one fifth of the estate. If the testator left his entire estate to his grandchildren ''per stirpes'' (by family branch), the children of A would share one half of the estate equally between the two of them, and the children of B would share one half of the estate equally amongst the three of them. 

The problem with a per capita ''in pari passu'' distribution in the example given is as follows. Assume A dies before B. On A's death a distribution could not be made to his or her children: they would have to await the death of B &amp;ndash; on the assumption that B could have additional children, and thereby consequently all grandchildren (of both A and B) would be entitled to less than one fifth each.

===In lending, bankruptcy and default===
This term is also often used in the [[lending]] area and in [[bankruptcy]] proceedings, where [[creditors]] are said to be paid ''pari passu'', or each creditor is paid ''[[pro rata]]'' in accordance with the amount of his claim. Here its meaning is "equally and without preference".
There have been cases where decisions were based on different interpretations of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Devi Sookun  Stop [[Vulture fund|Vulture Fund]] Lawsuits: A Handbook 2010 p34 2010 "The case succeeded because the court departed from the traditional meaning of the term pari passu. This section looks first at the original case of Elliott Associates v Republic of Peru."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd's maritime and commercial law quarterly 1983 "Obviously Lord Scott, in leaving out the preferential creditors, does not use the term pari passu in its multi-layered sense. Instead, his Lordship was referring to pari passu in its orthodox meaning."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], as the result of the [[Greek government-debt crisis]], a retroactive [[Collective action clause]] passed by the Greek government with the support of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and [[IMF]], enabled the debtor (who also controlled the courts) to impose a 70% loss on the creditors, more than 75% of whom had voted in favour of the cut.  In this case, ''pari passu'' means that all private-sector investors are equally treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevis|first1=Matina|last2=Burne|first2=Katy|title=Greek Legal Maneuvers Raise Fears of Euro-Zone Debt Fallout|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/eurocrisis/2012/02/23/greek-legal-maneuvers-raise-fears-of-euro-zone-debt-fallout/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3931">Started in Canada in 1985, '''Responsible Care&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;''' is a global, voluntary initiative developed autonomously by the [[chemical industry]] for the chemical industry. It runs in 67 countries whose combined chemical industries account for nearly 90% of global chemical production.  96 of the 100 largest chemical producers in the world have adopted Responsible Care.

It stands for the chemical industry's desire to improve health, safety, and environmental performance.

The signatory chemical companies agree to commit themselves to improve their performances in the fields of [[environmental protection]], occupational safety and health protection, plant safety, product stewardship and [[logistics]], as well as to continuously improve dialog with their neighbors and the public, independent from legal requirements.

As part of Responsible Care initiative, the [[International Council of Chemical Associations]] introduced the Global Product Strategy in 2006.

Critical analyses of Responsible Care have been done by Andrew King and Michael Lenox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King A. &amp; Lenox M.|title=Industry self-regulation without sanctions: the chemical industry's Responsible Care program|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/bes/papers/selfreg.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031106043307/http://www.stern.nyu.edu/bes/papers/selfreg.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-11-06|accessdate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Givel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Givel|first=Michael|year=2007|title=Motivation of Chemical Industry Social Responsibility Through Responsible Care|journal=Health Policy|volume=81|issue=1|pages=85–92|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2006.05.015|pmid=16797774}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moffet, Bregha and Middelkoop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/sppa/ccms/wp-content/ccms-files/ch6.pdf|title=Responsible Care: A Case Study of a Voluntary Environmental Initiative|accessdate=2010-11-12|author=Moffet|last= |first=John |author2=François Bregha |author3=Mary Jane Middelkoop|date=September 2007|publisher=Carleton University, School of Public Policy and Administration|pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Responsible Care was launched by the [[Chemistry Industry Association of Canada]] (formerly the Canadian Chemical Producers' Association - CCPA) in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianchemistry.ca/ResponsibleCareHome.aspx Chemistry Industry Association of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme evolved, and, in 2006, The Responsible Care Global Charter was launched at the [[UN]]-led International Conference on Chemicals Management in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icca-chem.org/Global/Initiatives/RC_GlobalCharter2006%5b1%5d.pdf?epslanguage=en Responsible Care Global Charter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Founded in 1989 as the private equity investment subsidiary of the international development organization CARE, Small Enterprise Assistance Funds ("SEAF") evolved in 1995 into an independent organization specializing in the sponsorship and management of investment funds targeting growth-oriented, emerging enterprises located in countries underserved by traditional sources of capital.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
SEAF has managed or is managing 36 Funds across more than 30 countries with over USD 1 billion in aggregate committed capital, of which over USD 600 million has been invested through over 400 investments in SMEs, with more than 300 completed exits (through December 31, 2017).  Investors in SEAF-sponsored funds represent a cross section of public and private institutions, including multilateral financial institutions, private foundations, pension funds, insurance companies, family offices, banks and other independent financial institutions.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

SEAF employs over 140 investment professionals worldwide within a network of 20+ regional offices.

== Impact on Development ==

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are often overlooked and therefore referred to as the "missing middle" in the developing world.  Recent data results, analysis and case highlights (reports can be found below in the "Publications" section) demonstrate how SMEs can generate employment opportunities in their local communities, serve as links to regional and international markets for smaller local suppliers, and address market deficiencies and customer needs that would otherwise go unaddressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seaf.com/Economic_Impact_Documents/From%20Poverty%20to%20Prosperity.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229004701/http://seaf.com/Economic_Impact_Documents/From%20Poverty%20to%20Prosperity.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }} SEAF Report on Development Impact&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2008/09_development_gibson.aspx Brookings Report on SMEs&lt;/ref&gt;

== SEAF and CEED ==

In 2006, the SEAF family grew larger with the creation of '''Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED)''', a legacy institution of [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and SEAF, born out of USAID grant funding in SME equity investments made by SEAF throughout the Balkans, and EBRD in Slovenia. CEED centers provide business development training and technical assistance to entrepreneurs in emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceed-global.org/web/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028114724/http://www.ceed-global.org/web/default.aspx |archivedate=2009-10-28 |df= }} CEED Homepage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usaid.gov/locations/europe_eurasia/press/success/2006-03-22.html USAID CEED Article&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8490">'''Stockholm City Centre''' (''Stockholms innerstad'', ''Innerstaden'', ''Inre staden'') is the [[city centre]]{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} of [[Stockholm]] in [[Sweden]]. The entire city of Stockholm is also the centre of the [[Metropolitan Stockholm|Stockholm Metropolitan Area]].

Since 2007, Stockholm City Centre is organized into four ''stadsdelsområden'' (sometimes translated to [[Boroughs of Stockholm|boroughs]]): [[Kungsholmen (borough)|Kungsholmen]], [[Södermalm]], [[Norrmalm]] and [[Östermalm]].&lt;ref name="bydistricts"&gt;City of Stockholm: [http://stockholm.se/-/English/Stockholm-by-districts/ "Stockholm by districts"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218065732/http://stockholm.se/-/English/Stockholm-by-districts/ |date=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2007, Stockholm City Centre was organized into five boroughs: [[Katarina-Sofia borough]], [[Kungsholmen borough]], [[Maria-Gamla stan borough]], [[Norrmalm borough]] and [[Östermalm borough]].

The border between the historical [[Provinces of Sweden|provinces]] of [[Södermanland]] and [[Uppland]] splits Stockholm City Centre in two parts. 179,185 people live on an area of 28.05&amp;nbsp;km² in the northern (Uppland) part, which gives a density of 6,388.06/km².{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The same data for the southern (Södermanland) part is 103,646 people on 7.44&amp;nbsp;km², giving a density of 13,930.91/km².{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} This border is purely historical and has no administrative significance whatsoever.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3178">The '''Teleport''' is a suburban-style 100-acre [[business park]] east of [[New York State Route 440]] and west of the [[Bulls Head, Staten Island|Bulls Head]] neighborhood on [[Staten Island]] in [[New York City]]. It includes five Class A office and specialized buildings totaling 700,000 square feet, as well as additional development-ready sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = The Teleport  | publisher = PANYNJ   | date =    | url = http://www.panynj.gov/real-estate-development/teleport.html   | accessdate = 2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teleport was developed in the mid-1980s by the City of New York and the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (PANYNJ), which manages it under contract to the city, focusing on new technologies and offering high-speed voice, data and video services via satellite and fiber optic connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;McCain, Mark.

Accessed June 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 [[AT&amp;T]], the Teleport's biggest tenant, moved 4,000 employees out of two office buildings on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news      | last =    | first =    | title = A new era for Staten Island's Teleport: City EDC initiative holds promise of jobs and financial growth   | publisher = Staten Island Advance   | date = July 25, 2013   | url = http://www.silive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/07/a_new_era_for_staten_islands_t.html   | accessdate = 2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were sold in 2009 to the Nicotra Group, LLC and renamed Corporate Commons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Advance file photo |url=http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/12/staten_island_hoteliers_develo.html |title=Staten Island hoteliers, developers purchase 2 Teleport buildings |publisher=SILive.com |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a major tenant being the St Paul's School of Nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Advance photo/Jan Somma-Hammel |url=http://www.silive.com/westshore/index.ssf/2009/06/first_tenant_set_for_staten_is.html |title=First tenant set for Staten Island's Corporate Commons |publisher=SILive.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder of the [[Bayrock Group]], a real estate development and investment company known for its business with [[Donald Trump]]. Bayrock and Trump were partners on the troubled [[Trump SoHo]] and the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Fort Lauderdale)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]], which was sold after it defaulted.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Behar|first1=Richard|title=Вся президентская рать.

==Early life and career==
Tevfik Arif was born Tofik Arifov in a [[Turks in Kazakhstan|Turkish family]] in [[Taraz|Dshambul]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name="Black Sea1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaw|first1=Craig|last2=Sentek|first2=Zeynep|title=The Football Leaks Family 1: World leaders, mobsters, smoke and mirrors|url=http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1278&amp;recType=story|work=The Black Sea|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorbello"/&gt; He received an international relations degree from a Moscow university.&lt;ref name="Black Sea1"/&gt; Prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Arif worked for the USSR's Ministry of Commerce and Trade for 17 years. He served as the deputy director of its Department of Hotel Management.&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kates|first1=Brian|last2=Schapiro|first2=Rich|title=Trump pal busted for allegedly running hooker ring on yacht|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/trump-pal-busted-allegedly-running-hooker-ring-yacht-article-1.191136|work=NY Daily News|date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arif resigned from the ministry in 1991 and founded Speciality Chemicals Trading Company, an export-import business trading in rare metals, chrome, and raw materials.&lt;ref name="Black Sea1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FT2"/&gt; He then worked as an "agent on the ground" in Kazakhstan for [[Trans World Group]], a natural resources company run by [[David and Simon Reuben]].&lt;ref name="Black Sea1"/&gt;

Arif moved to Turkey in 1993. He had owned the Turkish jewellery business Alset Dis Ticaret since 1979.&lt;ref name="Black Sea1"/&gt; In 1999, Arif partnered with the [[Rixos Hotels|Rixos]] hotel chain to open the Labada luxury hotel in [[Antalya]], Turkey.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=Delphine|title=Turkish police hold 10 in Atatürk yacht raid|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2448b03a-cd77-11df-9c82-00144feab49a|work=Financial Times|date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the independence of Kazakhstan, Arif and his brother secured ownership of ACCP, a [[chromium]] plant in [[Aktobe]] that had headquarters in the [[British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name="Sorbello"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sorbello|first1=Paolo|title=Football Leaks: The Kazakh Connection|url=http://thediplomat.com/2017/01/football-leaks-the-kazakh-connection/|work=The Diplomat|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers developed ties to the "Kazakh Trio" — [[Alexander Mashkevitch]], [[Patokh Chodiev]], and [[Alijan Ibragimov]]. They later established offshore real estate companies to fund high-end developments in Kazakhstan, [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Sorbello"/&gt;

==Later career==
===Bayrock Group===
In 2001, Arif moved some of his businesses to the United States&lt;ref name="Sorbello"/&gt; and founded the [[Bayrock Group]], a [[real estate development]] company. He began developing property in Brooklyn, first redeveloping Loehmann's Seaport Plaza, a waterfront shopping center in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Sheepshead Bay]].&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt; Arif was originally the sole employee of Bayrock, later hiring [[Felix Sater]] as managing director.&lt;ref name="FT2"/&gt;

After moving the Bayrock Group to [[Trump Tower]], Arif developed a relationship with billionaire businessman [[Donald Trump]]. Trump provided a licensing deal for the [[Trump SoHo]] hotel in a joint venture between the Bayrock Group and the [[Tamir Sapir|Sapir Organisation]].&lt;ref name="Nance"/&gt; In 2007, Bayrock traded future profits from Trump SoHo and other projects in exchange for $50 million in financing from Icelandic company [[FL Group]]. The arrangement led Bayrock's finance director to file racketeering lawsuits, alleging that money was diverted to people outside the company, including Salvatore Lauria, an associate of Sater's.&lt;ref name="FT2"/&gt;

Trump and Bayrock later developed the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Fort Lauderdale)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] in Fort Lauderdale. Arif also worked to introduce Trump to investors from Russia.&lt;ref name="Nance"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nance|first1=Malcolm|title=The Plot to Hack America: How Putin's Cyberspies and WikiLeaks Tried to Steal the 2016 Election|date=2016|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-1-5107-2333-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Bayrock, Arif collaborated with Trump on projects in Turkey, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Arizona, Colorado, New York, and Florida.&lt;ref name="FT2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silverman|first1=Gary|title=US election: Trump's Russian riddle|url=https://www.ft.com/content/549ddfaa-5fa5-11e6-b38c-7b39cbb1138a|work=Financial Times|date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tevfik Arif, Arif Arif and their two brothers own [[Doyen Sports|Doyen Sports Investment]].&lt;ref name="Sorbello"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theblacksea_Doyen_2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1277&amp;recType=story |work=The Black Sea |date=December 21, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |title=Football Leaks: The Dirty Tricks of Doyen Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ElMundo_Doyen Group"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/grafico/deportes/football-leaks/2016/12/17/585445ece2704e6a528b45ac.html |work=El Mundo |date=17 December 2016 |access-date=11 October 2017 |title=The Doyen Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal problems==
In 2010, Arif was arrested in Turkey and charged with running a prostitution ring, accused of human trafficking from Russia and Ukraine. Arif was one of 10 people arrested aboard the $60 million yacht [[MV Savarona|MV ''Savarona'']] in a massive sting operation. The charges were eventually dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Kevin G.|title=A Canadian bankruptcy adds to Trump's legal woes|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article125541629.html|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=McClatchy DC|date=20 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company’s factories are based in [[Turkey]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=ES200315/&gt;&lt;ref name=T210114&gt;{{cite news |last=Burn-Callander |first=Rebecca |date=21 Jan 2014 |title='X Factor for new firms’ founded by Ghost boss |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10585249/X-Factor-for-new-firms-founded-by-Ghost-boss.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location= |access-date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hawes &amp; Curtis ===

In 2001, Low Profile Group acquired Hawes &amp; Curtis for £1.&lt;ref name=FD251114&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fdrecruit.co.uk/blog/general-news/interview-with-an-fd-sam-nesan |title=Interview with an FD; Sam Nesan |last1=Howarth |first1=Jo |last2= |first2= |date=25 November 2014 |website=FD Recruit |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=T210114/&gt; Turnover at Hawes &amp; Curtis rose from £600,000 in 2001 to £30m in 2014, whilst Suleyman retained the Chairmanship of Hawes &amp; Curtis. &lt;ref name=FD251114/&gt;

As of 2014, Hawes &amp; Curtis operates from 30 branches in the UK and one in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. In 2013, [[UAE]] investment group Korath Holding signed a $5m deal to open 26 Hawes &amp; Curtis stores across the [[Persian Gulf|Gulf]] over a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://retail-news.net/2013/08/13/british-shirtmaker-to-open-26-stores-across-gulf/ |title=British shirtmaker to open 26 stores across Gulf |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 August 2013 |website=Retail News|publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ghost ===

In 2008, Suleyman purchased UK fashion label [[Ghost (fashion brand)|Ghost]] after its owner, KCAJ, an [[Iceland]]ic investment fund, cut investment following the collapse of the [[2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis|Icelandic banking market]].&lt;ref name=I311008&gt;{{cite news |last=O’Brien |first=Rachel |date=31 October 2008 |title=Businessman saves fashion label Ghost from collapse |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/businessman-saves-fashion-label-ghost-from-collapse-981380.html |newspaper=The Independent |location= |access-date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition safeguarded 142 jobs across the company.&lt;ref name=I311008/&gt; In 2009 the label announced its first collaboration with design duo Modernist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Modernist unveils new Ghost story |url=http://www.drapersonline.com/news/womenswear/news/modernist-unveils-new-ghost-story/5004247.article|newspaper=Drapers |location= |date=11 July 2009 |access-date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Woolworths Holdings Limited''' ({{jse|WHL}}) is a South Africa-based multinational retail company that owns the South African retail chain Woolworths, and Australian retailers [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]] and [[Country Road]] Group. Woolworths, however, has no association to Australia's [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] supermarket chain.

The first Woolworths store opened in [[The Old Royal Hotel]] in Plein Street, [[Cape Town]] in October 1931. It was founded by [[Max Sonnenberg]] assisted by his son Richard and Fred Kossuth. 

The business was later modelled on [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Yoffie (7 October 1997). [http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/relay.jhtml?name=itemdetail&amp;id=798026 "Higher Education"] Harvard Business Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship was formed after the Second World War, which led to Marks &amp; Spencer making an investment Woolworths in 1947. These shares were later sold, but close ties still remain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page295164?oid=534710&amp;sn=2009+Detail&amp;pid=287226|title=Enabling all Africans to invest in stock markets|date=2017-05-04|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The South African Woolworths business consists of full-line fashion, home and beauty stores, many of which incorporate a premium food retail offering. Stand-alone food stores and "Food Stops" attached to [[Engen Petroleum|Engen]] petrol stations are also located in urban areas. Woolworths operates 217 full line stores and 421 food stand alone stores in South Africa, with 65 stores throughout the rest of Africa. Woolworths sells clothing and accessory items under a number of premium brands, namely Studio W, RE: and Edition, with the Group’s Australian brands [[Country Road]], [[Witchery (company)|Witchery]] and Trenery also represented.

==History==

Founded by Max Sonnenberg and his son Richard, Woolworths South Africa first opened its doors on 30 October 1931 in Plein Street Cape Town, in what had been the stately dining room of the famous Royal Hotel. While Sonnenberg had no affiliation with any of the other Woolworths-named companies anywhere else in the world, his plan was to develop a chain of stores based on the American retailer, F.W. Woolworth Company which operated stores in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom.

A pivotal point in Woolworths' history came after World War II, when the company established its relationship with Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S). Sonnenberg and Sir [[Simon Marks, 1st Baron Marks of Broughton|Simon Marks]], son of the M&amp;S founder, became good friends which led to M&amp;S buying shares in Woolworths in 1947. Later, David Susman, son of Max Sonnenberg's business partner Elie Susman, married Ann Laski, Lord Marks' niece. David Susman became a non-executive director of M&amp;S, a position he held for nearly 30 years. Although M&amp;S ultimately sold its shares of Woolworths, the two companies maintain close ties to this day.

Woolworths merged with [[Truworths]] in 1981 to form the Wooltru Group. Over a twenty-year relationship the company underwent much change and transformation, before it was unbundled from the group in 1997. In 1998, the company bought a controlling interest in Australian clothing retailer [[Country Road]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Simon Susman, David's son, became Chief Executive of Woolworths in 2000.&lt;ref name="news24"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.news24.com/fin24/Companies/Retail/Woolworths-CEO-resigns-20101118|title=Woolworths' CEO resigns|website=m.news24.com|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Susman died on 11 May 2010 at the age of 84. Simon Susman retired from his post as CEO at the end of 2010&lt;ref name="news24"/&gt; replaced by Ian Moir, formerly the CEO of the Group’s Country Road Group subsidiary.

In 2014, Woolworths acquired Australian department store [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]] for $2.15 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/displayAnnouncement.do?display=pdf&amp;idsId=01507869|title=Myer response to David Jones announcement|date=9 April 2014|publisher=ASX-Media-Release, Australia|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/displayAnnouncement.do?display=pdf&amp;idsId=01507792|title=David Jones Board Recommends A$4.00 Cash per Share Proposal|date=9 April 2014|publisher=ASX-Media-Release, Australia|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Country Road]] CEO Iain Nairn succeeding Paul Zahra as chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/iain-nairn-to-head-david-jones-as-paul-zahra-quits/story-e6frg8zx-1227021431207|title=Iain Nairn to head David Jones as Paul Zahra quits|date=12 August 2014|publisher=News Corp Australia|agency=The Australian|last1=Speedy|first1=Blair|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the takeover, Woolworths sold the iconic 1938 Market Street store.

==Controversy==

===Christian magazines===
In October 2010, Woolworths came under fire as they opted to remove Christian magazines from their shelves and discontinue their sale. This was met with a huge outcry from the Christian community, many voicing that they would boycott the chain store.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Woolies-bans-Christian-mags-20101020|title=Woolworths bans Christian mags|work=News24|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woolworths maintained it was strictly a business decision, with CEO Simon Susman attributing their decision to diminishing number of sales.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Woolworths returned the five magazines to its shelves following a public outcry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/business/article718396.ece/Woolworths-repents Woolworths repents – ''Times'' LIVE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soft drink imitation===
In early 2012 the South African Advertising Standards Authority ruled that Woolworths' vintage cold drink range was an imitation of [[Frankie's (soft drink)|Frankie's Soft Drinks]] range.   It was ruled that Woolworths intentionally copied the phrase "Good Old Fashioned Soft Drinks" to promote its own line of beverages thereby infringing on the rights of Frankie's Soft Drinks.  Woolworths agreed to remove the range immediately.&lt;ref name="iol"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/woolworths-to-remove-entire-soft-drinks-range-1.1225944#.T8969NXar_g | title=Woolworths to remove entire soft drinks range | publisher=iol | date=2 February 2012 | accessdate=6 June 2012 | author=Peters, Sherlissa}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the event Woolworths South Africa's CEO Ian Moir publicly stated that "Public opinion is so much against us and, whether we're right or whether we're wrong, customer opinion is against us."&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-02-01-frankies-vs-woolworths-good-old-fashioned-david-and-goliath-battle | title=Frankie's vs. Woolworths: Good old-fashioned David-and-Goliath battle | publisher=Daily Maverick | date=1 February 2012 | accessdate=6 June 2012 | author=Nicolson, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affirmative action===
{{See also|Black Economic Empowerment}}
In September 2012 Woolworths was accused of racism by some groups&lt;ref name=sapromo /&gt; for allegedly discriminating against [[White South African|white]] job applicants and staff. The accusations followed after claims that the retailer's advertising on their career site said its jobs are only open to "African, Coloured and Indian" candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woolworths douses racial fires|url=http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/Woolworths-douses-racial-fires-20120904|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=4 September 2012|author=Fadia Salie|agency=News 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the incident, Woolworths changed the advert text to say "In accordance with Woolworths' Employment Equity approach, preference will be given to candidates from designated groups".&lt;ref name=sapromo&gt;{{cite web|title=Racist Woolworths SA defiant|url=http://www.sapromo.com/features/item/310-racist-woolworths-sa-defiant|publisher=[[SA Promo]]|accessdate=14 January 2013|author=Peter Church|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plagiarism===

In October 2013 rumours of plagiarism surfaced when Euodia Roets, a South African artist, accused Woolworths of using her designs that were kept as samples after contract negotiations failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groundup.org.za/article/copyright-credit-woolworths-and-hummingbird/|title=Copyright, credit, Woolworths and the hummingbird|last=Pedeboy|first=Delphine|date=21 October 2013|website=|publisher=[[Ground Up]]|access-date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her article Euodia Roets shows illustrative images of her design and compares it to a cushion later sold by Woolworths on which a strikingly similar design was used. Woolworths denied these allegations on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woolworths.co.za/store/fragments/corporate/corporate-index.jsp?content=corporate-content&amp;contentId=cmp200788] Cushion Design Allegation&lt;/ref&gt; In her allegations Euodia Roets also claimed "If that text is in fact from Wikipedia, Wiki requires attribution on all commercial use of their text. You'd be correct in assuming Woolies did no such thing.". 
The text used on the design is an exact match of portions of text lifted from Wikipedia's [[Hummingbird]] article, without attribution, in violation of its [[Creative Commons License]].  When pressed on the matter, the official Woolworths South Africa Twitter account opined that "We've checked with our lawyer; Wikipedia does not own the content."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woolworths South Africa Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/WOOLWORTHS_SA/status/392632794993926144|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
