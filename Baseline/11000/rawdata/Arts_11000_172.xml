==Plot summary==
Shadow is an ex-convict who is released from prison when his wife, Laura (McCabe) Moon, and best friend Robbie Burton die in a car accident. He takes a job as a bodyguard for a mysterious [[con man]], Mr. Wednesday. Shadow and Wednesday travel across America visiting Wednesday's acquaintances and Shadow learns that Wednesday is an incarnation of [[Odin]] the All-Father. Wednesday is recruiting American manifestations of the Old Gods, whose powers have waned as their believers have decreased in number, to participate in a battle against the New American Gods – manifestations of modern life and technology, such as the Internet, media, and modern means of transport. Shadow meets a [[leprechaun]] named Mad Sweeney who gives Shadow a magical gold coin after Shadow beats him in a fight. Shadow tosses the coin into his wife's grave, inadvertently bringing her back from the dead as a semi-living [[revenant]].

The New Gods abduct Shadow (utilizing a group of shadowy [[Men in Black]] led by the mysterious Mr. World), but Laura rescues him, killing several Men in Black in the process. Wednesday hides Shadow first with some Egyptian gods who run a funeral parlor in Illinois, and then in the Great Lakes community of Lakeside. They are pursued all the while by the Men in Black, particularly Mr. Town, who blames Shadow for the death of his friends.

The New Gods seek to parley with Wednesday, but murder him at the meeting. This act galvanizes the Old Gods and they rally to face their enemies in battle at [[Rock City (attraction)|Rock City]]. Shadow is bound by his contract with Wednesday to hold his vigil by re-enacting Odin's time hanging from a "[[World Tree]]" while pierced by a spear. He is visited by [[Horus]], who is mad from living too long as a hawk. Shadow dies and visits the land of the dead, where he is judged by Anubis. Shadow learns that he is Wednesday's son, conceived as part of the deity's plans. During this time Mr. Town arrives at the World Tree, ordered by Mr. World to cut a branch from the World Tree.

Horus finds [[Ēostre|Easter]] and convinces her to bring Shadow back to life. Shadow realizes Mr. World is actually [[Loki|Low-key (Loki) Lyesmith]] and that Odin and Loki have been working a "[[Confidence trick|two-man con]]". They orchestrated Shadow's birth, his meeting of Loki in disguise in prison, and Laura's death. Loki had arranged for Odin's murder so that the battle between the New and Old Gods would serve as a sacrifice to Odin, restoring his power, while Loki would feed on the chaos of the battle. 

Laura chooses to hitchhike to Rock City and meets Mr. Town, who does not realise who she is, and they agree to travel together. During their travels Laura learns who Mr. Town is and, once they arrive at their destination, kills him and takes the branch. She then meets with Loki and manages to stab him with the tree branch which turns into a spear.

Shadow arrives at Rock City and confronts Loki, now gravely wounded, and the ghost of Odin, who reveal their plans. Shadow travels to the site of the battle and explains that both sides have nothing to gain and everything to lose, with Odin and Loki as the only true winners. The United States is a bad place for Gods, Shadow tells them, and he recommends they return home. The Gods depart, Loki dies and Odin's ghost fades. Laura asks Shadow to take the coin from her and she finally dies.

In Iceland, Shadow meets another incarnation of Odin, created by the belief of the original settlers of Iceland and much closer to the Odin of mythology than Wednesday. Shadow accuses Odin of Wednesday's actions, whereupon Odin replies that "He was me, yes. But I am not him." Shadow gives Wednesday's glass eye to Odin, which Odin places in a leather bag as a keepsake. Shadow performs a simple sleight-of-hand coin trick, which delights Odin and who asks for a repeat performance. Shadow then performs a small piece of real magic, pulling a golden coin from nowhere before walking away from the god and out into the world.

==Influences==
The novel's dedication reads "For absent friends – [[Kathy Acker]] and [[Roger Zelazny]] and all points in between".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raintaxi.com/dreaming-american-gods-an-interview-with-neil-gaiman/ |title=Dreaming American Gods: an Interview With Neil Gaiman|last=Dornemann |first=Rudi |author2=Kelly Everding|date=Summer 2001|work=Rain Taxi Online Edition|publisher=Rain Taxi, Inc.|accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Terry Pratchett novel ''[[Small Gods]]'' explores a similar origin of deities. While Gaiman says that he did not read Pratchett's work, he thought they shared a world view due to their same geographic origins and, more importantly, daily phone conversations. He had also sought advice from Pratchett on resolving plot elements of ''American Gods''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.slashdot.org/story/03/11/03/1349252/neil-gaiman-responds |title=Neil Gaiman Responds |date=3 November 2003 |work=[[Slashdot]]|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gaiman, ''American Gods'' is not based on [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Eight Days of Luke]]'', "although they bear an odd relationship, like second cousins once removed or something". When working on the structure of a story linking gods and days of the week, he realised that this idea had already been used in ''Eight Days of Luke''. He abandoned the story, but later used the idea when writing ''American Gods'' to depict Wednesday and Shadow meeting on the god's namesake day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaiman |first=Neil |url=http://www.neilgaiman.com/exclusive/agblogarchive/2001_09 |title=Neil Gaiman – September 2001 |publisher=Neil Gaiman's Journal |date=25 September 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061210224109/http://www.neilgaiman.com/exclusive/agblogarchive/2001_09| archivedate= 10 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About [[John James (writer)|John James]]'s novel ''Votan'', Gaiman stated:  “I think probably the best book ever done about the Norse was a book that I couldn’t allow myself to read between coming up with the idea of ''American Gods'' and finishing it. After it was published I actually sat down and allowed myself to read it for the first time in 15 years and discovered it was just as good as I thought it was”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shadow-writer.co.uk/neilinterview.htm |title=Interview with Neil Gaiman |year=2005 |work=Shadow Writer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021063116/http://www.shadow-writer.co.uk/neilinterview.htm |archivedate=21 October 2016|accessdate=18 November 2018|deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Website tie-in ==

While Gaiman was writing ''American Gods'', his publishers set up a promotional web site featuring a [[weblog]] in which Gaiman described the day-to-day process of writing, revising, publishing, and promoting the novel. After the novel was published, the web site evolved into a more general Official Neil Gaiman Web Site. {{As of|2010|post=,}} Gaiman regularly adds to the weblog, describing his daily life and the writing, revising, publishing, or promoting his current project.

On 28 February 2008, Gaiman announced on his journal that for one month, the complete text of ''American Gods'' would be available to the public on his publisher's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaiman |first=Neil |url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/02/kids-free-book.html |title=Kids!

Gaiman's next novel, ''[[Anansi Boys]]'', was conceived before ''American Gods'' and shares a character, Mr. Nancy ([[Anansi]], the spider god of African legend).

In an interview with [[MTV News]] published on 22 June 2011, Gaiman said that he had plans for a direct sequel to ''American Gods''. He had plans for a sequel even while writing the first book. He said he is likely to focus on New Gods in the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neil Gaiman Reflects On 'American Gods,' 10 Years Later |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1666281/neil-gaiman-american-gods.jhtml |work=MTV News |first=Rick |last=Marshall |date=22 June 2011|accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614075056/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1666281/neil-gaiman-american-gods.jhtml  |archivedate=14 June 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the planned sequel, Gaiman has written two short-story sequels featuring Shadow Moon. "The Monarch of the Glen", first published in ''[[Legends II (book)|Legends II]]'', takes place in Scotland, two years after ''American Gods''. The second short story, "Black Dog", was collected in Gaiman's ''[[Neil Gaiman bibliography#Short Story Collections|Trigger Warning]]''. It takes place a year later in [[Derbyshire]]'s Peak District.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

{{quote|text=She draws inspiration from 16th- and 17th-century vanitas art and meticulously creates time shrines reminiscent of still-life paintings of that period, which generally featured a skull and an hourglass. “These are symbols of time, not death, and I build shrines to time. They are static installations in a natural lively environment,” she explains, pointing to the transient nature of human existence and the resilience of the earth."|author=Luisa Zargani&lt;ref name="zargani"/&gt;}}

* Water

'''Antitheatricality''' is any form of opposition or hostility to [[theater]]. Such opposition is as old as theater itself and can be found in all cultures {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, suggesting a deep-seated ambivalence in human nature about the dramatic arts. Jonas Barish's 1981 book, ''{{'}}The Antitheatrical Prejudice{{'}}'', was, according to one of his [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] colleagues, immediately recognized as having given intellectual and historical definition to a phenomenon which up to that point had been only dimly observed and understood. The book earned the American Theater Association's Barnard Hewitt Award for outstanding research in theater history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/07/arts/jonas-barish-76-scholar-of-theater-history.html|title=Jonas Barish, 76, Scholar of Theater History|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=7 April 1998|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barish and some more recent commentators treat the anti-theatrical, not as an enemy to be overcome, but rather as an inevitable and valuable part of the theatrical dynamic.

Antitheatrical views have been based on philosophy, religion, morality, psychology, aesthetics and on simple prejudice. Opinions have focussed variously on the art form, the artistic content, the players, the lifestyle of theater people, and on the influence of theater on the behaviour and morals of individuals and society. Anti-theatrical sentiments have been expressed by government legislation, philosophers, artists, playwrights, religious representatives, communities, classes, and individuals.

The earliest objections to theatrical performance were made by Plato around 380 B.C. and re-emerged in various forms over the following 2,500 years. Plato's philosophical objection was that theatrical performance was inherently distanced from reality and therefore unworthy. Church leaders would  rework this argument in a theological context. A later aesthetic variation, which led to closet drama, valued the play, but only as a book. From Victorian times, critics complained that self-aggrandizing actors and lavish stage settings were getting in the way of the play.

Plato's moral objections were echoed widely in Roman times, leading eventually to theater's decline. During the Middle Ages, theatrical performance gradually re-emerged, the mystery plays accepted as part of church life. From the 16th century onwards, once theater was re-established as an independent profession, concerns were regularly raised that the acting community was inherently corrupt and that acting had a destructive moral influence on both actors and audiences. These views were often expressed during the emergence of Protestant, Puritan and Evangelical movements.

The evaluation of historic anti-theatrical attitudes can itself be influenced by the cultural setting and vantage point from which that evaluation takes place, resulting in quite different opinions. What might be seen as irrational prejudice from one vantage point might be interpreted as a rational judgement from another.

[[File:Portrait of Plato; bust. Wellcome M0005618.jpg|thumb|Plato, theater's first critic]]

==={{Anchor|Plato and ancient Greece}}Athens===

Around 400 B.C. the importance of [[Greek drama]] to [[ancient Greek culture]] was expressed by [[Aristophanes]] in his play, ''[[The Frogs]],'' where the chorus leader says, "There is no function more noble than that of the god-touched Chorus teaching the city in song".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Kinney Williams|title=Empire of Ancient Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMCOqlnV41wC&amp;pg=PA87|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0315-0|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theater and religious festivals were intimately connected.

Around 380 B.C. [[Plato]] became the first to challenge theater in the ancient world. Although his views expressed in [[Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']] were radical, they were aimed primarily at the concept of theater (and other mimetic arts). He did not encourage hostility towards the artists or their performances. For Plato, theater was philosophically undesirable, it was simply a lie. It was bad for society because it engaged the sympathies of the audience and so might make people less thoughtful. Furthermore,the representation of ignoble actions on the stage could lead the actors and the audience to behave badly themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kpey7HX8CXQC&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=antitheatricality&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q=antitheatricality&amp;f=true|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Modernism|last=Lewis|first=Pericles|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521828093|location=|pages=193|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mimesis ===
{{See also|Mimesis}}Philosophically, acting is a special case of [[mimesis]] (''μίμησις''), a Greek term that describes imitation, especially when its object is to represent a greater reality. Plato explains this by using an illustration of an everyday object. First there is a universal truth, for example, the abstract concept of a bed. The carpenter who makes the bed creates an imperfect ''imitation'' of that concept in wood. The artist who paints a picture of the bed is making an imperfect ''imitation'' of the wooden bed. The artist is therefore several stages away from true reality and this is an undesirable state. Theater is likewise several stages from reality and therefore unworthy. The written words of a play can be considered more worthy since they can be understood directly by the mind and without the inevitable distortion caused by intermediaries.

Psychologically, mimesis is considered as formative, shaping the mind and causing the actor to become more like the person or object imitated. Actors should therefore only imitate people very much like themselves and then only when aspiring to virtue and avoiding anything base. Furthermore, they must not imitate women, or slaves, or villains, or madmen, or 'smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, boatswains, or the like'.

=== Aristotle ===
In ''The'' ''Poetics'' (Περὶ ποιητικῆς) c. 335 BC, Aristotle argues against Plato’s objections to ''mimesis'', supporting the concept of ''catharsis'' (cleansing) and affirms the human drive to imitate. Frequently, the term that Aristotle uses for ‘actor’ is ''prattontes'', suggesting ''praxis'' or real action, as opposed to Plato’s use of ''hypocrites'' (ὑποκριτής) which suggests one who 'hides under a mask', is deceptive or expresses make-believe emotions. Aristotle wants to avoid the hypothetical consequence of Plato’s critique, namely the closing of theaters and the banishment of actors. Ultimately Aristotle’s attitude is ambivalent; he concedes that drama should be able to exist without actually being acted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-S43g4iqD0UC&amp;pg=PT9|title=Stage Fright: Modernism, Anti-Theatricality, and Drama|author=Martin Puchner|first=|date=1 April 2003|publisher=JHU Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8018-7776-6|location=|page=9ff.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plutarch ===

The ''[[Moralia]]'' of [[Plutarch]], written in the first century, contain an essay (often given the title, ''Were the Athenians More Famous in War or in Wisdom?'') which reflects many of Plato's critical views but in a less nuanced way. Plutarch wonders what it tells us about the audience in that we take pleasure in watching an actor express strongly negative emotions on stage, whereas in real life, the opposite would be true.&lt;ref name="Barish"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Antitheatrical Prejudice|last1=Barish|first1=Jonas|date=1981|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520052161|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

==Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity==

=== Rome ===
Unlike Greece, theatre in Rome was distanced from religion and was largely led by professional actor-managers.  From early days the acting profession was marginalised and, by the height of the [[Roman Empire]], considered thoroughly disreputable. In the first century A.D., [[Cicero]] declared, "dramatic art and the theatre is generally disgraceful". During this time, permanent theater-building was forbidden and other popular entertainments often took theater's place. Actors, who were mainly foreigners, freedmen and slaves, had become a disenfranchised class.They were forbidden to leave the profession and were required to pass their employment on to their children.

[[Mime]]s included female performers, were heavily sexual in nature and often equated with [[prostitution]]. Attendance at such performances, says Barish, must have seemed to many Romans like visiting the brothels, "equally urgent, equally provocative of guilt, and hence equally in need of being scourged by a savage backlash of official disapproval".&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|38–43}}

=== Christian attitudes ===
Early Christian leaders, concerned to promote high ethical principles amongst the growing Christian community, were naturally opposed to the degenerate nature of contemporary Roman theatre. However, other arguments were also advanced.
[[File:Tertullian's Prescription Against Hereticks.jpg|left|thumb|'''Tertullian, second century Christian teacher and critic of theater''']]
In the second century, [[Taitian|Tatian]] and later [[Tertullian]], put forward [[Ascetical theology#Fathers and Doctors of the Church|ascetic]] principles. In ''[[De spectaculis]]'', Tertullian argued that even moderate pleasure is to be avoided and that theater, with its large crowds and deliberately exciting performances, led to "mindless absorption in the imaginary fortunes of nonexistent characters". Absorbing Plato’s concept of mimesis into a Christian context, he also argued that acting was an ever-increasing system of falsifications. "First the actor falsifies his identity, and so compounds a deadly sin. If he impersonates someone vicious, he further compounds the sin." And if physical modification was required, say a man representing a woman, it was a "lie against our own faces, and an impious attempt to improve the works of the Creator".&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|44–49}}

In the fourth century, the famous preacher [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]] again stressed the ascetic theme. It was not pleasure but the opposite of pleasure that brought salvation. He wrote that "he who converses of theatres and actors does not benefit [his soul], but inflames it more, and renders it more careless... He who converses about hell incurs no dangers, and renders it more sober."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

[[St. Augustine|Augustine of Hippo]], his North African contemporary, had in early life led a hedonistic lifestyle which changed dramatically following his conversion. In his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]],'' echoing Plato, he says about imitating others: "To the end that we may be true to our nature, we should not become false by copying and likening to the nature of another, as do the actors and the reflections in the mirror ... We should instead seek that truth which is not self-contradictory and two-faced."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|57,58}} Augustine also challenged the cult of personality, maintaining that hero worship was a form of idolatry in which adulation of actors replaced the worship of God, leading people to miss their true happiness.

{{Quote|text="For in the theatre, dens of iniquity though they may be, if a man is fond of a particular actor, and enjoys his art as a great or even as the very greatest good, he is fond of all who join with him in admiration of his favorite, not for their own sakes, but for the sake of him whom they admire in common; and the more fervent he is in his admiration, the more he works in every way he can to secure new admirers for him, and the more anxious he becomes to show him to others; and if he find anyone comparatively indifferent, he does all he can to excite his interest by urging his favorite's merits. If, however, he meet with anyone who opposes him, he is exceedingly displeased by such a man's contempt of his favorite, and strives in every way he can to remove it. Now, if this be so, what does it become us to do who live in the fellowship of the love of God, the enjoyment of whom is the true happiness of life...?"|sign=|source=}}

==Theatre and church in the Middle Ages==
[[File:ChesterMysteryPlay 300dpi.jpg|thumb|Engraving depicting an early Chester mystery play]]
Around AD 470, as Rome declined, the Roman Church increased in power and influence, and theater was virtually eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Rob, ''Theatre, A Crash Course'', East Sussex, 2003, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, theatrical performance re-emerged as part of church life, telling Bible stories in a dramatic way; The aims of the church and of theater had now converged and there was very little opposition..

One of the few surviving examples of anti-theatrical attitude is found in ''A Treatise of Miraclis Pleyinge,'' a fourteenth-century sermon by an anonymous preacher. The sermon is generally agreed to be of [[Lollard]] inspiration. It is not clear if the text refers to the performance of [[mystery plays]] on the streets or to [[liturgical drama]] in the church. Possibly the author makes no distinction. Barish traces the basis of the preacher's prejudice to the lifelike immediacy of the theater, which sets it in unwelcome competition to everyday life and to the doctrines held in schools and churches. The preacher declares that since a play's basic objective is to please, its purpose must be suspect because [[Christ]] never laughed. If one laughs or cries at a play it is because of the "pathos of the story". One's expression of emotion is therefore useless in the eyes of God. The playmaking itself is at fault. "It is the concerted, organized, professionalized nature of the enterprise that offends so deeply, the fact that it entails planning and teamwork and elaborate preparation, making it different from the kind of sin that is committed inadvertently, or in a fit of ungovernable passion."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|66–70}}

==16th and 17th century{{Anchor|16th and 17th century}}==
[[File:Thomas Becon.jpg|thumb|Thomas Becon c. 1511–1567, early Protestant critic of the theatricality of the Mass|left]]

=== Theatricality in the church ===
In 1559, [[Thomas Becon]], an English priest, wrote ''The Displaying of the Popish Mass'', an early expression of emerging Protestant theology, while in [[Marian exiles|exile]] during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1pXAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR12|title=The Early Works of Thomas Becon: Being the Treatises Published by Him in the Reign of King Henry VIII|author=Becon|first=Thomas|date=1559|publisher=University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|page=xii|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument was with the Church and the ritualised theatricality of the mass. "By introducing ceremonial costume, ritual gesture, and symbolic decor, and by separating the clergy from the laity, the church has perverted a simple communal event into a portentous masquerade, a magic show designed to hoodwink the ignorant." He believed that in a mass with too much pomp, the laity became passive spectators, entertained  in a production that became a substitute for the message of God.&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|161, 165}}

=== English Renaissance theatre ===
{{See also|English Renaissance theatre}}The first English theatres were not built until the last quarter of the 16th century. This was a time of enormous talent, resulting in far greater interest in theatre. One in eight Londoners regularly watched performances of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Jonson and others, an attendance rate only matched since by cinema around 1925–1939.&lt;ref&gt;Graham (2003) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

As theatre grew, so did anti-theatricality. Critics agree that the objections were to [[performance|live performances]], rather than to dramatic work itself or to its writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael O'Connell|title=The Idolatrous Eye: Iconoclasm and Theater in Early-Modern England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxmuqf7B2REC&amp;pg=PA34|date=13 January 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534402-8|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some objectors made a clear exception for [[closet drama]]s, especially those that were religious or had religious content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marta Straznicky|title=Privacy, Playreading, and Women's Closet Drama, 1550-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1bxX66o_30C&amp;pg=PA16|date=25 November 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84124-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of Plato's reasoning on mimesis re-emerged.  One problem was the representation of rulers and the high-born by those of low birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Thornton Burnett|author2=Adrian Streete|author3=Ramona Wray|title=The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAKrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267|date=31 October 2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3524-5|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social class was regarded as immutable.

[[File:Ben Jonson by George Vertue 1730 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ben Jonson, 1730, playwright and challenger of theatrical conventions]]

Another issue was that of effeminization. The [[boy player]] who performed a female role was singled out because he took on female clothing and gesture. Both [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] used cross-dressing as significant themes within their plays, further provoking anxieties about sexual identity. Laura Levine (1994) explores this issue at great depth in ''Men in Women's Clothing: Anti-theatricality and Effeminization, 1579-1642.'' In 1597 [[Stephen Gosson]] said that theatre 'effeminized' the mind. Four years later [[Philip Stubbs|Philip Stubbes]] claimed that male actors who wore women's clothing could 'adulterate' male gender.   Further tracts followed culminating, fifty years later, with [[William Prynne]] who described a man for whom the wearing of women's clothing had caused him to 'degenerate' into a woman.  Prynne's writing may have hastened theatre closure. Levine suggests these opinions reflect a deep anxiety, a view that male identity must be permanently reinforced by male behaviour and clothing, otherwise it will simply collapse into the feminine.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Levine,&amp;nbsp;''Men in Women's Clothing: Anti-theatricality and Effeminization,''&amp;nbsp;Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Men_in_Women_s_Clothing.html?id=RTU4AAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosson and Stubbs were both playwrights. The renowned playwright, Ben Jonson, can also be considered anti-theatrical and even anti-anti-theatrical, highlighting the deep-seated ambivalence of the times. He was against the use of theatrical costume because it lent itself to unpleasing mannerisms and an artificial triviality.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|151}} Jonson, in his plays, rejected the Elizabethan theatricality that often relied on special effects. His aim was to restore the true nature of theatre after its long bondage to false conventions.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|134–135}} His own [[court masques]], for which he was well known, were expensive, exclusive spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brocket|first1=Oscar G.|title=History of the Theatre: Foundation Edition|date=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Boston, New York, San Francisco|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had his work collected for a [[folio]] printing in 1616, a more lasting medium than the stage.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|138}}

Barish identifies Jonson as belonging to the Christian-Platonic-Stoic tradition "that finds value embodied in what is immutable and unchanging, and tends to dismiss as unreal whatever is past and passing and to come". His plays feature characters who remain silent or static in the face of great obstacles; other characters are foolish in their embracing of a changing world.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|143–5}} Jonson put typical anti-theatrical arguments into the mouth of his [[Puritan]] preacher Zeal-of-the-Land-Busy, in ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]],'' including the Puritan view that men mimicking women was forbidden in the [[Bible]], for in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 22 verse 5, the text states that "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God."

===Puritan opposition===
{{main|Histriomastix}}[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Prynne cropped.jpg|thumb|William Prynne – author of Histriomastix (1633) a culmination of the Puritan attack on English theatre|left]]William Prynne's  encyclopedic ''[[Histriomastix|Histriomastix''':''' The Player's Scourge, or Actor's Tragedy,]]'' represents the culmination of the Puritan attack on English Renaissance theatre&amp;nbsp;and on celebrations such as&amp;nbsp;[[Christmas]], the latter being derived from pagan Roman festivals. Although a particularly acute and comprehensive attack which emphasised spiritual and moral objections, it represented a common anti-theatrical view held by many during this time.

Prynne's outstanding objection to theater was that it encouraged pleasure and recreation over against work, and that its excitement and effeminacy increased sexual desire.&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|83–85, 88}}

Published in 1633, the ''Histriomastix'' scourged many types of theater in broad, repetitious, and fiery ways. The title page reads:

{{Quote|text="Histrio-mastix. The players scourge, or, actors tragædie, divided into two parts. Wherein it is largely evidenced, by divers arguments, by the concurring authorities and resolutions of sundry texts of Scripture, that popular stage-playes are sinfull, heathenish, lewde, ungodly spectacles, and most pernicious corruptions; condemned in all ages, as intolerable mischiefes to churches, to republickes, to the manners, mindes, and soules of men. And that the profession of play-poets, of stage-players; together with the penning, acting, and frequenting of stage-playes, are unlawfull, infamous and misbeseeming Christians.

By 1642, the Puritan view prevailed. As the [[First English Civil War]] got underway, London theaters were closed down.

Initially, the theatres performed many of the plays of the previous era, though often in adapted forms, but soon, new genres of&amp;nbsp;[[Restoration comedy]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Restoration spectacular]]&amp;nbsp;evolved. A Royal Warrant from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who loved the theatre, brought English women onto the stage for the first time, putting an end to the practice of the 'boy player' and creating an opportunity for actresses to take on 'breeches' roles. This, says historian Antonia Fraser, meant that Nell Gwynn, Peg Hughes and others could show off their pretty legs in shows more titillating than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Women's Lot in Seventeenth-Century England,'' vol. 2, London,1984, p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[George Norman Clark|George Clark]]&amp;nbsp;(1956) said the best-known fact about Restoration drama was that it was immoral. The dramatists mocked at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper. "The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it."&lt;ref&gt;Clark,&amp;nbsp;George &amp;nbsp;(1956) ''The Later Stuarts, 1660-1714'', Clarendon Press, Oxford. 2nd ed. p 369&lt;/ref&gt; Antonia Fraser (1984) took a more relaxed approach, describing the Restoration as a liberal or permissive era.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Women's Lot in Seventeenth-Century England,'' vol. 1, 1984, pp. 365-6&lt;/ref&gt; Her perspective possibly reflected the different vantage point of 1980s society compared to that of the 1950s.

The satirist, Tom Brown (1719) wrote, 'tis as hard a matter for a pretty Woman to keep herself honest in a Theatre as 'tis for an Apothecary to keep his treacle from the Flies in Hot Weather, for every Libertine in the Audience will be buzzing about her Honey-Pot...'&lt;ref&gt;''Brown, Thomas, 'Letters from the Dead to the Living''', 1719, cited in Fraser, 1984, vol 2, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The Restoration ushered in the first appearance of the casting couch in English social history. Most actresses were poorly paid and needed to supplement their income in other ways. Of the eighty women who appeared on the Restoration stage, twelve enjoyed an ongoing reputation as courtesans, being maintained by rich admirers of rank (including the King); at least another twelve left the stage to become 'kept women' or prostitutes. It was generally assumed that thirty of the women who had brief stage careers came from the brothels and had later returned to them. About a quarter of the actresses were considered to live respectable lives, most being married to fellow actors.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J.H. ''All the King's Ladies, Actresses of the Restoration'', Chicago, 1958, pp. 109-192, quoted in Fraser, 1984 vol 2, p.197&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser reports that 'by the 1670s a respectable woman could not give her profession as "Actoress" and expect to keep either her reputation or her person intact...&amp;nbsp; The word actress had secured in England that raffish connotation which would linger round it, for better or for worse, in fiction as well as in fact, for the next 250 years.'&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Women's Lot in Seventeenth-Century England,'' Vol. 2, 1984, p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century Europe==

Jansenism was the moral adversary to the theater in [[France]], and in that respect similar to Puritanism in England. However, Barish argues, "the debate in France proceeds on an altogether more analytical, more intellectually responsible plane. The antagonists attend more carefully to the business of argument and the rules of logic; they indulge less in digression and anecdote."&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|193}}

===Jansenism===

[[Jansenism|Jansenists]], rather like the Calvinists, denied the freedom of human will stating that "man can do nothing—could not so much as obey the ten commandments—without an express interposition of grace, and when grace came, its force was irresistible". Pleasure was forbidden because it became addictive.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|200–201}} According to [[Pierre Nicole]], a distinguished Jansenist, the moral objection was, not so much about the makers of theater, or about the vice-den of the theater-space itself, or about the disorder it is presumed to cause, but rather about the intrinsically corrupting content. When an actor expresses base actions such as lust, hate, greed, vengeance, and despair, he must draw upon something immoral and unworthy in his own soul. Even positive emotions must be recognised as mere lies performed by [[hypocrites]]. The concern was a psychological one for, by experiencing these things, the actor stirs up heightened, temporal emotions, both in himself and in the audience, emotions that need to be denied. Therefore, both the actor and audience should feel ashamed for their collective participation.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|194, 196}}

By imitating others, including the good, all things are reduced to ideas and caricatures of themselves. Even with the intent of betterment, imitation leads directly to confusion.

[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|Jean-Jacques Rousseau|left]]

===Rousseau===

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], the Genevan philosopher, held the primary belief that all men were created good and that it was society that attempted to corrupt. Luxurious things were primarily to blame for these moral corruptions and, as stated in his ''Discourse on the Arts'', ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality'' and ''Letter to d'Alembert'', the theater was central to this downfall. Rousseau argued for a nobler, simpler life free of the "perpetual charade of illusion, created by self-interest and self-love".The use of women in theater was disturbing for Rousseau; he believed women were designed by nature especially for modest roles and not for those of an actress. "The new society is not in fact to be encouraged to evolve its own morality but to revert to an earlier one, to the paradisal time when men were hardy and virtuous, women housebound and obedient, young girls chaste and innocent. In such a reversion, the theater—with all it symbolizes of the hatefulness of society, its hypocrisies, its rancid politeness, its heartless masqueradings—has no place at all."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|257–258, 282, 294}}

By the end of the 17th century, the moral pendulum had swung back. Contributory factors  included the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked playwrights like [[William Congreve|Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh]] in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, accusing them of profanity, blasphemy, indecency, and undermining public morality through the sympathetic depiction of vice, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place.

Censorship of stage plays had been exercised by the [[Master of the Revels]] in England from [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]] until the [[London theatre closure 1642|order]] closing theatres in 1642, closure remaining until the Restoration in 1660. In 1737, a pivotal moment in theatrical history, Parliament enacted the [[Licensing Act 1737|Licensing Act]], a law to censor plays on the basis of both politics and morals (sexual impropriety, blasphemy, and foul language). It also limited spoken drama to the two patent theatres. Plays had to be licensed by the Lord Chamberlain.  Parts of these law were enforced unevenly. The act was modified by the [[Theatres Act 1843]], which led later to the building of many new theatres across the country. Censorship was only finally abolished by the [[Theatres Act 1968|Theatres Act]] in 1968. (As the new medium of film developed in the 20th Century, the 1909 [[Cinematograph Act 1909|Cinematograph Act]] was passed. Initially a health and safety measure, its implementation soon included censorship. In time the [[British Board of Film Classification]] became the ''de facto'' [[Film censorship in the United Kingdom|film censor]] for films in the United Kingdom.)

=== Early America ===

In 1778, just two years after declaring the United States as a nation, a law was passed to abolish theater, [[gambling]], [[horse racing]], and [[cockfighting]], all on the grounds of their sinful nature. This forced theatrical practice into the American universities where it is also met with hostility, particularly from [[Timothy Dwight IV]] of [[Yale University]] and [[John Witherspoon]] of [[Princeton College]].&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|296}} The latter, in his work, ''Serious Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Stage'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/aseriousinquiry00millgoog|title=Serious Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the stage|last=Witherspoon|first=John|date=1812|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined similar arguments to his predecessors, but added a further moral argument that as theater was truthful to life, it was therefore an improper method of instruction. "Now are not the great majority of characters in real life bad? Must not the greatest part of those represented on the stage be bad? And therefore, must not the strong impression which they make upon the spectators be hurtful in the same proportion?"&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|297}}

=== William Wilberforce ===
[[File:Wilberforce john rising.jpg|left|thumb|William Wilberforce (1790) politician, anti-slavery leader, and advocate for evangelical Christianity]]

[[William Wilberforce]], a renowned English politician, had been a theatre-goer in his youth but, following an evangelical conversion while a [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]], gradually changed his attitudes, his behaviour and his lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Hague, William. William Wilberforce: The Life of the Great Anti-Slave Trade Campaigner (2008) (Kindle Locations 1354-). HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, he became a prime leader of the movement to stop the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]]. The conspicuous involvement of Evangelicals and Methodists in the highly popular anti-slavery movement served to improve the status of a group otherwise associated with the less popular campaigns against vice and immorality.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Christopher Leslie (2006), ''Moral Capital: Foundations of British Abolitionism'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 386-387&lt;/ref&gt; Wilberforce expressed his views on authentic faith in ''A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of Professed Christians, in the Middle and Higher Classes in this Country, Contrasted with Real Christianity'' (1797).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Prevailing-Christians-Contrasted-Christianity-ebook/dp/B0082VXMU4/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517158431&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=A+Practical+View+of+the+Prevailing+Religious+System+of+Professed+Christians,+in+the+Middle+and+Higher+Classes+in+this+Country,+Contrasted+with+Real+Christianity|title=A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of Professed Christians, in the Middle and Higher Classes in this Country, Contrasted with Real Christianity.|last=Wilberforce|first=William|publisher=Kindle edition|year=1797|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=Section V.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barish summarises Wilberforce's description of contemporary theatre as 'a place haunted by debauchees bent on gratifying their appetites, from which modesty and regularity had retreated, while riots and lewdness were invited to the spot where God's name was profaned, and the only lessons to be learned were those Christians should shun like the pains of hell.'&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|303}} The general tone of Wilberforce's argument is less contentious than Barish's summary would suggest and is only a small part of a wider call towards a true godliness. Wilberforce approaches theatricals tentatively, 'I am well aware that I am now about to tread on very tender ground; but it would be an improper deference to the opinions and manners of the age altogether to avoid it. There has been much argument concerning the lawfulness of theatrical amusements'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|202}} Wilberforce also urged potential playgoers to consider the destructive impact of theatre on the moral and spiritual welfare of vulnerable actors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|209}} Biographer and politician, [[William Hague]], says of Wilberforce,&lt;ref&gt;Hague, Ch. 19 (Kindle Locations 9286-9291)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=His ambitious and energetic promotion of his views may well have contributed to the changed social conventions which dominated the Victorian age after his death, creating a British society very different from the licentious London against which he had revolted in the 1780s. As one of the ‘Fathers of the Victorians’ his views once again seem dated when seen from the vantage point of the more relaxed morality of later times, but in relation to his basic view that the long-term happiness of a society depends on how individuals behave towards each other, how families hold together, and how leaders keep the trust of people, who can say with confidence that he was wrong?|sign=|source=}}

As theatre grew, so also did theatre-based anti-theatricality. Barish comments that from our present vantage point, nineteenth-century attacks on theater frequently have the air of a [[psychomachia]], that is, a dramatic expression of the battle of good versus evil.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|328–349}}

{{Quote|text="The artistic conscience, struggling against the grossness of the physical stage, striving to free itself from the despotism of the actors, resembles the spirit warring against the flesh, the soul wrestling with the body, or the virtues launching their assault on the vices.

=== Art versus theatre{{Anchor|Art versus theatre}} ===
[[File:Charles Lamb.jpg|thumb|Charles Lamb, Romantic writer and advocate of closet theatre]]
Various notables including [[Lord Byron]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Konstantin Stanislavsky]], [[Eleonora Duse|the actress Eleonora Duse]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]], regarded the uncontrollable narcissism of [[Edmund Kean]] and those like him with despair. They were appalled by the self-regarding mania that the theatre induced in those whose lot it was to parade, night after night, before crowds of clamorous admirers. Playwrights found themselves driven towards closet drama, just to avoid the corruption of their work by self-aggrandizing actors.

For Romantic writers such as [[Charles Lamb]], totally devoted to [[Shakespeare]], stage performances inevitably sullied the beauty and integrity of the original work which the mind alone could appreciate. The fault of the theater lay in its superficiality. The delicacy of the written word was crushed by histrionic actors and distracting scenic effects.&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|326–9}} In his essay ''On the Tragedies of Shakespeare, Considered with Reference to Their Fitness for Stage Representation'', Lamb states that "all those delicacies which are so delightful in the reading...are sullied and turned from their very nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/27/21.html|title=On the Tragedies of Shakspere Considered with Reference to Their Fitness for Stage Representation|last=Lamb|first=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian philosopher [[Auguste Comte]], although a keen theater-goer, like Plato, banned all theater from his idealist society. Theater was a "concession to our weakness, a symptom of our irrationality, a kind of placebo of the spirit with which the good society will be able to dispense".&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|323}}

The advent of [[Modernism]] would lead to a completely fresh and trenchant anti-theatricalism, beginning with attacks on [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] who could be considered the 'inventor' of [[avant-garde]] theatricalism. Wagner became the object of Modernism's most polemic anti-theatrical attackers. [[Martin Puchner]] states that Wagner, 'almost like a stage diva himself, continues to stand for everything that may be grandiose and compelling, but also dangerous and objectionable, about the theatre and theatricality.' Critics have included [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Michael Fried]]. Puchner argues that 'No longer interested in banishing actors or closing down theaters, modernist anti-theatricalism does not remain external to the theater but instead becomes a productive force responsible for the theater's most glorious achievements'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Eileen Fisher (1982), describes the anti-theatrical as "spats, self criticism from theater practitioners and fine critics. Such 'prejudices' are usually based upon aesthetic dismay at our theaters' rampant commercialism, general triteness, boring star-system, narcissism, and overreliance on Broadway-style spectacle and razzmatazz."&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Eileen|date=1982|title=[Review of The Antitheatrical Prejudice by Jonas Barish]|journal=Modern Drama|volume=25|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church versus theatre ===
'Psychomachia' applies even more to.the battle of Church versus Stage. The Scottish Presbyterian Church's exertions concerning Kean were more overtly focussed on the spiritual battle. The English newspaper,''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', sometimes known as the ''Actor's Bible,'' reported:&lt;ref&gt;Theatrical Recollections, ''The Era'', 23 November 1856&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text="It is well-known that the Kirk of Scotland, strict, if not somewhat stern in its observances, is utterly opposed to all theatrical exhibitions; in fact, amusement of any kind is in direct opposition to the gloomy Calvinistic tenets on which the Presbyterian Kirk is based. Kean's arrival in Edinburgh made a great stir [c.1820]. In Auld Reekie, the more rigid viewed his coming with anything but pleasure. Many really pious and well-meaning teachers of the word were very strenuous in their exertions to prevent their flocks being contaminated by a visit under such strong temptations. A certain clergyman was extremely anxious to prevent any collision between the lambs of the elect and the children of Satan, as he conscientiously believed his followers and the Corps Dramatique to be, and earnestly cautioned the major part of his flock, particularly his own family, not to go near the theatre."|sign=|source=}}In 1860, the report of a sermon, a now occasional but still ferocious attack on the morality of the theatre, was submitted to ''The Era''  by an actor, S. Price: {{Quote|text="Sir, knowing your valuable paper to be the only medium through which the 'poor player' can defend himself and his honest calling against the bigotry, slander, and unchristian misrepresentations of certain reverend mawworms who occasionally attack the Drama and its expounders, I venture to forward you this communication... These aforesaid mawworms, creaming over with a superabundance of piety, and blinded by too much zeal, forget their divine calling, and stem to profit little by the divine behest which bears reference to evil-speaking and slander."|sign=|source=}}
According to Price, who had attended the service, the minister declared that the present class of professionals, with very few exceptions, were dissipated in private and rakish in public, and that they pandered to the depraved and vitiated tastes of playgoers.&amp;nbsp;Furthermore, theatre managers "held out the strongest inducements to women of an abandoned character to visit their theatres, in order to encourage the attendance of those of the opposite sex."&lt;ref&gt;'The Theatre! Is the Stage Condusive to Morality?', ''The Era'', 4 March 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the opposition was even more intense and ubiquitous.The ''Encyclopedie théologique'' (1847) records: "The excommunication pronounced against comedians, actors, actresses tragic or comic, is of the greatest and most respectable antiquity... it forms part of the general discipline of the French Church... This Church allows them neither the sacraments nor burial; it refuses them its suffrages and its prayers, not only as infamous persons and public sinners, but as excommunicated persons... One must deal with the comedians as with public sinners, remove them from participation with holy things while they belong to the theater, admit when they leave it."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|321}}

[[Walter Scott]] drew attention to vantage point when he recalled that a grand-aunt had asked him to get her some books by Restoration playwright [[Aphra Behn]] that she remembered from her youth. She later returned the books, recommending they be burnt and saying, "Is &amp;nbsp;it not a very odd thing that I, an old woman of eighty and upwards, sitting alone, feel myself ashamed to read a book which, sixty years ago, I have heard read aloud for the amusement of large circles, consisting of the first and most creditable society in London."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/STELLA/STARN/prose/WSCOTT/LIFE/chap12.htm|title=Chapter 12 - The Life of Scott|last=Lockhart|first=J.

In [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814), Sir Thomas Bertram gives expression to social anti-theatrical views. Returning from his slave plantations in Antigua, he discovers his adult children preparing an amateur production of [[Elizabeth Inchbald]]'s ''[[Lovers' Vows|Lovers Vows]].''  He argues vehemently, using statements such as "unsafe amusements" and "noisy pleasures" that will "offend his ideas of [[decorum]]" and burns all unbound copies of the play. [[Fanny Price]], the heroine judges that the two leading female roles in ''Lovers Vows'' are "unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty". ''Mansfield Park'', with its strong moralist theme and criticism of corrupted standards, has generated more debate than any other of Austen's works, polarising supporters and critics. It sets up an opposition between a vulnerable young woman with strongly held religious and moral principles against a group of worldly, highly cultivated, well-to-do young people who pursue pleasure without principle.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41409993|title=Jane Austen : a life|last=Tomalin|first=Claire.|publisher=Viking|year=1997|isbn=|edition=Penguin 1998|location=London|pages=226–234|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austen herself was an avid theatregoer  and an admirer of actors like Kean.

Byrne also argues strongly that Austen's novels have considerable dramatic structure, making them particularly adaptable for screen representation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A careful reading of Austen's text shows that while there is considerable debate about the propriety of amateur theatre, even Edmund and Fanny, who both oppose the production, have an appreciation of good theatricals.

In [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]]'s&amp;nbsp;''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]] (1847),'' [[Becky Sharp (character)|Becky Sharp]], exceptionally gifted with mimicry, is looked upon with much suspicion.

=== Building bridges ===

==== Earlier divergence of church and stage ====
An editorial in ''The Era'', quoted a contemporary writer outlining the history of the divergence of Church and Stage following the Middle Ages, and arguing that the conflict was unnecessary: 
{{Quote|text="So long as the drama had been content to be mainly the echo of the pulpit, some bond of sympathy, however slight, continued to exist between priests and players. But as soon as the theatre claimed to have a voice of its own, to have its own aims and objects, its own field of enterprise, its own mode of action, that bond was broken. The functions of the church were found to be different from those of the theatre; and because their functions were different the fatal fallacy, which has been, and still is, the cause of so much misunderstanding, sprang at once into existence, that therefore their interests must be opposed."|sign=|source='Clerical Showmen', The Era, 13 November 1886}}In the second half of the 19th century, Evangelical Christians established many societies for the relief of poverty. Some were created to help working women, particularly those whose occupation placed them in 'exceptional moral danger'. Evangelical groups tended towards 'charity' for the oppressed. 'Christian Socialists', distinctively different, (as in the ''Church and Stage Guild'') were more likely to direct their energies towards what they considered to be the root causes of poverty.

==== 1873 The Theatrical Mission ====
The Theatrical Mission was formed by two Evangelicals in 1873 to support vulnerable girls employed in travelling companies, the first being a group in a company that went on tour after performing their pantomime at the Crystal Palace.&amp;nbsp; By 1884, the Mission was sending out some 1,000 supportive letters a month.&amp;nbsp; They then opened a club, '[[William Macready|Macready]] House', in [[Henrietta Street, Covent Garden|Henrietta Street]], close to the London theatres, that provided cheap lunches and teas, and later, accommodation.&amp;nbsp;They looked after children employed on the stage and, for any girl who was pregnant, encouraged her to seek help from the Theatre Ladies Guild which would arrange for the confinement and find other work for her after the baby was born.&lt;ref&gt;Heasman, Kathleen ''Evangelicals in Action'' London 1962 p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The Mission attracted royal patronage. Towards the end of the century, an undercover journalist from ''The Era'' investigated Macready House, reporting it as 'patronising to the profession' and sub-standard.&lt;ref&gt;Opinions are expressed in ''The Era,''&amp;nbsp;10 February 1900, and on other dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1879, ''The Era'', responding to a resurgence of interest in religious circles about the Stage, reported a lecture defending the stage at a Nottingham church gathering. The speaker noted increased tolerance amongst church people and approved of the recent formation of the ''Church and Stage Guild''. For too long, the clergy had referred to theatre as the 'Devil's House'. The chairman in his summary stated that while there was good in the theatre, he did not think the clergy could support the Stage as presently constituted.&lt;ref&gt;Church and Stage, ''The Era,''&amp;nbsp;23 November 1879 p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Church and Stage Guild'' had been founded earlier that year by the Rev [[Stewart Headlam]] on 30 May.&amp;nbsp;Within a year it had more than 470 members with at least 91 clergy and 172 professional theatre people. Its mission included breaking down "the prejudice against theatres, actors, music hall artists, stage singers, and dancers."&lt;ref&gt;Joey A.

Jackson, writing to Headlam, and after distancing himself from any Puritanism, said, "I do pray earnestly that you may not have to meet before the Judgment Seat those whom your encouragement first led to places where they lost the blush of shame and took the first downward step towards vice and misery."&lt;ref&gt;Headlam, Stewart D, ''Theatres &amp; music halls : a lecture given at the Commonwealth club, Bethnal Green, on Sunday, October 7, 1877''. 2nd edition, London, Women's Printing Society, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Tonight at the Grand opera house Wilson Barrett produced his new play, "The Sign of the Cross." to a large audience. It is a professed attempt to conciliate the prejudices which church members are said to have for the stage and to bring the two nearer together.

I think it is but justice to expect the denouncers of my profession to come the other half of the way to meet me."|sign=|source=}}

[[Ben Greet]], an English actor-manager with a number of companies, formed a touring ''Sign of the Cross'' Company.

=== 1865–1935 A theatre manager's perspective{{Anchor|A theatre manager's perspective|1865 - 1935 A theatre manager's perspective}} ===
{{See also|William Morton (theatre manager)#'Church and Stage'}}
[[William Morton (theatre manager)|William Morton]] was a provincial theatre manager in England whose management experience spanned the 70 years between 1865 and 1935. He often commented on his experiences of theatre and cinema, and also reflected on national trends. He challenged the church when he believed it to be judgmental or hypocritical. He also strove to bring quality entertainment to the masses, though the masses did not always respond to his provision. Over his career, he reported a very gradual acceptance of theatre by the 'respectable classes' and by the church. Morton was a committed Christian though not a party man in religion or politics. A man of principle, he maintained an unusual policy of no-alcohol in all his theatres.

==== 1860s bigotry ====
Morton commented in his memoirs, "At this period there was more bigotry than now. As a rule the religious community looked upon actors and press men as less godly than other people."&lt;ref&gt;'Early Days at Southport', Morton, William (1934).&amp;nbsp;''I Remember. (A Feat of Memory.)''. Market-place. Hull: Goddard. Walker and Brown. Ltd, pp. 40-44. (Morton had previously been a journalist.)&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;"Prejudice against the theatre was widespread amongst the respectable classes whose tastes were catered for by non-theatrical shows."&lt;ref&gt;'London's Entertainments in the Victorian Era', Morton, pp. 84-91&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;''Hull Daily Mail''&amp;nbsp;echoed, "To many of extreme religious views, his profession was anathema". It also reported that many had considered Morton's profession "a wasteful extravagance which lured young people from the narrow path they should tread".&lt;ref name="One Hundred And Fifty' p. 4"&gt;'One Hundred And Fifty',&amp;nbsp;''Hull Daily Mail,''&amp;nbsp;24 January 1938 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1910 The same goal ====
Morton stated in a public lecture held at Salem Chapel that he censured clergy "when they go out their way to preach against play-acting and warn their flock not to see it".&lt;ref&gt;'Mr. Morton on Amusement',&amp;nbsp;''The Era''&amp;nbsp;,5 March 1910 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In another lecture he said that "the Protestant Church took too prejudiced a view against the stage. Considering their greater temptations I do not consider that actors are any worse than the rest of the community. Both the Church and the Stage are moving to the same goal. No drama is successful which makes vice triumphant. Many of the poor do not go to church and chapel, and but for the theatre they might come to fail to see the advantage in being moral".&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;'Secrets Of Success, "The Father Of Hull Theatres"',&amp;nbsp;''Hull Daily Mail,''&amp;nbsp;15 November 1910,&amp;nbsp; p. 7 {Lecture given by William Morton at the Fish Street Memorial Schoolroom}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1921 Actor's Church Union ====
Morton received a circular from a Hull vicar, Rev. R. Chalmers. It described his small parish as full of evil-doing aliens, the crime-plotting homeless and a floating population of the theatrical profession. Said&amp;nbsp;''The Stage'', this "represents a survival of that antagonistic spirit to the stage which the work of the Actors' Church Union has done so much to kill".&lt;ref&gt;'Hull has a Hell—',&amp;nbsp;''The Stage,''&amp;nbsp;17 March 1921 p.14&lt;/ref&gt; (Chalmers was noted for his charitable work so the real issue may have been more about poor communication.)

==== 1938 Greater tolerance ====
Morton lived to see greater tolerance. On his hundredth birthday the ''Hull Daily'' ''Mail'' said Morton was held in great respect, "even by those who would not dream of entering any theatre.  Whatever he brought for his patrons, grand opera, musical comedy, drama, or pantomime, came as a clean, wholesome entertainment."&lt;ref name="One Hundred And Fifty' p. 4"/&gt;

[[File:Proudly UnAustralian.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Proudly UnAustralian'' by Azlan McLennan, confiscated by the Victoria Police in Melbourne, 2006.]]
Conceptually, McLennan's work tends to be unambiguous and antagonistic from a left-wing perspective, loosely following the traditions of [[agitprop]], [[anti-art]] and [[Institutional Critique]], incorporating elements of [[détournement]], [[readymade]] or [[installation art|installation]]. His works have often been characterised as controversial by conservative politicians, journalists and art critics, usually portraying the artist in a negative light.&lt;ref name="The politics"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/13/1084289821310.html "The politics of art"] ''The Age,'' 14 May 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, various liberal lawyers, academics and activists have defended his works, usually on the basis of [[free speech]], due to the offence sometimes caused by his art for its often overt left-leaning bias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visualarts.net.au/files/NQ%20Dec%2008_fin.pdf "25 Years: NAVA at the forefront of Australia’s cultural policy agenda"] ''NAVA Quarterly''. December 2008. Accessed 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The artist has expressed public criticisms over [[Zionism]], the [[War on Terror]], [[Australian nationalism]] and racism, the [[Mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory detention]] of [[asylum seekers]], various political figures and the [[managerial class]] of the [[art world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WhLNCpl6XgEJ:www.visualarts.net.au/files/Art_Censorship.pdf "Dealing With Art Censorship"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''National Association for the Visual Arts'' Media Release, 30 March 2009.

== Controversy ==

=== Victorian College of the Arts ===
In August 2003, McLennan hired a [[G4S|Group 4 Securicor]] guard to keep gallery punters out of an exhibition opening at the VCA. Group 4 run [[immigration detention]] centres in Australia, such as [[Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Baxter Detention Centre]] and the now closed [[Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Woomera Detention Centre]]. The security guard was reportedly humiliated due to the incident which occurred at a time of high criticism of the [[John Howard]] government's treatment of [[Refugee#Asylum seekers|asylum seekers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209182233/http://www.theage.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2003/09/03/1062548903857.html "VCA artwork raises ethics concerns"] ''The Age,'' 4 September 2003. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 24seven ===
In May 2004, McLennan produced ''Fifty-six,'' an exhibition designed to coincide with [[Nakba Day]], the title drawing on the number of years since the establishment of [[Israel]]. The public exhibition in the shop front window space of 24seven Gallery on one of Melbourne CBD's busy streets, was censored by the [[City of Melbourne]] days after it was installed. The installation consisted of a large wall painting of an Israeli flag, with "debatable" statistics on the gallery's window about Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The scandal made international news, many pro-Israel individuals and groups accusing McLennan of [[antisemitism]]. This put a number of Victorian political figures such as former Premier [[Steve Bracks]], Lord Mayor [[John So]] and former City of Melbourne councillor Kimberly Kitching under pressure to respond. The use of taxpayer's money to fund the space fuelled a lot of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.discoverymedia.com.au/artzinePub/story.asp?id=375&amp;section=ExNews "Making Space – spanking the hand that feeds it"] ''Art Right Now,'' 16 June 2007. Accessed 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan also deeply outraged some critics by insinuating that the [[Nazis]] had a similar position on what they termed [[degenerate art]]. McLennan maintains a strong criticism of Israeli policies.&lt;ref name="The politics" /&gt;

=== Citylights ===
In August 2004, McLennan displayed ''State Sponsored'', a collection of portraits of [[Hamas]] militants, including [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] and [[Abdul Aziz Rantisi|Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi]] and the dates they were assassinated. The work was exhibited at Citylights project – a public art space in a Melbourne CBD lane way. McLennan was accused of glorifying terrorism by Ted Lapkin, a senior policy analyst of the [[Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council]]. Andrew Mac, Citylights' curator and director defended the work on the grounds of diversity of opinion stating the artist's use of "state sponsored" referred to [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Jewish-group-blasts-offensive-artwork/2004/12/10/1102625519852.html "Jewish group blasts 'offensive' artwork"] ''The Age,'' 10 December 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform Artists Group ===
In September 2005, the City of Melbourne intervened to terminate McLennan's ''Canberra's 18'' exhibition shortly before it was scheduled to be shown at the [[Platform artists group]]'s [[Artist-run initiative]] (ARI), Platform 2. The exhibition was to include images of the then 18 Islamic organisations proscribed as terrorists by the Australian Government and the basis for their formation. City of Melbourne Deputy Mayor [[Gary Singer]] claimed the proper guidelines were not followed. Human rights campaigner and barrister [[Julian Burnside]] claimed the censorship was about governments testing how much Australians would tolerate such occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/war-on-terrorism-is-claiming-victims-on-the-walls-of-art-galleries/2005/09/15/1126750082623.html "War on terrorism is claiming victims on the walls of art galleries"] ''Sydney Morning Herald,'' 16 September 2005. Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan accused City of Melbourne of political censorship and appeasing Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/09/14/1126377376345.html "City council bans 'terror artwork'"] ''The Age,'' 15 September 2005. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Singer's areas of special interests ironically include [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=190&amp;pa=1317&amp;pg=1996 "Deputy Lord Mayor Gary Singer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725155111/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=190&amp;pa=1317&amp;pg=1996 |date=25 July 2008 }} ''City of Melbourne,'' Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monash University ===
[[Monash University Art and Design Faculty]] in Melbourne withdrew McLennan's video ''Mind the Gap'' in October 2005, ironically made for the same exhibition Monash had agreed to show the censored ''Canberra's 18'' work. The video contained graphic footage of the [[beheading]] of British contractor [[Kenneth Bigley]] by [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Tawhid and Jihad]] in 2004. The video criticised former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] for his role in the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html "Azlan McLennan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520005543/http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html |date=20 May 2008 }} ''un Magazine,'' Volume 7, 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship is likely to have been motivated by the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005]], particularly the controversial return to the crime of [[sedition]] introduced by the Howard government some weeks later and passed into law the following month; a move highly unpopular amongst the arts sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 "Artists 'at risk' under terror laws"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627104653/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 |date=27 June 2006 }} ''NineMSN,'' 8 November 2005. Accessed 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Art ===
City of Melbourne and acting Transport Minister [[Bob Cameron (Victorian politician)|Bob Cameron]] censored ''Pay Your Way'' in January 2006 while McLennan was in residency in Indonesia. The posters – part of the Urbanart ARI program – were displayed in public tram shelters and pulled down only hours later due to complaints. The works featured images of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]], a Brazilian man shot dead by London police and accused Muslim terrorist, [[Joseph T. Thomas|Jack Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/fare-game-shelters-feel-the-brush-of-protest/2006/01/09/1136771500463.html "Fare game! Shelters feel the brush of protest"] ''The Age,'' 10 January 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The works were characterised as racist and [[Islamophobic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,17795788-2862,00.html "My art is not racist"] ''Herald Sun,'' 12 January 2006. Accessed 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; yet McLennan claimed the works were satirising the post [[9-11]] racism and Islamophobia perpetuated by pro-US governments. McLennan is also a [[Muslim]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=266&amp;Itemid=106 "Political art meets a paranoid state"] ''Socialist Alternative,'' Edition 99, February 2006.

Accessed 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; yet weeks later would defend McLennan publicly against the [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]] police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/defiant-artist-flies-his-unaustralian-flag-again/2006/02/28/1141095741391.html "Defiant artist flies his 'UnAustralian' flag again"] ''The Age,'' 1 March 2006. Accessed 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trocadero Art Space ===
Only weeks after the ''Pay Your Way'' affair, McLennan's ''Proudly UnAustralian'' was removed by the [[Victoria Police]] in Melbourne. The exhibition – featuring a burnt Australian flag – took place at Trocadero Art Space who rents a public billboard to exhibiting artists. It was to coincide with the 2006 [[Australia Day]] in January. The work was removed some days prior this date and McLennan arrived back in Australia days later to a media furore. The scandal had been criticised as offensive by those such as Federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] MP [[Bronwyn Bishop]] who attempted to introduce a ban on [[Flag desecration|flag burning]], and the national president of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned and Services League]]. [[Free speech]] advocates such as the [[National Association for the Visual Arts]] and criminal defence lawyer Rob Stary denounced the police's actions as an attack on [[civil rights]]. This took place only a few short months after the [[2005 Cronulla riots]] and fuelled the broader debate about [[racism in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm "Art prompts call for flag-burning law change"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211040610/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm |date=11 February 2006 }} ''The 7.30 Report'' (Transcript), 6 February 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Centre for Contemporary Art ===
McLennan wrote an article in 2006 criticising the Artistic Director of the [[Australian Centre for Contemporary Art]] (ACCA), Juliana Engberg over her reaction to artist and VCA student, Ash Keating and his appropriation of ACCA's waste disposal for the use of his art. The Engberg/Keating scandal became widely known amongst Melbourne art circles from the ACCA exhibition opening where it took place and later through the independent electronic magazine [[Crikey]]. McLennan's polemic further fuelled debate over Engberg's credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/power-of-one/2006/08/31/1156817027357.html "Power of one"] ''The Age,'' 1 September 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anna Schwartz Gallery ===
McLennan featured in ''Rules of Engagement'' at Melbourne ARI West Space in May 2007, which dealt with "relationships, power and exchange within the art system" according to the show's curator Mark Feary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westspace.org.au/projects/rules-of-engagement.html?Itemid=0 "Rules of Engagement"] ''West Space'' (Catalogue Essay), May 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan's contribution, ''Art in a Capitalist Society'' depicted an authoritative picture of leading private Australian gallerist Anna Schwartz, linked to a quote about [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] from the [[Karl Marx]] treatise ''[[Das Kapital]]''. Schwartz has previously criticised McLennan&lt;ref name="The politics" /&gt; and some have accused McLennan of taking revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/artists-dish-it-out-to-the-dealers/2007/06/14/1181414455138.html "Artists dish it out to the dealers"] ''The Age,'' 15 June 2007. Accessed 25 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Melbourne ===
In a July 2009, ''[[Farrago (newspaper)|Farrago]]'' interview, McLennan attacked the [[University of Melbourne]] over the merger with the [[Victorian College of the Arts]], the [[Melbourne Model]], the liquidation of the [[Victorian College of the Arts Student Union|VCA Student Union]] and likened the Vice-chancellor, [[Glyn Davis]]' perceived political censorship to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s use of [[Nazi art|Fascist Art]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s use of [[Socialist Realism]]. He also depicted Davis and the Provost, [[Peter McPhee (academic)|Peter McPhee]], as [[Sex Pistols]] musicians, [[Johnny Rotten]] and [[Sid Vicious]] in a parody of the [[Sex Pistols#Never Mind the Bollocks|Never Mind the Bollocks]] album cover as well as depicting Davis as the violent [[psychopath]], [[Alex DeLarge]] in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film adaptation of [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;"Report on the death of the VCA" ''Farrago,'' Edition 5, July 2009, p. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan had previously attacked Davis and the university administration as the former General Secretary of the VCA Student Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1659&amp;Itemid=106 Smashing jobs, courses and student unions: A 2020 vision?] ''Socialist Alternative,'' Edition 128, May 2008.

==Early life and education==
Akerman was born in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] to [[Holocaust]] survivors from [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; She was the older sister of Sylviane Akerman, her only sibling. Her mother Natalia (Nelly) had survived years at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where her own parents had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Chantal Akerman obituary|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/08/chantal-akerman|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-10|first = Jonathan|last = Romney}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age, Akerman and her mother were exceptionally close, and she encouraged her daughter to pursue a career rather than marry young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.thejc.com/arts/film/chantal-akerman-my-family-and-other-dark-materials| title = Chantal Akerman: My family and other dark materials| website = www.thejc.com| access-date = 2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At age 18, Akerman entered the [[INSAS (film school)|Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle et des Techniques de Diffusion]], a Belgian [[film school]].  Akerman dropped out during her first term to make the [[short film]] ''Saute ma ville''; she funded the film's costs by trading diamond shares on the [[Antwerp]] [[stock exchange]].&lt;ref name=criterion&gt;{{cite web |last1=Margulies |first1=Ivone |title=A Matter of Time: Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1215-a-matter-of-time-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles |website=The Criterion Collection |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Akerman had an extremely close relationship with her mother, captured in some of her films. In 1976 ''[[News From Home]]'', Akerman's mother's letters outlining mundane family activities serve as a soundtrack throughout the film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lebow|first1=Alisa|title=Identity Slips: The Autobiographical Register In The Work Of Chantal Akerman|journal=Film Quarterly|date=2016|volume=1|issue=70|pages=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 ''[[No Home Movie]]'' centers on mother-daughter relationships, largely situated in the kitchen, and is a response to her mother's death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=Jon|title=Every Home A Heartache: Chantal Akerman|journal=C: International Contemporary Art|date=2016|issue=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film explores issues of [[metempsychosis]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; the last shot of the film acting as a memento mori of the mother's apartment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Akerman acknowledged that her mother was at the center of her work and admitted to feeling directionless after her death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The maternal imagery can be found throughout all of Akerman's films, as an homage and an attempt to reconstitute the image and voice of the mother.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In ''Family In Brussels'', Akerman narrates the story, interchanging her own voice with her mother's.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Work==

===Early work and influences===
Akerman claimed that, at the age of 15, after viewing [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Pierrot le fou]]'' (1965), she decided, that same night, to become a filmmaker.  In 1971, Akerman's first short film, ''Saute ma ville'', premiered at the [[International Short Film Festival Oberhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Margulies |first=Ivone |date=1996 |title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's hyperrealist everyday |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |page=2 |isbn=0-8223-1723-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, she moved to [[New York City]], where she remained until 1972.

At [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York, Akerman was impressed with the work of [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Michael Snow]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], and [[Andy Warhol]].

===Critical recognition===
Her first feature film, [[Hotel Monterey (film)|''Hotel Monterey'']] (1972), and subsequent short films, ''La Chambre 1'' and ''La Chambre 2'', reveal the influence of structural filmmaking through these films' usage of long takes. These protracted shots serve to oscillate images between abstraction and figuration. Akerman's films from this period also signify the start of her collaboration with [[cinematographer]] [[Babette Mangolte]]. 

In 1973, Akerman returned to Belgium and, in 1974, she received critical recognition for her feature ''[[Je Tu Il Elle|Je, Tu, Il, Elle]] (I, You, He, She)''. Feminist and queer film scholar [[B. Ruby Rich]] noted that ''Je Tu Il Elle'' can be seen as a "cinematic Rosetta Stone of [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]]".

Akerman's most significant film, ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'', was released in 1975. Often considered one of the greatest examples of [[feminist]] filmmaking, the film makes a hypnotic, real-time study of a middle-aged widow's stifling routine of domestic chores and prostitution. Upon the film's release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called ''Jeanne Dielman'' the "first masterpiece of the feminine in the history of the cinema". Chantal Akerman scholar Ivone Margulies says the picture is a filmic paradigm for uniting feminism and anti-illusionism.&lt;ref name="criterion"/&gt; The film was named the 19th greatest film of the 20th century by [[J. Hoberman]] of the ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman, J. (2001) [4 January 2000]. "100 Best Films of the 20th Century: Village Voice Critics' Poll". The Village Voice (reprint ed.). Reprinted by AMC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===

Akerman has acknowledged that her cinematic approach can be explained, in part, through the writings of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Felix Guattari]].&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marguilles|first1=Ivonne|title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's Hyperrealist Everyday|date=1996|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=9780822317265|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] write about the concept of minor literature as being characterized by the following things:
*1. Minor literature is the literature that a [[minority group|minority]] makes in a major language; the language is effected by a strong co-efficient of [[deterritorialization]].
*2. Every individual matter is immediately plugged into political because minor literature exists in a narrow space.
*3. Everything has a collective value: what the solitary writer says already has collective value.&lt;ref name="What Is A Minor Literature"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deleuze|first1=Gilles|last2=Guattari|first2=Félix|last3=Brinkley|first3=Robert|title=What Is A Minor Literature?|journal=Mississippi Review|date=1983|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] claim that these characteristics describe the revolutionary conditions within the canon of literature.&lt;ref name="What Is A Minor Literature"/&gt; Akerman has referenced [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] on how, in minor literature, the characters assume an immediate, nonhierarchical relation between small individual matters and economic, commercial, juridical, and political ones.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; While the filmmaker has an interest in multiple [[deterritorialization]]s, she also considers the feminist demand for the exercise of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], where a borderline status may be an undesirable position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marguilles|first1=Ivonne|title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's Hyperrealist Everyday|date=1996|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=9780822317265|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===

Akerman has used the setting of a kitchen to explore the intersection between femininity and domesticity.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel|title=The Director's Director: Chantal Akerman|publisher=New York Times|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kitchens in Akerman's work provide intimate spaces for connection and conversation and serve the function of a backdrop to the dramas of daily life.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; The kitchens, alongside other domestic spaces, act as self-confining prisons under patriarchal conditions.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; In Akerman's work, the kitchen acts as a domestic theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=Sultan|first2=Terrie|title=Chantal Akerman: Moving Through Time and Space|date=2008|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers|location=Bluffer Gallery, Art Museum of the University of Houston|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Akerman is often grouped within feminist and queer thinking, the filmmaker has articulated her distance from an essentialist feminism.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; Akerman resists labels relating to her identity like "female", "Jewish" and "lesbian", choosing instead to immerse herself in the identity of being a daughter; Akerman has stated that she sees film as a "generative field of freedom from the boundaries of identity".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The filmmaker has advocated for multiplicity of expression, explaining that "when people say there is a feminist film language, it is like saying there is only one way for women to express themselves".&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; The filmmaker asserted that there are as many cinematic languages as there are individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 

Writer and scholar Ivone Marguiles notes that Akerman's resistance to be categorized is in response to the rigidity of cinema's earlier essentialist realism and "indicates an awareness of the project of a transhistorical and transcultural feminist aesthetics of the cinema".&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt;

Akerman works with the feminist motto of the personal being political, complicating it by an investigation of representational links between private and public.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; In Jeanne Dielman, Akerman's most well-known film, the main protagonist does not supply a transparent, accurate representation of a fixed social reality.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; Throughout the film, the housewife and prostitute Jeanne is revealed to be a construct, with multiple historical, social, and cinematic resonances.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; 

Akerman engages with realist representations, a form which is historically grounded to act as a feminist gesture and simultaneously as an "irritant" to fixed categories of "woman".&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt;

===Later career===
In 1991, Akerman was a member of the jury at the [[41st Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1991/04_jury_1991/04_Jury_1991.html |title=Berlinale: 1991 Juries |work=berlinale.de |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, she joined the full-time faculty of the MFA Program in Media Arts Production at the [[City College of New York]] as a distinguished lecturer and the first Michael &amp; Irene Ross Visiting Professor of Film/Video &amp; Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chantal Akerman feature is tapped for New York Film Festival {{!}} The City College of New York |url=https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/news/chantal-akerman-ny_film-fesrtival |website=www.ccny.cuny.edu |date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Important solo exhibitions of Akerman's work have been held at the Museum for Contemporary Art, Antwerp, Belgium (2012), MIT, Cambridge Massachusetts (2008), the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel (2006); [[Princeton University Art Museum]], Princeton, NJ (2006); and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris (2003). Akerman has participated in [[Documenta]] XI (2002) and the [[Venice Biennale]] (2001). 

In 2011, a film retrospective of Akerman's work was shown at the Austrian Film Museum.&lt;ref name=gallery&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/chantal-akerman/ |title=Chantal Akerman |website=Marian Goodman Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2015 Venice Biennale included an installation of interspersed parallel screens displaying the landscape-in-motion footage that would appear in "No Home Movie". 

In 2018, the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] presented her final video installation ''NOW'' (2015) in the exhibition ''Scenes from the Collection'', and acquired her work for the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/scenes-from-the-collection|title=Scenes from the Collection|website=The Jewish Museum|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinematography==

Akerman's cinematography is characterized by the dryness of language, the lack of metaphorical associations, the composition in a series of discontinuous blocks, the interest in putting a poor, withered syntax and reduced vocabulary at the service of a new intensity.&lt;ref name="What Is A Minor Literature"/&gt; Many directors have cited Akerman's films as an influence on their work.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; [[Kelly Reichardt]], [[Gus Van Sant]], and [[Sofia Coppola]] have noted their exploration of filming in real time as a tribute to Akerman.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

Terrie Sultan, art historian, claims that Akerman's "narrative is marked by an almost Proustian attention to detail and visual grace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=Sultan|first2=Terrie|title=Chantal Akerman: Moving Through Time and Space|date=2008|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers|location=Bluffer Gallery, Art Museum of the University of Houston|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Akerman's visual language resists easy categorization and summarization: the filmmaker creates narrative through filmic syntax instead of plot development.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=David|first2=Catherine|last3=Michael|first3=Tarantino|title=Bordering On Fiction: Chantal Akerman's D'Est|date=1995|publisher=New York: Distribured Art Publishers|location=Minneapolis, Walker Art Center|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akerman was influenced by European art cinema, as well as structuralist film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Structuralist film used formalist experimentation to propose a reciprocal relationship between image and viewer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Akerman cites [[Michael Snow]] as a structuralist inspiration, especially his film Wavelength, which is composed of a single shot of a photograph of a sea on a loft wall, with the camera slowly zooming in.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Akerman was drawn to the perceived dullness of structuralism because it rejected the dominant cinema's concern for plot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; As a teenager in Brussels, Akerman skipped school in order to see movies, including films from the experimental festival in Knokke-le-Zoute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Akerman addresses the voyeurism that is always present within cinematic discourse by often playing a character within her films, thus placing herself on both sides of the camera simultaneously.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The filmmaker used the boredom of structuralism in order to generate a bodily feeling in the viewer, accentuating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Akerman's filming style relies on capturing ordinary life. By encouraging viewers to have patience for a slower pace, her films emphasize the humanity of the everyday.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Kathy Halbreich states that the filmmaker "creates a cinema of waiting, of passages, of resolutions deferred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=David|first2=Catherine|last3=Michael|first3=Tarantino|title=Bordering On Fiction: Chantal Akerman's D'Est|date=1995|publisher=New York: Distribured Art Publishers|location=Minneapolis, Walker Art Center|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of Akerman's films portray the movement of people across distances or their absorption with claustrophobic spaces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Curator Jon Davies states that Akerman's domestic interiors "conceal gendered labour and violence, secrecy and shame, where traumas both large and small unfold with few, if any witnesses".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Death==
Akerman died on 5 October 2015 in Paris; ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that she committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=monde&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cinema/article/2015/10/06/la-cineaste-chantal-akerman-est-morte_4783566_3476.html|author=Isabelle Regnier|title=La cinéaste Chantal Akerman est morte|publisher=''Le Monde''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was 65.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel|last2=Buckley|first2=Clara|title=Chantal Akerman, Pioneering Belgian Filmmaker, Dies at 65|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/arts/chantal-akerman-belgian-filmmaker-dies-65.html?_r=0|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015|publisher=''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=liberation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://next.liberation.fr/culture-next/2015/10/06/mort-de-la-cineaste-chantal-akerman_1398190|author=Julien Gester|title=Mort de la cinéaste Chantal Akerman|publisher=''Libération''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/06/chantal-akerman-pioneering-belgium-film-director-and-theorist-dies-aged-65|author=Catherine Shoard|title=Chantal Akerman, pioneering Belgian film director and theorist, dies aged 65|publisher=''Guardian''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last film was the documentary ''[[No Home Movie]]'', a series of conversations with her mother shortly before her mother's death; of the film, she said, "I think if I knew I was going to do this, I wouldn't have dared to do it."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Citation | last =Rapold | first =Nicolas | title =Chantal Akerman Takes Emotional Path in Film About 'Maman' | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =5 August 2015 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/arts/international/chantal-akerman-takes-emotional-path-in-film-about-maman.html | accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Akerman's sister, she had recently been hospitalized for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], before returning home to Paris ten days prior her death.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;

[[File:Bridge 98, Lancaster Canal - geograph.org.uk - 1773863.jpg|thumb|A bridge on the [[Lancaster Canal]], featuring coping stones linked by large metal "staples" &lt;ref&gt;Brushing °&lt;/ref&gt;.]]

'''Coping''' (from ''cope'', Latin ''capa'') consists of the capping or covering of a [[wall]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Coping|volume=7|page=101|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''splayed''' or '''wedge''' coping slopes in a single direction; a '''saddle''' coping slopes to either side of a central high point.&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Francis D. K. (1995). A Visual Dictionary of Architecture. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. {{ISBN|0-442-02462-2}}, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

A coping may consist of stone (capstone), brick, [[tile]], [[slate]], metal, wood or [[Thatching|thatch]]. In all cases it should be weathered to throw off the water.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Various types of copings exist. A diagramatic explanation of [[Copper in architecture#Flashing|copper copings]] is available.&lt;ref&gt;Flashings and copings: Coping covers; http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/flashings_copings/coping_covers.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flashings and coatings: Counterflashing; http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/flashings_copings/counterflashing.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flashings and copings: Stepped and chimney flashings&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] work copings appeared plain and flat, and projected over the wall with a [[throating]] to form a drip. In later work a steep slope was given to the weathering (mainly on the outer side), and began at the top with an [[astragal]]; in the [[Decorated Period|Decorated]] style there were two or three sets off; and in the later [[Perpendicular Period]] these assumed a wavy section, and the coping [[molding (decorative)|moulding]]s continued round the sides, as well as at top and bottom, [[Miter joint|mitre]]ing at the angles, as in many of the colleges at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

'''''Doctor Dolittle's Puddleby Adventures''''' is a [[Doctor Dolittle]] book written by [[Hugh Lofting]]. The book is a posthumous collection of stories that Lofting originally wrote during the 1920s for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune Syndicate]]'' but here first included in book form.

The book originally contained two introductory pieces followed by eight Doctor Dolittle stories by Hugh Lofting:
*†A short "Foreword" by Josephine Lofting
*"Introduction" by Hugh Lofting's sister-in-law Olga Michael.
*†"The Sea Dog"
*"Dapple"
*"The Dog Ambulance"
*"The Stunned Man"
*"The Crested Screamers"
*"The Green Breasted Martins"
*†"The Story of the Maggot"
*"The Lost Boy"

Those marked † are omitted in recent reprintings for no given reason. The first four stories may be read at the beginning of ''[[Doctor Dolittle's Garden]]''. "The Green Breasted Martins" follows Chapter XII in ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]''. "The Crested Screamers" and "The Lost Boy" are to be placed in that order within Part One, Chapter 12 of ''[[Doctor Dolittle's Caravan]]''. "The Story of the Maggot" is given a greatly reduced summary at the conclusion to early printings of Part Two, Chapter 4 of ''[[Doctor Dolittle's Garden]]''.

[[File:Dresden triptych Catherine and frame 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail of the right panel showing St.&amp;nbsp;Catherine and the inner mouldings of the protective frame]]

The '''''Dresden Triptych''''' (or '''''Virgin and Child with St. Michael and St. Catherine and a Donor''''', or '''''Triptych of the Virgin and Child''''') is a very small hinged-[[triptych]] altarpiece by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Jan van Eyck]]. It consists of five individual panel paintings: a central inner panel, and two double-sided wings. It is signed and dated 1437, and in the permanent collection of the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]], Dresden, with the panels still in their original frames. The only extant triptych attributed to van Eyck, and the only non-portrait signed with his personal motto, ''&lt;small&gt;ALC IXH XAN&lt;/small&gt;'' ("I Do as I Can").&lt;ref group=a&gt;The words "As I Can" are a play on his name. Their spelling varies between examples, usually translated as ''Als ich can''. See Dhanens (1980), 188, 385&lt;/ref&gt; the triptych can be placed at the midpoint of his known works. It echoes a number of the motifs of his earlier works while marking an advancement in his ability in handling depth of space, and establishes iconographic elements of [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian portraiture]] that were to become widespread by the latter half of the 15th&amp;nbsp;century. [[Elisabeth Dhanens]] describes it as "the most charming, delicate and appealing work by Jan van Eyck that has survived".&lt;ref name ="Dhanens246"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 246&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings on the two outer wings become visible when the triptych is closed. They show the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] in an [[Annunciation]] scene painted in [[grisaille]], which because of their near-monochrome colouring give the impression that the figures are sculpted. The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior. In the central inner panel Mary is seated and holds the [[Child Jesus|Christ Child]] on her lap. On the left hand wing [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] presents a kneeling [[Donor portrait|donor]], while on the right St. [[Catherine of Alexandria]] stands reading a prayer book. The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering.  The texts are drawn from a variety of sources, in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the [[Assumption of Mary|assumption]], while the inner wings are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints Michael and Catherine.

The work may have been intended for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because of a lack of surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15th&amp;nbsp;century-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged [[coats of arms]] on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the [[Giustiniani]] of [[Genoa]]&amp;nbsp;– an influential ''[[Albergo (family)|albergo]]'' active from 1362&amp;nbsp;– who established trade links with [[Bruges]] as early as the mid-14th century.

==Provenance and attribution==
The ''Dresden Triptych'' was probably in the possession of the Giustiniani family in the mid- to late-15th century.&lt;ref name ="Dhanens246"/&gt; It is mentioned in a May 10, 1597 record of a purchase by [[Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], and was then sold with the Gonzaga Collection to [[Charles I of England]] in 1627.&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt; After Charles's fall and execution, the painting went to Paris and was owned by [[Eberhard Jabach]], the [[Cologne]]-based banker and art dealer for [[Louis XIV]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. A year after Jabach's death in 1695, it passed to the [[Elector of Saxony]], and next appears in a 1754 inventory of the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden Collection]], attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]],&lt;ref name ="Dhanens246"/&gt; until the German historian [[Aloys Hirt]] in 1830 established it as a van Eyck.&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt; In the mid-19th century the Dresden catalogues first attribute it to [[Hubert van Eyck]] (d.&amp;nbsp;1426) and a few years later to Jan.&lt;ref name ="Dhanens246"/&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck - Lucca Madonna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Jan van Eyck's ''[[Lucca Madonna (van Eyck)|Lucca Madonna]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1436. [[Städelsches Kunstinstitut]], Frankfurt]]
Van Eyck signed, dated and added his motto to the central panel, a fact only discovered when the frame was removed in the course of a mid-20th century restoration,&lt;ref name="Pächt83"/&gt; and confirmed with the 1959 discovery of the signature which is placed along with the words ''&lt;small&gt;IOHANNIS DE EYCK ME FECIT ET C[OM]PLEVIT ANNO D[OMINI MCCCCXXXVII.ALC IXH XAN&lt;/small&gt;'' ("Jan Van Eyck Made And Completed Me In The Year 1437. As I Can"). The word "completed" (''complevit'') may suggest the completion date, but as master painters of the era  typically had workshops to assist on major works, the wording can be seen as aggressively socially ambitious; perhaps an arrogant master painter indicating his workshop assistants had little material involvement in the panels, and that he was primarily responsible for its design and execution. This view is reinforced by the fact that it is the only non-portrait to contain van Eyck's motto, ''&lt;small&gt;ALC IXH XAN&lt;/small&gt;''.&lt;ref name="b60" /&gt; Until the discovery of the signature the piece was variously dated to an early piece from the 1420s to his later period in the late 1430s.&lt;ref name = "Dhanens242"/&gt; Because the panels are so definitely attributed they are often used as a touchstone to date van Eyck's other works; there are a number of evident stylistic developments, including the type of stained glass windows and mouldings around the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], and his ability at handling [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which can be used to determine if other works at least pre-date the triptych.&lt;ref name="h152"&gt;Harbison (1991), 152&lt;/ref&gt;

The central panel has often been compared to his unsigned and undated ''[[Lucca Madonna (van Eyck)|Lucca Madonna]]'' of c.&amp;nbsp;1436. That work echoes the central panel of the Dresden triptych in a number of aspects, including the dark green canopy, the figuration and positioning of Mary, her heavily-folded dress, the orange and brown pigments of the floor, the geometric carpet and the wooden carvings.&lt;ref name="h106" /&gt; The ''Lucca Madonna'' is thought to be a portrait of the artist's much younger wife, [[Portrait of Margaret van Eyck|Margaret]].&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1991), 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The work measures {{convert|33|×|27.5|cm|in}} including the frames.&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt; Given this miniaturist scale, the triptych probably functioned as a portable devotional piece, or ''altare portabile''.&lt;ref name="h61"/&gt; Members of the upper-classes and nobility acquired these through papal dispensation,&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt; to use during travel and typically during pilgrimage. Van Eyck's patron and employer [[Philip the Good]] owned at least one portable triptych
of which fragments survive.&lt;ref name ="Luber30"&gt;Luber (1998), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The three inner panels comprise a typical ''[[Sacred conversation|sacra conversazione]]'', a form established in Italy in the latter half of the 14th century with a [[patron saint]] presenting the donor, usually kneeling, to an enthroned "Deity or Mother of God".&lt;ref name ="Pächt81"&gt;Pächt (1999), 81&lt;/ref&gt; John Ward believes the rich and complex [[iconography]] and symbolic meaning van Eyck employed in his religious panels served to highlight the co-existence the artist saw between the spiritual and material worlds. In his earlier paintings, subtle iconographical features&amp;nbsp;– referred to as disguised symbolism&amp;nbsp;– are typically woven into the work, as "relatively small, in the background, or in the shadow [details]".&lt;ref name="W11"&gt;Ward (1994), 11&lt;/ref&gt; These elements include the apparition of the Virgin before the donor, whose panel contains carvings that seem to be reflective of events of his life.&lt;ref name="W11"/&gt; In his religious panels after 1436, van Eyck's reliance on iconographical or symbolic elements is greatly reduced. Ward speculates the reduced size of the work or the wishes of the commissioner influenced this choice, or he "decided that he had exhausted the most interesting possibilities and&amp;nbsp;.... much of his carefully planned symbolism went unappreciated by patrons or by viewers."&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1994), 13&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacobs, the work reflects a system of symbolism in so far as heavenly and earthly objects are juxtaposed. This is most evident in the disparity between the monochromatic exterior and vivid inner panels.&lt;ref name="Jacobs 2012 80"&gt;Jacobs (2012), 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frames===

The triptych retains its original frames, which are both ornate and served to protect the piece from the effects of light and smoke during travel and when ''in situ''.&lt;ref name="n239"&gt;Nash (2008), 239&lt;/ref&gt;  The inner frames have recessed mouldings and are carved with gilded inscriptions,&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt; and the top corners of the two wing panels each bear a carved set of [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref name = "Dhanens242"/&gt; The lettering and phrases in Latin serve a dual purpose. They are decorative, similar to margins in medieval manuscripts, and set the context for the imagery; van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.&lt;ref name="s146"&gt;Smith (2004), 146&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about Early Netherlandish triptychs, Jacobs says the inscriptions serve to distinguish and separate between the worldly and spiritual spheres, with the panels showing earthly images while the inscriptions on the frames act as reminder of heavenly influence. The letterings reinforce the duality between the earthly and heavenly, with St. Catherine's a reminder of ascetic piety while the figure herself is depicted in sumptuous garments and jewels.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2012), 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscriptions on the central panel are fragments from the [[Book of Wisdom]] (7:26 and 7:29), and [[Ecclesiastes]] (24: 23–24).&lt;ref name ="Dhanens385"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;The lettering on that panel reads: &lt;small&gt;''HEC EST SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM DISPOSTITIONEM STELLARUM LUCI COMPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR. CANDOR EST ENIM LUCIS AETERNAE ET SPECULUM SINE MACULA DEI MAIESTATIS ECT. EGO QUASI VITIS FRUCTIVICAVI SUAVITATEM ODORIS ET FLORES MEI FRUCTIS HONORIS ET HONESTATIS. ECO MATER PULCHARAE DILECTIONIS ET TIMORIS ET MAGNITUDINES ET SANCTAE SPEI''&lt;/small&gt; ("She is more beautiful than the sun and above the whole order of the stars. Being compared with the light of day, she is found to excel. For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the flawless mirror of God's majesty. As a vine I have brought forth a pleasant fragrance, and my flowers are the fruit of honour and probity. I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of greatness, and of holy hope"). see Dhanens (1980), 385; Heath (2008), 110&lt;/ref&gt; Those on the wing panels are taken from texts referring directly to the two saints.&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt;

===Inner panels===

====Virgin and Child====
In the central panel the Virgin and Child are enthroned in a church [[nave]] within a columned [[basilica]] running on either side.&lt;ref name="h106"&gt;Heath (2008), 106&lt;/ref&gt; The columns are painted using a variety of dark red, orange and grey pigments, a colour scheme which Peter Heath describes as lending to a "sense of airy silence".&lt;ref name="h107"&gt;Heath (2008), 107&lt;/ref&gt; The throne is positioned on a [[dais]], before a lavishly detailed [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental carpet]] lying on a similarly geometrically designed tiled floor.&lt;ref name="h106" /&gt; The arms of the canopied throne and the arches to either side contain carved or sculptured figures, including tiny representations of [[Isaac]], and [[David and Goliath]],&lt;ref&gt;Dhanens (1980), 248&lt;/ref&gt; although art historian Antje Maria Neuner reads this carving as showing [[Jephthah]] sacrificing his daughter.&lt;ref name="h107" /&gt; Mary wears a richly embroidered and as is typical for van Eyck, voluminous red robe, which effectively serves as a [[Baldachin|cloth of honour]].&lt;ref&gt;Purtle, Carol J. Review of "The Marian Paintings of Jan van Eyck", by Goodgal, Dana. ''Renaissance Quarterly'', Volume 36, No. 4, Winter, 1983. 590–594&lt;/ref&gt; The robe is placed over a blue square-cut underdress edged with a jewelled border.&lt;ref name= "Weale29"/&gt; In van Eyck's Marian paintings, he almost always clothes her in red writes Pächt, which makes her seem to dominate the space.&lt;ref name ="Pächt84"/&gt; The Christ Child is naked and holds towards the donor a [[banderole]]&lt;ref name="h106" /&gt; adorned with a phrase from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (11:29), ''&lt;small&gt;DISCITE A ME, QUIA MITIS SUM ET HUMILIS CORDE&lt;/small&gt;'' ("Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart").&lt;ref name="b60" /&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck - Triptych of Mary and Child, St. Michael, and the Catherine - Google Art Project Crop.jpg|thumb|310px|Detail showing the Virgin and Child sitting on the canopied throne with multi-coloured marble columns to the left]]
Mary's presence in the church is symbolic; she and the child occupy the area where the altar would normally be situated.&lt;ref name="b56"&gt;Borchert (2008), 56&lt;/ref&gt; Like van Eyck's two other late Madonna portraits (''[[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele]]'' of 1436 and ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'' of c.&amp;nbsp;1438–40), Mary is unrealistically large and out of proportion to her surroundings. This reflects the influence of 12th- and 13th-century Italian artists such as [[Cimabue]] and [[Giotto]], who in turn drew on the tradition of monumental depictions of Mary from [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] icons. According to [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]], Mary is presented as if about to "rise from her throne and advance into the same plane as St. Michael and St. Catherine, she would tower above them and also above the columns of the church."&lt;ref name="C23" /&gt; This idea is in keeping with van Eyck's tendency in such portraits to present Mary as if she was an apparition materialising before the donor in response to his prayer and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 283&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck's Mary is here monumental, but less overwhelmingly large than in 13th century works. She is disproportionate to the architecture in her panel, but approximately proportional to the figures in the wings. This restraint evidences the beginning of van Eyck's mature phase, most evidently seen in the composition's "greater spatial depth".&lt;ref name ="Pächt82"&gt;Pächt (1999), 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Christ's pose closely follows that of the ''Paele Madonna''; his body still leans towards the donor but here his head faces the viewer more directly.&lt;ref name ="Pächt84"&gt;Pächt (1999), 84&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saints and donor wings====
[[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]] and the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] occupy the right and left hand panels respectively. They appear to stand in either the aisles&lt;ref name="C23"&gt;Campbell (2004), 23&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Ambulatory|ambulatories]],&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt; and a few bays to the fore compared to the central panel.&lt;ref name="h106" /&gt; Their depictions are in keeping with the artist's evolving style: the aisles convey spaciousness, especially by the implied spaces out of view, while both saints subtly lean close to Mary. The use of perspective makes the saints appear small; according to Pächt they are "less solid than the massive figures in the ''Paele Madonna''. It was this Gothic daintiness that led many scholars&amp;nbsp;... to place this among Jan van Eyck's early work".&lt;ref name ="Pächt83"&gt;Pächt (1999), 83&lt;/ref&gt; The two side panels are filled with light streaming through the windows that reflects off the saints' accoutrements, glinting from St. Michael's armour and St. Catherine's bejewelled steel sword.&lt;ref name="h107"/&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Dresden Catherine.jpg|thumb|200px|Detail showing a crowned [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]]. She can be identified through the various [[hagiography|hagiographical]] objects around her.]]
On the right panel St. Catherine is presented as almost the essence of a gothic princess. She stands reading a book in "ravishing modesty",&lt;ref name ="Dhanens246"/&gt; with unbound blonde hair, which is topped with an elaborate jewelled crown very similar to that in the ''[[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]]'', combined with her rich blue gown and [[tabard]] of white draped [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] showing her as the princess she was. A golden chain with a jewelled pendant hangs from her neck. The attributes associated with her are included in her depiction. In her right hand, she holds the sword used for her beheading and at her feet lies the [[breaking wheel]] on which she was tortured.&lt;ref name = "D250"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 250&lt;/ref&gt; Like the woman in van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' she is "fashionably pear-shaped"; Heath describes her attire as "more dazzling than the Virgin's", mirroring St. Michael's splendid armour on the opposite panel.&lt;ref name="h112"&gt;Heath (2008), 112&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Catherine's presence can be attributed to a number of factors. At that period her reputation and popularity were second to Mary's; she was both an educated and outspoken woman during her lifetime&amp;nbsp;– characteristics that perhaps mirrored the donor's. She is absorbed in her book in a contemplative manner, which might be reflective of a donor with a similar temperament.&lt;ref name="h110" /&gt; The frame of her wing is inscribed with the words &lt;small&gt;''VIRGO PRUDENS ANELAVIT, GRANUM SIBI RESERVAVIT, VENTILANDO PALEAM. DISIPLINUS EST IMBUTA PUELLA COELESTIBUS, NUDA NUDUM EST SECUTA CHRISTUM PASSIBUS, DUM MUNDANIS EST EXUTA ECT''&lt;/small&gt; ("The prudent virgin has longed for the starry throne where she has made her place ready; leaving the world's threshing floor, she saved the grain for herself by winnowing the chaff. The young girl has been steeped in heavenly learning. Stripped of everything, with sure footsteps she followed Christ until she was delivered from earthly affairs").&lt;ref name="h112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dhanens 1980 368"/&gt;

[[File:Dresden Triptych Detail Archangel Michael with Donor 1.jpeg|thumb|left|240px|Detail of the Archangel Michael presenting the donor. Note the two faux bronze painted frames.]]
A landscape can be seen through the window behind St. Catherine. Because of the miniature scale of the painting it can be seen only at close up. The view is built with extremely fine brushwork and shows a number of highly detailed buildings&lt;ref name="b60"&gt;Borchert (2008), 60&lt;/ref&gt; and hills before snowcapped mountains.&lt;ref name="h112"/&gt;

A lance rests against the shoulder of a youthful-looking St. Michael.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="Dhanens 1980 368"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 368&lt;/ref&gt; Michael is dressed in elaborately jewelled and coloured armour, his left arm holding his helmet,&lt;ref name= "Weale29"&gt;Weale (1903), 29&lt;/ref&gt; while his right hand rests on the shoulder of the donor as he is presented to Mary. The donor kneels in prayer before the Virgin, with his hands held upwards [[Orans|as if in prayer]], although they are not clasped. He wears a gold ring on his right small finger,&lt;ref name="h107" /&gt; and is dressed in a long olive-green [[houppelande]],&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt; at the time the height of fashion and an indicator of status within the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian court]].&lt;ref name="h61"/&gt; The gown has a fur-lined high collar and deep baggy sleeves, also lined with fur.  The donor's bowl-shaped haircut, rounded at the fringe but cut above his ears, is also typical of mid-1430s Netherlandish fashion. Except for the red hood, the garment closely resembles that worn by the groom in the ''Arnolfini Portrait''.&lt;ref name = "D248ff"/&gt;

The [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] of the pillar above the donor's head is lined with carvings of military scenes. Similar carvings are seen near the donor in van Eyck's earlier ''van der Paele'' and ''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'',&lt;ref name = "D248ff"/&gt; and where they depict events or personal circumstances from the donor's life. Those in the present work likely serve a similar role, however because the donor is unidentified it is unknown as to what they may refer.&lt;ref&gt;Teasdale-Smith (1981), 274&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisabeth Dhanens]] speculates that they might depict the [[sarcophagus]] of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] in [[Pisa]], which she believes adds credibility to the belief the donor was of Italian origin; she also notes the military scene reflects St. Michael's status as military commander.&lt;ref name = "D248ff"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 248–249&lt;/ref&gt; Ward compares the carving to a similar one found in the Washington ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]''.&lt;ref name = "Ward209"/&gt; Unlike in van Eyck's earlier votive portraits the donor is positioned at a remove from the Marian apparition, and at a much smaller scale to Mary on a triptych wing.&lt;ref name="h61"&gt;Harbison (1991), 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The lettering running along the edges of the panel's frame consists of a prayer fragment from the liturgy for the [[Michaelmas|feast of St. Michael]]. The extract reads ''&lt;small&gt;HIC EST ARCHANGELUS PRINCEPS MILITAE ANGELORUM CUIUS HONOR PRAESTAT BENEFICIA POPULORUM ET ORATARIO PERDUCIT AD REGNA COELORUM. HIC ANGELUS MICHAEL DEI NUNTIUS DE ANIMABUS JUSTIS. GRATIA DEI ILLE VICTOR IN COELIS RESEDIT. A PACIBUS&lt;/small&gt;'' ("This is Michael the Archangel, leader of the angelic hosts, whose privilege it is to grant favours to the people, and whose prayer leads them to the Kingdom of Heaven. The Archangel Michael is God's messenger for the souls of the just. By the grace of God, that great victor has taken his place in Heaven, on the side of peace'").&lt;ref name="h110"&gt;Heath (2008), 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outer panels===
[[File:Jan van Eyck - Small Triptych (outer panels) - WGA07615.jpg|240px|left|thumb|The closed view shows an ''Annunciation'', with imitation statues of the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] and Mary.]]
When the triptych is closed, the outer wings reveal an [[Annunciation]] scene with the [[Archangel Gabriel]] and Mary painted in [[grisaille]]. The figures form an [[Illusionism (art)|illusionistic]] imitation of sculpture, a conceit which van Eyck extends by  placing them on octagonal pedestals.&lt;ref name="b60" /&gt; The figures are illuminated by light from the left, a device van Eyck often used to imply the presence of God. A dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]], hovers above Mary. Because the dove is also in grisaille but not attached to a pedestal and apparently floating unfixed above the saints, its presence serves to highlight that the viewer is not looking at sculpture but at a painted representation of sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2012), 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The annunciation dominates any other theme on the outer wings of Northern 15th-century [[polyptych]]s. The tradition originates from Byzantine art, with van Eyck largely responsible for re-popularising the practice.&lt;ref name="j64"&gt;Jacobs (2012) 64&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', the ''Dresden Triptych'' is one of the earliest surviving examples of the technique, and on this basis he is usually credited as the innovator of a motif that became almost standard from the mid-15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2012), 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; As the annunciation marks the incarnation of Christ, its representation on the outer wings gives symmetry to the scenes of his life typically detailed on the inner panels.&lt;ref name="h55"&gt;Harbison (1995), 55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hugo van der goes portinari triptych closed.jpg|thumb|320px|Outer wings of [[Hugo van der Goes]]'s ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'', c. 1475. [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], Florence. Van der Goes closely follows the convention established by van Eyck, although he omits the octagonal pedestals typical of actual sculpture.&lt;ref name="h55"/&gt;]]
The outer wings of 15th-century [[diptych]]s and triptychs typically contained Annunciation scenes painted in grisaille. Molly Teasdale Smith believes the practice echoes the tradition of covering religious imagery with grey cloth during the then-46-day [[lent]]en period leading up to Easter. There is a symmetry with this in how polyptychs were typically kept closed except for Sundays or church holidays, when they were opened to reveal the more colourful and expansive inner panels.&lt;ref name="h54-5"&gt;Harbison (1995), 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dhanens, the sculptural depictions on the outer panels are a "brilliant success&amp;nbsp;... in imparting a sense of life to the supposed statues."&lt;ref name = "D251"/&gt; The wings continue van Eyck's innovation in placing two grisaille outer panels wings of polyptychs; the earliest extant example being the Annunciation wings of the ''Ghent Altarpiece''.&lt;ref name = "Ward209"&gt;Ward (1975), 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The depicted church is of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] elements. There are pointed [[Canopy (building)|canopies]] above Mary, and the nave is narrow, barely wide enough to contain her. It is walled by a [[colonnade]] joined by [[entablature]]s and capped with rounded arches.&lt;ref name="h151" /&gt; The columns are variously of pink, red and purple marble. Each of the capitals is decorated with faux carvings, some showing representations of the twelve [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] under a small [[baldachin]]. The [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] is visible in the aisles but not in the central nave.&lt;ref name = "D248ff"/&gt; There are a number of implied spaces not visible to the viewer. The central panel contains two on either side of the pillars, others lead from the balcony above the throne, and there are unseen exits to hallways at the rear of the two wing panels.&lt;ref name="h151"&gt;Harbison (1991), 151&lt;/ref&gt; The east facing windows in the right hand wing resemble those in van Eyck's ''[[Rolin Madonna]]''.&lt;ref name = "D248ff"/&gt;

The centre panel's spatial depth marks an advancement in van Eyck's technique, especially when compared to his similar 1436 ''{{plain link|http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jan_van_Eyck_054-096.jpg|Diptych of the Annunciation}}'' or ''van der Paele'' panel, both of which are comparatively flat. The depth of space is accomplished through such devices as placing the Virgin at the far end of the pictorial space, making her appear both smaller and seemingly at a remove and accentuating the receding lines of the carpets by setting them against the parallels of the folds of her gown.&lt;ref name="Pächt83" /&gt; The recessional perspective is further achieved by the sequence of columns stretching back from the throne.&lt;ref name="h106"/&gt; This is particularly noticeable with the positioning of the throne in comparison to the ''Lucca Madonna'' and van der Paele panels.&lt;ref name = "D248ff"/&gt;

As with van Eyck's earlier paintings of interiors, the building is not based on a particular place, but is an imagined and idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect and representational architectural space. This is evidenced by a number of features that would be unlikely in an actual contemporary church such as the sculptures that were more secular in nature. In detailing the structure he pays close attention to contemporary models, which he possibly combined with elements from ancient buildings. The columns contain "high [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] bases" found in early churches and on the [[Arch of Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Christopher. ''Forgery, Replica, Fiction: Temporalities of German Renaissance Art''. University of Chicago Press, 2008. 195–96. {{ISBN|0-226-90597-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Harbison]] believes that because the interior is not based on an actual building, the viewer is not burdened by preconceptions, a device which perhaps opens up the painting's "physiological" impact. In his view, the panels capture the moment when the donor's prayer and piety is rewarded by an apparition of the Virgin and Child. The novelty and unworldliness of the situation is highlighted by the unrealistic size of the Virgin compared to her surroundings.&lt;ref name="h151" /&gt;

Light plays a central role in all panels, to an extent almost comparable to van Eyck's ''Madonna in the Church''. The arches and columns are bathed in daylight, echoed by the text of the inscriptions around the central frame allude to light and illumination.&lt;ref name = "D251"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 252&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck pays close attention to the saturating effects and gradations of the light, which enters from the left and spreads across the middle ranges of each panel. He often used light to indicate a divine ethereal presence.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2003), 63&lt;/ref&gt; Because the implied spaces found on either side of Mary and leading into each of the wing panels are bathed in this light, they can be seen as conduits for the divine.&lt;ref name="h151" /&gt;

The triptych influenced [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s 1445–50 ''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece]]'' in a number of aspects, most obviously in its disregard of scale, especially with Mary's size relative to the other figures and surrounding architecture. Van der Weyden develops the idea further, placing a large crucifixion towering above the figures and almost spanning the height of the central panel.&lt;ref name="C23" /&gt;

== Donor ==
[[File:Dresden Triptych Detail Donor.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Detail showing the donor. Unusually his hands are held up but unclasped, suggesting that he is caught in wonder rather than prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Dhanens (1980), 249&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The identity of the [[Donor portrait|donor]] has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy.&lt;ref name="h61"/&gt; Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a [[Genoa|Genoese]] merchant.&lt;ref name="Streeton"/&gt; This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to [[Giovanni Mazone]]'s ''Virgin and Child'' altarpiece in [[Pontremoli]], [[Tuscany]], which may place it in the Italian region of [[Liguria]] at latest by the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="h61" /&gt; Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames&lt;ref name="Streeton"&gt;Streeton, Noëlle L.W. "[http://www.jhna.org/index.php/past-issues/vol-3-1/136-janvaneycksdresden Jan van Eyck's Dresden Triptych: new evidence for the  Giustiniani of Genoa in the Borromei ledger for Bruges, 1438]". ''Journal of Historians of Netherlandish Art'', Volume 3, Issue 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; have been linked to the Giustiniani family,&lt;!--linked (!) on what basis--&gt; known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="h61" /&gt; If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century.&lt;ref name = "Dhanens245"/&gt; In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor,&lt;ref name= "Weale29"/&gt; however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.&lt;ref name="Streeton"/&gt;

Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost.&lt;ref name = "Dhanens242"/&gt; Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family,&lt;ref group=a&gt;The Rapondis had strong banking ties to the Burgundian dukes and were active in Paris and the Low Countries. See Small, Graham. "The City, the Duke and Their Banker: The Rapondi Family and the Formation of the Burgundian State (1384–1430)". ''The Economic History Review''. Volume 60, No. 3 (Aug., 2007), 626–627&lt;/ref&gt; whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from [[Lucca]], who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in [[Wervik]] paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a [[stipend]] funded by local tax receipts, suggesting a connection. Dhanens admits the donor's identity is lost, but she says of the piece that "it could have been a gift from the husband to the wife, a pledge of his affection during his absences; or it could have been a gift from the wife to the husband, by way of protection on his travels."&lt;ref name = "Dhanens245"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 245&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
The triptych is in poor condition, having suffered damage and heavy paint loss, and has undergone a number of restorations.&lt;ref name="c139"&gt;Campbell (2006), 139&lt;/ref&gt;  The outer wooden frames, originally painted in grey and yellow marbling, were later overpainted in a design of black and red&lt;ref name="Jacobs 2012 80" /&gt; in the 16th or 17th centuries when "a faux turtle-shell design, imitating the then-fashionable veneer, replaced the earlier scheme of jaspered paint".&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt; An ebony surround was added to the inner frames for protection in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt; There has been extensive repair work on the paint forming Mary's dress,&lt;ref name="b60" /&gt; with large areas of her gown repaired in 1844 by painter [[Eduard Bendemann]].&lt;ref name="c139" /&gt;&lt;!-- was there only one restoration in the 1840s w/ conflicting dates in sources? --&gt; The badly damaged coats of arms have been retouched,&lt;ref name = "Dhanens242"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 242&lt;/ref&gt; while the frames have sustained impairment and are overpainted in areas.&lt;ref name="h61"/&gt; The painting was taken to Moscow after the Second World War. It was returned in 1959 after it had been cleaned, restored and underwent examination in a laboratory. This process revealed the ''&lt;small&gt;ALC IXH XAN&lt;/small&gt;'' inscription on the inner moulding of the central frame in front of the tiled floor when a coat of brown paint was stripped away.&lt;ref name="Streeton" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dhanens242"/&gt; The surround was removed during the 1959 restoration.&lt;ref name="Streeton"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">The '''Euston Road School''' is a term applied to a group of English painters, active either as staff or students at the School of Drawing and Painting in London between 1937 and 1939.&lt;ref name=crOxf&gt;{{cite web |author=Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095801579 |title=Euston Road School |year=|accessdate=4 November 2013|work=Oxford Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The School opened in October 1937 at premises in [[Fitzroy Street]] before moving to 314/316 [[Euston Road]] in February 1938. The School was founded by [[William Coldstream]], [[Victor Pasmore]] and [[Claude Rogers (artist)|Claude Rogers]]. [[Graham Bell (artist)|Graham Bell]] was a substantial theoretical influence on these teachers and [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] was also closely associated with the School.&lt;ref name=RMtate&gt;{{cite web |author=Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1674&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio |title=Artist biography, Rodrigo Moynihan |year=|accessdate=8 December 2013|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students at the school included [[Lawrence Gowing]], Tom Carr, [[Peter Lanyon]], and [[Thelma Hulbert]]. The writer [[Adrian Stokes (critic)|Adrian Stokes]] and the poet [[Stephen Spender]] attended drawing classes. [[Vanessa Bell]] and [[Duncan Grant]] were among visiting teachers to the School.&lt;ref name=ersODNB/&gt; The emphasis was on acute representational painting based on observation. The School emphasised [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]], in contrast to the various schools of ''[[avant-garde]]'' art then prevalent.  Many of the members were on the political left, and naturalism was seen as an attempt to make art more relevant and understandable to non-specialists and members of the public. To this end, Bell and Coldstream spent three weeks in working-class lodgings in [[Bolton]], Lancashire in April 1938 painting cityscapes showing local factories. The resulting paintings were not highly regarded locally in Bolton. Later in 1938, the Euston Road artists contributed to the ''Fifteen paintings of London'' exhibition held at the [[Storran Gallery]]. In an attempt to engage the wider public, private invitations were sent to everyone named Brown, in the Post Office telephone directory.&lt;ref name=ersODNB/&gt;

The School closed at the start of the Second World War, as its members joined the Armed Forces, worked as war artists or, in the case of Pasmore, were imprisoned for being a conscientious objector. A small exhibition, ''Members of the Euston Road group'' was held at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in 1942. In 1945 Pasmore, Coldstream, Rogers and Gowing were all teaching at the [[Camberwell School of Art]] and two further exhibitions followed, ''The Euston Road School and others'' at the Wakefield Art Gallery in 1948 and a group retrospective organised by the [[Arts Council]] which toured Britain throughout 1948 and 1949. By the end of 1949 the artists had embarked on separate projects, with Coldstream leaving Camberwell for the [[Slade School of Art]].&lt;ref name=ersODNB&gt;{{cite web |author=Bruce Laughton|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=64717&amp;back= |title=Euston Road School (act.1937-1939) |year=2004|accessdate=4 November 2013|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (OUP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cat guarding geese c1120 BC Egypt.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] cat guarding geese, Egypt, ca. 1120 [[BCE]]]]
'''Fable''' is a literary genre: a succinct [[fiction|fictional]] story, in [[prose]] or [[verse (poetry)|verse]], that features [[animal]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, [[plant]]s, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] (given human qualities, such as the ability to speak [[human language]]) and that illustrates or leads to a particular [[moral]] lesson (a "moral"), which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]&lt;!-- ''most'' of this page is too specific to serve as the only target --&gt; or [[saying]]&lt;!-- this is too much of a compendium to serve as the only target --&gt;.

A fable differs from a [[parable]] in that the latter ''excludes'' animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech or other powers of humankind.

Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished. In the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]], "{{lang|grc|μῦθος}}" ("''[[mythos]]''") was rendered by the [[Translation|translators]] as "fable"&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''[[First Epistle to Timothy|First Timothy]]'', "neither give heed to fables...", and "refuse profane and old wives' fables..." (1 Tim 1:4 and 4:4, respectively).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[First Epistle to Timothy]], the [[Second Epistle to Timothy]], the [[Epistle to Titus]] and the [[First Epistle of Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;
Strong's 3454. μύθος muthos moo’-thos; perhaps from the same as 3453 (through the idea of tuition); a tale, i.e. &lt;U&gt;fiction&lt;/U&gt; ("myth"):—fable.&lt;br /&gt;"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty." (2nd Peter 1:16)&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who writes fables is a '''fabulist'''.

==History==
The fable is one of the most enduring forms of [[folklore|folk literature]], spread abroad, modern researchers agree,&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Märchens'' (1977), see "Fabel", "Äsopica" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; less by literary anthologies than by oral transmission. Fables can be found in the literature of almost every country.

===Aesopic or Aesop's fable===
The varying corpus denoted ''Aesopica'' or ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' includes most of the best-known western fables, which are attributed to the [[legend]]ary [[Aesop]], supposed to have been a slave in [[ancient Greece]] around 550 BCE. When [[Babrius]] set down fables from the ''Aesopica'' in verse for a [[Hellenistic]] Prince "Alexander," he expressly stated at the head of Book II that this type of "myth" that Aesop had introduced to the "sons of the Hellenes" had been an invention of "Syrians" from the time of "[[Ninus|Ninos]]" (personifying [[Nineveh]] to Greeks) and [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belos]] ("ruler").&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1992:121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epicharmus of Kos]] and Phormis are reported as having been among the first to invent comic fables.&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Buckham, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Many familiar fables of Aesop include "[[The Crow and the Pitcher]]", "[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]" and "[[The Lion and the Mouse]]". In ancient Greek and Roman education, the fable was the first of the ''[[progymnasmata]]''—training exercises in prose composition and public speaking—wherein students would be asked to learn fables, expand upon them, invent their own, and finally use them as persuasive examples in longer forensic or deliberative speeches. The need of instructors to teach, and students to learn, a wide range of fables as material for their declamations resulted in their being gathered together in collections, like those of Aesop.

===Africa===
[[Oral tradition|African oral culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/atim-oton/arits-fables-kids-series_b_1001656.html |author=Atim Oton |title=Reaching African Children Through Fables and Animation |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a rich story-telling tradition. As they have for thousands of years, people of all ages in Africa continue to interact with nature, including plants, animals and earthly structures such as rivers, plains, and mountains. Grandparents enjoy enormous respect in African societies and fill the new role of story-telling during retirement years. Children and, to some extent, adults are mesmerized by good story-tellers when they become animated in their quest to tell a good fable.

[[Joel Chandler Harris]] wrote African-American fables in the Southern context of slavery under the name of [[Uncle Remus]]. His stories of the animal characters Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear are modern examples of African-American story-telling, this though should not transcend critiques and controversies as to whether or not Uncle Remus was a racist or apologist for slavery. The Disney movie ''[[Song of the South]]'' introduced many of the stories to the public and others not familiar with the role that storytelling played in the life of cultures and groups without training in speaking, reading, writing, or the cultures to which they had been relocated to from world practices of capturing Africans and other indigenous populations to provide slave labor to colonized countries.

===India===
India has a rich tradition of fabulous novels, mostly explainable by the fact that the culture derives traditions and learns qualities from natural elements. Most of the gods are some form of animals with ideal qualities. Also, hundreds of fables were composed in [[History of India|ancient India]] during the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BCE]], often as [[Story within a story|stories within]] [[frame story|frame stories]]. Indian fables have a mixed cast of humans and animals. The dialogues are often longer than in fables of Aesop and often witty as the animals try to outwit one another by trickery and deceit. In Indian fables, man is not superior to the animals. The tales are often comical. The Indian fable adhered to the universally known traditions of the fable. The best examples of the fable in India are the Panchatantra and the [[Jataka tales]]. These included [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', the ''[[Hitopadesha]]'', ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and The Vampire]]'', and [[Syntipas]]' ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', which were collections of fables that were later influential throughout the [[Old World]]. Ben E. Perry (compiler of the "[[Perry Index]]" of Aesop's fables) has argued controversially that some of the Buddhist ''Jataka tales'' and some of the fables in the ''Panchatantra'' may have been influenced by similar [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Near East]]ern ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ben E. Perry, "Introduction", p. xix, in ''Babrius and Phaedrus'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] such as [[Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa|Vyasa's]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'' also contained fables within the main story, often as [[side story|side stories]] or [[back-story]]. The most famous folk stories from the Near East were the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights''.

===Europe===
Fables had a further long tradition through the [[Middle Ages]], and became part of European high literature. During the 17th century, the [[France|French]] fabulist [[Jean de La Fontaine]] (1621–1695) saw the soul of the fable in the moral — a rule of behavior. Starting with the Aesopian pattern, La Fontaine set out to satirize the court, the church, the rising [[bourgeoisie]], indeed the entire human scene of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Translations of his 12 books of fables are available online at [http://oaks.nvg.org/fontaine.html oaks.nvg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; La Fontaine's model was subsequently emulated by England's [[John Gay]] (1685–1732);&lt;ref&gt;His two collections of 1727 and 1738 are available in one volume on Google Books at [https://books.google.com/books?id=X_Y0AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=john+gay+++%22fables%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_ChY5dZunN&amp;sig=5qBAeejDOY8U5EgxDr4Pgnw68ao&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EcNNTLKfGpL24AbX5uCaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false books.google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Poland's [[Ignacy Krasicki]] (1735–1801);&lt;ref&gt;His ''Bajki przypowiesci'' (Fables &amp; Parables, 1779) are available online at [http://literat.ug.edu.pl/ikbajk/index.htm ug.edu.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's [[:it:Lorenzo Pignotti|Lorenzo Pignotti]] (1739–1812)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CSQZlaZjE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pignotti+++favola&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n8Mlm8LQld&amp;sig=ubnkrD47WARSbDJKUXgNCj7_Vgo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8DhNTP-rOt3NjAeEtLDYDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Favole e Novelle'&amp;#39; (1785) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} and [[:it:Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi|Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi]] (1754–1827);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKoTAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pignotti+++favola&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Favole'&amp;#39; (1788) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} Serbia's [[Dositej Obradović]] (1739–1811); Spain's [[Félix María de Samaniego]] (1745–1801)&lt;ref&gt;9 books of fables are available online in Spanish at [http://amediavoz.com/samaniego.htm amediavoz.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa]] (1750–1791);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr0DAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tom%C3%A1s+de+Iriarte+y+Oropesa+fabulas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WbHNxf22GV&amp;sig=zrfOpn4x0K8bAykQBwrXmq_zHfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mElNTMGZO5mW4gbNyLCaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Fabulas Literarias'&amp;#39; are available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} France's [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]] (1755–94);&lt;ref&gt;His five books of fables are available online in French at [http://www.shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm shanaweb.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612144726/http://shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia's [[Ivan Krylov]] (1769–1844).&lt;ref&gt;5 books of fables are available online in Russian at [http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/literature/19century/krylov2.html friends-partners.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
In modern times, while the fable has been trivialized in children's books, it has also been fully adapted to modern adult literature. [[Felix Salten]]'s ''[[Bambi, A Life in the Woods|Bambi]]'' (1923) is a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' — a story of a [[protagonist]]'s coming-of-age — cast in the form of a fable. [[James Thurber]] used the ancient fable style in his books ''[[Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated|Fables for Our Time]]'' (1940) and ''[[Further Fables for Our Time]]'' (1956), and in his stories "[[The Princess and the Tin Box]]" in ''The Beast in Me and Other Animals'' (1948) and "The Last Clock: A Fable for the Time, Such As It Is, of Man" in ''Lanterns and Lances'' (1961). [[Władysław Reymont]]'s ''The Revolt'' (1922), a [[metaphor]] for the [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution of 1917]], described a revolt by animals that take over their farm in order to introduce "equality." [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) similarly satirized [[Stalinist Communism]] in particular, and [[totalitarianism]] in general, in the guise of animal fable.

In the 21st century, the Neapolitan writer Sabatino Scia is the author of more than two hundred fables that he describes as “western protest fables.” The characters are not only animals, but also things, beings, and elements from nature. Scia’s aim is the same as in the traditional fable, playing the role of revealer of human society. In Latin America, the brothers Juan and Victor Ataucuri Garcia have contributed to the resurgence of the fable. But they do so with a novel idea: use the fable as a means of dissemination of traditional literature of that place. In the book ''[http://www.childrenslibrary.org/icdl/BookPreview?bookid=atafabu_00510018&amp;route=author_Spanish&amp;lang=Spanish&amp;msg&amp;ilang=Spanish "Fábulas Peruanas"] published in 2003, they have collected myths, legends, beliefs of Andean and Amazonian Peru, to write as fables. The result has been an extraordinary work rich in regional nuances. Here we discover the relationship between man and his origin, with nature, with its history, its customs and beliefs then become norms and values.&lt;ref&gt;Juan y Víctor Ataucuri García, "Fábulas Peruanas", Gaviota Azul Editores, Lima, 2003 {{ISBN|9972-2561-0-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House''''' (New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2007) is a [[memoir]] by [[Valerie Plame|Valerie Plame Wilson]]. Mrs. Wilson is the former [[Non-official cover|covert]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer whose then-classified [[non-official cover]] (NOC) identity as "[[Valerie Plame]]" was leaked to the press in July 2003, after her husband, former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph C. Wilson, IV]], had criticized the [[Presidency of the United States|George W. Bush administration]]'s rationale for the [[Iraq War]].  The outing made her the center of the [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|American political scandal]] known as the [[Plame affair]].  Her public outing led to her decision to resign from the CIA in December 2005, when she attempted to retire early at the age of 42. Being told that she could not collect her pension until the age of 56, she determined to write this book both as a means of telling her own story in her own words and as a means of earning income to replace her deferred retirement annuity.  She encountered resistance from the CIA in the course of chronicling her work with the organization.&lt;ref name=LiptakAug&gt;Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/washington/03plame.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=login&amp;adxnnlx=1206245413-gmc8PySloz5lTGt0nKkH1Q "Judge Backs C.I.A. in Suit On Memoir"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 3, 2007, accessed March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;John Solomon, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-07-15-rove-testimony_x.htm "Rove Learned CIA Agent's Name from Novak"], ''[[USA Today]]'', July 15, 2005, accessed July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seidman&gt;Joel Seidman (Producer, [[NBC News]]), [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18924679/ "Plame Was 'covert' Agent at Time of Name Leak: Newly Released Unclassified Document Details CIA Employment"], ''[[MSNBC]]'', May 29, 2007, accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Bonnie Goldstein, [http://www.slate.com/id/2168490/entry/0/ "Free Valerie Plame's Memoirs!"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', June 15, 2007, accessed October 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Janet Maslin]] writes in her ''New York Times'' review on the day of publication, "the story of how her career was derailed and her C.I.A. cover blown ... has its combative side.  But the real proof of Ms. Wilson’s fighting spirit is the form in which her version of events has been brought into the light of day."

{{Main article|Plame affair}}
The phrase "fair game" in the title of Mrs. Wilson's [[memoir]] refers to a comment that [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Deputy White House Chief of Staff]] for Strategic Planning and Senior Advisor [[Karl Rove]] reportedly told [[Chris Matthews]], the host of [[MSNBC]]'s television show ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'': "I just got off the phone with Karl Rove. He says, and I quote, '[[Joseph C. Wilson|Wilson]]'s wife is fair game.'"&lt;ref name=WilsonPolitics&gt;Russ Hoyle, "The [[Niger uranium forgeries|Niger Affair]]: The Investigation That Won't Go Away," "Foreword" (xiii-xlix) in Joseph C.

Cf. Joseph C. Wilson, "The Sixteen Words", chap. 1 in ''The Politics of Truth'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'WILSON'S WIFE IS FAIR GAME.'" Those are fighting words for any man, and I'd just had them quoted to me by MSNBC's [[Chris Matthews]].  It was July 21, 2003, barely a week since a column by [[Robert Novak]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' had named my wife, Valerie, as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, and now the host of ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'' was calling to tell me that as far as the [[The White House|White House]] was concerned, they had declared open season on my family. ... In his signature staccato, Matthews was blunt: "I just got off the phone with [[Karl Rove]].  He says, and I quote, 'Wilson's wife is fair game.'"

"Fair Game" serves as a metaphor derived from more recent contexts of her life that the author relates in this book; given the nature of [[Non-official cover|covert espionage]], it may suggest multiple meanings.&lt;ref name=Waas&gt;[[Murray Waas]], [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=plugging_leaks "Plugging Leaks:] More Details Emerge on the Plame Investigation, As Karl Rove's Testimony Is Revealed for the First Time", ''[[The American Prospect]]'', March 8, 2004, accessed August 23, 2007.

=====Karl Rove's disavowal of the phrase "fair game"=====
After the title of Valerie Plame Wilson's book had already been widely disseminated, on August 19, 2007, on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' with [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]], Gregory asked Rove, who identified himself as an "avid [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]",&lt;ref name=MTP1&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20302351/ "'Meet the Press' Transcript for Aug. 19, 2007"], ''[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]'', August 19, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007.  (Page 1 of 6 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt; among other statements pertaining to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] attributed to him, whether he "considered her fair game in this debate" between her husband and [[The White House]] over the President's so-called "[[September Dossier|sixteen words]]".  Rove responded that the phrase "fair game" attributed to him by [[Chris Matthews]] was Matthews' phrase not his own and that he himself did not consider Mrs. Wilson (in Gregory's phrase) "an appropropriate target in this debate."&lt;ref name=MTP3&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20302351/page/3/ "'Meet the Press' Transcript for Aug. 19, 2007"], ''[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]'', August 19, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  Do you think you owe Valerie Plame an apology?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  You do not?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  You considered her fair game in this debate?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.  And you know what?  Fair game, that wasn’t my phrase.  That’s a phrase of a journalist.  In fact, a colleague of yours [Matthews].&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  Was she an appropriate target in this debate?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  She was not.&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.  (Page 3 of 6 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Related contexts=====
In October 2003 Evan Thomas and [[Michael Isikoff]] reported in ''[[Newsweek]]'' that "The White House spokesman dismissed as 'ridiculous' the charge that Rove outed Plame."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3a&gt;Evan Thomas and [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3129941/site/newsweek/ "Secrets and Leaks:] Pssst ... You Might Think This Washington Leak Investigation Will Peter Out Like Most Others, with No Culprits and No Penalties. But Here's Why This One May Be Different", ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 6, 2003,  online version, October 13, 2003 ("Updated: 1:20 p.m. ET July 12, 2005"): 3 (of 4 pages), accessed August 22, 2007: &lt;blockquote&gt;A source familiar with Rove's conversation acknowledged that Rove spoke to Matthews a few days after [[Robert Novak|Novak's]] column appeared, but said that Rove never told Matthews that Wilson’s wife was "fair game"—rather, that it "was reasonable to discuss who sent Wilson to Niger." Novak wrote last week that the leaker was "no partisan gunslinger."  That suggests that the original leak came from someone in [[the White House]] [[national security|national-security]] apparatus, which holds itself above politics. Many White House staffers are potential suspects, but various press reports have suggested that the Feds will want to interview [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney|Cheney's]] [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States|chief of staff]], an aggressive consumer of intelligence regarded by some CIA analysts as an intimidating figure.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Thomas and Isikoff note, "It may be significant that both Rove and Libby deny leaking classified information. They may say that in talking to reporters they used her name without knowing that she was undercover."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt;

[[Chris Matthews]] reportedly declined to discuss the telephone conversation that he had had with Rove, according to Thomas and Iskikoff in ''[[Newsweek]]'', who quote the conversation that Wilson reported having with Matthews and then add parenthetically: "(Matthews told ''Newsweek'': 'I’m not going to talk about off-the-record conversations.')"&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt; [[David Corn]] of ''[[The Nation]]'' notes Matthews' statement to ''Newsweek'' "that he would not discuss off-the record conversations," adding, also parenthetically, that, earlier, "he [Matthews] told me the same...."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Corn&gt;As cited in [[David Corn]], [http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&amp;pid=991 "The Spin Is Not Holding"], ''Capital Games'' (blog),  ''[[The Nation]]'', October 4, 2003, accessed August 22, 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The newsmagazine [Newsweek] also notes that, according to a source close to Wilson, shortly after the leak occurred Bush's senior aide Karl Rove told Hardball host Chris Matthews that Wilson's wife was "fair game." Matthews told Newsweek that he would not discuss off-the-record conversations. (He told me the same weeks ago when I made a similar inquiry about this chat with Rove.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Isikoff&gt;[[Cf.]] [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek/ "The Rove Factor: Time Magazine Talked to Bush's Guru for Plame Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050706043356/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek |date=2005-07-06 }}, ''[[Newsweek]]'', July 11, 2006, accessed August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7102243 "Legal Affairs: Reporter Says Libby, Rove Told Him of Plame's Work"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', ''[[National Public Radio]]'', January 31, 2007, accessed August 23, 2007; includes audio link (NPR Player).&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews was one of over twenty-five journalists subpoenaed by [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Special Counsel]] [[Patrick Fitzgerald]] regarding their conversations with high-level [[Presidency of the United States|Bush administration]] officials pertaining to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] (2003–2005), leading to the indictment and prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]] in ''[[United States v. Libby]]'' (2007).{{Further information|Valerie Plame#Judicial and legislative actions pertaining to "Plamegate"}}

Ultimately, whereas Fitzgerald's grand jury did not indict Rove for committing any alleged crimes, and, in October 2005, it did indict Libby not for allegedly having leaked Mrs. Wilson's identity but for allegedly having lied in his sworn testimony pertaining to the leak investigation, federal [[felony|felonies]] for which a jury convicted and a judge sentenced him, a sentence which was commuted by Presidential proclamation.  On July 19, 2007, a district court judge dismissed the Wilsons' [[civil lawsuit]] ([[Plame v. Cheney]]) which charged related offenses by the various government officials. The dismissal was on jurisdictional grounds, that the case belonged in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-19-plame-lawsuit_N.htm|title=Plame's lawsuit against Cheney dismissed - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/19/cia.leak/index.html|title=Judge tosses out ex-spy's lawsuit against Cheney in CIA leak case - CNN.com|website=us.cnn.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071901395.html?hpid=topnews|title=Plame's Suit Against  Top Officials Dismissed|last=Leonnig|first=Carol D.|date=2007-07-20|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2006cv1258-52|title=Memorandum Opinion|last=in "Valerie Wilson, et al., Plaintiffs, v.

On April 6, 2006, Matthews stated his own point of view on the CIA leak publicly in some detail in his conversation with Senator [[John Kerry]] on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', describing as "high drama" [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]]'s testimony that the [[President of the United States]] via the [[Vice President of the United States]] had "ordered" Libby to leak classified information pertaining to [[national security]] in order to bolster the case for the [[Iraq War]] after it began in March 2003.&lt;ref name="Matthews2006"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12193430/ "Kerry: 'Immoral to allow our kids to be killed':] Sen. John Kerry talks to Chris Matthews about Iraq, CIA leak: ''Following the CIA leak disclosure, Chris Matthews sat down with Senator John Kerry in his Capitol office to discuss the big developments in the CIA leak case and vision for Iraq policy''", ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', ''[[MSNBC]]'', April 6, 2006, accessed August 22, 2007 (Transcript):&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's talk about the timing of this and we all remember this.  It was July 6th that Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who had been sent down there by the CIA to the government of [[Niger]] to check out the story which appeared mysteriously in an Italian newspaper, that there had been a deal by Saddam Hussein to purchase nuclear materials, [[yellowcake|uranium yellow cake]], from the government of Niger.
Within two days, the [[vice president of the United States]] said the [[president of the United States]] wanted [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]] to leak to [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judy Miller]], someone he had been working with on stories, had written stories that were supportive of the war, in effect, if not in intent, to tell her, this is a specific determination by the president.
You tell Scooter to go tell Judy that there was a real case for these aluminum tubes being material for use in developing a nuclear weapon.  You tell her this.  This is the conversation we're getting recounted under oath from Scooter Libby.  Pretty high drama here, isn't it?
I mean, it tells you that the president himself was in charge of this operation. He wasn't some, faded backroom guy getting orders from the vice president.  He was in fact, calling the shots particularly, and making the case for the war after the fact.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2007, the day after [[Lewis Libby]]'s sentencing, in a conversation with actor and political activist [[Ben Affleck]] about other matters, [[Chris Matthews]] used the phrase "fair game" several times, initially citing its use in a question submitted for Affleck by a viewer, whose own use of the phrase could reflect Matthews' already well-publicized reported use of it by Wilson, ''[[Newsweek]]'', and many other [[mass media|media]] sources.&lt;ref name=MatthewsJune2007&gt;[[Chris Matthews]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19110556/ "'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for June 7"], ''[[MSNBC]]'', updated June 8, 2007, 12:09 p.m. ET, accessed August 23, 2007: "Here's a question from [...].  'Are the personal or religious beliefs of candidates ''fair game'' for scrutiny when deciding for whom to vote?'  What do you make of that, Ben?  It's been happening in these debates, lots of questions about, you know, evolution, Genesis, the whole thing, creationism.  Are they ''fair game'', or is that a religious test?" (Italics added.) (Transcript; "Guests: [[Ben Affleck]], [[Loretta Sanchez]], [[Brian Bilbray]], [[Ezra Klein]], Karen Hanretty.")&lt;/ref&gt;  His later usage of the phrase "fair game" in talking with Affleck about other matters raises a possibility that the phrase "fair use" that he reportedly used in talking with Wilson about Rove's comments about "Wilson's wife" (as quoted in ''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' [2004, 2005] and as previously quoted in ''[[Newsweek]]'' [2003]) was his own phrase and not Rove's, as Rove later disavowed it.

Nevertheless, whether or not Rove originated it, the phrase still conveys metaphorically what Matthews and the Wilsons appear to think that Rove literally may have intended: to "target" (in Gregory's later terminology) Wilson and, collaterally, to leak the information about his wife's CIA identity in the process.  The [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] did not result in charging that anyone leaked her name intentionally while knowing that it was a classified [[Non-official cover|covert]] identity, in part, Special Counsel Fitzgerald later argued in ''[[United States v. Libby]]'', because of Libby's [[obstruction of justice]].  The jury [[Conviction|convicted]] Libby on four of the five counts in the indictment: one count of [[obstruction of justice]]; two counts of [[perjury]]; and one count of [[making false statements]] to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|federal investigators]], he was sentenced on June 5, 2007, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] his 30-month prison sentence on July 2, 2007.&lt;ref name=TheCounts&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/i_lewis_libby_jr/index.html "I.

Libby}}

On July 3, 2007, the day after President Bush commuted Libby's sentence, [[Chris Matthews]] talked again with former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Wilson]], who reiterated his belief that the Bush administration had inappropriately leaked his wife's then-classified [[Non-official cover|covert]] CIA identity to retaliate against him politically, in effect targeting her. Matthews asked Wilson: "When did you sense that the White House was trying to destroy your reputation?" and he replied: "Well, it was pretty clear to me shortly after I wrote my article [[Joseph C. Wilson#"What I Didn't Find in Africa"|"What I Didn't Find in Africa"]], when Mr. Novak spoke to a friend of mine on the street and said that, Wilson's a 'blank,' and his wife works for the CIA, that the nature of the smear campaign they were going to run against me was going to include the betrayal of her identity as a covert CIA officer.

====Subtitle====
The subtitle "My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House" corresponds to parts of the subtitle of the 2005 paperback edition of former Ambassador Wilson's memoir ''[[The Politics of Truth|Inside the Lies that Put the White House on Trial and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir]]''.  Since her identity was leaked by Richard Armitage, then Deputy Secretary of State, the subtitles are not entirely accurate.

==Review excerpts==
[[Janet Maslin]]:
{{cquote|'Anyone not living in a cave for the last few years [since the outing in 2003] knew I had a career at the C.I.A.,' writes Ms. Wilson .... Once that career was destroyed, she wrote this account of her experiences as a means of both supporting herself and settling scores. She was contractually obligated to submit a draft of the book to the Central Intelligence Agency’s Publications Review Board. That draft came back heavily expurgated. She was then expected to rewrite her book so that it made sense despite many deletions.

But Ms. Wilson and her publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, contend that much of the censored information is in the public domain—and that the suppression of information is itself part of Ms. Wilson's story. So ''Fair Game'' has been published with the censor's marks visible as blacked-out words, lines, paragraphs or pages. The publisher amplifies the book with an 80-page afterword by Laura Rozen, a reporter, who uses matters of public record to fill in some of the gaps.

'My days of spelling "P-L-A-M as in Mary-E" over the phone would be over,' she writes in what is this book's biggest understatement. But however widely known she has become, Ms. Wilson has not previously revealed what it was like for her to follow the trial of [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis Libby Jr.]], known as Scooter; to be infuriated that [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], then of ''[[The New York Times]]'', and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' tried to protect secret sources at Ms. Wilson's expense ('These reporters were allowing themselves to be exploited by the administration and were obstructing the investigation'); and to learn that Ms. Miller, in her notebook, had gotten her name wrong, calling her "Valerie Flame" ('my exotic-dancer stage name,' Ms. Wilson joked to friends). She was outraged by the extent to which she had become fodder for the gossip mill.

Citing the dismay voiced by [[Ari Fleischer]], the [[White House]] press secretary, that such loose talk about an undercover agent might actually be criminal, she writes angrily: 'If he was so surprised that his actions might have adverse national security implications, then he's not smart enough to work in the White House. That goes for all the officials who thought that using my name as catnip was just playing the Washington game as usual.'

That idea of gamesmanship gives 'Fair Game,' the book's already stinging title, an even harsher meaning.}}

Alan Cooperman:
{{cquote|There is no reason to doubt that Wilson wrote ''Fair Game'' herself. To put it kindly, the memoir lacks the sheen of a ghostwriter's work and has the voice of an ordinary person caught up in extraordinary events. It doesn't help that the CIA redacted the manuscript heavily before approving it for publication. Each time she is about to launch into a juicy anecdote, it seems, lines are blacked out, sometimes for pages on end.

The book is, however, greatly assisted by an afterword by Laura Rozen, a reporter for the ''American Prospect''. Rozen faithfully echoes Wilson's point of view but fills in many of the censored dates, places and other details from published sources. Readers would be smart to turn to the afterword first, before tackling Wilson's disjointed narrative.}}

==Film adaptation==
In 2010, the book was adapted into [[Fair Game (2010 film)|a film]] starring [[Sean Penn]] and [[Naomi Watts]] as Plame.

In [[art]] and [[art criticism]], '''form and content''' are considered distinct aspects of a [[work of art]]. The term ''form'' refers to the work's style, techniques and media used, and how the [[Design elements and principles|elements of design]] are implemented. ''Content'', on the other hand, refers to a work's subject matter, or what is being depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/reference/f/what_is_art.htm|title=How to Define Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Gothic altarpiece of Santes Creus''' is an altarpiece painted by [[Guerau Gener]] and [[Lluís Borrassà]] between 1407 and 1411. It is one of the key works of the International Gothic altarpieces in [[Catalonia]], created for the [[Santes Creus]] Monastery. The [[MNAC Barcelona|MNAC museum]] retains the ''Nativity'', crowned by the figure of ''St. John the Evangelist'', and the Resurrection of Christ, while the rest of the tables are kept in one of the chapels of the [[cathedral of Tarragona]]. The altarpiece was commissioned to [[Pere Serra]] but apparently died without starting it. Guerau Gener, a connoisseur of València international Gothic, replaced him, but his untimely death made Lluís Borrassà, one of the major figures in the painting of the first international Catalan Gothic, to complete the project.&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.

'''''Helen of Troy''''' is an 1898 painting by [[Evelyn De Morgan]] depicting [[Helen of Troy]]; it was commissioned by [[William Imrie]] of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cherry, ''Painting Women: Victorian Women Artists'' (1993) p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compositionally, the painting is similar to De Morgan's ''Flora'' and ''Cassandra'':&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2002, pp. 92-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Helena is standing upright and tall, in a peaceful posture that reminds to Boticcelli's representations of Greek and Roman goddesses (such as [[Pallas and the Centaur|Athena]] or [[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Venus]]) that are, at the same time, an evocation of classical art, a usual characteristic between Renaissance artists. Helena has been removed from the common artistic elements of the [[Trojan War]]: despite dealing with a typically bellic topic, De Morgan decides to paint, instead of weapons and battles, the wonderful pink clothes and the fascinated look that Helena puts on the mirror that is reflecting her beautiful face, elements that can be read as symbols of her inconscient vanity, which eventually brought a long and terrible war and destruction to the city of [[Troy]], which we can see in the last term of the composition, on top of a hill. The presence of the moon-sun in the sky is also related to her feminine and voluble nature.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The '''International Short Film Festival Oberhausen''', founded in 1954, is one of the oldest [[short film]] festivals in the world. Held in [[Oberhausen]], it is one of the major international platforms for short form. The festival holds an International Competition, German Competition and International Children’s and Youth Film Competition as well as the MuVi Award for best German music video and, since 2009, the NRW Competition for productions from the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

Oberhausen is furthermore known today for its extensive thematic programmes such as “Shooting Animals. A Brief History of Animal Film” (2011), "Memories Can't Wait. Film without Film" (2014) or "The Third Image. 3D Cinema as Experiment" (2015). The festival in addition offers visitors a well-equipped Video Library, operates a non-commercial short-film distribution service and owns an archive of short films from over 60 years of cinema history.

== History ==
The International Short Film Festival Oberhausen was founded in 1954 by the director of the Oberhausen Volkshochschule (adult education centre), [[Hilmar Hoffmann]], in association with the Filmclub Oberhausen under the name “1st West German Educational Film Festival”. The event was initially geared to fulfilling an educational policy mandate and the motto chosen for the first festival was hence “Cultural Film – Route to Education”. Featured were 45 films from the Federal Republic of Germany, France and the USA.

At the 4th West German Educational Film Festival, in 1958, the motto “Way to the Neighbour” was introduced, under which the festival took place until 1997. In 1959 the festival was rechristened “West German Short Film Festival”. Oberhausen soon made a political name for itself, chiefly because many films produced in the [[Eastern Bloc]] could only be viewed in Oberhausen, a situation that led to the festival’s rapid ascent and its reputation as “short film mecca”. As early as the 1950s, however, visitors were also treated to works by young filmmakers from the West such as [[François Truffaut]], [[Norman McLaren]], [[Alain Resnais]], [[Bert Haanstra]] and [[Lindsay Anderson]]. At the fourth festival in 1958, 190 films from 29 countries were already included in the programme.

At the eighth festival in 1962 a group of young German filmmakers, among them [[Alexander Kluge]], [[Peter Schamoni]] and [[Edgar Reitz]], issued the [[Oberhausen Manifesto]], pronouncing the “old” film dead and declaring their aspiration to create a new kind of German film.

The 1960s then culminated in a 1968 scandal surrounding Hellmuth Costard’s film '''Besonders wertvoll''', in which a talking penis criticized the new Film Funding Act of 1967. Responding to an objection issued by the public prosecutor’s office, the festival removed the film from the official programme, whereupon many German filmmakers withdrew their works from the festival. Oberhausen emerged from the crisis with an amended set of regulations, including a public selection procedure for German films.

[[File:DBP 1979 1003 25 Jahre Westdeutsche Kurzfilmtage.jpg|thumbnail|left|German stamp commemorating the festival's 25th anniversary (1979)]]
In the 1970s the women’s movement was a touchstone at the festival, with young filmmakers such as [[Chantal Akerman]] and [[Helma Sanders-Brahms]] showing their first films in Oberhausen. With its Children’s and Youth Cinema, the festival inaugurated a new competition category in 1978. The 1970s also witnessed a wave of new festivals: ousted from the cinema, the short form found new screening options in the festival arena.

In the late 1980s video and new media began to gradually come onto the scene at Oberhausen. With the subsidence of the East/West conflict that had shaped the festival’s early years, its role as “window to the East” slowly faded. Now, the festival’s profile as mediator and trailblazer between the worlds of short film and advertising clip, [[music video]], industrial film and [[video art]] – often subsumed under the generic term avant-garde – came to the fore.

In 1991 the festival was renamed the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, the name it still bears today. That same year, Oberhausen introduced the nation’s first competition for German short film. Since 1993 the festival has given film and video equal standing in its competitions. In 1999 Oberhausen introduced the first film-festival award for music videos anywhere in the world, known as the MuVi, which is still today awarded exclusively to directors for the visual quality of their clips.[3] With the rise of video art more and more films made by artists have found their way into the festival programmes.

Today Oberhausen presents short films and videos originating from a wide range of formal, cultural and social backgrounds. Large-scale special programmes take up a different theme each year, most recently “Shooting Animals. A Brief History of Animal Film” (2011), "Memories Can't Wait. Film without Film" (2014) and "The Third Image. 3D Cinema as Experiment (2015). The festival also maintains a Video Library featuring a large selection of recent international short films, regularly mounts profile programmes dedicated to individual artists, and each year hosts a discussion series called “Podium”.

Besides organizing the festival, Oberhausen operates a non-commercial short film distribution service and its own archive holding short films from over 60 years of film history.

== Careers ==
“I smoked my first cigarette here. For years, I saw every single film at the Westdeutsche Kurzfilmtage, looking forward to those days in Oberhausen every year. These events were important for me, for my decision to become a filmmaker.” [[Wim Wenders]], filmmaker, Germany

“Short film is a great first step for a budding filmmaker. That’s how I made my beginnings, and Oberhausen was an important step on my path to become a director.” [[Roman Polanski]], filmmaker, Poland/France

During the long history of the Oberhausen festival, many careers got off to a successful start. A few of the filmmakers and artists who showed their early works in Oberhausen: : [[Eija-Liisa Ahtila]], [[Doug Aitken]], [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Andrea Arnold]], Jürgen Böttcher, [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Vera Chytilová]], [[Valie Export]], [[Miloš Forman]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Christoph Hochhäusler]], [[Hermine Huntgeburth]], [[Joris Ivens]], [[Isaac Julien]], [[Miranda July]], [[Romuald Karmakar]], Jochen Kuhn, [[Jan Lenica]], [[Chris Marker]], [[Bjørn Melhus]], Dore O., [[Roman Polanski]], [[Pipilotti Rist]], [[Christoph Schlingensief]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[István Szabó]], [[Agnès Varda]], [[Adolf Winkelmann (film director)|Adolf Winkelmann]].

'''John McRobbie Gordon''', ''né'' '''John McRobbie''' (12 October 1857 &amp;ndash; 22 February 1944) was a Scottish singer, actor, stage manager and director, known as an influential stage director of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] after the death of [[W. S. Gilbert]].

In his early career Gordon appeared in the chorus and minor roles in D'Oyly Carte productions, and after a period as a freelance actor, manager and director, he returned to the company permanently in 1910, as stage manager, and later stage director, establishing a reputation as a firm disciplinarian and upholder of the performing practices originated by Gilbert.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Gordon was born in [[Lumphanan]], Aberdeenshire, the eldest son of Samuel McRobbie, a carpenter and farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon,  p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon retained his Aberdeen accent throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary", ''The Glasgow Herald'', 25 February 1944&lt;/ref&gt; The family was musical and did not discourage the boy's ambitions for a career as a singer. He studied at the short-lived Aberdeen Conservatoire before moving to London in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 10 and 13&lt;/ref&gt; He took his mother's maiden name as a stage name to avoid embarrassing his more puritanical relatives, who disapproved of the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Introduction and p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a touring opera company, playing [[baritone]] roles in such works as ''[[La Sonnambula]]'' and ''[[Fra Diavolo]]''. In 1881 he was understudy to the baritone lead in the [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Edmond Audran|Audran]]'s ''[[La Mascotte]]''. Further small roles in touring opera companies followed. In 1883, while playing Marvejol in Audran's ''[[Les noces d'Olivette|Olivette]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Olivette at West Hartlepool", ''The North-Eastern Daily Gazette'', 4 January 1904, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; he married a fellow member of the company, May Piemonté.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 21 and 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 Gordon joined one of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] touring companies as a member of the chorus in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''. In 1884, he played the part of Colonel Calverley in ''Patience'' on tour.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon,  p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] saw him perform and offered him the chance to join the main London company at the [[Savoy Theatre]], as a chorus member and understudy.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon remained a member of the company until 1890, playing Piscator in ''[[The Carp (opera)|The Carp]]'', a one-act [[curtain raiser (drama)|curtain raiser]], when it accompanied ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), and Harrington Jarramie in ''[[Mrs. Jarramie's Genie]]'' (another curtain raiser), when it accompanied ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888).&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GordonJM.htm J.M. Gordon], Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 17 July 2014, accessed 21 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the chorus in the original runs of  ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), ''Ruddigore'', ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889), and the 1885 revival of  ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' and ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' at the Savoy.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

In the 1890s, Gordon managed, and acted in, his own touring company, "The Gordon 'At Home' Party". It comprised variously four or five performers, playing a series of short pieces including ''[[Mock Turtles (opera)|Mock Turtles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 14 August 1897, p. 12; and "Local Topics", ''Shoreditch Observer'', 11 December 1897, p. 3 &lt;/ref&gt; He also ran his own band.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; By the early 1900s, he was working as a freelance conductor and stage director for British amateur operatic societies. Among the works he directed were Sullivan's ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'', [[Robert Planquette|Planquette's]] ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', [[Alfred Cellier|Cellier]]'s ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' and ''[[The Mountebanks]]'', and Gilbert's play ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 59, 60 and 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===D'Oyly Carte stage manager and director===
Throughout his freelance period Gordon maintained his links with D'Oyly Carte, coaching young singers for the touring companies and the Savoy in his spare time. After Carte's death in 1901, Gordon continued to coach singers for [[Helen Carte]] after she took over the opera company. In March 1907 he served as [[stage manager]] to the D'Oyly Carte touring company.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; At the Savoy in July of that year, during the D'Oyly Carte's first London repertory season, he directed the revival of ''[[Iolanthe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 21; and Bullough, John Malcolm. "Deeside Man Carries On Gilbert Traditions", ''Aberdeen Press and Journal'', 13 December 1937, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 Gordon accepted Helen Carte's offer of a permanent position as stage manager to the company, and he gave up his freelance activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert died in 1911, and Helen Carte died two years later. The opera company was inherited by her stepson, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], who, according to a 2014 biographical sketch of Gordon, needed a stage manager who would maintain the company's production standards and preserve Gilbert's traditions and style. Gordon's skills, attention to detail and tenacity, together with his experience with the company under Gilbert's direction, were what Carte required.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; One of Carte's priorities was to arrive at an authorised text. Over the years Gilbert had tweaked his libretti, removing out-of-date references and adding new ones. He had also permitted a few interpolations by senior members of the company. Gordon, whose close contacts with Gilbert had included work on the [[prompt book]]s for the Savoy operas, was entrusted with preparing an authoritative set of libretti. In general, he retained the few "gags" that Gilbert had approved, and otherwise returned to the original 1870s and '80s texts.&lt;ref name=j165/&gt;{{refn|"Gags" approved by Gilbert and retained by Gordon included Pooh-Bah's "No money – no grovel!" and Nanki-Poo's "Modified rapture!" in ''The Mikado''. Examples of Gordon’s removal of Gilbert's own updatings included reverting from "a tuppenny tube young man" to the original "a threepenny bus young man" in ''Patience''.&lt;ref name=j165&gt;Joseph, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}     

Gordon stage managed and then directed D'Oyly Carte productions for the next twenty-eight years. He coached new artists on the blocking, dances, and line readings for each part, and maintained strict quality control over the productions. He was named stage director for the company in 1922 and served in that capacity for seventeen years.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix pp. I–IV&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Sorcerer'' was revived in 1916 after a long absence from the company's repertory, Gordon directed the production.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, John Malcolm. "Deeside Man Carries On Gilbert Traditions", ''Aberdeen Press and Journal'', 13 December 1937, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In consultation with Rupert D'Oyly Carte, he was responsible for making major textual revisions to ''Ruddigore'' when it was revived, for the first time, in December 1921. Around the same time, he worked with the company's musical director, [[Harry Norris (conductor)|Harry Norris]], to create the radically shortened "Savoy Edition" of ''[[Cox and Box]]'', and he approved any changes to stage business, such as [[Darrell Fancourt]]'s introduction of the Mikado's famous laugh.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; His relations with [[Malcolm Sargent]], whom Carte brought in to conduct London seasons in 1926 and 1929–30, were less harmonious. Sargent's brisk tempos upset Gordon, who protested unavailingly that they interfered with the pacing of the stage action. Some senior company members agreed with Gordon, but Carte backed Sargent.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon retired in July 1939, but briefly came out of retirement in late 1939 and early 1940 to coach [[Grahame Clifford]], who had taken over at short notice from [[Martyn Green]] as principal comedian.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; He died at his home in Brighton at the age of 87 after a fall in the wartime blackout.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;Gordon, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; His only surviving daughter, Lily, preserved many of his papers with information about the company's productions. His memoirs were edited by his great-niece Elizabeth Benney and published by Pitcairn-Knowles in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
Many members of D'Oyly Carte wrote anecdotes about Gordon's dedication and the value of his instruction. [[Derek Oldham]] described him as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a tiger for knowing and getting what he wanted! He was only really happy when he was rehearsing. He loved rehearsing. ... He was the everlasting secret joke of the Company ... and there were some funny tales. ... But he had that company on its toes. It is sometimes said that the vintage years of [the company] were from 1919 and the six years following. Well, they were all due to old man Gordon. … Later, as he became older and tired, it showed itself in the fact that he was not so flexible. He became a martinet in tiny little things of "business" and tradition, and would not allow the individuality of the actor to colour a part, as he used to in my time ... making for a dull uniformity. But what a producer when at his best. ... Gordon gave me diction, much solid stage technique, and nursed the passion and sincerity for my job.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Roy (ed). [http://pinafore.www3.50megs.com/remembers.html "Derek Oldham Remembers"], at the ''Memories of the D'Oyly Carte'' website, accessed 21 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Viola Wilson, who was a soprano with the company near the end of Gordon's career, wrote this description in her memoir:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He worshipped Gilbert and this was reflected in his own productions. Although a stickler for tradition, he believed first and foremost in building up an intelligent performance. Short and slight, James Gordon kept a small step ladder [to see over the heads of the chorus] near the prompt corner so he could stand on it, peer through his pince-nez spectacles at us and not miss a single movement. He knew the exact spot where we should stand and no one dared be half an inch out of place. From the stage we could see his luminous pen jotting down notes which he later handed to us. Some of these I still have: "You took three steps too close to Strephon during the duet." "Keep your arms steady during song and sing with more feeling" and so on.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:ColorValue.svg|frame|right|Three [[hue]]s in the [[Munsell color system|Munsell color model]]. Each color differs in value from top to bottom in equal perception steps. The right column undergoes a dramatic change in perceived color.]]

In [[colorimetry]] and [[color theory]], '''lightness''', also known as '''value''' or '''tone''', is a representation of variation in the perception of a [[color]] or [[color space]]'s [[brightness]]. It is one of the [[Color appearance model#Color appearance parameters|color appearance parameters]] of any [[color appearance model]]. 

Various [[color models]] have an explicit term for this property. The [[Munsell color system|Munsell color model]] uses the term ''value'', while the [[HSL and HSV|HSL color model]], [[HCL color space]] and [[Lab color space]] use the term ''lightness''. The [[HSL and HSV|HSV model]] uses the term ''value'' a little differently: a color with a low value is nearly black, but one with a high value is the pure, fully saturated color.

In [[subtractive color]] (i.e. paints) value changes can be achieved by adding black or white to the color. However, this also reduces saturation. [[Chiaroscuro]] and [[Tenebrism]] both take advantage of dramatic contrasts of value to heighten drama in art. Artists may also employ [[shading]], subtle manipulation of value.

==Lightness and human perception==
{{double image|right|srgb-in-cielab.png|197|adobergb-in-cielab.png|197|Fig 2a. The [[sRGB]] gamut mapped in CIELAB space. Notice that the lines pointing to the red, green, and blue primaries are not evenly spaced by hue angle, and are of unequal length. The primaries also have different ''L''* values.|Fig 2b. The [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]] gamut mapped in CIELAB space. Also notice that these two RGB spaces have different gamuts, and thus will have different HSL and HSV representations.}}

While HSL, HSV, and related spaces serve well enough to, for instance, choose a single color, they ignore much of the complexity of color appearance. Essentially, they trade off perceptual relevance for computation speed, from a time in computing history (high-end 1970s graphics workstations, or mid-1990s consumer desktops) when more sophisticated models would have been too computationally expensive.{{refn|group=upper-alpha |Most of the disadvantages below are listed in [[#Poynton|Poynton (1997)]], though as mere statements, without examples.}}

[[HSL and HSV]] are simple transformations of the [[RGB color model]] which preserve symmetries in the RGB cube unrelated to human perception, such that its ''R'', ''G'', and ''B'' corners are equidistant from the neutral axis, and equally spaced around it. If we plot the RGB gamut in a more [[perceptually uniform]] space, such as [[CIELAB]], it becomes immediately clear that the red, green, and blue primaries do not have the same lightness or chroma, or evenly spaced hues. Furthermore, different RGB displays use different primaries, and so have different gamuts. Because HSL and HSV are defined purely with reference to some RGB space, they are not [[absolute color space]]s: to specify a color precisely requires reporting not only HSL or HSV values, but also the characteristics of the RGB space they are based on, including the [[gamma correction]] in use.

If we take an image and extract the hue, saturation, and lightness or value components, and then compare these to the components of the same name as defined by color scientists, we can quickly see the difference, perceptually. For example, examine the following images of a fire breather ({{nobr|fig. 1}}). The original is in the sRGB color space.  CIELAB ''L''* is a CIE-defined achromatic lightness quantity (dependent solely on the perceptually achromatic luminance ''Y'', but not the mixed-chromatic components ''X'' or ''Z'', of the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE XYZ color space]] from which the sRGB color space itself is derived), and it is plain that this appears similar in perceptual lightness to the original color image. Luma is roughly similar, but differs somewhat at high chroma, where it deviates most from depending solely on the true achromatic luminance (''Y'', or equivalently ''L''*) and is influenced by the colorimetric chromaticity (''x,y'', or equivalently, ''a*,b*'' of CIELAB).  HSL ''L'' and HSV ''V'', by contrast, diverge substantially from perceptual lightness.

==Relationship to value and relative luminance==
The [[Munsell_color_system|Munsell value]] has long been used as a [[Color difference#Tolerance|perceptually uniform]] lightness scale. A question of interest is the relationship between the Munsell value scale and the [[relative luminance]]. Aware of the [[Weber–Fechner law]], Munsell remarked "Should we use a logarithmic curve or curve of squares?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The early development of the Munsell system|first=Rolf G.|last=Kuehni|volume=27|issue=1|pages=20–27|doi=10.1002/col.10002|date=February 2002|journal=Color Research &amp; Application}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither option turned out to be quite correct; scientists eventually converged on a roughly cube-root curve, consistent with the [[Stevens' power law]] for brightness perception, reflecting the fact that lightness is proportional to the number of nerve impulses per nerve fiber per unit time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Light Energy and Brightness Sensation|first=Robert W. G.|last=Hunt|date=May 18, 1957|page=1026|volume=179|issue=4568| journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/1791026a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of this section is a chronology of lightness approximations, leading to [[CIE LAB]].

''Note.'' – Munsell's ''V'' runs from 0 to 10, while ''Y'' typically runs from 0 to 100 (often interpreted as a percentage). Typically, the relative luminance is normalized so that the "reference white" (say, [[magnesium oxide]]) has a tristimulus value of {{nowrap|1=''Y'' = 100}}. Since the reflectance of magnesium oxide (MgO) relative to the [[diffuser (optics)#Perfect reflecting diffuser|perfect reflecting diffuser]] is 97.5%, {{nowrap|1=''V'' = 10}} corresponds to {{nowrap|1=''Y'' = 100/97.5% ≈ 102.6}} if MgO is used as the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNDS1C6x0WYC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=0.975+OR+97.5+%22magnesium+oxide%22|title=Light Vision Color|first=Arne|last=Valberg|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2006|isbn=0470849029|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lightness approximations.svg|thumb|right|500px|Observe that the lightness is 50% for a relative luminance of around 18% relative to the reference white.]]

; 1920: Priest ''et al.'' provide a basic estimate of the Munsell value (with ''Y'' running from 0 to 1 in this case):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Irwin G.|last=Priest|last2=Gibson|first2=K.S.|last3=McNicholas|first3=H.J.|title=An examination of the Munsell color system.

They suggest a quintic parabola (relating the reflectance in terms of the value):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1943|title=Final report of the O.S.A. subcommittee on the spacing of the Munsell colors|volume=33|issue=7|pages=385–418|last=Newhall|first=Sidney M.|author2=Nickerson, Dorothy |author3=Judd, Deane B | url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-33-7-385|doi=10.1364/JOSA.33.000385|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; 1943: Using Table II of the O.S.A. report, Moon and Spencer express the value in terms of the relative luminance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[JOSA]]|title=Metric based on the composite color stimulus|first=Parry|last=Moon|author2=Spencer, Domina Eberle |volume=33|issue=5|date=May 1943|pages=270–277|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-33-5-270|doi=10.1364/JOSA.33.000270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;V = 2.217 Y^{0.352} - 1.324.&lt;/math&gt;
: Realizing this is quite close to the cube root, they simplify it to:
::&lt;math&gt;V = 2.468 Y^{1/3} - 1.636.&lt;/math&gt;

; 1958: Glasser ''et al.'' define the lightness as ten times the Munsell value (so that the lightness ranges from 0 to 100):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cube-root color coordinate system|first=L.G.|last=Glasser |author2=A.H.

:: &lt;math&gt;L^\star = 25.29 Y^{1/3} - 18.38.&lt;/math&gt;

; 1964: Wyszecki simplifies this to:&lt;ref name=gunter&gt;{{cite journal|first=Günther|last=Wyszecki|title=Proposal for a New Color-Difference Formula|pages=1318–1319|date=November 1963|volume=53|journal=[[JOSA]]| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-53-11-1314|doi=10.1364/JOSA.53.001318|issue=11}} ''Note:'' The asterisks are not used in the paper.&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;W^\star = 25 Y^{1/3} - 17.&lt;/math&gt;
: This formula approximates the Munsell value function for {{nowrap|1% &lt; ''Y'' &lt; 98%}} (it is not applicable for {{nowrap|''Y'' &lt; 1%}}) and is used for the [[CIE 1964 color space]].

; 1976: [[CIE LAB]] uses the following formula:
:: &lt;math&gt;L^\star = 116(Y/Y_\mathrm{n})^{1/3} - 16.&lt;/math&gt;
: where ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[CIE XYZ]] ''Y'' tristimulus value of the reference [[white point]] (the subscript n suggests "normalized") and is subject to the restriction {{nowrap|''Y''/''Y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0.01}}. Pauli removes this restriction by computing a [[linear extrapolation]] which maps {{nowrap|1=''Y''/''Y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} to {{nowrap|1=''L''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}} and is tangent to the formula above at the point at which the linear extension takes effect. First, the transition point is determined to be {{nowrap|1=''Y''/''Y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (6/29)^3 ≈ 0.008,856}}, then the slope of {{nowrap|(29/3)^3 ≈ 903.3}} is computed. This gives the two-part function:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Hartmut K.A.|last=Pauli|title=Proposed extension of the CIE recommendation on "Uniform color spaces, color spaces, and color-difference equations, and metric color terms"|journal=[[JOSA]]|volume=66|issue=8|pages=866–867|year=1976| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-66-8-866|doi=10.1364/JOSA.66.000866}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;f(t) = \begin{cases}
    t^{1/3} &amp; \text{if } t &gt; \big(\frac{6}{29}\big)^3 \\
    \frac{1}{3}\big(\frac{29}{6}\big)^2 t + \frac{4}{29} &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
: The lightness is then:
:: &lt;math&gt;L^\star = 116 f(Y/Y_\mathrm{n}) - 16.&lt;/math&gt;

At first glance, you might approximate the lightness function by a cube root, an approximation that is found in much of the technical literature. However, the linear segment near black is significant, and so the 116 and 16 coefficients. The best-fit pure power function has an exponent of about 0.42, far from 1/3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles|last=Poynton|first2=Brian|last2=Funt|title=Perceptual uniformity in digital image representation and display|journal=Color Research and Application|volume=39|issue=1|pages=6–15|date=Feb 2014|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/col.21768|doi=10.1002/col.21768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An approximately 18% grey card, having an exact reflectance of &lt;math&gt;\left(33/58\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;, has a lightness value of 50. It is called "mid grey" because its lightness is midway between black and white.

==Other psychological effects==
This subjective perception of luminance in a non-linear fashion is one thing that makes [[Gamma correction|gamma compression]] of images worthwhile. Beside this phenomenon there are other effects involving perception of lightness. Chromacity can affect perceived lightness as described by the [[Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect]]. Though the CIE LAB space and relatives do not account for this effect on lightness, it may be implied in the Munsell color model. 
Light levels may also affect perceived chromacity, as with the [[Purkinje effect]].

'''The London Sketch Club''' was founded by members of the Langham Sketching Club on 1 April 1898 as a social club for artists working in the field of commercial graphic art, mainly for newspapers, periodicals and books.  The founder members were [[Dudley Hardy]], [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]], Walter Fowler, [[Lance Thackeray]], [[Cecil Aldin]], W Sanders Fiske, Walter Churcher, [[Tom Browne (illustrator)|Tom Browne]], [[George Charles Haité]], its first president, and [[Frederick Hamilton Jackson]], its first Honorary Secretary. By 1903, it had established itself in permanent premises in Wells Street. However, the club relocated to 7 Dilke Street in 1957. Members still meet each other there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/london-sketch-club|title=London Sketch Club {{!}} Artist Biographies|website=www.artbiogs.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léonce Rosenberg''' (12 September 1879 in [[Paris]] – 31 July 1947 in Neuilly-sur Seine) was an art historian, art collector, publisher and one of the most influential [[France|French]] [[art dealer]]s of the 20th century. The son of an antique dealer Alexander Rosenberg and brother of the gallery owner [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]] (21 rue de la Boétie, Paris), Léonce, a prominent gallery owner in [[Paris]] at the end of [[World War I]], would become one of the world's major dealers of [[Modern art]].

Leaving the family-owned gallery in 1910 Léonce opened his own business called ''Haute Epoque'' at 19 rue de La Baume, Paris. As an antiquarian Rosenberg began buying works by [[Cubist]] artists. By 1914 his collection included works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Auguste Herbin]], and [[Juan Gris]]. After serving in World War I (1916-1917) he pursued his interests and represented these and other artists, and by the end of the war opened a new show space, [[:fr:Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/Rosenbergf Léonce Rosenberg Papers, Correspondence Relating to Cubism in The Museum of Modern Art Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Léonce Rosenberg studied in London and Antwerp visiting galleries and museums in his free time.  After returning to Paris he worked with his brother Paul in the family business. In 1906 Léonce  and his brother inherited the family gallery on [[Avenue de l'Opéra]] which had been in existence for twenty years. His brother Paul was largely engaged in 19th- and early 20th-century art.

Léonce Rosenberg was an early advocate of [[Cubism]], and would remain so throughout the 1920s and 1930s. He discovered the works of [[avant-garde]] artists in 1911 through the [[Salon des Indépendants]], the art dealer [[Wilhelm Uhde]], and in 1912 at the gallery of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]].

[[File:Jean Metzinger, invitation card, Léonce Rosenberg, Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, January 1919.jpg|thumb|230px|Jean Metzinger, invitation card for the exhibition at Léonce Rosenberg's [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]], January 1919]]
At the outset of [[World War I]] many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state. As a German citizen Kahnweiler took refuge in Switzerland and ran out of funds. With his art collection the hand of the French government he could no longer support his artists. Following the advice of [[Max Jacob]] and André Level (known for his well informed art investments), Léonce Rosenberg began amassing his collection. Just before the outbreak of [[World War I]] Rosenberg purchased 15 Cubist works by Picasso for 12,000 FF. His collection would soon include 20 works by Picasso, 10 by [[Georges Braque]], 5 by [[Juan Gris]] and 20 by [[Auguste Herbin]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme 1"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kb107.html Léonce Rosenberg, Kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franck"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3hYBzRzZ0kcC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=%22André+Level%22,+Léonce+rosenberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_yT8iKJ_Fs&amp;sig=GKItuWScGloX_J8EFbwl5nLY4es&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4Ym0UejSH-rZ0QWR9IHICw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22André%20Level%22%2C%20Léonce%20rosenberg&amp;f=false Dan Franck, ''Bohemian Paris: Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse, and the Birth of Modern Art'', Grove Press, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Very quickly and despite his lack of experience Rosenberg became the official dealer of the Cubists purchasing works, in addition to those he already owned, by artist such as [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Henry Laurens]], [[Georges Valmier]] and [[:fr:Henri Hayden|Henri Hayden]]. Throughout [[World War I]] Rosenberg served as a moral and financial supporter of these artists. 'Without him' noted Max Jacob, 'a number of painters would be drivers or factory workers'.&lt;ref name="Franck" /&gt;

Picasso eventually switched over to his brother Paul Rosenberg's gallery, who would become his dealer [[Interwar period|Entre Deux Guerres]].

Rosenberg volunteered for military service in 1915. He moved into a house at rue Marthe Édouard in Meudon near the military base, but also retained his Paris apartment at 22 rue Lavoisier and his [[Hôtel particulier]] 19 Rue de la Baume in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]]. During his periods of leave he continued to purchase Cubist works. From May, 1916, Rosenberg worked outside his unit as an English interpreter at the field headquarters of the Allied forces on the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] front. During leave at the end of 1916 Rosenberg, through the intermediary of [[Juan Gris]], went to [[Gino Severini]]'s studio and bought a large painting of Woman Reading; possibly Severini's 1916 ''Femme lisant (Jeanne dans l’atelier; La lecture n. 1)''. The death of [[Umberto Boccioni]] during the month of August 1916 marked Severini's rupture from [[Futurism]] and his move closer to the Cubists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fileadmin/mediatheque/integration_MO/PDF/DP/DP_Severini.pdf ''Gino Severini, Futuriste et néoclassique'', Musée d'Orsay, Musée de l'Orangerie – Jardin des Tuileries, exhibition catalogue, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galerie de L'Effort Moderne==

In March 1917, the second line of defense cleared Rosenberg's unit moved to [[Le Havre]]. In July of the same year Rosenberg returned to his old unit, now stationed at an airport in [[Nanterre]]. Closer to Paris, Rosenberg decided to reopen his gallery.&lt;ref name="Kubisme 1" /&gt;

With the support given by Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism reemerged as a central issue for artists after four years of war. Rosenberg found himself financially ruined but exhibited the works he owned at his newly opened Galerie de L'Effort Moderne (also known as ''Galerie Léonce Rosenberg'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/ressource.action?param.id=FR_R-cc931e156ad49248e214b3533147d3f5&amp;param.idSource=FR_CF-cc931e156ad49248e214b3533147d3f5 Galerie Léonce Rosenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; at 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and fashionable 8th arrondissement of Paris. The gallery was open to all forms of [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[Abstract art]]. What followed would be a series of major [[Solo show (art exhibition)|one-man]] exhibitions—including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

The first solo exhibition was held in March 1918, featuring works by [[Auguste Herbin]].&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/research/leonard-lauder-research-center/programs-and-resources/index-of-cubist-art-collectors/effort-moderne Effort Moderne, Galerie L, Paris], Index of Historic Collectors and Dealers of Cubism, 1918-1941, Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year, Rosenberg launched a series of Cubist exhibitions, beginning with [[Henri Laurens]], followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Fernand Léger]] in February, [[Georges Braque]] in March, [[Juan Gris]] April, [[Gino Severini]] May, and [[Pablo Picasso]] in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive, despite claims by critics to the contrary,&lt;ref name="Gris"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=correspondence+Juan+Gris,+Maurice+Raynal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=omG4wHCpDC&amp;sig=jyC3HCXNGm4X7vTF98ybQOyk3Wc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeprVfHJBMz9Ur-NgLAI&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=correspondence%20Juan%20Gris%2C%20Maurice%20Raynal&amp;f=false Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin von Maur, Whitechapel Art Gallery, ''Juan Gris: Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September -29 November 1992: Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 18 December 1992 - 14 February 1993: Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993'', Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 6, 22-60]&lt;/ref&gt; and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Albert Gleizes]] most obviously. Nonetheless, according to art historian Christopher Green, "this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its "new collective form" marked by "intellectual rigor". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Rosenberg also organized literary and musical events in his gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.metmuseum.org/search~S1/?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=leonce+rosenberg&amp;searchscope=1&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xpaul+rosenberg Thomas J. Watson Library, The Catalog of the Libraries of The Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

The art collections of Kahnweiler and Uhde sequestered at the outset of World War I (which included works by Georges Braque, [[Raoul Dufy]], Juan Gris, Auguste Herbin, [[Marie Laurencin]], Fernand Léger, Jean Metzinger, Pablo Picasso, [[Jean Puy]] and [[Henri Rousseau]]) were sold by the government in a series of auctions at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll18/id/5199/rec/6 The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries, ''Vente de biens allemands ayant fait l'objet d'une mesure de Séquestre de Guerre'': Collection Uhde.

From 1924 to 1927, Rosenberg made his activities known through his ''Bulletin de l'Effort moderne'' (Éditions de l'effort moderne), a publication featuring writings and illustrations by contributors such as Léonce Rosenberg, Albert Gleizes, Piet Mondrian, Gino Severini.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Bulletin_de_L_effort_Moderne.html?id=yTtDPgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Bulletin de l'Effort moderne', Léonce Rosenberg, Albert Gleizes, Piet Mondrian, Gino Severini]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 Rosenberg moved his personal collection to his apartment rue de Longchamp, Paris, and commissioned the artists he championed to realize decorative panels. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] painted large panels for his living room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesdiagonalesdutemps.com/article-de-l-homo-erotisme-chez-chirico-83382018.html Salon de Léonce Rosenberg, the gladiator series]&lt;/ref&gt; After 1928 exhibitions became sporadic, featuring solo exhibitions by de Chirico, Metzinger, and Valmier.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

Rosenberg commissioned [[Albert Gleizes]] (replacing [[Gino Severini]]) in 1929 to paint decorative panels for his Parisian residence. They were installed in 1931.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881–1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 and 1932, the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne presented two large exhibitions of works by [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

A veritable center of activity and interest during the rise of [[modern art]], the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne closed permanently in 1941, as a result of anti-Semitic laws and by the threat of the Nazi occupation of France. Eventually, the Nazi authorities looted some of his collection.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt; The gallery was not reopened following the war due primarily to Rosenberg’s death in July 1947.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

The''''' Madonna and Child with Three Angels''''' (also known as ''Madonna del Padiglione'') is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Sandro Botticelli]], executed in 1493. It is housed in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] of [[Milan]].

The Virgin Mary is portrayed holding a book to her breast and gesturing to the Child, the latter being supported by an angel. The Italian name (''[[:wiktionary|padiglione]]'' meaning "pavilion") derives from the rich baldachin over the scene. There is an open book on a small prie-dieu between the Virgin and Child. Angels are pulling back the drapery of the pavilion. Together, the books and the open drapery signify the revelation that Old Testament prophecy has been fulfilled in the birth of the Christ Child to the Virgin.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Might Is Right''''', or '''''The Survival of the Fittest''''', is a book by pseudonymous author Ragnar Redbeard. First published in 1890, it heavily advocates [[egoist anarchism]], [[amorality]], [[consequentialism]] and [[psychological hedonism]]. In ''Might Is Right'', Redbeard rejects conventional ideas of [[human rights|human]] and [[natural rights]] and argues that only strength or physical might can establish moral right (à la [[Callicles]] or [[Thrasymachus]]). The book also attacks [[Christianity]] and [[Democracy]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s theories of [[master–slave morality]] and [[herd mentality]] serve as a clear inspiration for Redbeard's book written contemporaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Mathews|title=Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQrbsOWaOyUC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=May 16, 2017|year=2009|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-36639-0|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Individualist anarchism|Individualist Anarchist]] historian [[James J. Martin]] called it "surely one of the most incendiary works ever to be published anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818145227/http://www.nonserviam.com/egoistarchive/SidParker/Parker_Ego_06.htm |date=August 18, 2010 |title=EGO No 6 1985 Twenty Five Pence, }} archived from [https://web.archive.org/web/20020812061611/http://www.nonserviam.com:80/egoistarchive/SidParker/Parker_Ego_06.htm the original]&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the controversial content such as the viewpoint that weakness should be regarded with hatred and the strong and forceful presence of [[Social Darwinism]] in the text. There are also controversial parts of the book that deal with race and male–female relations, claiming that the woman and the family as a whole is the property of the man and proclaiming the innate superiority of the [[English people|Anglo-Saxon]] race. The book also contains many strongly [[anti-Semitic]] statements. 

Some have suspected that the work is at least partly intended to be a satire of Social Darwinism. It has also been characterised as "proto-fascist white power manifesto".&lt;ref&gt;Mathews 2009, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authorship ==
[[S. E. Parker]] writes in his introduction to the text: "The most likely candidate is a man named [[Arthur Desmond]] who was red-bearded, red-haired and whose poetry was very similar to that written by Redbeard."&lt;ref name="parker"&gt;[[S. E. Parker]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120143427/http://www.churchofsatan.org/might.pdf Introduction to ''Might is Right'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of Satan]] founder [[Anton LaVey]] and white supremacist publisher Katja Lane (wife of [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] member [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]]) both believed noted novelist [[Jack London]] was substantially involved, if not the author of the entire book; the latter based her judgment on London's distinctive grammar and punctuation.&lt;ref name=jacobs&gt;[http://london.sonoma.edu/Bibliographies/redbeard.html RUNNING WITH THE WOLVES: JACK LONDON, THE CULT OF MASCULINITY, AND "MIGHT IS RIGHT"], Rodger Jacobs, Jack London Online Collection, Sonoma U&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HioKA46blE8C&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;ots=UvgQ6nsieW&amp;dq=%22might%20is%20right%22%20author%20jack%20london&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22might%20is%20right%22%20author%20jack%20london&amp;f=false "Foreward" (sic)] by Anton LaVey, to ''Might is Right'', pub. Shane Bugbee (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jack London scholar Rodger Jacobs said, "the notion is as ludicrous as suggesting that the author of 'White Fang' was a cross-dressing hermaphrodite who buried his sexual shame in manly exploits".&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt; London was born in 1876, so he would have written the book in his early teens by the time it was first published in 1890.

Ambrose Bierce, the American born author of the Devil's Dictionary has also been suggested to have written Might Is Right.

==Response==
[[Leo Tolstoy]], whom ''Might Is Right'' described as "the ablest modern expounder of primitive Christliness", responded in his 1897 essay ''[[What Is Art?]]'':

{{quote|The substance of this book, as it is expressed in the editor's preface, is that to measure "right" by the false philosophy of the [[Nevi'im|Hebrew prophets]] and "weepful" [[Messiah]]s is madness. Right is not the offspring of doctrine, but of power.  All laws, commandments, or doctrines as to not doing to another what you do not wish done to you, have no inherent authority whatever, but receive it only from the [[Club (weapon)|club]], the [[gallows]], and the [[sword]]. A man truly free is under no obligation to obey any injunction, human or divine. Obedience is the sign of the [[wikt:degenerate|degenerate]]. Disobedience is the stamp of the hero.

Expressed in the form of a doctrine these positions startle us. In reality they are implied in the ideal of art serving beauty. The art of our upper classes has educated people in this ideal of the over-man, --- which is in reality the old ideal of [[Nero]], [[Stenka Razin]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Robert Macaire]] or [[Napoleon]] and all their accomplices, assistants, and adulators --- and it supports this ideal with all its might.

It is this supplanting of the ideal of what is right by the ideal of what is beautiful, i.e. of what is pleasant, that is the fourth consequence, and a terrible one, of the perversion of art in our society. It is fearful to think of what would befall humanity were such art to spread among the masses of the people. And it already begins to spread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=tolstoy%20redbeard&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q=fittest&amp;f=false What is art?] Leo Tolstoy&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[S. E. Parker]] wrote: "''Might Is Right'' is a work flawed by major contradictions." He particularly criticised the inconsistency of the book's central dogma of [[individualism]] with its open sexism and racism. However, he concluded that "it is sustained by a crude vigor that at its most coherent can help to clear away not a few of the religious, moral and political superstitions bequeathed to us by our ancestors."&lt;ref name="parker"/&gt;

==Influence==
Portions of ''Might Is Right'' comprise the vast majority of ''The Book of Satan'' in [[Anton LaVey]]'s ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', the founding document of the [[Church of Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Eugene V.|authorlink=Eugene V.

Petersen|chapter=Sources, Sects, and Scripture: The Book of Satan in The Satanic Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is no longer included in current printings of ''The Satanic Bible'', early printings included an extensive dedication to various people whom LaVey recognized as influences, including Ragnar Redbeard.&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton Szandor (1969).

'''''Mirth &amp; Girth''''' is a portrait painting by [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC) student David K. Nelson, Jr., depicting the recently deceased, popular African-American mayor of [[Chicago]], [[Harold Washington]] wearing only a bra, [[G-string]], garter belt and stockings.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880514"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD4093DE240&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Controversial painting reported damaged |author1=Hanania, Mark  |author2=Padgett, Tim  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 14, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief showing at a May 11, 1988 private student exhibition in the Art Institute, angry African-American [[Chicago City Council|aldermen]], including Ald. [[Allan Streeter]],  Ald. [[Bobby Rush]] and Ald. [[Dorothy Tillman]],  arrived with [[Chicago Police Department]] officers and confiscated the painting, triggering a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and race relations crisis and a civil lawsuit.

[[Freedom of speech|Free-speech]] advocates condemned the seizure of the painting, while the aldermen maintained that the painting was an insult to Washington and should have been taken down. Some students at the SAIC showed their support for free speech by holding rallies in front of the school and at the [[Richard J. Daley Plaza]], while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing in showing a racially insensitive image.

At some point between when the painting was confiscated and when it was returned, a {{convert|5|in|cm|0|adj=on}} gash was made on the canvas. Nelson filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting's confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. He and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) settled with the city for $95,000 (1994; {{Inflation|US|95000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) in compensation for the damaged painting after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] upheld the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois|lower court's]] decision.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Harold Washington, the subject of the portrait, was elected in 1965 to the [[Illinois House of Representatives]]. After the death of [[Richard J. Daley]] in late 1976, Washington won Chicago's 1983 Democratic mayoral primary election. He was elected mayor, prevailing over [[Bernard Epton]] in a racially polarizing general election.&lt;ref name=levinsohn&gt;{{cite book |title=Harold Washington: A Political Biography |last=Hamlish Levinsohn |first=Florence |year=1983 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location=Chicago |pages=265–266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first four-year term was characterized by the [[Council Wars]], a period of political conflict with the mostly white aldermanic majority in [[Chicago City Council|City Council]].&lt;ref name="rivlin_209-210"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire on the Prairie: Chicago's Harold Washington and the Politics of Race |author=Rivlin, Gary |year=1992 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-1468-3 |pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven Washington-backed aldermanic challengers prevailed in the April, 1986 special municipal election, facilitating progress with Washington's agenda.

=== Creation of painting ===
Shortly after Washington's death, Nelson (who is white)&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D6153EF930A25756C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |title=Chicago aldermen and police seize portrait that blacks deem offensive |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |author=Schmidt, William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; painted ''Mirth &amp; Girth'', a "full-length frontal portrait of a portly grim-faced Harold Washington clad in a white bra and G-string, garter belt, and stockings".&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt; The painting was approximately {{convert|4|ft|cm|0}} tall by {{convert|3|ft|cm|0}} wide.&lt;ref name="brenson_19880529"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DA1F38F93AA15756C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=A savage painting raises troubling questions |author=Brenson, Michael |date=May 29, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the portrait, Washington is holding a pencil in his right hand.

In an interview with the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Nelson stated that he had painted ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' over the course of one night, standing in his underwear. He said that he had painted it in response to how the city populace revered Washington shortly after his death. Nelson stated, "(i)n Chicago, at this time, Harold Washington is like an icon. He's like a deity." In particular, Nelson painted the portrait after seeing prints of "Worry Ye Not", another poster that depicted a smiling Washington with a blue-robe adorned [[Jesus Christ]], looking down on the Chicago skyline.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD3D90C4278&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Art Institute surrenders&amp;nbsp;— Will bar controversial painting of Washington |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=January 27, 1988 |author1=Hanania, Ray  |author2=Cronin, Barry  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Sun Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D9163AF934A25751C0A96F948260 |title=The Editorial Notebook; Chicago Seeks a Winning Coalition |author=Wycliff, Don |work=The New York Times |date=February 17, 1989 |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson later testified that he had based the iconoclastic elements of the painting on a rumor that doctors at [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] had discovered female underwear beneath the suit Washington was wearing at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;[http://www.projectposner.org/case/1994/16F3d145 Nelson v.

The caricature was not Nelson's first. He had drawn a portrait of his mother as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]'' for Mother's Day. Nelson had also drawn a caricature of his father as the model depicted on boxes of [[Cream of Wheat]].  Nelson explained, "(t)his kind of irreverence and iconoclasm runs through all my artwork". In an April Fools' Day edition of a ''[[Weekly World News]]'' parody produced by Nelson, he illustrated SAIC president Edward Jones as an infant in the arms of a bare-breasted [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DF07B02FACEB&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Schlesinger, Toni |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 22, 1998 |accessdate=2008-01-26 |title=The mayoral painter's 15 minutes of fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Display and confiscation ==

=== Initial display ===
On May 11, 1988, ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' was displayed at a private exhibition in one of the school's main interior hallways. The painting was part of a set of six that Nelson was displaying in a judged three-day student fellowship exhibition held to showcase upcoming graduates. Another of his works was a self-portrait titled "I'm Sensitive, and I Love All Humanity", depicting Nelson holding little people of multiple nationalities.&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; As soon as the exhibit opened, between 7:30 and 8:30 am, the painting drew enough negative attention for the Art Institute to post a security guard in front of the painting. Shortly thereafter, the school began to receive angry phone calls about the painting.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Soon after the exhibit opened, word of the controversy reached the [[Chicago City Council]], which was in session. Alderman [[Bobby Rush]] (then of the 2nd ward)&lt;ref name="siewers_19880512"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD390636B54&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |author1=Siewers, Alf  |author2=Hanania, Ray  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 12, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-02 |title=Controversial painting leads to brush with law}}&lt;/ref&gt; immediately put together a resolution that would cut off the city's contribution to the Art Institute unless it apologized for displaying the painting. In part, the resolution read "Whereas, the artist David Nelson obviously exhibits some type of demented and pathological mental capacities&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; Another resolution was written that asked the Art Institute to remove the painting immediately. After passing both items, a group of aldermen left to deliver the resolutions to the Art Institute.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Nelson returned to the painting about an hour after it was first displayed. He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang the painting, and had left it leaning against the wall for an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt;

=== Confiscation ===
Aldermen [[Edward Jones (Illinois politician)|Edward Jones]] (20th) and [[William C. Henry]] (24th) were the first aldermen to arrive from the City Council session. According to the federal lawsuit, Henry showed he had a gun, and then with Jones removed the now-hung painting from the wall and placed it on the floor, facing the wall. After they left, another student rehung the painting. Three other aldermen, [[Allan Streeter]] (17th), [[Dorothy Tillman]] (3rd) and Rush, arrived later. They took down the painting and attempted to remove it from the school, but were stopped by a school official. The aldermen then took the painting to the office of the school president Anthony Jones (no relation to Edward Jones). The painting had a {{convert|5|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} gash,&lt;ref name="hanania_19880514" /&gt; and it had been wrapped in brown paper.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Alderman Tillman threatened to burn the painting in President Jones' office, but a [[Chicago Police Department]] (CPD) lieutenant present with the aldermen, Lt. Raymond Patterson, advised against this. Instead, another unnamed alderman called CPD [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] Leroy Martin. Martin telephoned Patterson in Jones' office and ordered Patterson to take the painting into police custody, telling Jones that the painting amounted to "incitement to riot". Patterson overrode this direct order, citing his own powers as the lieutenant on the scene and hung up on Martin. A CPD sergeant accompanied Rush, Streeter and Tillman to a waiting police car with the wrapped painting in hand. Parts of the incident were later broadcast on television.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB4261ADA2A3328&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Paying the bill for a tantrum |author=Chicago Tribune Editorial Board |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 28, 1994 |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimmins_19880512"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEB5A2DBA8BD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Student's painting causes stir |author1=Crimmins, Jerry  |author2=Davis, Robert  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 12, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident was marked by a volatile shouting match between the aldermen and students, and met with condemnation from free-speech advocates. As the aldermen escorted the painting to the police vehicle, a mass of students outside of the Art Institute jeered them, naming the aldermen "commies", "fascists", "[[brownshirt]]s" and "[[Philistinism|philistines]]".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; Seventeen bomb threats were recorded at the school after the controversy erupted.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt;

== Responses ==

=== African-American community ===
Shortly after the incident, a black alderman told reporters that he believed the painting was the work of a Jewish artist. Nelson replied through a ''Chicago Tribune'' story that he "is not Jewish".&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; The remark was made in part because racial tensions had already been elevated a week earlier after the firing of [[Steve Cokely]], a mayoral aide, by African-American mayor and Harold Washington's successor [[Eugene Sawyer]]. Cokely had accused Jews of "engaging in an international conspiracy for world control". His firing caused a rift in segments of the black community, leading some to believe that Sawyer was also involved in the same conspiracy.&lt;ref name="lipinski_19880506"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DE8B553106E6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Sawyer fires Cokeley as aide&amp;nbsp;— somber mayor asks city to look beyond controversy |date=May 6, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=[[Ann Marie Lipinski]] and Baquet, Dean.

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' article published on May 13, 1988, Alderman Streeter reiterated his stance regarding the removal of the painting, saying that he would have "gone to jail to get that painting down", calling it "an insult to a great man and an affront to blacks".&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513"/&gt; On May 16, 1988, Streeter appeared on [[WTTW|the local public television station]] news program ''[[Chicago Tonight]]''.

On May 12, 1988, representatives from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) picked up the painting and returned it to Nelson. Jay Miller, another representative for the ACLU, described the incident as "vigilante stuff", noting that the action "was done in the name of one of the great civil libertarians of our time. Harold Washington had a 100&amp;nbsp;percent voting record in Congress and in the state Legislature on issues of civil liberties and civil rights."&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; In 1984 Washington had supported the civil rights of sculptor John Sefick after Sefick had created a satirical statue of Washington.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; By comparison, former mayor [[Michael Bilandic]] had ordered a Sefick statue satirizing his handling of Chicago's crippling [[Chicago Blizzard of 1979|Blizzard of 1979]] covered by a blanket, a decision that was later overturned in federal court.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880502"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DE6EE0F3AE64&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Sculptor carves governor's likeness with a barb |author=Kendall, Peter |date=May 2, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from the SAIC protested on [[Columbus Drive (Chicago)|Columbus Drive]] the next day, holding signs that asked drivers to "honk for free speech".

On ''Chicago Tonight'', Daniel Polsby, a law professor at [[Northwestern University]], cited federal statutes violated during the confiscation of the portrait. He then faulted Marshall Field's reluctance to defend the First Amendment, further comparing the seizure of ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' to then-Arkansas governor [[Orval Faubus]]' refusal to abide by the First Amendment and allow minorities to enroll in [[Little Rock Central High School]]. According to Polsby, Faubus' rationale at the time was to preserve a delicate civil rights situation. Polsby called the aldermen's action "crushingly ironic and terribly sad".&lt;ref name="suntimes_chicago_tonight" /&gt;

=== Reactions within the SAIC ===
At the SAIC, students' characterizations of the painting ranged from political caricature, to "whimsy", to a commercial success. One student noted that Nelson was "known nationally now, which is every artist's dream". Another student noted that "(a)rtists have to be responsible for what they make, and this guy is not being responsible". In a meeting with 100&amp;nbsp;students after the incident, Anthony Jones, then-president of the SAIC, assured the students that he stood behind their First Amendment rights. Regarding the painting, Jones said that the painting was in poor taste and should not have been displayed.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513" /&gt;

Members of the Art Institute Board met the day after the incident and agreed not to display ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' any further. Chairman Marshall Field also issued a formal apology for displaying the painting and agreed to consider demands that the school both hire more black administrators and accept more black students. Field also published the apology in each of the city's daily metropolitan newspapers.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; After the apology was issued, Polsby strongly criticized Field's refusal to more aggressively stand up for the students' First Amendment rights.&lt;ref name="suntimes_chicago_tonight" /&gt;

=== Other reactions ===
Members of the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago, which included leaders from mainline Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish organizations from the city, issued a statement that expressed "moral dismay" over the painting. They further added that the display of the painting showed "a lack of sensitivity which we could have expected from those who were responsible for its showing".&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513" /&gt;

As for the painting's critical reception, one local art reviewer mentioned that "the only thing [the SAIC] might have felt sheepish about was not having a staff that in four years could instill in Nelson a better grasp of figure painting".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; In a newspaper interview, Nelson responded that the criticism was "the one thing that did make me kind of angry. I don't think the painting was poorly executed, though it wasn't my favorite painting."&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; In his book ''Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions'', Stephen C. Dubin suggested that the painting represented a symbolic castration of Washington, reflecting more "traditional" reactions to African-Americans in positions of power.&lt;ref name="dubin_36"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven C. | title = Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = Routledge, Chapman, and Hall Inc.  | year = 1992 | location = New York, NY U.S.A. | pages = 36 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson gave only a few interviews before leaving Chicago for the suburbs, and then [[Graceland]] to avoid the press.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; On the advice of his friends, Nelson stayed away from his graduation ceremony on May 14, 1988.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880515" /&gt; He turned down a $15,000 (1988, $22,000 in 2008) offer for the painting, calling it a "grossly inflated" price. He also turned down a separate opportunity to appear on [[Phil Donahue]]'s syndicated talk show, saying that he never watched the show and was genuinely uninterested in the offer.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; Other than the interview with WLUP, Nelson's views were expressed by Harvey Grossman, the legal director for the ACLU. Through Grossman, Nelson said he would not press for the returning of the painting, as it had fulfilled its purpose of "drawing attention to his '[[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]' work".&lt;ref name="davis_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEBF1E8DADB6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Politics takes its place in the world of art |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |author=Davis, Robert and [[Ann Marie Lipinski]].

== ''Nelson v. Streeter'' ==
On June 23, 1988, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Nelson against the three aldermen who were seen on television handling the painting.&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DE207421D41&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=Pitt, Leon |date=June 24, 1988 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |title=Suit hits seizure of Washington painting}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed the removal of the painting violated Nelson's First Amendment right to freedom of expression, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] right to protection from unreasonable seizures, and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendment]] right against being deprived of property without a hearing. The ACLU sought $100,000 (1988, {{Inflation|US|100000|1988|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) to compensate Nelson for damage to the painting, and to "punish" the aldermen and police for their actions.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624" /&gt;

Ald. Robert Shaw (9th) called the suit "a slap in the face to the black community". Rush questioned the motive of the suit, as himself, Tillman and Streeter all were supporters of Alderman [[Timothy C. Evans]] (17th), a political rival of mayor Eugene Sawyer. Rush specifically called the suit "frivolous" and "impetuous", openly questioning whether the ACLU had filed the suit to enhance fundraising activities or for other political reasons.&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624" /&gt;

The City of Chicago refused in February 1990 to pay mounting legal costs for the aldermen. The aldermen argued that they were performing their official duties "in protecting the security of the city during the turmoil created by the exhibit" when they removed the painting. The city contended that the aldermen had taken the action as individuals.&lt;ref name="strong_19900210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF82825B81D1A52&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Aldermen ask city: Pay our art flap costs |author=Strong, James |work=Chicago Tribune |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson refused a $10,000 (1990, {{Inflation|US|10000|1990|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) settlement at the time.&lt;ref name="hanania_19900210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB372CC0FC12A41&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Aldermen sued in art tiff want city to pay lawyer |work=Chicago Sun-Times |author=Hanania, Ray |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 1992, U.S. District Judge George Lindberg dismissed the City of Chicago from the lawsuit, but ruled that Superintendent Martin must go to trial and that the three aldermen violated Nelson's civil rights. Lindberg supported the recommendations regarding that issue [[United States magistrate judge|Magistrate Judge]] Elaine Bucklo's had made in March&amp;nbsp;1992. Tillman's lawyer, James Chapman, recommended to Tillman that an immediate appeal be filed in federal court.&lt;ref name="oconnor_19920811"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FFEE336AB06BEAD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Judge rules for artist in '88 case |date=August 11, 1992 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |author=O'Connor, Matt.

{{Quote box
| quote  = So we must ask whether in 1988 the law was clear that local government officials may not go onto private property without invitation (the aldermen had not been invited to the exhibition of student work), seize a painting that they do not like because it vilifies a public official with whom they had been associated, and wrap it in brown paper and remove it so that no one can see it. To ask the question is pretty much to answer it. As Chief Justice Warren said in another case involving an effort to suppress public criticism of a mayor of Chicago, "This is a simple case."

=== Appellate court ===
In the appeal, decided February 1, 1994, judges [[Richard Posner]], [[Frank H. Easterbrook]], and [[Michael Stephen Kanne]] affirmed Lindberg's earlier decision. Writing for the court, Posner rejected claims of official immunity and said city officials had no right to enter private property and take "offensive" paintings off its walls.&lt;ref name="ncac"&gt;[http://www.ncac.org/art-law/op-nel.cfm Nelson v. Streeter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515225219/http://ncac.org/art-law/op-nel.cfm |date=2008-05-15 }}, [[Case citation#Lower federal courts|16 F.3d 145]] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Cir.]] 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the argument that removing paintings from walls was an official duty.&lt;ref name=posner/&gt;

Posner also rejected the argument that the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, and that there was no mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.&lt;ref name=posner/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncac" /&gt;

The appellate court also faulted the district judge for allowing "more than a year and a half elapsed before the filing and disposition of the motions for summary judgment". Posner noted in his opinion that "the governing principles are clear, the facts have been explored exhaustively, and the defendants should be aware that efforts to mount a last-ditch, no-holds-barred defense may simply increase their liability for the plaintiff's attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988." He then affirmed the district court's decision.&lt;ref name="ncac" /&gt;

=== Settlement and aftermath ===
On September 20, 1994, the city and the ACLU reached a settlement. The ACLU agreed to drop claims against the city and Superintendent LeRoy Martin.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB421DDDCC02773&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=City settles suit over Washington painting |date=September 21, 1994 |accessdate=2008-02-10 |author1=Lehmann, Daniel J.  |author2=Golab, Art  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the city of Chicago agreed to pay Nelson and the ACLU $95,000 (1994, {{Inflation|US|95000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for damage to the painting and to issue police procedures about what materials protected by the First Amendment may be seized.&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921" /&gt; The elected officials also agreed not to appeal the district court's ruling.&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921" /&gt; Left unresolved were the hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal fees owed to lawyers defending Tillman, Rush and Streeter; by September 1994, $200,000 (1994, {{Inflation|US|200000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) in fees were owed by Tillman alone.&lt;ref name="oconnor_19940921" /&gt; Earlier in the year, the City Council's Finance Committee voted against paying for the aldermen's legal fees. The vote split along racial lines, 12 to 8.&lt;ref name="spielman_19940223"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB4219C9E2B3DC4&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Council won't pay bills for 3 - aldermen's legal bills mount |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=February 23, 1994 |accessdate=2008-05-22 |author=Spielman, Fran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grossman stated that the relatively small settlement showed that Nelson had proceeded with the lawsuit "on a matter of principle". Tillman, however, called the settlement a "great victory", saying, "we didn't admit to anything, all the charges were dropped, we're not paying anything (in damages), and we preserve our rights to pursue efforts to have our legal fees paid". At the time the lawsuit was settled, Nelson did not issue any statements.&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921" /&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' reported that he was employed as an advertising artist at an undisclosed firm; he continued to paint in his free time.&lt;ref name= oconnor_19940921&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB42617116B777C&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Suit ended on picture of Washington |author=O'Connor, Matt |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 21, 1994 |accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1994, the painting had not been sold, exhibited, or repaired after the incident.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

'''''Posankka''''' is a [[statue]] located in [[Turku]], [[Finland]]. The statue, which is located near the campus area of the [[University of Turku]] and the [[Turku Student Village]], represents a hybrid between a [[marzipan pig]] ("possu") and a [[rubber duck]] ("ankka"). It is a pink animal with a duck's lower body and a pig's head.&lt;ref name="Gullichsen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alvar Gullichsen (1961&amp;ndash;) Posankka|url=http://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=62348&amp;nodeid=13067|publisher=Wäinö Aaltosen Museo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928173014/http://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=62348&amp;nodeid=13067|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}
{{Semiotics}}
'''Postmodernism''' is a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across [[philosophy]], [[the arts]], [[architecture]], and [[criticism]] and that marked a departure from [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/postmodernism|title=postmodernism: definition of postmodernism in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reichl, Cook's November 1989; [http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html American Heritage Dictionary's definition of "postmodern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075319/http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |date=9 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |doi=10.7565/landp.2012.0005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also more generally been applied to the [[Postmodernity|historical era following modernity]] and the tendencies of this era.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; (In this context, "modern" is not used in the sense of "contemporary", but merely as a name for a specific period in history.)
 
While encompassing a wide variety of approaches, postmodernism is generally defined by an attitude of [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], [[irony]], or rejection toward the [[meta-narrative]]s and [[ideology|ideologies]] of modernism, often calling into question various assumptions of [[the Enlightenment|Enlightenment rationality]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Consequently, common targets of postmodern critique include [[universalism|universalist]] notions of [[objective reality]], [[moral universalism|morality]], [[truth]], [[human nature]], [[reason]], [[language]], and [[social progress]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duignan|first1=Brian|title=Postmodernism|website=[[Britannica]]|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/postmodernism-philosophy|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] or [[social conditioning|socially-conditioned]] nature of [[knowledge]] claims and  [[value system]]s, situating them as products of particular political, historical, or cultural [[discourse]]s and [[hierarchies]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to [[self-reference|self-referentiality]], [[epistemological relativism|epistemological]] and [[moral relativism]], [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], [[subjectivism]], and irreverence.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Postmodern critical approaches gained purchase in the 1980s and 1990s, and have been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines, including [[cultural studies]], [[philosophy of science]],  [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[architecture]], [[feminist theory]], and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[Postmodern art|art movements]] in fields such as [[postmodern literature|literature]] and music. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as [[deconstruction]] and [[post-structuralism]], as well as philosophers such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Fredric Jameson]]. Some philosophers have criticized the term.

==History==
Postmodernism arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what is now called postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of artists such as [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barth, John: “[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].” ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and [[continental philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,&lt;ref&gt;See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a "[[grand narrative]]" of  Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;See Lyotard, Jean-François, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; a preference for the [[virtual (philosophy)|virtual]] at the expense of [[the Real]] (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)&lt;ref&gt;See Baudrillard, Jean: “[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.” In: ''Jean Baudrillard. Selected Writings''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waning of affect"&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Garry and Lopez, Jose (eds.): ''After Postmodernism: An Introduction to Critical Realism''. London: The Athlone Press 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postmodernism and structuralism===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|

{{Main article|Manifestations of postmodernism }}
[[Structuralism]] was a philosophical movement developed by French academics in the 1950s, partly in response to French [[Existentialism]]. It has been seen variously as an expression of [[Modernism]], [[High modernism]], or postmodernism {{By whom|date=July 2010}}. [[Post-Structuralism|"Post-structuralists"]] were thinkers who moved away from the strict interpretations and applications of structuralist ideas. Many American academics consider post-structuralism to be part of the broader, less well-defined postmodernist movement, even though many post-structuralists insisted it was not. Thinkers who have been called structuralists include the anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], the linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]], and the semiotician [[Algirdas Julien Greimas|Algirdas Greimas]]. The early writings of the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] and the literary theorist [[Roland Barthes]] have also been called structuralists. Those who began as structuralists but became post-structuralists include [[Michel Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Gilles Deleuze]]. Other post-structuralists include [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Hélène Cixous]], and [[Luce Irigaray]]. The American cultural theorists, critics and intellectuals whom they influenced include [[Judith Butler]], [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Avital Ronell]], and [[Hayden White]].

Post-structuralism is not defined by a set of shared axioms or methodologies, but by an emphasis on how various aspects of a particular culture, from its most ordinary, everyday material details to its most abstract theories and beliefs, determine one another. Post-structuralist thinkers reject [[Reductionism]] and [[Epiphenomenalism]] and the idea that cause-and-effect relationships are top-down or bottom-up. Like structuralists, they start from the assumption that people's identities, values and economic conditions determine each other rather than having ''intrinsic'' properties that can be understood in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lévi-Strauss|first1=Claude| |authorlink=Claude Lévi-Strauss| title=Structural Anthropology|date=1963|publisher=New York: Basic Books|location=USA|isbn=046509516X|page=324|edition=I}}&lt;br/&gt;Lévi-Strauss, quoting D'Arcy Westworth Thompson states: "To those who question the possibility of defining the interrelations between entities whose nature is not completely understood, I shall reply with the following comment by a great naturalist: In a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related forms rather than in the precise definition of each; and the deformation of a complicated figure may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the figure itself has to be left unanalyzed and undefined."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the French structuralists considered themselves to be espousing [[Relativism]] and [[Social constructionism|Constructionism]]. But they nevertheless tended to explore how the subjects of their study might be described, reductively, as a set of ''essential'' relationships, schematics, or mathematical symbols. (An example is Claude Lévi-Strauss's algebraic formulation of mythological transformation in "The Structural Study of Myth"&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Anthropologie Structurale''. Paris: Éditions Plon, 1958.&lt;br/&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Structural Anthropology''. Trans. Claire Jacobson and Brooke Grundfest Schoepf (New York: Basic Books, 1963), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RmeUknlauJAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=NJWcwczLLV&amp;dq=Structural%20Anthropology%20Basic%20Books&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=Structural%20Anthropology%20Basic%20Books&amp;f=false 228].&lt;/ref&gt;). Post-structuralists thinkers went further, questioning the existence of any distinction between the nature of a thing and its relationship to other things.

Postmodernist ideas in [[philosophy]] and the analysis of [[culture]] and [[society]] expanded the importance of [[critical theory]] and has been the point of departure for works of [[literature]], [[architecture]], and [[design]], as well as being visible in marketing/business and the interpretation of [[history]], [[law]] and [[culture]], starting in the late 20th century.

One of the most well-known postmodernist concerns is "deconstruction," a theory for philosophy, literary criticism, and textual analysis developed by [[Jacques Derrida]]. The notion of a "deconstructive" approach implies an analysis that questions the already evident understanding of a text in terms of presuppositions, ideological underpinnings, hierarchical values, and frames of reference. A deconstructive approach further depends on the techniques of close reading without reference to cultural, ideological, moral opinions or information derived from an authority over the text such as the author. At the same time Derrida famously writes: "Il n'y a pas d'hors-texte (''there is no such thing as outside-of-the-text'')."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1967), Of Grammatology, Part II, Introduction to the "Age of Rousseau," section 2 "...That Dangerous Supplement...", title, The Exorbitant Question of Method, pp. 158–59, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida implies that the world follows the grammar of a text undergoing its own deconstruction. Derrida's method frequently involves recognizing and spelling out the different, yet similar interpretations of the meaning of a given text and the problematic implications of binary oppositions within the meaning of a text. Derrida's philosophy inspired a postmodern movement called [[deconstructivism]] among architects, characterized by the intentional fragmentation, distortion, and dislocation of architectural elements in designing a building. Derrida discontinued his involvement with the movement after the publication of his collaborative project with architect Peter Eisenman in ''Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman''.&lt;ref&gt;Benoît Peeters, ''Derrida: A Biography'', pp. 377–8, translated by Andrew Brown, [[Polity Press]], 2013, {{ISBN|9780745656151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between postmodernism, posthumanism, and cyborgism has led to a challenge of postmodernism, for which the terms "postpostmodernism" and "postpoststructuralism" were first coined in 2003:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wearcam.org/decon2/decon_leonardo_leon_36_4_285_0.pdf|title="Deconstructing Decontamination", LEONARDO, Vol. 36, No. 4, pp. 285–290, 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Postcyborg Ethics: A New Way to Speak of Technology", Heidi A.

More recently [[metamodernism]], post-postmodernism and the "death of postmodernism" have been widely debated: in 2007 Andrew Hoberek noted in his introduction to a special issue of the journal ''Twentieth Century Literature'' titled "After Postmodernism" that "declarations of postmodernism's demise have become a critical commonplace". A small group of critics has put forth a range of theories that aim to describe culture or society in the alleged aftermath of postmodernism, most notably Raoul Eshelman (performatism), [[Gilles Lipovetsky]] ([[hypermodernity]]), [[Nicolas Bourriaud]] ([[altermodern]]), and Alan Kirby (digimodernism, formerly called pseudo-modernism). None of these new theories and labels have so far gained very widespread acceptance. Sociocultural anthropologist Nina Müller-Schwarze offers neostructuralism as a possible direction. &lt;ref&gt;Müller Schwarze, Nina

==Origins of term==
The term ''postmodern'' was first used around the 1880s. John Watkins Chapman suggested "a Postmodern style of painting" as a way to depart from French [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ihab Hassan|Hassan, Ihab]], ''The Postmodern Turn, Essays in Postmodern Theory and Culture'', Ohio University Press, 1987. p. 12ff.&lt;/ref&gt; J. M. Thompson, in his 1914 article in ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' (a quarterly philosophical review), used it to describe changes in attitudes and beliefs in the critique of [[religion]], writing: "The raison d'être of Post-Modernism is to escape from the double-mindedness of [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] by being thorough in its criticism by extending it to religion as well as [[theology]], to Catholic feeling as well as to Catholic tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. M. "Post-Modernism," ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]''. Vol XII No. 4, July 1914. p. 733&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 and 1925, postmodernism had been used to describe new forms of [[art]] and [[music]]. In 1942 H. R. Hays described it as a new literary form. However, as a general theory for a historical movement it was first used in 1939 by [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]: "Our own Post-Modern Age has been inaugurated by the general war of 1914–1918".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGQ9AQAAIAAJ&amp;q= ''A study of History'', Volume 5], Oxford University Press, 1961 [1939], p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Portland Building 1982.jpg|right|thumb|[[Portland Building]] (1982), by architect Michael Graves, an example of [[Postmodern architecture]]]]
In 1949 the term was used to describe a dissatisfaction with [[modern architecture]], and led to the [[postmodern architecture]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and a response to the modernist architectural movement known as the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]]. Postmodernism in architecture was initially marked by a re-emergence of surface ornament, reference to surrounding buildings in urban settings, historical reference in decorative forms ([[eclecticism]]), and non-orthogonal angles.

[[Peter Drucker]] suggested the transformation into a post-modern world happened between 1937 and 1957 (when he was writing). He described an as yet "nameless era" which he characterized as a shift to conceptual world based on pattern, purpose, and process rather than mechanical cause, outlined by four new realities: the emergence of Educated Society, the importance of [[international development]], the decline of the nation state, and the collapse of the viability of non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=LoT&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter F.| authorlink=Peter Drucker |title=Landmarks of Tomorrow|date=1957|publisher=Harper Brothers|location=New York|url=http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/30294/XX_CNE-LIPSOR_1197.pdf.txt?sequence=3|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, in a lecture delivered at the Institute of Contemporary Art, London, [[Mel Bochner]] described "post-modernism" in art as having started with Jasper Johns, "who first rejected sense-data and the singular point-of-view as the basis for his art, and treated art as a critical investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bochner|first1=Mel|authorlink=Mel Bochner| title=Solar System &amp; Rest Rooms: Writings and Interviews 1965--2007|date=2008|publisher=The MIT Press|location=USA|isbn=9780262026314|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Walter Truett Anderson]] described postmodernism as belonging to one of four typological world views, which he identifies as either (a) Postmodern-ironist, which sees truth as socially constructed, (b) Scientific-rational, in which truth is found through methodical, disciplined inquiry, (c) Social-traditional, in which truth is found in the heritage of American and Western civilization, or (d) Neo-Romantic, in which truth is found through attaining harmony with nature and/or spiritual exploration of the inner self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Fontana Postmodernism Reader]]|author=Walter Truett Anderson|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Heidegger===
[[Martin Heidegger]] rejected the philosophical basis of the concepts of "subjectivity" and "objectivity" and asserted that similar grounding oppositions in logic ultimately refer to one another. Instead of resisting the admission of this paradox in the search for understanding, Heidegger requires that we embrace it through an active process of elucidation he called the "[[hermeneutic circle]]". He stressed the [[historicity]] and cultural construction of concepts while simultaneously advocating the necessity of an [[wikt:atemporal|atemporal]] and [[immanence|immanent]] apprehension of them. In this vein, he asserted that it was the task of contemporary philosophy to recover the original question of (or "openness to") ''[[Dasein]]'' (translated as Being or Being-there) present in the [[Presocratic]] philosophers but normalized, neutered, and standardized since [[Plato]]. This was to be done, in part, by tracing the record of ''Dasein's'' sublimation or forgetfulness through the history of philosophy which meant that we were to ask again what constituted the grounding conditions in ourselves and in the World for the affinity between beings and between the many usages of the term "being" in philosophy. To do this, however, a non-historical and, to a degree, self-referential engagement with whatever set of ideas, feelings or practices would permit (both the non-fixed concept and reality of) such a continuity was required—a continuity permitting the possible experience, possible existence indeed not only of beings but of all differences as they appeared and tended to develop.

Such a conclusion led Heidegger to depart from the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of his teacher [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of [[Ontology]], a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between [[phenomena]] and [[noumena]] or between things in themselves (''[[de re]]'') and things as they appear (see [[qualia]]): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness to the process of ''Dasein''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in [[Rationalism]], [[Empiricism]], and [[methodological naturalism]], his repudiation of the idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a [[nominalist]]), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Heinrich von Kleist]], [[World view|Weltanschauung]], and [[social constructionism]]), and his [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] and [[Via Negativa|negativist]] notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also [[process philosophy]], [[Dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[Instrumentalism]], [[Pragmatism]], and [[Vitalism]]).

===Jacques Derrida===
[[Jacques Derrida]] re-examined the fundamentals of writing and its consequences on philosophy in general; sought to undermine the language of "presence" or [[metaphysics]] in an analytical technique which, beginning as a point of departure from Heidegger's notion of [[Heideggerian terminology|''Destruktion'']], came to be known as [[Deconstruction]]. Derrida used, like Heidegger, references to Greek philosophical notions associated with the [[Skeptic]]s and the [[Presocratic]]s, such as [[Epoché]] and [[Aporia]] to articulate his notion of implicit circularity between premises and conclusions, origins and manifestations, but—in a manner analogous in certain respects to [[Gilles Deleuze]]—presented a radical re-reading of canonical philosophical figures such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Descartes]] as themselves being informed by such "destabilizing" notions.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]] introduced concepts such as '[[discourse|discursive regime]]', or re-invoked those of older philosophers like '[[episteme]]' and '[[Genealogy of Morals|genealogy]]' in order to explain the relationship between meaning, power, and social behavior within social orders (see ''[[The Order of Things]]'', ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'', ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', and ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''). In direct contradiction to what have been typified as [[modernist]] perspectives on [[epistemology]], Foucault asserted that rational judgment, social practice, and what he called "[[biopower]]" are not only inseparable but co-determinant. While Foucault himself was deeply involved in a number of progressive political causes and maintained close personal ties with members of the [[far-left]], he was also controversial with leftist thinkers of his day, including those associated with various [[Marxist]] tendencies, proponents of [[left-libertarianism]] (such as [[Noam Chomsky's political views|Noam Chomsky]]), and supporters of [[humanism]] (like [[Jürgen Habermas]]), for his rejection of what he deemed to be [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] concepts of freedom, liberation, [[self-determination]], and [[human nature]]. Instead, Foucault focused on the ways in which such constructs can foster [[cultural hegemony]], violence, and exclusion.

In line with his rejection of such "[[Positivism|positive]]" tenets of Enlightenment-era humanism, he was active—with [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]—in the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, considering much of institutionalized psychiatry and, in particular, Freud's concept of [[Psychological repression|repression]] central to [[Psychoanalysis]] (which was still very influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s), to be both harmful and misplaced. Foucault was known for his controversial aphorisms, such as "language is oppression"{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}, meaning that language functions in such a way as to render nonsensical, false, or silent tendencies that might otherwise threaten or undermine the distributions of power backing a society's conventions—even when such distributions purport to celebrate liberation and expression or value minority groups and perspectives. His writings have had a major influence on the larger body of postmodern academic literature.

===Jean-François Lyotard===
[[Jean-François Lyotard]] identified in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' a crisis in the "discourses of the human sciences" latent in modernism but catapulted to the fore by the advent of the "computerized" or "telematic" era (see [[Information Revolution|information revolution]]). This crisis, insofar as it pertains to academia, concerns both the motivations and justification procedures for making research claims: unstated givens or values that have validated the basic efforts of academic research since the late 18th century might no longer be valid—particularly, in social science and humanities research, though examples from mathematics are given by Lyotard as well. As formal conjecture about real-world issues becomes inextricably linked to automated calculation, information storage, and retrieval, such knowledge becomes increasingly "exteriorised" from its knowers in the form of information. Knowledge thus becomes materialized and made into a commodity exchanged between producers and consumers; it ceases to be either an idealistic end-in-itself or a tool capable of bringing about liberty or social benefit; it is stripped of its humanistic and spiritual associations, its connection with education, teaching, and human development, being simply rendered as "data"—omnipresent, material, unending, and without any contexts or pre-requisites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/lyotard.htm Lyotard, Jean-François. The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. Les Éditions de Minuit, 1979. English Translation by Geoffrey Bennington and Brian Massumi. Manchester University Press, 1984. See Chapter 1, The Field: Knowledge in Computerised Societies.]//&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the "diversity" of claims made by various disciplines begins to lack any unifying principle or intuition as objects of study become more and more specialized due to the emphasis on specificity, precision, and uniformity of reference that competitive, database-oriented research implies.

The value-premises upholding academic research have been maintained by what Lyotard considers to be quasi-mythological beliefs about human purpose, human reason, and human progress—large, background constructs he calls "[[metanarrative]]s". These metanarratives still remain in Western society but are now being undermined by rapid [[Informatization]] and the commercialization of the university and its functions. The shift of authority from the presence and intuition of knowers—from the good faith of reason to seek diverse knowledge integrated for human benefit or truth fidelity—to the automated database and the market had, in Lyotard's view, the power to unravel the very idea of "justification" or "legitimation" and, with it, the rationale for research altogether, especially in disciplines pertaining to human life, society, and meaning. We are now controlled not by binding extra-linguistic value paradigms defining notions of collective identity and ultimate purpose, but rather by our automatic responses to different species of "language games" (a concept Lyotard imports from [[J. L. Austin]]'s theory of [[speech act]]s). In his vision of a solution to this "vertigo", Lyotard opposes the assumptions of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]], consensus, and generality that he identified within the thought of humanistic, [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers like [[Jürgen Habermas]], and proposes a continuation of experimentation and diversity to be assessed pragmatically in the context of language games rather than via appeal to a resurrected series of transcendentals and metaphysical unities.

===Richard Rorty===
[[Richard Rorty]] argues in ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' that contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of [[representationalism]] and [[correspondence theory]] that rely upon the independence of knowers and observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of [[anti-foundationalism]] and anti-essentialism within a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] framework, he echoes the postmodern strain of [[conventionalism]] and [[relativism]], but opposes much of postmodern thinking with his commitment to [[social liberalism]].

===Jean Baudrillard===
[[Jean Baudrillard]], in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'', introduced the concept that reality or the principle of "[[The Real]]" is short-circuited by the interchangeability of signs in an era whose communicative and semantic acts are dominated by electronic media and digital technologies. Baudrillard proposes the notion that, in such a state, where subjects are detached from the outcomes of events (political, literary, artistic, personal, or otherwise), events no longer hold any particular sway on the subject nor have any identifiable context; they therefore have the effect of producing widespread indifference, detachment, and passivity in industrialized populations. He claimed that a constant stream of appearances and references without any direct consequences to viewers or readers could eventually render the division between appearance and object indiscernible, resulting, ironically, in the "disappearance" of mankind in what is, in effect, a virtual or holographic state, composed only of appearances. For [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]], "simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or a reality: a [[hyperreality|hyperreal]]."&lt;ref&gt;Luke, T. W. (1991). Power and politics in hyperreality: The critical project of Jean Baudrillard. Social Science Journal, 28(3), 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fredric Jameson===
[[Fredric Jameson]] set forth one of the first expansive theoretical treatments of postmodernism as a historical period, intellectual trend, and social phenomenon in a series of lectures at the [[Whitney Museum]], later expanded as ''Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'' (1991). Eclectic in his methodology, Jameson has continued a sustained examination of the role that [[periodization]] continues to play as a grounding assumption of critical methodologies in [[humanities]] disciplines. He has contributed extensive effort to explicating the importance of concepts of [[Utopia]] and Utopianism as driving forces in the cultural and intellectual movements of [[modernity]], and outlining the political and existential uncertainties that may result from the decline or suspension of this trend in the theorized state of postmodernity. Like [[Susan Sontag]], Jameson served to introduce a wide audience of American readers to key figures of the 20th century [[continental European]] intellectual left, particularly those associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], [[structuralism]], and [[post-structuralism]]. Thus, his importance as a "translator" of their ideas to the common vocabularies of a variety of disciplines in the Anglo-American academic complex is equally as important as his own critical engagement with them.

===Douglas Kellner===
In ''Analysis of the Journey'', a journal birthed from postmodernism, [[Douglas Kellner]] insists that the "assumptions and procedures of modern theory" must be forgotten. His terms defined in the depth of postmodernism are based on advancement, innovation, and adaptation. Extensively, Kellner analyzes the terms of this theory in real-life experiences and examples. Kellner used science and technology studies as a major part of his analysis; he urged that the theory is incomplete without it. The scale was larger than just postmodernism alone; it must be interpreted through cultural studies where science and technology studies play a huge role. The reality of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States of America is the catalyst for his explanation. This catalyst is used as a great representation due to the mere fact of the planned ambush and destruction of "symbols of globalization", insinuating the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].

{{Clarify|reason=Unclear what exactly is being said here, as if crucial information is omitted.|text=One of the numerous yet appropriate definitions of postmodernism and the qualm aspect aids this attribute to seem perfectly accurate.|date=March 2017}} In response, Kellner continues to examine the repercussions of understanding the effects of the September 11 attacks. He questions if the attacks are only able to be understood in a limited form of postmodern theory due to the level of irony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lule | first1 = Jack | year = 2001 | title = The Postmodern Adventure (Book) | url = | journal = Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 78 | issue = 4| pages = 865–866 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In further studies, he enhances the idea of [[semiotics]] in alignment with the theory. Similar to the act of September 11 and the symbols that were interpreted through this postmodern ideal, he continues to even describe this as "[[semiotics|semiotic systems]]" that people use to make sense of their lives and the events that occur in them. Kellner's [[Wikt:adamancy|adamancy]] that signs are necessary to understand one's culture is what he analyzes from the evidence that most cultures have used signs in place of existence.{{Citation needed|reason=Strong Statement with significant implications. Likely point for user to seek source material|date=February 2015}} Finally, he recognizes that many theorists of postmodernism are trapped by their own cogitations. He finds strength in theorist Baudrillard and his idea of [[Marxism]]. Kellner acknowledges Marxism's end and lack of importance to his theory.

The conclusion he depicts is simple: postmodernism, as most use it today, will decide what experiences and signs in one's reality will be one's reality as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danto | first1 = AC | year = 1990 | title = The Hyper-Intellectual | url = | journal = New Republic | volume = 203 | issue = 11/12| pages = 44–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on art==
{{Main article|Postmodern art}}

===Architecture===
{{Main article|Postmodern architecture}}
[[File:Staatsgalerie1.jpg|thumb|[[Neue Staatsgalerie]] (1977-84), Stuttgart, [[Germany]], by James Stirling and Michael Wilford, showing the eclectic mix of classical architecture and colourful ironic detailing.]]

The idea of Postmodernism in [[architecture]] began as a response to the perceived blandness and failed Utopianism of the Modern movement. [[Modern Architecture]], as established and developed by [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Le Corbusier]], was focused on the pursuit of a perceived ideal perfection, and attempted harmony of form and function,&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Louis. "The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered," published Lippincott's Magazine (March 1896).&lt;/ref&gt; and dismissal of "frivolous ornament,"&lt;ref&gt;Loos, Adolf. "Ornament and Crime," published 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tafuri, Manfredo, 'Architecture and Utopia: Design and Capitalist Development', Cambridge: MIT Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as arguing for an architecture that represented the spirit of the age as depicted in cutting-edge technology, be it airplanes, cars, ocean liners or even supposedly artless grain silos.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Towards a New Architecture''. Dover Publications, 1985/1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of modernism argued that the attributes of perfection and minimalism themselves were subjective, and pointed out [[anachronism]]s in modern thought and questioned the benefits of its philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Venturi, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Definitive postmodern architecture such as the work of [[Michael Graves]] and [[Robert Venturi]] rejects the notion of a 'pure' form or 'perfect' architectonic detail, instead conspicuously drawing from all methods, materials, forms and colors available to architects.

Modernist [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] is associated with the phrase "[[Minimalist architecture|less is more]]"; in response [[Robert Venturi|Venturi]] famously said, "Less is a bore." 

The intellectual scholarship regarding postmodernism and architecture is closely linked with the writings of critic-turned-architect [[Charles Jencks]], beginning with lectures in the early 1970s and his essay "The rise of post-modern architecture" from 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, Charles, "The rise of Post-Modern architecture", ''Architecture Association Quarterly'', No.4, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''magnum opus'', however, is the book ''The Language of Post-Modern Architecture'', first published in 1977, and since running to seven editions. Jencks makes the point that Post-Modernism (like Modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture it is not just a reaction to Modernism but what he terms ''double coding'': "Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other architects."&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, Charles. "The Language of Post-Modern Architecture", Academy Editions, London 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Post-Modern architects would for economic reasons be compelled to make use of contemporary technology, hence distinguishing such architects from mere revivalists. Among the Post-Modern architects championed by Jencks were [[Robert Venturi]], [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]], [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Leon Krier]], and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]].

===Urban planning===
Postmodernism is a rejection of 'totality', of the notion that planning could be 'comprehensive', widely applied regardless of context, and rational. In this sense, Postmodernism is a rejection of its predecessor: Modernism. From the 1920s onwards, the Modern movement sought to design and plan cities which followed the logic of the new model of industrial [[mass production]]; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardisation and [[prefabricated]] design solutions (Goodchild 1990). Postmodernism also brought a break from the notion that planning and architecture could result in [[social reform]], which was an integral dimension of the plans of Modernism (Simonsen 1990). Furthermore, Modernism eroded urban living by its failure to recognise differences and aim towards homogenous landscapes (Simonsen 1990, 57). Within Modernism, urban planning represented a 20th-century move towards establishing something stable, structured, and rationalised within what had become a world of chaos, flux and change (Irving 1993, 475). The role of planners predating Postmodernism was one of the 'qualified professional' who believed they could find and implement one single 'right way' of planning new urban establishments (Irving 1993). In fact, after 1945, urban planning became one of the methods through which [[capitalism]] could be managed and the interests of developers and corporations could be administered (Irving 1993, 479).

Considering Modernism inclined urban planning to treat buildings and developments as isolated, unrelated parts of the overall [[urban ecosystem]]s created fragmented, isolated, and homogeneous urban landscapes (Goodchild, 1990). One of the greater problems with Modernist-style of planning was the disregard of resident or [[public opinion]], which resulted in planning being forced upon the majority by a minority consisting of affluent professionals with little to no knowledge of real 'urban' problems characteristic of post-[[Second World War]] urban environments: [[slum]]s, overcrowding, deteriorated [[infrastructure]], [[pollution]] and disease, among others (Irving 1993). These were precisely the 'urban ills' Modernism was meant to 'solve', but more often than not, the types of 'comprehensive', 'one size fits all' approaches to planning made things worse., and residents began to show interest in becoming involved in decisions which had once been solely entrusted to professionals of the built environment. [[Urban planning#Advocacy planning|Advocacy planning]] and [[Participatory modeling|participatory model]]s of planning emerged in the 1960s to counter these traditional [[elitist]] and [[technocratic]] approaches to urban planning (Irving 1993; Hatuka &amp; D'Hooghe 2007). Furthermore, an assessment of the 'ills' of Modernism among planners during the 1960s, fuelled development of a participatory model that aimed to expand the range of participants in urban interventions (Hatuka &amp; D'Hooghe 2007, 21).

[[Jane Jacobs]]' 1961 book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:32pm on 15 July in 1972, when [[Pruitt Igoe]]; a housing development for low-income people in [[St. Louis]] designed by [[architect]] [[Minoru Yamasaki]], which had been a prize-winning version of [[Le Corbusier]]'s 'machine for modern living' was deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka &amp; D'Hooghe 2007). Postmodern planning aims to accept [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and heighten awareness of social differences in order to accept and bring to light the claims of minority and [[disadvantaged]] groups (Goodchild 1990). Urban planning discourse within Modernity and Postmodernity has developed in different contexts, even though they both grew within a capitalist culture. Modernity was shaped by a capitalist ethic of [[Fordism|Fordist]]-[[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] paradigm of mass, standardized production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], while postmodernity was created out of a more flexible form of capital accumulation, [[labor market]]s and organisations (Irving 1993, 60). Also, there is a distinction between a postmodernism of 'reaction' and one of 'resistance'. A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a result of Postmodernism, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan' (Irving 474).&lt;ref&gt;Goodchild, B 1990, 'Planning and the Modern'Postmodern Debate', in The Town Planning Review, vol. 61, no. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;119–137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatuka, T &amp; D'Hooghe, A 2007, 'After Postmodernism: readdressing the Role of Utopia in Urban Design and Planning', in Places: Forum of Design for the Public Realm, vol. 19, Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–27/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irving, A 1993, 'The Modern/Postmodern Divide and Urban Planning', in The University of Toronto Quareterly, vol. 62, no. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;474–487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonsen, K 1990, 'Planning on 'Postmodern' Conditions', in Acta Sociologica, vol. 33, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;51–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary postmodernism was officially inaugurated in the United States with the first issue of ''[[boundary 2]]'', subtitled "Journal of Postmodern Literature and Culture", which appeared in 1972. [[David Antin]], [[Charles Olson]], [[John Cage]], and the [[Black Mountain College]] school of poetry and the arts were integral figures in the intellectual and artistic exposition of postmodernism at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''The origins of postmodernity'', London: Verso, 1998, Ch.2: "Crystallization".&lt;/ref&gt; ''boundary 2'' remains an influential journal in postmodernist circles today.&lt;ref&gt;''boundary 2'', Duke University Press, [http://boundary2.dukejournals.org/ Boundary2.dukejournals.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Henryk Mikołaj Górecki Polish composer.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Henryk Górecki]].]]
{{Main article|Postmodern music|Postmodern classical music|Art pop}}

[[Postmodern music]] is either music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetic and philosophical trends of postmodernism. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to the ideals of the [[modernism|modernist]]. Because of this, postmodern music is mostly defined in opposition to [[Modernism (music)|modernist music]], and a work can either be modernist, or postmodern, but not both. [[Jonathan Kramer]] posits the idea (following [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]]) that postmodernism (including ''musical'' postmodernism) is less a surface style or historical period (i.e., condition) than an ''attitude''.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

The postmodern impulse in classical music arose in the 1960s with the advent of musical [[minimalism]]. Composers such as [[Terry Riley]], [[Henryk Górecki]], [[Bradley Joseph]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[Lou Harrison]] reacted to the perceived elitism and dissonant sound of atonal academic modernism by producing music with simple textures and relatively consonant harmonies, whilst others, most notably [[John Cage]] challenged the prevailing [[narrative]]s of beauty and objectivity common to Modernism. Some composers have been openly influenced by popular music and world ethnic musical traditions.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

Postmodern classical music as well is not a musical ''style'', but rather refers to music of the postmodern era. It bears the same relationship to postmodernist music that postmodernity bears to postmodernism. Postmodern music, on the other hand, shares characteristics with [[postmodern art|postmodernist art]]—that is, art that comes ''after'' and reacts ''against'' modernism.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

Though representing a general return to certain notions of music-making that are often considered to be classical or romantic{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, not all postmodern composers have eschewed the experimentalist or academic tenets of modernism. The works of Dutch composer [[Louis Andriessen]], for example, exhibit experimentalist preoccupation that is decidedly anti-romantic. Eclecticism and freedom of expression, in reaction to the rigidity and aesthetic limitations of modernism, are the hallmarks of the postmodern influence in musical composition.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

Author on postmodernism, Dominic Strinati, has noted, it is also important "to include in this category the so-called '[[art rock]]' musical innovations and mixing of styles associated with groups like [[Talking Heads]], and performers like [[Laurie Anderson]], together with the self-conscious 'reinvention of [[disco]]' by the [[Pet Shop Boys]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Theories of Popular Culture|last=Strinati|first=Dominic|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|location=London|pages=234|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic design=== 
[[File:AprilGreiman.jpg|thumb|April Greiman]]
[[Graphic design]] in the postmodern age brought forth ideas that challenged the orderly feel of [[modernism]]. Graphic designers created works beginning in the 1970s without any set adherence to rational order and formal organization. Designers began experimenting with how shapes, forms and typography could react with one another effectively and interestingly in a less rigid way even if the design was rendered illegible. Some graphic design styles that emerged in the postmodernist era were [[New Wave (design)|New Wave]] Typography, retro and vernacular design, playful design inspired by the Italian [[Memphis Group]], punk rock styles and explorative digital design from the late 1980's.  Another characteristic of postmodern graphic design is that "retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and pastiche were all conspicuous trends. Each had its own sites and venues, detractors and advocates".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Graphic Design History|last = Drucker|first = Johanna and [[Emily McVarish]]|publisher = Pearson|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0132410755|location = |pages = 305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, while postmodern design did not consist of one unified graphic style, the movement was an expressive and playful time for designers who searched for more and more ways to go against the system. Postmodernism did not seek rules but only creative solutions and innovative ideas. The clean orderly grid-based designs of [[International Typographic Style]] were interrupted for more exploration and innovation in color, composition, visual communication, and typography. Key influential postmodern graphic designers include [[Wolfgang Weingart]], [[April Greiman]], [[Jayme Odgers]], [[Tibor Kalman]], [[Dan Friedman (graphic designer)|Dan Friedman]], [[Paula Scher]], [[Neville Brody]], [[Michael Vanderbyl]] and [[Jamie Reid]].

==Criticisms==
{{Main article|Criticism of postmodernism}}
Criticisms of postmodernism are intellectually diverse, including the assertions that postmodernism is meaningless and promotes [[obscurantism]]. For example, [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals do not respond like people in other fields when asked, "what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn't already obvious, etc.?...If [these requests] can't be met, then I'd suggest recourse to Hume's advice in similar circumstances: 'to the flames'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bactra.org/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html|title=Noam Chomsky on Post-Modernism|work=bactra.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] has noted "The idea that we live in a postmodern culture is a myth. In fact, a postmodern culture is an impossibility; it would be utterly unliveable. People are not relativistic when it comes to matters of science, [[engineering]], and technology; rather, they are relativistic and pluralistic in matters of religion and [[ethics]]. But, of course, that's not postmodernism; that's [[modernism]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Craig|first=William Lane| |authorlink=William Lane Craig| title=God is Not Dead Yet|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/july/13.22.html|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=July 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal, academic critiques of postmodernism can also be found in works such as ''[[Beyond the Hoax]]'' and ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]''.

However, as for [[continental philosophy]], American academics have tended to label it "postmodernist", especially practitioners of "French Theory". Such a trend might derive from U.S. departments of Comparative Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uninomade.org/italian-theory-english|title=Italian Theory|work=UniNomade|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Guattari]], often considered a "postmodernist", rejected its theoretical assumptions by arguing that the structuralist and postmodernist visions of the world were not flexible enough to seek explanations in psychological, social and environmental domains at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guattari|first1=Felix|title=The three ecologies|journal=New formations|date=1989|url=http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/collections/newformations/08_131.pdf|page=134|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytic philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] declared, "Postmodernism, the school of 'thought' that proclaimed 'There are no truths, only interpretations' has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for 'conversations' in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster."&lt;ref&gt;DENNETT ON WIESELTIER V. PINKER IN THE NEW REPUBLIC http://edge.org/conversation/dennett-on-wieseltier-v-pinker-in-the-new-republic&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel A. Farber]] and [[Suzanna Sherry]] criticised Postmodernism for reducing the complexity of the modern world to an expression of power and for undermining truth and reason: "If the modern era begins with the European Enlightenment, the postmodern era that captivates the radical multiculturalists begins with its rejection. According to the new radicals, the Enlightenment-inspired ideas that have previously structured our world, especially the legal and academic parts of it, are a fraud perpetrated and perpetuated by white males to consolidate their own power. Those who disagree are not only blind but bigoted. The Enlightenment's goal of an objective and reasoned basis for knowledge, merit, truth, justice, and the like is an impossibility: "objectivity," in the sense of standards of judgment that transcend individual perspectives, does not exist. Reason is just another code word for the views of the privileged. The Enlightenment itself merely replaced one socially constructed view of reality with another, mistaking power for knowledge. There is naught but power."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Farber and Suzanne Sherry, Beyond All Reason
The Radical Assault on Truth in American Law, New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/farber-reason.html&lt;/ref&gt;

H. Sidky pointed out what he sees as several "inherent flaws" of a postmodern antiscience perspective, including the confusion of the authority of science (evidence) with the scientist conveying the knowledge; its self-contradictory claim that all truths are relative; and its strategic ambiguity. He sees 21st-century anti-scientific and pseudo-scientific approaches to knowledge, particularly in the United States, as rooted in a postmodernist "decades-long academic assault on science:" "Many of those indoctrinated in postmodern anti-science went on to become conservative political and religious leaders, policymakers, journalists, journal editors, judges, lawyers, and members of city councils and school boards. Sadly, they forgot the lofty ideals of their teachers, except that science is bogus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sidky |first1=H. |title=The War on Science, Anti-Intellectualism, and ‘Alternative Ways of Knowing’ in 21st-Century America |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=38-43 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606170145/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/e_war_on_science_anti-intellectualism_and_alternative_ways_of_knowing_in_21 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raghurajpur''' is a heritage crafts village out of  [[Puri district]], [[India]], known for its master [[Pattachitra]] painters, an art form which dates back to 5&amp;nbsp;BC in the region and [[Gotipua]] dance troupes, the precursor to the [[Indian classical dance]] form of [[Odissi dance|Odissi]]. It is also known as the birthplace of one of the finest Odissi exponents and Guru, [[Kelucharan Mohapatra]]. Apart from that, the village is also home to crafts like Tussar paintings, palm leaf engravings, stone and wood carvings, wooden, cowdung and papier mache toys, and masks.&lt;ref name=bi&gt;[[#Bo|Bindloss, p. 648]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fr&gt;{{cite news |title=A visitors' delight  |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1924/stories/20021206002208600.htm |publisher=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] |date=Volume 19 - Issue 24, 23 November – 6 December 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bu, Bundgaard. p. 65]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, after a two-year research and documentation project by [[INTACH]], starting 1998, the village was chosen to be developed as state's first heritage village and developed as a Crafts village, soon the village had an interpretation centre, commissioned artwork on the walls of the artists’ homes and a rest house.&lt;ref name=fr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HERITAGE: Mural village|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2516/stories/20080815251607400.htm |publisher=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] |date=Volume 25 - Issue 16 :: 2–15 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has the distinction of the only place where the traditional decoration called ''Patas'', used under the throne of Lord [[Jagannath]] and on the three chariots during the annual [[Rath Yatra]] festival, that takes place at pilgrimage town of [[Puri]], some 14&amp;nbsp;km away, known for the [[Jagannath Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pattachitra.com/raghurajpur.htm Rajhurajpur - pattachitra]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Behind-the-scene action before the Rath Yatra|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/behindthescene-action-before-the-rath-yatra/44947-3.html|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=15 Jul 2007|access-date=27 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006222043/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/behindthescene-action-before-the-rath-yatra/44947-3.html#|archive-date=6 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated amidst groves of coconut, palm, mango and jack fruit, the main village has two streets with over 120 houses, most decorated with mural paintings, where the painters reside and practice their pattachitra craft, besides many other that practices throughout the village, including traditional masks, stone idols, papier mache, sculptures, wooden toys.&lt;ref name=bi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsofindia.com/puri/weekend-tours/raghurajpur.html Rajhurajpur] mapsofindia.&lt;/ref&gt; The village also has a series of temples dedicated not only to Bhuasuni, the local deity but also to various [[Hindu]] gods including, Radha Mohan, Gopinath, Raghunath, [[Laxminarayan]] and [[Gouranga]].

Around, 2000 it was developed as a heritage village by [[INTACH]], and soon became a major rural tourist destination of the state, drawing tourist, both domestic and foreign to the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/11/stories/2007101157960200.htm INTACH to develop village in Ganjam district] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Villagers were also trained to provide heritage walks to the visitors by the organisation, and has since become a template for heritage tourism in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/AAHM/heritage_guides_training/training_kit/Core_module/English_version.pdf Heritage Guide training] [[UNESCO]], [[Bangkok]].Feb, 2007. '' p. 6-5''&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is also the venue of the annual ''Basant Utsav - Parampara Raghurajpur'' (Spring Festival), which was first organized in 1993 under the aegis of State Tourism Department and astern Zonal Cultural Centre, Kolkata, held in the month of February/March and an important tourist draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raghurajpur gears up for Vasant Utsav  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/10/stories/2007031005740200.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=10 Mar 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pattachitra==
[[File:Patta Chitra 02.jpg|right|380px|thumb|[[Patta Chitra]] painting]]
The [[pattachitra]] paintings are made over a piece of cloth known as ''Patta'' or a dried palm leaf, which is first painted with a mixture of chalk and gum. Over the prepared surface, colorful and intricate pictures of various Gods, Goddesses, and mythological scenes with ornamentation of flowers, trees and animals are then painted. The paintings on Tussar saris, especially the [[Sambalpuri Saree]] depicting Mathura Vijay, Raslila and Ayodhya Vijay owe their origin to ‘Raghurajpur [[Pattachitra]] paintings’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where every villager is an artist|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020414/spectrum/main7.htm |publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] |date=14 April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
It is situated 14&amp;nbsp;km away from Hindu pilgrimage town of [[Puri]], on the southern banks of river Bhargabi (Bhargavi). Visitors from Puri take the [[Bhubaneswar]] road, near Chandanpur, on NH-316, and upon reaching the Chandanpur Bazaar, they can take a right turn to reach Raghurajpur. The village is then around 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from Chandanpur.&lt;ref name=bi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/9354769/Raghurajpur Raghurajpur] [[wikimapia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''STARTS Prize''' is the grand prize of the [[European Commission]] that honors projects that demonstrate the successful integration of [[science]], [[technology]] and [[art]] to contribute to social and economic innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/launch-starts-prize-2017-honouring-successful-collaboration-between-technology-and-arts|title=Launch of STARTS prize 2017 – Honouring successful collaboration between technology and the Arts|last=|first=|date=|work=European Commission – Digital Single Market|access-date=2017-04-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two grand prize winners and up to ten honorary mentions are selected by an international jury each year. One grand prize is awarded for innovative collaboration between industry or technology and the arts that open new pathways for innovation. A second grand prize is awarded for artistic exploration and art works where appropriation by the arts has a strong potential to influence or alter the use, deployment or perception of technology. The prize is funded under [[Horizon 2020]] and is awarded on behalf of the [[European Commission]], [[Ars Electronica]] in collaboration with [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|BOZAR]] and [[Waag Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://starts-prize.aec.at/en/about/|title=About|work=STARTS PRIZE|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Seal of the State of Iowa''' was created in 1847 (one year after [[Iowa]] became a [[U.S. state]]) and depicts a citizen soldier standing in a wheat field surrounded by symbols including farming, mining, and transportation with the [[Mississippi River]] in the background. An eagle overhead bears the state motto.

==Definition==
The Seal of Iowa is described carefully under Iowa Code 1A.1 in the following: "''The secretary of state be, and is, hereby authorized to procure a seal which shall be the great seal of the state of Iowa, two inches in diameter, upon which shall be engraved the following device, surrounded by the words, 'The Great Seal of the State of Iowa' - a sheaf and field of standing [[wheat]], with a sickle and other farming utensils, on the left side near the bottom; a [[Lead (metal)|lead]] furnace and pile of pig lead on the right side; the citizen soldier, with a [[plow]] in his rear, supporting the [[American flag]] and [[Phrygian cap|liberty cap]] with his right hand, and his gun with his left, in the center and near the bottom; the [[Mississippi River]] in the rear of the whole, with the [[Iowa (steamboat)|steamer Iowa]] under way; an [[Bald eagle|eagle]] near the upper edge, holding in his beak a scroll, with the following inscription upon it: Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.''"

[[File:Seal of iowa over time.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Historically there were numerous variations of the Seal of Iowa. ''The Reports of the Iowa Geological Survey'', for example, used three different seals 1893-1918.]]

It was approved by the First [[Iowa General Assembly]] on February 25, 1847. Since that date, there have been no revisions to the code governing this Seal. The Seal of Iowa is kept and used by the [[Governor of Iowa|Governor]] for official purposes. Because the seal was not illustrated in the Iowa code, over the years there have been several variations with differences in color and arrangement of objects.

The seal was not universally beloved when introduced, it was considered cluttered and ungainly, and the older Territorial Seal was utilized in several instances on official publications into the 1860s, including official currency. "[[Ralph P. Lowe|Gov. Lowe]], who, with every other gentleman of refinement, cannot but regret the bad taste that conceived and adopted the conglomerate devices of our present 'Great Seal'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parvin|first=T.|title=Territorial Sea of Iowa|journal=Annals of Iowa|date=April 1864|pages=264–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==

The symbols presented on the seal reflect things important to early Iowa settlers.

*'''Citizen soldier.''' The seal was approved during the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–1848, and the citizen soldier depicted with a "liberty cap" represents volunteer soldiers from Iowa. Battles of the Mexican-American war are also memorialized in several place names, including the counties of [[Buena Vista County, Iowa|Buena Vista]], [[Palo Alto County, Iowa|Palo Alto]] and [[Cerro Gordo County, Iowa|Cerro Gordo]]. As is traditional in official symbols, weapons are held in the soldier's left hand, and items of peace and freedom in the right.
* '''Liberty Cap.''' A "liberty cap", also called a [[Phrygian cap]], is a brimless hat resembling a tall beret that is an ancient Greek symbol of freedom. However, the soldier on the seal typically wears a wide-brimmed hat that resembles a Civil War-era Cavalry hat. Most versions of the seal put the liberty cap on top of the flag staff, presumably because the artists felt the cap did not match the soldier's uniform, which typically resembles that of a Civil War Union soldier.
*'''Wheat.''' Early settlers in the 1840s primarily planted wheat, it was not until the introduction of the railroad in the 1850s and 1860s that [[maize|corn]] became the primary crop of Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon. ''Nature's Metropolis'' 1991. Norton&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Lead mining Barber 1865p321cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|Lead mining near Dubuque, 1865, showing a mine, furnace, and slag.]]
*'''Lead.''' Lead mining in the [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] region was an early economic force; no lead is mined in Iowa today.&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Geological and Water Survey, {{cite web |url=http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/leadzinc/leadzinc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928170226/http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/leadzinc/leadzinc.htm |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "pig" is a large slab of lead shaped in a furnace mold with four corners that protrude slightly to facilitate handling; thought to resemble the animal [[pig]].
*'''Steamer Iowa.''' The ''[[Iowa (steamboat)|Steamboat Iowa]]'' was revered as one of the largest and fastest boats on the Mississippi; it set the speed record from [[Galena, Illinois]] to [[St. Louis]] in 1843, making the trip in 44 hours, a record that held until 1849.&lt;ref&gt;p. 241, ''Steamboating on the Upper Mississippi'', William J. Peterson, 1968, [[State Historical Society of Iowa]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mississippi was the primary route of transportation in Iowa in the 1840s, and most large Iowa towns were on or near the Mississippi.
*'''Eagle.''' The federal eagle was used in the earlier Seal of the Iowa Territory, and this symbol holding a banner with the motto of Iowa on it was incorporated into the [[flag of Iowa]].

=="Plow in his rear" controversy==
Concerned about portraying members of the [[Iowa National Guard]] in a poor light, in 2010 Rep. Ray Zirkelbach, a state legislator, recommended changing the text "the citizen soldier, with a plow in his rear" to "the citizen soldier, standing in front of a plow” because "in his rear" is considered a [[malapropism]]. His proposal was not considered in 2010 because of time constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Legislator: Remove 'rear' from state seal wording ''Des Moines Register'' January 14, 2010 http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=20101140355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iowa territorial seal==
The state seal supplanted the [[Iowa Territory]] seal (1838–1846), which consisted of a Federal eagle holding an arrow in its mouth and a bow in its talon. "The Seal of Iowa contains the following simple device: An Eagle In the attitude of flight grasping in its dexter talon a Bow and holding in its beak an arrow. Around the border of the seal are the words, SEAL OF THE TERRITORY OF IOWA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willson|first=Marcius|title=American history: comprising historical sketches of the Indian tribes|publisher=Moore and Co.|location=New York|year=1847|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territorial seal was the basis for other state seals, including the first seal of the [[University of Iowa]] and the [[State Historical Society of Iowa]], as well as the Civil War Arms of Iowa; these later seals had the bow held in the left talon, rather than the right.

The Territorial seal was well liked as a simple image of the state and was used on state documents well into the 1860s, even after it had been officially replaced. "It is regarded as perfectly expressive of a distinct idea, intimately associated with the history of the delightful country which we have the happiness to inhabit... The slightest examination of the seal will disclose to the Honorable Council the eagle, the proud and appropriate emblem of our national power, bearing in its beak an Indian arrow, and clutching in its talons an unstrung bow; and while the idea thus delicately evolved is so well calculated to make the eye glisten with patriotic pride, and cause the heart to beat high with the pulsations of conscious superiority, it nevertheless presents a touching appeal to our manly sensibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parvin|first=T.|title=Territorial Sea of Iowa|journal=Annals of Iowa|date=April 1864|pages=264–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''standard illuminant''' is a theoretical source of [[visible light]] with a profile (its [[spectral power distribution]]) which is published. Standard illuminants provide a basis for comparing images or colors recorded under different lighting.

==CIE illuminants==
The [[International Commission on Illumination]] (usually abbreviated '''CIE''' for its French name) is the body responsible for publishing all of the well-known standard illuminants. Each of these is known by a letter or by a letter-number combination.

Illuminants A, B, and C were introduced in 1931, with the intention of respectively representing average incandescent light, direct sunlight, and average daylight. Illuminants D represent phases of daylight, Illuminant E is the equal-energy illuminant, while Illuminants F represent fluorescent lamps of various composition.

There are instructions on how to experimentally produce light sources ("standard sources") corresponding to the older illuminants. For the relatively newer ones (such as series D), experimenters are left to measure to profiles of their sources and compare them to the published spectra:&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;
{{quote|At present no artificial source is recommended to realize CIE standard illuminant D65 or any other illuminant D of different CCT. It is hoped that new developments in light sources and filters will eventually offer sufficient basis for a CIE recommendation.|CIE|Technical Report (2004) Colorimetry, 3rd ed., Publication 15:2004, CIE Central Bureau, Vienna}}

Nevertheless, they do provide a measure, called the [[Metamerism Index]], to assess the quality of daylight simulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=CIE Technical Report|year=1999|isbn=92-9034-051-7|title=A Method for Assessing the Quality of Daylight Simulators for Colorimetry|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/51-2-99.html|series=51.2-1999 (including Supplement 1-1999)|quote=A method is provided for evaluating the suitability of a test source as a simulator of CIE Standard Illuminants D55, D65, or D75. The Supplement, prepared in 1999, adds the CIE Illuminant D50 to the line of illuminants where the method can be applied to. For each of these standard illuminants, spectral radiance factor data are supplied for five pairs of nonfluorescent samples that are metameric matches. The colorimetric differences of the five pairs are computed for the test illuminant; the average of these differences is taken as the visible range metamerism index and is used as a measure of the quality of the test illuminant as a simulator for nonfluorescent samples. For fluorescent samples, the quality is further assessed in terms of an ultraviolet range metamerism index, defined as the average of the colorimetric differences computed with the test illuminant for three further pairs of samples, each pair consisting of a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent sample which are metameric under the standard illuminant.|publisher=Bureau central de la CIE|location=Paris|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416151749/http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/51-2-99.html|archivedate=2008-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=CIE Standard|title=Standard Method of Assessing the Spectral Quality of Daylight Simulators for Visual Appraisal and Measurement of Colour|series=S012/E:2004|year=2004|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/s012.html}} Prepared by TC 1-53 "A Standard Method for Assessing the Quality of Daylight Simulators".

In a manner similar to the [[color rendering index]], the average difference between the metamers is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of the quality of different D65 simulators for visual assessment|first=Yuk-Ming|last=Lam|author2=Xin, John H. |date=August 2002|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|volume=27|issue=4|pages=243–251|doi=10.1002/col.10061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminant A===
The CIE defines illuminant A in these terms:
{{quote|CIE standard illuminant A is intended to represent typical, domestic, tungsten-filament lighting. Its relative spectral power distribution is that of a Planckian radiator at a temperature of approximately 2856&amp;nbsp;K. CIE standard illuminant A should be used in all applications of colorimetry involving the use of incandescent lighting, unless there are specific reasons for using a different illuminant.|CIE|[http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/s005.html CIE Standard Illuminants for Colorimetry]}}

The [[spectral radiant exitance]] of a [[black body]] follows [[Planck's law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;M_{e,\lambda}(\lambda, T) = \frac{c_1 \lambda^{-5}}{\exp\left(\frac{c_2}{\lambda T}\right) - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

At the time of standardizing illuminant A, both &lt;math&gt;c_1=2\pi \cdot h \cdot c^2&lt;/math&gt; (which does not affect the relative SPD) and &lt;math&gt;c_2=h \cdot c/k&lt;/math&gt; were different. In 1968, the estimate of c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was revised from 0.01438&amp;nbsp;m·K to 0.014388&amp;nbsp;m·K (and before that, it was 0.01435 m·K when illuminant A was standardized). This difference shifted the [[Planckian locus]], changing the color temperature of the illuminant from its nominal 2848&amp;nbsp;K to 2856&amp;nbsp;K:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{new} = T_{old} \times \frac{1.438,8}{1.435} = 2,848\ \text{K} \times 1.002,648 = 2,855.54\ \text{K}.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to avoid further possible changes in the color temperature, the CIE now specifies the SPD directly, based on the original (1931) value of c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_{A}(\lambda) = 100\left(\frac{560}{\lambda}\right)^5 \frac{\exp \frac{1.435 \times 10^7}{2,848 \times 560} - 1}{\exp\frac{1.435 \times 10^7}{2,848 \lambda} - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients have been selected to achieve a normalized SPD of {{nowrap|100}} at {{nowrap|560 nm}}. The tristimulus values are {{nowrap|1=(''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'') = (109.85, 100.00, 35.58)}}, and the chromaticity coordinates using the standard observer are {{nowrap|1=(''x'', ''y'') = (0.447,58, 0.407,45)}}.

===Illuminants B and C===
Illuminants B and C are easily achieved daylight simulations. They modify Illuminant A by using liquid filters. B served as a representative of noon sunlight, with a [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT) of 4874&amp;nbsp;K, while C represented average day light with a CCT of 6774&amp;nbsp;K. Unfortunately, they are poor approximations of any phase of natural daylight, particularly in the short-wave visible and in the ultraviolet spectral ranges. Once more realistic simulations were achievable, Illuminants B &amp; C were deprecated in favor of the D series:&lt;ref name=schanda&gt;{{cite book|title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|first=János|last=Schanda|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|year=2007|chapter=3: CIE Colorimetry|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|pages=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Lighting cabinets, such as the Spectralight III, that use filtered incandescent lamps have better fits to the D illuminants in the {{nowrap|400 nm}} to {{nowrap|700 nm}} range than do the fluorescent daylight simulators.&lt;ref name=Wyszecki&gt;{{cite journal|title=Development of New CIE Sources for Colorimetry|first=Gunter|last=Wyszecki|publisher= |date=1970|journal=Die Farbe|volume=19|pages=43-}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{quote|Illuminant C does not have the status of CIE standard illuminants but its relative spectral power distribution, tristimulus values and chromaticity coordinates are given in Table T.1 and Table T.3, as many practical measurement instruments and calculations still use this illuminant.|CIE|Publication 15:2004&lt;ref name=cie2004/&gt;}} Illuminant B was not so honored in 2004.

The liquid filters, designed by [[Raymond Davis, Jr.]] and Kasson S. Gibson in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Raymond|last=Davis|author2=Gibson, Kasson S. |title=Filters for the reproduction of sunlight and daylight and the determination of color temperature|publisher=[[National Bureau of Standards]]|date=January 21, 1931|journal=Precision Measurement and Calibration|volume=10|pages=641–805}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a relatively high absorbance at the red end of the spectrum, effectively increasing the CCT of the [[incandescent lamp]] to daylight levels. This is similar in function to a CTO [[color gel]] that photographers and cinematographers use today, albeit much less convenient.

Each filter uses a pair of solutions, comprising specific amounts of distilled water, [[copper sulfate]], [[mannite]], [[pyridine]], [[sulfuric acid]], [[cobalt]], and [[ammonium sulfate]]. The solutions are separated by a sheet of uncolored glass. The amounts of the ingredients are carefully chosen so that their combination yields a color temperature conversion filter; that is, the filtered light is still white.

They are difficult to produce artificially, but are easy to characterize mathematically.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; had independently measured the spectral power distribution (SPD) of daylight from {{nowrap|330 nm}} to {{nowrap|700 nm}}, totaling among them 622 samples. Judd ''et al.'' analyzed these samples and found that the (''x'', ''y'') chromaticity coordinates had a simple, [[quadratic function|quadratic]] relation:
:&lt;math&gt;y = 2.870 x - 3.000 x^2 - 0.275.&lt;/math&gt;

Simonds supervised the [[characteristic vector analysis]] of the SPDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[JOSA]]|first=John L.|last=Simonds|title=Application of Characteristic Vector Analysis to Photographic and Optical Response Data|volume=53|issue=8|pages=968–974|date=August 1963| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-53-8-968|doi=10.1364/JOSA.53.000968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A review of principal component analysis and its applications to color technology|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|first=Di-Yuan|last=Tzeng|author2=Berns, Roy S. |volume=30|issue=2|pages=84–98|date=April 2005|doi=10.1002/col.20086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of his method revealed that the SPDs could be satisfactorily approximated by using the mean (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and first two characteristic vectors (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;S(\lambda) = S_0(\lambda) + M_1 S_1(\lambda) + M_2 S_2(\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

In simpler terms, the SPD of the studied daylight samples can be expressed as the [[linear combination]] of three, fixed SPDs. The first vector (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is the mean of all the SPD samples, which is the best reconstituted SPD that can be formed with only a fixed vector. The second vector (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) corresponds to yellow–blue variation, accounting for changes in the correlated color temperature due to presence or absence of clouds or direct sunlight.&lt;ref name=jmw/&gt; The third vector (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) corresponds to pink–green variation caused by the presence of water in the form of vapor and haze.&lt;ref name=jmw/&gt;

To construct a daylight simulator of a particular correlated color temperature one merely needs to know the coefficients M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the characteristic vectors S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:CIE illuminants D components.svg|right|thumb|250px|Characteristic vectors of illuminant D; component SPDs S0 (blue), S1 (green), S2 (red).]]

Expressing the chromaticities x and y as:
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{X_0 + M_1 X_1 + M_2 X_2}{S_0 + M_1 S_1 + M_2 S_2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{Y_0 + M_1 Y_1 + M_2 Y_2}{S_0 + M_1 S_1 + M_2 S_2}&lt;/math&gt;
and making use of known tristimulus values for the mean vectors, they were able to express M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:

[[File:Planckian-locus.png|thumb|Kelly's figures depicted the lines of constant correlated color temperature on the CIE 1960 UCS, as shown here, as well as the familiar xy diagram.]]

:&lt;math&gt;M_1 = \frac{-1.351,5 - 1.770,3 x + 5.911,4 y}{0.024,1 + 0.256,2 x - 0.734,1 y},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2 = \frac{0.030,0 - 31.442,4 x + 30.071,7 y}{0.024,1 + 0.256,2 x - 0.734,1 y}.&lt;/math&gt;

The only problem is that this left unsolved the computation of the coordinate &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for a particular phase of daylight. Judd ''et al.'' simply tabulated the values of certain chromaticity coordinates, corresponding to commonly used correlated color temperatures, such as 5500&amp;nbsp;K, 6500&amp;nbsp;K, and 7500&amp;nbsp;K. For other color temperatures, one could consult figures made by Kelly.&lt;ref name=kelly&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Kenneth L.|date=August 1963|title=Lines of Constant Correlated Color Temperature Based on MacAdam's (u,v) Uniform Chromaticity Transformation of the CIE Diagram|journal=JOSA|volume=53|issue=8|pages=999–1002| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-53-8-999|doi=10.1364/JOSA.53.000999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was addressed in the CIE report that formalized illuminant D, with an approximation of the x coordinate in terms of the reciprocal color temperature, valid from 4000&amp;nbsp;K to 25,000&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Proceedings of the 15th Session, Vienna|author=Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The y coordinate trivially followed from Judd's quadratic relation.

Judd ''et al.'' then extended the reconstituted SPDs to {{nowrap|300 nm}}–{{nowrap|330 nm}} and {{nowrap|700 nm}}–{{nowrap|830 nm}} by using Moon's spectral absorbance data of the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proposed standard solar-radiation curves for engineering use| first=Parry|last=Moon|date=November 1940|volume=230|issue=5|pages=583–617|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|doi=10.1016/S0016-0032(40)90364-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tabulated SPDs presented by the CIE today are derived by [[linear interpolation]] of the {{nowrap|10 nm}} data set down to {{nowrap|5 nm}}. &lt;ref&gt;[http://files.cie.co.at/204.xls CIE 1931 and 1964 Standard Colorimetric Observers] from {{nowrap|380 nm}} to {{nowrap|780 nm}} in increments of {{nowrap|5 nm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar studies have been undertaken in other parts of the world, or repeating Judd ''et al.'''s analysis with modern computational methods. In several of these studies, the daylight locus is notably closer to the Planckian locus than in Judd ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Studies from the 1960s and 1970s include:

; Computation:
The relative [[spectral power distribution]] (SPD) &lt;math&gt;S_D (\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; of a D series illuminant can be derived from its [[chromaticity coordinate]]s in the [[CIE 1931 color space]], &lt;math&gt;(x_D,y_D)&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;The coefficients differ from those in the original paper due to the change in the constants in [[Planck's law]]. See [http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_DIlluminant.html Lindbloom] for the current version, and [[Planckian locus]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
x_D = \begin{cases}
0.244,063 + 0.09911 \frac{10^3}{T} + 2.967,8 \frac{10^6}{T^2} - 4.607,0 \frac{10^9}{T^3} &amp; 4,000\ \mathrm{K} \leq T \leq 7,000\ \ \mathrm{K} \\

\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_D = -3.000 x_D^2 + 2.870 x_D - 0.275&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' is the illuminant's CCT. The chromaticity coordinates of the Illuminants D are said to form the ''CIE Daylight Locus''. The relative SPD is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;S_D(\lambda) = S_0(\lambda) + M_1 S_1(\lambda) + M_2 S_2(\lambda),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_1 = (-1.351,5 - 1.770,3 x_D + 5.911,4 y_D)/M,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2 = (0.030,00 - 31.442,4 x_D + 30.071,7 y_D)/M,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M = 0.024,1 + 0.256,2 x_D - 0.734,1 y_D&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S_0(\lambda), S_1(\lambda), S_2(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; are the mean and first two [[eigenvector]] SPDs, depicted above.&lt;ref name=bruce/&gt; The characteristic vectors both have a zero at {{nowrap|560 nm}}, since all the relative SPDs have been normalized about this point.

The CCTs of the canonical illuminants, D&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;65&lt;/sub&gt;, and D&lt;sub&gt;75&lt;/sub&gt;, differ slightly from what their names suggest. For example, D50 has a CCT of 5003&amp;nbsp;K ("horizon" light), while [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] has a CCT of 6504&amp;nbsp;K (noon light). As explained in a previous section, this is because the value of the constants in Planck's law have been slightly changed since the definition of these canonical illuminants, whose SPDs are based on the original values in Planck's law. In order to match all significant digits of the published data of the canonical illuminants the values of M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have to be rounded to three decimal places before calculation of ''S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;.''&lt;ref name="schanda" /&gt;

===Illuminant E===
Illuminant E is an equal-energy radiator; it has a constant SPD inside the [[visible spectrum]]. It is useful as a theoretical reference; an illuminant that gives equal weight to all wavelengths, presenting an even color. It also has equal [[CIE XYZ]] tristimulus values, thus its chromaticity coordinates are (x,y)=(1/3,1/3). This is by design; the XYZ color matching functions are normalized such that their integrals over the visible spectrum are the same.&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;

[[File:Planckian-locus.png|thumb|right|Illuminant E is beneath the Planckian locus, and roughly isothermal with D&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

Illuminant E is not a black body, so it does not have a color temperature, but it can be approximated by a D series illuminant with a CCT of 5455&amp;nbsp;K. (Of the canonical illuminants, D&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt; is the closest.) Manufacturers sometimes compare light sources against Illuminant E to calculate the [[colorfulness#Excitation purity|excitation purity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Philips|title=Optical Testing for SuperFlux, SnapLED and LUXEON Emitters|url=http://www.philipslumileds.com/pdfs/AB08.pdf|quote=CIE has defined the color coordinates of several different white Illuminants, but within Lumileds, CIE Illuminant E is used for all color calculations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminant series F===
The '''F''' series of illuminants represent various types of [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]].

F1–F6 "standard" fluorescent lamps consist of two semi-broadband emissions of [[antimony]] and [[manganese]] activations in calcium halophosphate [[phosphor]].&lt;ref&gt;For commercial examples of calcium halophosphate fluorescents, see for example {{patent|US|5447660|Method for making a calcium halophosphate phosphor}} or {{patent|US|6666993|Single component calcium halophosphate phosphor}}&lt;/ref&gt; F4 is of particular interest since it was used for calibrating the CIE [[color rendering index]] (the CRI formula was chosen such that F4 would have a CRI of 51). F7–F9 are "broadband" ([[full-spectrum light]]) fluorescent lamps with multiple phosphors, and higher CRIs. Finally, F10–F12 are narrow triband illuminants consisting of three "narrowband" emissions (caused by ternary compositions of rare-earth phosphors) in the R,G,B regions of the visible spectrum. The phosphor weights can be tuned to achieve the desired CCT.

The spectra of these illuminants are published in Publication 15:2004.&lt;ref name=cie2004&gt;{{cite book|author=CIE Technical Report|year=2004|title=Colorimetry|edition=3rd|series=Publication 15:2004|publisher=CIE Central Bureau, Vienna|isbn=3-901906-33-9|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213035758/http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html|archivedate=2008-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/CIE/Fluorescents.htm Spectral power distribution of Illuminants Series F] ([http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/CIE/Fluorescents.xls Excel]), in {{nowrap|5 nm}} increments from {{nowrap|380 nm}} to {{nowrap|780 nm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Illuminant series L===
Publication of an '''L''' series of illuminants is expected mid-2018. It will represent various types of [[LED lamp|LED lighting]].

==White point==
{{main|White point}}
The spectrum of a standard illuminant, like any other profile of light, can be converted into [[tristimulus value]]s. The set of three tristimulus coordinates of an illuminant is called a ''white point''. If the profile is [[Normalizing constant|normalized]], then the white point can equivalently be expressed as a pair of [[chromaticity coordinate]]s.

If an image is recorded in tristimulus coordinates (or in values which can be converted to and from them), then the white point of the illuminant used gives the maximum value of the tristimulus coordinates that will be recorded at any point in the image, in the absence of [[fluorescence]]. It is called the white point of the image.

The process of calculating the white point discards a great deal of information about the profile of the illuminant, and so although it is true that for every illuminant the exact white point can be calculated, it is not the case that knowing the white point of an image alone tells you a great deal about the illuminant that was used to record it.

'''''The Loves of the Gods''''' is a monumental [[fresco]] cycle, completed by the Bolognese artist [[Annibale Carracci]] and his studio,  in the Farnese Gallery which is located in the west wing of the [[Palazzo Farnese]], now the French Embassy, in Rome. The frescoes were greatly admired at the time, and were later considered to reflect a significant change  in painting style away from sixteenth century [[Mannerism]] in anticipation of the development of [[Baroque]] and [[Classicism]] in Rome during the seventeenth century.

==Production==
Cardinal [[Odoardo Farnese]], [[Pope Paul III]]'s nephew, commissioned Annibale Carracci and his workshop to decorate the barrel-vaulted gallery on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' of the family palace. Work was started in 1597 and was not entirely finished until 1608, one year before Annibale's death.&lt;ref&gt;When the Farnese frescoes were nearly complete, Cardinal Odoardo paid him an insultingly small sum of 500 ''scudi d'oro'' or pieces of gold which were brought to his room on a saucer.  Annibale, physically exhausted after his work on the vault and profoundly upset by his brother Agostino's defection, reacted sharply to his patron's callous and ungrateful behavior and fell into a state of depression, lasting until his death in 1609.&lt;/ref&gt; 
His brother [[Agostino Carracci|Agostino]] joined him from 1597 to 1600, and other artists in the workshop included [[Giovanni Lanfranco]], [[Francesco Albani]], [[Domenichino]], and [[Sisto Badalocchio]].

==Scheme and interpretations==
[[File:Annibale Carracci, Volta Farnese, Eros e Anteros.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Cupid and Anteros wrestling framed by Atlantes and Ignudi.]]
Annibale Carracci had first decorated a small room, the [[The Camerino Farnese|Camerino]] (1595-7), with scenes from the life of [[Hercules]]. The Herculean theme was probably selected because the [[Farnese Hercules]] was standing at the time in the Palazzo Farnese.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} This concept of art imitating ancient art seems to have been carried over to the large Gallery. While performing graduate research on the Gallery, [[Thomas Hoving]], later director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], pointed out many correspondences between the frescoes and items in the famous [[Farnese Collection]] of Roman sculpture. Much of the collection is now housed in the [[Capodimonte Museum]] and [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Naples]] but, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it was arranged according to themes within the Palazzo Farnese. Hoving's suggestion that many details of the frescoes were designed to complement the marbles below has been generally accepted.&lt;ref name="hoving"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/hoving/hoving5-26-09.asp |title=Artful Tom, A Memoir, Chapter 20. Master and Doctor |last=Hoving |first=Thomas |date=26 May 2009 |website=Artnet |access-date=February 6, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1597, Carracci began to decorate the Gallery with scenes depicting the loves of the gods set within frames (''[[Quadro riportato|quadri riportati]]'') and faux bronze [[Tondo (art)|medallions]] painted on an [[Illusionistic ceiling painting|illusionistic]] architectural framework referred to as ''[[quadratura]]''. [[Sistine Chapel ceiling#Ignudi|Ignudi]], [[putti]], [[satyr]]s, [[grotesque]]s, and standing [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlas]] figures (Atlantes) help support the painted framework.

[[Gian Pietro Bellori]], a biographer of seventeenth-century artists and [[Platonic idealism|Platonic]] apologist, called the cycle "Human Love Governed by Celestial Love". This observation was based principally on Carracci's depiction of putti representing [[Cupid]] (equated by Bellori with profane love) and [[Anteros]] (equated with sacred love) found at the four corners of the vault. For example, Bellori writes:&lt;ref name="bellori"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bellori |first=Giovan Pietro |date= |title=Giovan Pietro Bellori: The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC |editor-last=Wohl |editor-first=Hellmut |translator-last=Wohl |translator-first=Alice Sedgwick |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=84 |isbn=0521781876 |author-link=Giovanni Pietro Bellori }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The painter wished to represent with various symbols the war and peace between heavenly and common love formulated by Plato. On one side he painted Heavenly Love wrestling with Common Love and pulling him by the hair: this is the philosophy and most sacred law that removes the soul from vice, raising it on high. Accordingly, a crown of immortal laurel is resplendent overhead amid brilliant light, demonstrating that victory over the irrational appetites raises men up to heaven.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hoving saw it differently. In his memoir, he writes:&lt;ref name="hoving" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;My lucky discovery destroyed the accepted interpretation of Annibale's fresco cycle as a "Neo-Platonic visual essay about celestial love's supremacy over physical passion." The paintings were actually both an entertaining celebration of a bunch of randy Olympians hitting on each other and also an up-scale mind game paying homage to Odoardo's fine antiquities collection.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Scenes on the vault==
[[File:Volta della Galleria Farnese dopo il restauro del 2015.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''The Loves of the Gods'' on the vault of the Farnese Gallery]]
In addition to the putti shown at the four corners, ''The Loves of the Gods'' are depicted on the vault in thirteen narrative scenes. Complementing them, there are twelve medallions painted to appear as bronze [[relief]]s. These medallions portray additional stories of love, abduction, and tragedy. The scenes are arranged as follows:

*Central row (from left to right in the accompanying image): ''Pan and Diana'', ''The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne'', and ''Mercury and Paris''.

Beginning in the lower left and proceeding counter-clockwise around the vault, the remaining scenes are:

*West side (from left to right in the lower portion of the accompanying image): ''Jupiter and Juno'', Marine scene (traditionally ''The Triumph of Galatea''), and ''Diana and Endymion''.
*Medallions on the west side (from left to right): ''Apollo and Marsyas'', ''Boreas and Orithyia'', ''Orpheus and Euridice'', and ''The Rape of Europa''.
*South side (on the right of the accompanying image): ''Apollo and Hyacinth'' above ''Polyphemus and Galatea''.
*Medallions on the south side: Possible scene of abduction and ''Jason and the Golden Fleece''.
*East side (from right to left in the upper portion of the accompanying image): ''Hercules and Iole'', ''Aurora and Cephalus'', and ''Venus and Anchises''.
*Medallions on the east side (from right to left): ''Hero and Leander'', ''Pan and Syrinx'', ''Salmacis and Hermaphroditus'', and ''Cupid and Pan''.
*North side (on the left of the accompanying image): ''The Rape of Ganymede'' above ''Polyphemus and Acis''.
*Medallions on the north side: ''Judgement of Paris'' and ''Pan and Apollo''.

===''The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne''===
[[Image:The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne - Annibale Carracci - 1597 - Farnese Gallery, Rome.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne'']]
Prominently displayed in the center panel, the ''Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne'' depicts a both riotous and classically restrained procession which ferries [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] and [[Ariadne]] to their lovers' bed.  Here, the underlying myth is that Bacchus, the god of wine, had gained the love of the abandoned princess, Ariadne. The procession recalls the [[Roman triumph|triumph]]s of the Republican and Imperial Roman era, in which the parades of victorious leaders had the laurel-crowned ‘imperator’ in a white chariot with two white horses. In Carracci's procession, the two lovers are seated in chariots drawn by tigers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Io Triumpe – Greeting a God |work= |publisher=Trionfi.com |date = |url=http://trionfi.com/0/t/01/index.php | accessdate=December 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and goats, and accompanied by a parade of nymphs, bacchanti, and trumpeting satyrs. At the fore, Bacchus' tutor, the paunchy, ugly, and leering drunk [[Silenus]], rides an ass. The figures carefully cavort in order to hide most naked male genitals.&lt;ref&gt;The painter's cousin [[Ludovico Carracci]] engraved uncensored versions in [[old master print|prints]] of the scenes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Also, in contrast to the ceiling's intimation rather than outright depiction of mythological [[sexual intercourse|lovemaking]], there are [[Agostino Carracci#Erotic work|erotic engravings]] by the painter's brother Agostino – the [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=lascivie&amp;images=true ''Lascivie''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The program refers to [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (VIII; lines 160-182) and the spirit alludes to contemporary images voiced, for example, in a trifling [[carnival song]]-poem written by [[Lorenzo de Medici]] in about 1475, that entreats:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne | work = | publisher =Trionfi.com | date = | url =http://trionfi.com/0/gg/103/t.html | accessdate =December 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is even more explicit in Agostino's [[cartoon#fine art|cartoon]] found in the [[National Gallery]] in London. In the cartoon, there is no intervening cloth between his groping hand and her flesh. The scowling head of the principal male is a parody of an ancient bust of [[Caracalla|Emperor Caracalla]] which would have been found in a niche in the gallery below.{{sfn|Dempsey|1995|p=56}}

Annibale Carracci's decorations in the Farnese Gallery demonstrated a new grand manner of monumental fresco painting.&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, Rudolf. ''Art and Architecture in Italy 1600–1750'', Pelican History of Art, 1985 edn., p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; They exerted a powerful formative influence on both canvas and fresco painting in Rome during the seventeenth century. The dual classicizing and baroque tendencies in this work would fuel the debate by the next generation of fresco painters, between [[Andrea Sacchi|Sacchi]] and [[Pietro da Cortona]], over the number of figures to be included in a painting.&lt;ref&gt;This debate took place at the ''Accademia di San Luca'', the guild for artists in Rome; see the article on [[Andrea Sacchi]] for more discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Carracci's treatment of the composition and the disposition and expression of the figures would influence painters such as Sacchi and [[Poussin]], whereas his effervescent narrative manner influenced Cortona.

[[File:Venus and Anchises.jpg|thumb|left|''Venus and Anchises'', showing fictive (painted) sculptural elements surrounding the scene.]]
Annibale Carracci, in his day, was seen as one of the key painters to revive the classical style. In contrast, a few years later, artists such as [[Caravaggio]] and his followers would rebel against representing spatial depth in colour and light, and introduce tenebrous dramatic realism into their art instead. But it would be inappropriate to view Annibale Carracci as solely the continuation of an inherited tradition; in his day, his vigorous and dynamic style, and that of his studio assistants, changed the pre-eminent style of painting in Rome. His work would have been seen as liberating for artists of his day, touching on pagan themes with an unconstrained joy. It could be said that while Mannerism had mastered the art of formal strained ''[[contraposto]]'' and contorsion; Annibale Carracci had depicted dance and joy.

Later followers of Neoclassic formalism and severity frowned on the excesses of Annibale Carracci,  but in his day, he would have been seen as masterful in achieving the supreme approximation to classic beauty  in the tradition of [[Raphael]] and [[Giulio Romano]]'s [[c:Loggia of Psyche (Villa Farnesina, Rome)|secular frescoes]] in the Loggia of the [[Villa Farnesina]].&lt;ref&gt;The Villa Farnesina was acquired by the same family, but built earlier for [[Agostino Chigi]] at the foot of the Janiculum Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Raphael, though, his figures can display a [[Michelangelo]]-esque muscularity, and depart from the often emotionless visages of High Renaissance painting.&lt;ref&gt;It has been said that Carracci and his school blended Venetian colorism with the Florentine-Umbrian attention to drawing and design; yet this is best seen in the oil canvases rather than the frescoes in the Farnese.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

[[File:William Orpen - The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors.jpg|thumb|300x300px|''The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28th June 1919'']]

'''''The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28 June 1919''''' is an [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by Irish artist [[William Orpen]], completed in 1919. It was one the paintings commissioned from Orpen to commemorate of the [[Versailles Peace Conference|Peace Conference]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1919.  The work is held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London.

==Background==
Orpen was one of the first people chosen as a [[war artist]] by the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in 1917.  Orpen was also official painter at the peace conference, and was commissioned to paint three canvases to record the proceedings.  The work was the most expensive of the British public art commissions associated with the First World War: Orpen was paid £3,000: by comparison, [[John Singer Sargent]] received £300 for his much larger painting ''[[Gassed (painting)|Gassed]]''.

The painting depicts the signature of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] by representatives from Germany on 28 June 1919, to formally end the [[First World War]].  It is a [[group portrait]] depicting soldiers, diplomats and politicians who attended the conference, at the point when the treaty was signed in the opulent surroundings of [[Louis XIV]]'s [[Hall of Mirrors]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. High up can be seen the words "Le Roy Gouverne par lui meme" (French: "The King governs alone").  It measures {{convert|152.4|xx|127|cm|in}}.

Orpen grew to dislike the politicians at the conference, considering them vain and greedy.  In his painting, they are dwarfed by the scale of the palace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5753">'''Theatre criticism''' is a genre of [[arts criticism]], and the act of writing or speaking about the [[performing arts]] such as a [[play (theatre)|play]] or [[opera]].

Theatre criticism is distinct from drama criticism, as the later is a division of literary criticism whereas the former is a critique of the theatrical performance. Dramas or plays as long as they stay in the print form remain a part of literature. They become a part of the performing arts as soon as the written words of the drama are transformed into performance on the stage or any arena suitable for viewers to see. So the literary craft gives birth to a stage production. Likewise a criticism of a written play has a different character from that of a theatre performance. 

==Criticism vs Review==

There is a distinctive dissimilarity between theatre criticism and a theatre review. Both of them deal with the dramatic arts as they are performed. But they are done in different ways and for different purposes. Both have strong rationalities to support the observations expressed, both are analytical, and both deal with the commendable as well as the blemishes of the production. A theatre review is a short essay for the ordinary uninitiated readers who get to know about the play being performed, about the group staging the play, and its director and other actors. Basically a review is a subjective discourse hinting on the cultural and artistic significance of the production. The storyline is discussed as it is believed to be the mainstay of the production. The discussion reflects an instant reaction of viewing the performance. An overall clinical analysis of each department of the production, like that of acting, stage craft, lighting designs and its implementation, background scoring, dress and costume designing, make-up etc., and even the script that had been prepared for the staging, is made by the reviewer. A review is published during the period when the play is ‘on’, that is, when the play is being regularly staged. This requires a speedy writing of the piece. Thus, a review lacks any deep analytical discourse or investigative studies of the different aspects. It never gives any conclusive verdict about the production, as such. 

Theatre criticism, on the other hand, is a deep analytical discourse of the production against the backdrop of the theatre-arts as a whole. The social and political bearings that have relevance to the play are highlighted, so also the cultural import. Hence, the discussion becomes a highly theoretical objective discourse on the historical significance of the production. Criticism thus is an academic dissertation that is usually lengthy and may take a considerable time to write. The piece may be published even after the regular staging of the play has been suspended or stopped, or a subsequent production of a different play has been started by the group. Technicalities of the different aspects of the production are discussed in details together with exhaustive analysis of the rationalities of their execution. Criticism thus is an anatomical scrutiny of the production. The play is not discussed in detail as such, as it is job of the literary critic.

A '''treasure binding''', or '''jewelled bookbinding''' / '''jeweled bookbinding''' is a luxurious [[book cover]] using [[metalwork]] in gold or silver, jewels or [[ivory]], perhaps in addition to more usual [[bookbinding]] material for book-covers such as leather, velvet, or other cloth.  The actual bookbinding technique is the same as for other medieval books, with the folios, normally of [[vellum]], stitched together and bound to wooden cover boards.  The metal furnishings of the treasure binding are then fixed, normally by tacks, onto these boards.  Treasure bindings appear to have existed from at least [[Late Antiquity]], though there are no surviving examples from so early, and [[Early Medieval]] examples are very rare.  They were less used by the end of the Middle Ages, but a few continued to be produced in the West even up to the present day, and many more in areas where [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] predominated.  The bindings were mainly used on grand [[illuminated manuscript]]s, especially [[Gospel book]]s designed for the altar and use in church services, rather than study in the library.

The vast majority of these bookbindings were later destroyed as their valuable gold and jewels were removed by looters, or the owners when in need of cash.  Others survive without their jewels, and many are either no longer attached to a book, or have been moved to a different book.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [[Lindau Gospels]]; as removing and attaching cover plates is relatively easy, moving them between books seems to have been common at all periods. In the last 200 years many art dealers have preferred to treat book and cover as different objects, and have separated them&lt;/ref&gt;  Some survive in major libraries - for example the [[Morgan Library]] in [[New York City]], the [[John Rylands Library]] in [[Manchester]], the [[British Library]] in [[London]] and the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in [[Paris]].  As the carved ivory reliefs often used could not usually be recycled, these survive in much larger numbers, giving a better idea of the numbers of treasure bindings that once existed.  Other examples are recorded in documentary sources but though the books survive the covers do not.  The [[Book of Kells]] lost its binding after a robbery, and the fate of the missing cover of the [[Book of Lindisfarne]] is not recorded.

In the Eastern Orthodox churches treasure bindings have continued to be produced, mainly for liturgical Gospel books, up to the present day, and exist in many different artistic styles. Other styles of binding using gems, and typically pearls, have a covering of [[velvet]] or other textile, to which the gems are sewn or otherwise fixed.  These were more likely to be for the private books of a grand person, especially the prayer books and [[books of hours]] of female royalty, and may also include [[embroidery]].

==Technique and Production==
The techniques for producing jewelled bookbinding have evolved over the course of history with the technologies and methods used in creating books. During the fourth century of the Christian era, manuscripts on [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] scrolls first became flattened and turned into books with cut pages tied together through holes punched in their margins. Beginning in the fifth century, books were sewn together in this manner using leather thongs to make the bind stronger and longer lasting with wooden boards placed on top and bottom to keep the pages flat. These thongs then came to be laced into the boards and covered entirely by leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Pauline|title=Creative Bookbinding|year=1990|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boards afforded the opportunity for decorative ornamentation, with metal casings set into the wood for the installation of precious gems, stones, and jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Pauline|title=Creative Bookbinding|year=1990|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover material would then be laid over the casings by hand and cut around the rim of the casings to reveal the jewels. The books typically bound were Gospels and other religious books made for use within the church. In the Middle Ages, the responsibility of creating adorned books went to metalworkers and guilders, not the bookbinders, who worked with sheets of gold, silver, or copper to create jewelled and enamelled panels that were nailed separately into the wooden boards.&lt;ref name="Marks 1998 56"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marks|first=P.J.M.|title=The British Library Guide to Bookbinding: History and Techniques|year=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Forms===
Metalwork [[book furniture]] also included metal clasps holding the book shut when not in use, and isolated metal elements decorating a leather or cloth cover, which were very common in grander libraries in the later Middle Ages.  Decorative book clasps or straps were made with jewels or [[repoussé]] metal from the 12th century onward, particularly in Holland and Germany.&lt;ref name="Foot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Foot|first=Miriam M.|title=Bookbinding|work=Oxford Art Online|accessdate=27 February 2012|author2=Robert C. Akers }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland and Ireland from the ninth century or earlier, books that were regarded as [[relic]]s of monastic leaders were enshrined in a decorated metal [[reliquary]] box called a [[cumdach]], and thereafter were probably not used as books. These were even carried into battle as a kind of standard, worn around the neck by a soldier like a protective amulet. Jewelled slipcases or boxes were also used to house small editions of the [[Qur’an]] during this time period.&lt;ref name="Marks 1998 56"/&gt;

In fashion in the 16th century were 'books of golde': small, devotional books adorned with jewelled or enamelled covers worn as a girdle or around the neck like pieces of jewellery by the English court. These pieces can be seen in portraits from the period and records of jewels from the reigns of [[Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foot|first=Miriam M.|title=Bookbinding 1400-1557|work=Cambridge Histories Online|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=28 February 2012|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Embroidered bookbinding England 16th century.jpg|thumb|Restored 16th century binding of velvet embroidered with pearls for [[Elizabeth I]], on a volume of church history.]]
Treasure bindings were a luxury affordable only by wealthy elites, and were commissioned by wealthy private collectors, churches and senior clergy and royalty, and were often commissioned for presentation by or to royal or noble persons.&lt;ref name="Foot"/&gt;  The earliest reference to them is in a letter of [[Saint Jerome]] of 384, where he "writes scornfully of the wealthy Christian women whose books are written in gold on [[purple vellum]], and clothed with gems...".&lt;ref name="Needham, 21"&gt;Needham, 21&lt;/ref&gt;  From at least the 6th century they are seen in mosaics and other images, such as the 6th century icon of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] and the famous mosaic of [[Justinian I]] in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]].  The ivory panels often placed in the centre of covers were adapted from the style of [[consular diptych]]s, and indeed a large proportion of surviving examples of those were reused on book covers in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Needham, 21"/&gt;  Some bindings were created to contain [[relic]]s of saints, and these large books were sometimes seen suspended from golden rods and carried in the public processions of [[Byzantine emperor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diehl|first=Edith|title=Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique Vol. 1|year=1980|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the [[Celtic Christianity]] of Ireland and Britain, relatively ordinary books that had belonged to monastic saints became treated as relics, and might be rebound with a treasure binding, or placed in a [[cumdach]].

The gems and gold do not merely create an impression of richness, though that was certainly part of their purpose, but served both to offer a foretaste of the bejewelled nature of the [[Celestial city]] in religious contexts, and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various "scientific", medical and magical respects, as set out in the popular [[lapidary (text)|lapidary books]].&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;  Several liturgical books given rich bindings can be shown by textual analysis to lack essential parts of the normal textual apparatus of a "working" version of their text, like the [[Book of Kells]] and the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]].  They may have been used for readings at services, but in a monastery were essentially part of the furnishings of the church rather than the library; as records from the [[Abbey of Kells]] show, the book of Kells lived in the [[sacristry]].

[[Byzantine]] and Western medieval treasure bindings are often not entirely unified in style. Apart from being completed at different times, and sometimes in different countries, elements were also removed and readapted for other volumes or reset with new pieces as time passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prideaux|first=Sarah Teverbian|title=An Historical Sketch of Bookbinding|year=1893|publisher=Lawrence and Bullen|location=London|pages=179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+Historical+Sketch+of+Bookbinding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WHZqT8r-CMbZgQeo7dGrBg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Edward Gordon Duff }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the covers now on the [[Lindau Gospels]] come from different parts of South Germany, with the lower or back cover created in the eighth century (earlier than the book they now adorn) while the upper or front cover was completed in the ninth century; both incorporate gilded metal ornamented with jewels.  It is not known when they were first used on this manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, 24-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the monasteries, the emerging bookbinders’ guilds of the Middle Ages were often restricted by law with quantitative limitations on the application of jewels. Though this did not significantly affect the craft of decorating books, it did mandate the number of jewels allowed depending on the position or rank of the commissioner of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diehl|first=Edith|title=Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique Vol. 1|year=1980|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardly any early medieval English treasure bindings survived the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] and the [[English Reformation]], when ecclesiastical libraries in England were rounded up and treasure bindings removed under an act to ‘to strip off and pay into the king’s treasury all gold and silver found on Popish books of devotion.’ Comparable depredations were not as thorough in the Continental [[Protestant Reformation]], but most bindings survive from Catholic areas that avoided later war and revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prideaux|first=Sarah Teverbian|title=An Historical Sketch of Bookbinding|year=1893|publisher=Lawrence and Bullen|location=London|pages=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+Historical+Sketch+of+Bookbinding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WHZqT8r-CMbZgQeo7dGrBg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Edward Gordon Duff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the commoditisation of book production due to the printing press, the artistic tradition of jewelled bookbinding continued in England, though less frequently and often in simpler designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Cyril|title=Cantor Lectures on Decorative Bookbinding|year=1898|publisher=William Trounce|location=London|pages=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrnPAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cantor+lectures+on+decorative+bookbinding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PXpqT60Wh-qCB6q9sLoG&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxury bindings were still favoured by the English Court, which is evident from the records on the private library of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], who favoured velvet bindings. On a visit to the Royal Library in 1598, [[Paul Hentzner]] remarked on the books ‘bound in velvet of different colours, though chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; some have pearls, and precious stones, set in their bindings.’&lt;ref name="Marks 1998 57"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marks|first=P.J.M.|title=The British Library Guide to Bookbinding: History and Techniques|year=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the style evolved to be one using velvet, satin, silk, and canvas in bookbinding decorated less with jewels and more with embroidery, metal threads, pearls, and sequins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marks|first=P.J.M.|title=The British Library Guide to Bookbinding: History and Techniques|year=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right

After jewelled bookbinding enjoyed its renaissance, the practice waned until it experienced a revival near the turn of the twentieth century in England. Highly influential in the revival of this style were [[Francis Sangorski]] and George Sutcliffe of the [[Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe]] bindery. Their bindings were not large uncut gems as in Mediaeval times, but semi-precious stones ''[[en cabochon]]'' set into beautifully designed bindings with multi-coloured leather inlays and elaborate gilt tooling. The craftsmanship of these bindings was unsurpassable; only their competitors [[Robert Riviere|Riviere]] produced work of similar quality. The most famous of these bindings is "[[The Great Omar]]" (1909) on a large copy of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|FitzGerald's]] ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', which included good tooling, inlays of coloured leather, and 1050 jewels in a peacock design scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Middleton|first=Bernard|title=A History of English Craft Bookbinding Technique|year=1996|publisher=The British Library|location=London|pages=125–126|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went down with the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' in 1912. Today, a third reproduction of this binding is the only one to survive, after the second one, reproduced to Sutcliffe’s design by his nephew Stanley Bray, was damaged in the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] during [[World War II]]. Bray’s second attempt at recreating the design, the third version that survives, was placed in the [[British Library]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="Marks 1998 57"/&gt;

Other binderies creating books in this style during this period were the companies of Rivière and [[Zaehnsdorf]].  The largest collection of these masterpieces was the Phoebe Boyle one; over 100 jewelled bindings were sold in 1923. Jewelled bindings occasionally appear at auction; literature on them is surprisingly scant given their superb quality.

In 1998, Rob Shepherd of [http://www.bookbinding.co.uk/ Shepherds Bookbinders] bought both Zaehnsdorf and Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe. Presently, binding with jewels is a rare practice, and binding companies both large and small are finding the art form becoming less viable in today’s society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Severs|first=John|title=A Model, Modern Artisan|journal=Printweek|date=27 March 2009|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bindings that exist today are housed in private collections or can be found in libraries and museums across the world.

== History ==
[[File:Flag of UNESCO.svg|thumb|[[Flag of UNESCO]]]]
UNESCO and its mandate for international cooperation can be traced back to a League of Nations resolution on 21 September 1921, to elect a Commission to study feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = League of Nations | series = Records of the Second Assembly | title = Plenary Meetings | date = 5 September – 5 October 1921 | place = Geneva}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] (ICIC) was officially created on 4 January 1922, as a consultative organ composed of individuals elected based on their personal qualifications.  The International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) was then created in Paris on 9 August 1925, to act as the executing agency for the ICIC | title = A Chronology of UNESCO: 1945–1987|url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000790/079049eb.pdf | place = Paris | date = December 1987 | id = LAD.85/WS/4 Rev | series = UNESDOC database |format= PDF | ref = {{Harvid | UNESCO |1987}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 18 December 1925, the [[International Bureau of Education]] (IBE) began work as a [[non-governmental]] organization in the service of international educational development.{{Sfn | UNESCO | 1987}}  However, the onset of [[World War II]] largely interrupted the work of these predecessor organizations.

After the signing of the [[Atlantic Charter]] and the [[Declaration of the United Nations]], the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) began meetings in London which continued from 16 November 1942 to 5 December 1945.  On 30 October 1943, the necessity for an international organization was expressed in the Moscow Declaration, agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United States and the USSR.  This was followed by the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] proposals of 9 October 1944.  Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with the recommendations of the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] (UNCIO), held in San Francisco in April–June 1945, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London 1–16 November 1945 with 44 governments represented. The idea of UNESCO was largely developed by [[Rab Butler]], the [[Minister of Education]] for the United Kingdom, who had a great deal of influence in its development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1949/jan/26/the-work-of-unesco  The work of U.N.E.S.C.O. (Hansard, 26 January 1949)].  Millbank systems. Retrieved 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the ECO/CONF, the Constitution of UNESCO was introduced and signed by 37 countries, and a Preparatory Commission was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | ref = {{Harvid | Unesco | 1945}} |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001176/117626e.pdf |title= United Nations Conference for the Establishment of an Educational and Cultural Organisation.

The first General Conference took place from 19 November to 10 December 1946, and elected Dr. [[Julian Huxley]] to Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114580e.pdf | publisher =UNESCO | year = 1947 | title = General Conference, First Session | place = UNESCO House, Paris, from 20 November to 10 December 1946.

As member states worked together over time to realize UNESCO's mandate, political and historical factors have shaped the organization's operations in particular during the Cold War, the decolonization process, and the dissolution of the USSR.

Among the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism, for example through influential [[The Race Question|statements on race]] starting with a declaration of anthropologists (among them was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]) and other scientists in 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001269/126969eb.pdf |title = UNESCO.

In 1956, the Republic of South Africa withdrew from UNESCO claiming that some of the organization's publications amounted to "interference" in the country's "racial problems."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.

UNESCO's early work in the field of education included the pilot project on fundamental education in the Marbial Valley, Haiti, started in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;The Haiti pilot project: phase one, 1947–1949. (1951). Monographs on Fundamental Education IV. UNESCO: Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;
This project was followed by expert missions to other countries, including, for example, a mission to Afghanistan in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0005/000590/059046eb.pdf |title = Debiesse, J., Benjamin, H. and Abbot, W.

In 1948, UNESCO recommended that Member States should make free primary education compulsory and universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114591e.pdf#xml=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;set=4CFE6AEC_1_103&amp;hits_rec=1&amp;hits_lng=eng |title=UNESCO.

In 1990, the World Conference on Education for All, in [[Jomtien]], Thailand, launched a global movement to provide basic education for all children, youths and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000975/097551e.pdf |title=UNDP, UNESCO, UNICEF, and The World Bank.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ten years later, the 2000 [[World Education Forum]] held in [[Dakar]], Senegal, led member governments to commit to achieving basic education for all by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001211/121147e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

UNESCO's early activities in culture included, for example, the Nubia Campaign, launched in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000419/041943eb.pdf |title=UNESCO.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The purpose of the campaign was to move the [[Great and Small Temples of Abu Simbel|Great Temple of Abu Simbel]] to keep it from being swamped by the Nile after construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. During the 20-year campaign, 22 monuments and architectural complexes were relocated. This was the first and largest in a series of campaigns including [[Mohenjo-daro]] (Pakistan), [[Fes]] (Morocco), [[Kathmandu]] (Nepal), [[Borobudur]] (Indonesia) and the [[Acropolis]] (Greece).
The organization's work on heritage led to the adoption, in 1972, of the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114044e.pdf |title=Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.

The [[World Heritage Committee]] was established in 1976 and the first sites inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000347/034793eb.pdf |title=UNESCO.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate = 8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then important legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been adopted by UNESCO member states in 2003 (Convention for the Safeguarding of the [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001331/133171e.pdf |title=Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.

An intergovernmental meeting of UNESCO in Paris in December 1951 led to the creation of the European Council for Nuclear Research, which was responsible for establishing the [[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001137/113790e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

Arid Zone programming, 1948–1966, is another example of an early major UNESCO project in the field of natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114593e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

Volume II: Resolutions. (UNESCO: Paris). 2 C/Resolution 3.7, page 23. UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1968, UNESCO organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, a problem which continues to be addressed in the field of sustainable development. The main outcome of the 1968 conference was the creation of UNESCO's [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000677/067785eo.pdf |title="Use and conservation of the biosphere: Proceedings of the intergovernmental conference of experts on the scientific basis for rational use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere.

In the field of communication, the "free flow of ideas by word and image" has been in UNESCO's constitution from its beginnings, following the experience of the Second World War when control of information was a factor in indoctrinating populations for aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002269/226924e.pdf#page=6|title=Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the years immediately following World War II, efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world. UNESCO started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001480/148006eb.pdf |title=UNESCO. (1955).

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to calls for a "[[New World Information and Communication Order]]" in the late 1970s, UNESCO established the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000323/032363eb.pdf |title=UNESCO.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produced the 1980 [[MacBride report]] (named after the Chair of the Commission, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Seán MacBride]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000400/040066eb.pdf |title=MacBride, S.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same year, UNESCO created the [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] (IPDC), a multilateral forum designed to promote media development in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/intergovernmental-programmes/ipdc/about-ipdc/|title=About IPDC {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/intergovernmental-programmes/ipdc/homepage/|title=International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, UNESCO's General Conference endorsed the [[Windhoek Declaration]] on [[media independence]] and pluralism, which led the UN General Assembly to declare the date of its adoption, 3 May, as [[World Press Freedom Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/world-press-freedom-day-2016/|title=World Press Freedom Day 2016|website=UNESCO|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, UNESCO has awarded the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize|UNESCO / Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] every 3 May. In the lead up to the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in 2003 ([[Geneva]]) and 2005 ([[Tunis]]), UNESCO introduced the [[Information for All Programme]].

UNESCO admitted Palestine as a member in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/general_conference_admits_palestine_as_unesco_member_state/|title=General Conference admits Palestine as UNESCO Member |date = 31 October 2011 |accessdate = 11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/8860951/US-withdraws-Unesco-funding-after-it-accepts-Palestinian-membership.html |title = US withdraws Unesco funding after it accepts Palestinian membership |first = Adrian |last=Blomfield |work=The Telegraph |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO implements its activities through the five programme areas: education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, and communication and information.
* Education: UNESCO supports research in [[comparative education]]; and provide expertise and fosters partnerships to strengthen national educational leadership and the capacity of countries to offer quality education for all. This includes the
** [[UNESCO Chairs]], an international network of 644 UNESCO Chairs, involving over 770 institutions in 126 countries.
** Environmental Conservation Organisation
** [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] adopted in 1960
** Organization of the International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA) in an interval of 12 years
** Publication of the [[Education for All Global Monitoring Report]]
** Publication of the ''Four Pillars of Learning'' seminal document
** [[UNESCO ASPNet]], an international network of 8,000 schools in 170 countries.
UNESCO does not accredit institutions of higher learning.&lt;ref&gt;Because [[diploma mill]]s have claimed false UNESCO accreditation, UNESCO itself has published warnings against education organizations that claim UNESCO recognition or affiliation. See Luca Lantero, [http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf Degree Mills: non-accredited and irregular higher education institutions]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513185433/http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf |date=13 May 2015 }}, [[Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence|Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence (CIMEA)]], Italy. and [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090521152755/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=48787&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO "Alert: Misuse of UNESCO Name by Bogus Institutions"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* UNESCO also issues public statements to educate the public:
** [[Seville Statement on Violence]]: A statement adopted by UNESCO in 1989 to refute the notion that humans are biologically predisposed to organised violence.

The [http://opendata.unesco.org UNESCO transparency portal] has been designed to enable public access to information regarding Organization's activities, such as its aggregate budget for a biennium, as well as links to relevant programmatic and financial documents. These two distinct sets of information are published on the [[International Aid Transparency Initiative|IATI]] registry, respectively based on the IATI Activity Standard and the IATI Organization Standard.

There have been proposals to establish two new UNESCO lists. The first proposed list will focus on movable cultural heritage such as artifacts, paintings, and biofacts. The list may include cultural objects, such as the [[Jōmon Venus]] of [[Japan]], the [[Mona Lisa]] of [[France]], the [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] of [[Egypt]], [[The Ninth Wave]] of [[Russia]], the [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]] of [[Turkey]], the [[David (Michelangelo)]] of [[Italy]], the [[Mathura Herakles]] of [[India]], the [[Manunggul Jar]] of the Philippines, the [[Crown of Baekje]] of [[South Korea]], [[The Hay Wain]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Benin Bronzes]] of [[Nigeria]]. The second proposed list will focus on the world's living species, such as the [[Komodo Dragon]] of [[Indonesia]], the [[Panda]] of China, the [[Bald eagle]] of [[North America]]n countries, the [[Aye-aye]] of [[Madagascar]], the [[Asiatic Lion]] of [[India]], the [[Kakapo]] of [[New Zealand]], and the [[Mountain tapir]] of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/cairo/culture/tangible-cultural-heritage/|title=Tangible Cultural Heritage - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/114908|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - Document - Discovered artifacts under preservation, Archaeological Site, 18 Hoang Dieu street|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
UNESCO and its specialized institutions issue a number of magazines.

''The UNESCO Courier'' magazine states its mission to "promote UNESCO’s ideals, maintain a platform for the dialogue between cultures and provide a forum for international debate." Since March 2006 it is available online, with limited printed issues. Its articles express the opinions of the authors which are not necessarily the opinions of UNESCO. There was a hiatus in publishing between 2012 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/courier/archives|title=Archives|website = The UNESCO Courier|publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate = 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, UNESCO initiated the quarterly review ''Impact of Science on Society'' (also known as ''Impact'') to discuss the influence of science on society. The journal ceased publication in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/education/nfsunesco/brochure/E29.PDF |title = Science and Technology Education|publisher = UNESCO |date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO also published museum international quarterly from the year 1948.

==Official UNESCO NGOs==
UNESCO has official relations with 322 [[international non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |title=Quoted on UNESCO official site |publisher=Ngo-db.unesco.org |accessdate=1 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625221827/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |archivedate=25 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these are what UNESCO calls "operational"; a select few are "formal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35293&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Full list of NGOs that have official relations with UNESCO |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The highest form of affiliation to UNESCO is "formal associate", and the 22 NGOs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |title=UNESCO Headquarters Committee 107th session 13 Feb 2009 |publisher=Ngo-db.unesco.org |accessdate=1 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625221827/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |archivedate=25 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''formal associate'' (ASC) relations occupying offices at UNESCO are:

==Governing bodies==

===Director-General===
There has been no elected UNESCO Director-General from Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and North Asia, Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, Australia-Oceania, and South America since inception.

The Director-Generals of UNESCO came from West Europe (5), Central America (1), North America (2), West Africa (1), East Asia (1), and East Europe (1). Out of the 11 Director-Generals since inception, women have held the position only twice. [[Qatar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Iran]] are proposing for a Director-General bid by 2021 or 2025. There have never been a Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian UNESCO Director-General since inception. The [[ASEAN]] bloc and some Pacific and Latin American nations support the possible bid of the Philippines, which is culturally Asian, Oceanic, and Latin. Qatar and Iran, on the other hand, have fragmented support in the Middle East. [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], and [[Madagascar]] are also vying for the position but have yet to express a direct or indirect proposal. Both Qatar and Egypt lost in the 2017 bid against France.

==Offices and Headquarters==
[[File:April 2010, UNESCO Headquarters in Paris - The Garden of Peace (or Japanese Garden) in Spring.jpg|thumb|The Garden of Peace, UNESCO headquarters, Paris.

==Controversies==

===New World Information and Communication order===
UNESCO has been the centre of controversy in the past, particularly in its relationships with the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Singapore]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1970s and 1980s, UNESCO's support for a "[[New World Information and Communication Order]]" and its [[MacBride report]] calling for democratization of the media and more egalitarian access to information was condemned in these countries as attempts to curb [[freedom of the press]].  UNESCO was perceived as a platform for communists and Third World dictators to attack the West, in contrast to accusations made by the USSR in the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grahm |first=S. E. |date= April 2006 |title= The (Real)politiks of Culture: U.S. Cultural Diplomacy in UNESCO, 1946–1954 |journal=Diplomatic History |volume= 30 |issue=2 |pages=231–51 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-7709.2006.00548.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, the United States withheld its contributions and withdrew from the organization in protest, followed by the United Kingdom in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A4079804/AONE?u=tamp44898&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=ef6d5640 | title = UNESCO asks states considering withdrawal to 'reconsider their position' | journal = [[UN Chronicle (journal)|UN Chronicle]] | date = January 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Singapore withdrew also at the end of 1985, citing rising membership fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19841228&amp;id=Y5srAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qPoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5684,5359479 | title = Singapore to withdraw from UNESCO | newspaper = [[The Telegraph (newspaper)|The Telegraph]] | date = 28 December 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a change of government in 1997, the UK rejoined. The United States rejoined in 2003, followed by Singapore on 8 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/UNESCO | title = UNESCO | website = Encyclopedia Britannica | date = 14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
[[Israel]] was admitted to UNESCO in 1949, one year after its creation. Israel has maintained its membership since 1949.
In 2010, Israel designated the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]], [[Hebron]] and [[Rachel's Tomb]], [[Bethlehem]] as [[List of National Heritage Sites of Israel|National Heritage Sites]] and announced restoration work, prompting criticism from the United States and protests from Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hebron clashes over Israel's West Bank heritage list|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8538948.stm|date=26 February 2010|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, UNESCO's Executive Board voted to declare the sites as "al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs" and "Bilal bin Rabah Mosque/Rachel's Tomb" and stated that they were "an integral part of the [[occupied Palestinian Territories]]" and any unilateral Israeli action was a violation of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/executive_board_adopts_five_decisions_concerning_unescos_work_in_the_occupied_palestinian_and_arab_territories/|title=Executive Board adopts five decisions concerning UNESCO's work in the occupied Palestinian and Arab Territories|date=21 October 2010|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
UNESCO described the sites as significant to "people of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions", and accused Israel of highlighting only the Jewish character of the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE TWO PALESTINIAN SITES OF AL-HARAM AL-IBRAHIMI/TOMB OF THE PATRIARCHS IN AL-KHALIL/HEBRON AND THE BILAL BIN RABAH MOSQUE/RACHEL'S TOMB IN BETHLEHEM|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001873/187356e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Israel in turn accused UNESCO of "detach[ing] the Nation of Israel from its heritage", and accused it of being politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/140377 |title=UNESCO Erases Israeli Protests from Rachel's Tomb Protocol |date=1 November 2010 |publisher=Arutz Sheva |author=Hillel Fendel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Shmuel Rabinovitch|Rabbi of the Western Wall]] claimed that Rachel's tomb had not previously been declared a holy Muslim site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/news.aspx/140345|title=UN Org.: Rachel's Tomb is a Mosque |date=29 October 2010|publisher=Arutz Sheva|author=Maayana Miskin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel partially suspended ties with UNESCO. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] declared that the resolution was a "part of Palestinian escalation".
[[Zevulun Orlev]], chairman of the [[Knesset]] Education and Culture Committee, referred to the resolutions as an attempt to undermine the mission of UNESCO as a scientific and cultural organization that promotes cooperation throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=193893 |title=Ayalon: Israel will no longer cooperate with UNESCO |date=3 November 2010 |work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shalom |first=Rabbi |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=194090 |title=Cooperation with UNESCO only partially suspended |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, at [[Jordan]]'s insistence, censured{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Israel's decision to demolish and rebuild the [[Mughrabi-Bridge|Mughrabi Gate]] Bridge in Jerusalem for safety reasons. Israel stated that Jordan had signed an agreement with Israel stipulating that the existing bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons; Jordan disputed the agreement, saying that it was only signed under U.S. pressure. Israel was also unable to address the UNESCO committee over objections from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088221,00.html |title=UNESCO censures Israel over Mughrabi Bridge – Israel News, Ynetnews |work=Ynetnews |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, days before it was scheduled to open, UNESCO Director-General, [[Irina Bokova]], "indefinitely postponed" and effectively cancelled an exhibit created by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] entitled "The People, The Book, The Land: The 3,500-year relationship between the [[History of the Jews and Judaism in the Land of Israel|Jewish people and the Land of Israel]]." The event was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January in Paris. Bokova cancelled the event after representatives of Arab states at UNESCO argued that its display would "harm the [[Arab-Israeli peace process|peace process]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berman|first=Lazar|title=UNESCO cancels event on Jewish ties to Land of Israel|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/unesco-cancels-event-on-jewish-ties-to-land-of-israel/|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the exhibition, Professor [[Robert Wistrich]] of the [[Hebrew University]]'s [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism]], called the cancellation an "appalling act," and characterized Bokova's decision as "an arbitrary act of total cynicism and, really, contempt for the Jewish people and its history." UNESCO amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the year, and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahren|first=Raphael|title=Author of UNESCO's nixed Israel exhibit decries 'appalling betrayal'|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/author-of-unescos-nixed-israel-exhibit-decries-appalling-betrayal|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occupied Palestine Resolution====
{{Main article|Occupied Palestine Resolution}}
On 13 October 2016, UNESCO passed a resolution on East Jerusalem that condemned Israel for "aggressions" by Israeli police and soldiers and "illegal measures" against the freedom of worship and Muslims' access to their holy sites, while also recognizing Israel as the occupying power. Palestinian leaders welcomed the decision.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO adopts anti-Israel resolution on al-Aqsa Mosque|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/unesco-adopts-anti-israel-resolution-al-aqsa-mosque-161018120610946.html|work=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the text acknowledged the "importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions", it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its Muslim name "Al-Haram al-Sharif", Arabic for Noble Sanctuary. In response, Israel denounced the UNESCO resolution for its omission of the words "Temple Mount" or "Har HaBayit," stating that it [[Temple denial|denies Jewish ties to the key holy site]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002462/246215e.pdf |title=Commission report|website=unesdoc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving criticism from numerous Israeli politicians and diplomats, including [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and [[Ayelet Shaked]], Israel froze all ties with the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4866113,00.html|title=UNESCO fails to acknowledge Jewish ties to Temple Mount|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-leads-angry-denunciations-of-absurd-unesco-decision/|title=Netanyahu leads angry denunciations of ‘absurd’ UNESCO decision|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was condemned by [[Ban ki-Moon]] and the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, who said that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have clear historical connections to Jerusalem and "to deny, conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =  UNESCO chief ‘received death threats’ for opposing Jerusalem motion|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/unesco-chief-received-death-threats-for-opposing-jerusalem-motion/|date = 17 October 2016|work= Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/statement_by_the_director_general_of_unesco_on_the_old_city-1/#.WAQnmeUrLb3|title=Statement by the Director-General of UNESCO on the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls on the occasion of the 40th session of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO in Istanbul - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Aqsa Mosque is also Temple Mount, whose Western Wall is the holiest place in Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.747466|title=UNESCO Director Criticizes Resolution: Temple Mount Sacred to Both Jews, Muslims|work=Haaretz|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also rejected by the Czech Parliament which said the resolution reflects a "hateful [[anti-Israel]] sentiment",&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/czech-mps-slam-hateful-unesco-jerusalem-resolution/|title=Czech MPs slam ‘hateful’ UNESCO Jerusalem resolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hundreds of Italian Jews demonstrated in Rome over Italy's abstention.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"/&gt; On 26 October, UNESCO approved a reviewed version of the resolution, which also criticized Israel for its continuous "refusal to let the body's experts access Jerusalem's holy sites to determine their conservation status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO approves new Jerusalem resolution|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/unesco-approves-anti-israel-resolution-jerusalem-161026173149575.html|work=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite containing some softening of language following Israeli protests over a previous version, Israel continued to denounce the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beaumont|first1=Peter|title=Unesco adopts controversial resolution on Jerusalem holy sites|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/unesco-adopts-controversial-resolution-on-jerusalem-holy-sites-israel|work=The Guardian|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution refers to the site Jews and Christians refer to as the Temple Mount, or Har HaBayit in Hebrew, only by its Arab name — a significant semantic decision also adopted by UNESCO's executive board, triggering condemnation from Israel and its allies. U.S. Ambassador Crystal Nix Hines stated: "This item should have been defeated. These politicized and one-sided resolutions are damaging the credibility of UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO resolution on Jerusalem holy sites draws criticism from U.S., Israel|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unesco-resolution-holy-sites-un-1.3821919|work=CBC/Radio-Canada|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the United States and Israel announced they would withdraw from the organization, citing in-part anti-Israel bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm|title=The United States Withdraws From UNESCO|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Gardiner|last2=Erlangeroct|first2=Steven|title=U.S. Will Withdraw From Unesco, Citing Its ‘Anti-Israel Bias’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-unesco-withdrawal.html|accessdate=8 April 2018|agency=The New York Times|date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestine===

====Palestinian youth magazine controversy====
In February 2011, an article was published in a Palestinian youth magazine in which a teenage girl described one of her four role-models as [[Adolf Hitler]]. In December 2011, UNESCO, which partly funded the magazine, condemned the material and subsequently withdrew support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/8975423/Unesco-cuts-funding-for-Palestinian-youth-magazine-over-Hitler-praise.html |title=Unesco cuts funding for Palestinian youth magazine over Hitler praise |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islamic University of Gaza controversy====
In 2012, UNESCO decided to establish a chair at the [[Islamic University of Gaza]] in the field of [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]], and [[space science]]s,&lt;ref name="UNESCOIslamicUniversity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unesco.org/en/university-twinning-and-networking/access-by-region/arab-states/palestine/unesco-chair-in-astronomy-astrophysics-and-space-sciences-964/ | title=UNESCO Chair in Astronomy, Astrophysics and Space Sciences (964), established in 2012 at The Islamic University of Gaza (Palestine). | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; fueling controversy and criticism. [[Israel]] bombed the school in 2008 claiming they develop and store weapons there, a claim Israel restated in criticizing UNESCO's move.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=OsM94e1GHxAC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=destruction+caused+at+the+Islamic+University&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX1IWTmuzWAhXn54MKHT7JAGQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=destruction%20caused%20at%20the%20Islamic%20University&amp;f=false The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict] By Adam Horowitz, Lizzy Ratner and Philip Weiss (2011).

The head, [[Kamalain Shaath]], defended UNESCO, stating that "the Islamic University is a purely academic university that is interested only in education and its development".&lt;ref name="NationalPostUNESCO"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/07/12/unesco-accused-of-endorsing-hamas-terrorists-breeding-ground/ | title=UNESCO establishes chair at Gaza university accused of housing Hamas bomb labs | author=Higgins, Michael| work=National Post | date=12 July 2012 | accessdate=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShalitGazaIslamicUniversity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3361595,00.html | title=Fatah: Shalit was held at Gaza Islamic University | publisher=Yedioth Ahronot | date=6 February 2007 | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonIUGProfile"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/02/28/hamas_u/ | title=Hamas University | author=Cambanis, Thanassis| work=Boston Globe | date=28 February 2010 | accessdate=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli ambassador to UNESCO [[Nimrod Barkan]] planned to submit a letter of protest with information about the university's ties to Hamas, especially angry that this was the first Palestinian university that UNESCO chose to cooperate with.&lt;ref name="HaaretzUNESCOGaza"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/diplomania/israel-furious-at-unesco-decision-to-back-science-chair-at-islamic-university-of-gaza-1.450524 | title=Israel furious at UNESCO decision to back science chair at Islamic University of Gaza | author=Ravid, Barak| work=Haaretz | date=12 July 2012 | accessdate=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish organization [[B'nai B'rith]] criticized the move as well.&lt;ref name="BnaiBrithUNESCO"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/bnai-brith-slams-unesco-affiliation-with-gaza-university/ | title=B'nai Brith slams UNESCO affiliation with Gaza University | author=Yaakov, Yifa| work=The Times of Israel | date=14 July 2012 | accessdate=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wikileaks===
On 16 and 17 February 2012, UNESCO held a conference entitled "The Media World after [[WikiLeaks]] and [[News of the World]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/new_journalism_in_a_digital_world/ |title=News journalism in a digital world |publisher=UNESCO |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all six panels being focused on WikiLeaks, no member of WikiLeaks staff was invited to speak. After receiving a complaint from WikiLeaks spokesman [[Kristinn Hrafnsson]], UNESCO invited him to attend, but did not offer a place on any panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://issuu.com/unesconow/docs/unescoleaks_to_refute_wikileaks_accusations |title=UNESCO-leaks to refute wikileaks accusation| publisher=UNESCO | date=16 February 2012 | accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer also came only a week before the conference, which was held in Paris, France. Many of the speakers featured, including [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] and [[Heather Brooke]], had spoken out openly against WikiLeaks and its founder [[Julian Assange]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/mar2011/wiki-m10.shtml |title=The Guardian's hatchet job on Julian Assange |publisher=[[World Socialist Web Site]] |date=10 March 2011 |access-date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks released a press statement on 15 February 2012 denouncing UNESCO which stated, "UNESCO has made itself an international human rights joke. To use 'freedom of expression' to censor WikiLeaks from a conference about WikiLeaks is an Orwellian absurdity beyond words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-denounces-UNESCO-after.html |title=WikiLeaks denounces UNESCO after WikiLeaks banned from UNESCO conference on WikiLeaks |publisher=WikiLeaks |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Che Guevara===
In 2013, UNESCO announced that the collection "The Life and Works of Ernesto [[Che Guevara]]" became part of the [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]]. [[United States Congress|US Congresswoman]] [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] condemned this decision, saying that the organization acts against its own ideals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://ros-lehtinen.house.gov/press-release/unesco-once-again-makes-mockery-its-own-ideals-glorifying-mass-murderer-che-guevara | type = press release | title = UNESCO Once Again Makes a Mockery of its Own Ideals by Glorifying Mass Murderer Che Guevara, Says Ros-Lehtinen | publisher = House of representatives | date = 22 July 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|sign=|source=|This decision is more than an insult to the families of those Cubans who were lined up and [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] by Che and his merciless cronies but it also serves as a direct contradiction to the UNESCO ideals of encouraging peace and universal respect for human rights.}}

[[UN Watch]] also condemned this selection by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwatch.org/unesco-honors-executioner-che-guevara/  UNESCO honors executioner Che Guevara], ''UN Watch'', 21 July 2013 (retrieved 11 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Listing Nanjing Massacre documents===
In 2015, [[Japan]] threatened to halt funding for UNESCO over the organization's decision to include documents relating to the 1937 [[Nanjing massacre]] in the latest listing for its "Memory of the World" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/japan-furious-at-unesco-listing-nanjing-massacre-documents/a-18790477|title=Japan furious at UNESCO listing Nanjing Massacre documents - Asia - DW.COM - 19.10.2015|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2016, Japanese Foreign Minister [[Fumio Kishida]] confirmed that Japan's 2016 annual funding of ¥4.4 billion had been suspended although denied any direct link with the Nanjing document controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan halts Unesco funding following Nanjing massacre row|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/japan-halts-unesco-funding-nanjing-massacre-row|accessdate=30 October 2016|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US withdrawals===
After withdrawing from UNESCO in 1984, the United States rejoined January 10, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/europe-and-north-america/united-states-of-america/|title=United States of America - United Nations Educational Scientific Cooperation Organization|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Congressman [[Jim Leach]] stated before a Congressional subcommittee:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher = Library of Congress | series = Congressional subcommittee on International operations | date = September 19, 1989 | title = Expert Witness Statement transcript}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote |The reasons for the withdrawal of the United States from UNESCO in 1984 are well-known; my view is that we overreacted to the calls of some who wanted to radicalize UNESCO, and the calls of others who wanted the United States to lead in emasculating the UN system. The fact is UNESCO is one of the least dangerous international institutions ever created. While some member countries within UNESCO attempted to push journalistic views antithetical to the values of the west, and engage in Israel bashing, UNESCO itself never adopted such radical postures. The U.S. opted for empty-chair diplomacy, after winning, not losing, the battles we engaged in…  It was nuts to get out, and would be nuttier not to rejoin.}}

He concluded that the record showed Israel bashing, a call for a new world information order, money management, and arms control policy to be the impetus behind the withdrawal; he asserted that before the UNESCO withdrawal, a withdrawal from the [[IAEA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?9189-1/united-states-unesco-part-1|title=United States &amp; UNESCO Part 1, Sep 19 1989 - Video - C-SPAN.org|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been pushed on him. The United States rejoined UNESCO shortly thereafter.

On 12 October 2017, the United States notified UNESCO that it will again withdraw from the organization on 31 December 2018 and will seek to establish a permanent observer mission beginning in 2019. The [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] cited "mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm |title=The United States Withdraws From UNESCO| publisher =U.S. Department of State |access-date= 2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has not paid its $80 million annual UNESCO dues since Palestine became a full member in 2011. Israel and the US were among only 14 votes against the membership, of 194 member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S., Israel quit UNESCO over alleged bias |author=John Irish| publisher=Globe and Mail |date=October 13, 2017 |page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish–Kurdish conflict===
On May 25, 2016, the noted Turkish poet and human rights activist [[O. Z. Livaneli|Zülfü Livaneli]] resigned as [[Turkey]]’s only UNESCO goodwill ambassador. He highlighted [[Human rights in Turkey|human rights situation in Turkey]] and destruction of historical [[Sur, Diyarbakır|Sur]] district of [[Diyarbakır|Diyarbakir]], the largest city in Kurdish-majority southeast Turkey, during [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)|fighting]] between the Turkish army and Kurdish militants as the main reasons for his resignation. Livaneli said: "To pontificate on peace while remaining silent against such violations is a contradiction of the fundamental ideals of UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-rights-un/turkish-writer-quits-unesco-to-protest-damage-to-heritage-rights-abuse-idUSKCN0YH1KA Turkish writer quits UNESCO to protest damage to heritage, rights abuse]".

===Information processing tools===
UNESCO develops, maintains and disseminates, free of charge, two interrelated software packages for database management (CDS/ISIS [not to be confused with UK police software package ISIS]) and data mining/statistical analysis (IDAMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=1542&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150108023105/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php%2DURL_ID%3D1542%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2015-01-08 |title= Information Processing Tools |publisher= Unesco }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CDS/ISIS – a generalised information storage and retrieval system. The Windows version may run on a single computer or in a local area network. The JavaISIS client/server components allow remote database management over the Internet and are available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh. Furthermore, GenISIS allows the user to produce HTML Web forms for CDS/ISIS database searching. The ISIS_DLL provides an API for developing CDS/ISIS based applications.
* OpenIDAMS – a software package for processing and analysing numerical data developed, maintained and disseminated by UNESCO. The original package was proprietary but UNESCO has initiated a project to provide it as open-source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15653&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150113175706/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php%2DURL_ID%3D15653%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2015-01-13 |title= OpenIDAMS |publisher= Unesco }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Costume}}

The '''wardrobe supervisor''' is responsible for supervising all wardrobe related activities during the course of a [[Theatre|theatrical]] run. The modern title "wardrobe supervisor" has evolved from the more traditional titles of "wardrobe mistress/master" or "mistress/master of the [[wardrobe]]". The wardrobe supervisor may be present at some [[Theatrical production|production]] meetings and fittings, their primary responsibilities generally begin at the load-in stage of a production. At load-in physical custody and responsibility for the [[costume]]s shifts from the [[costume designer]] and shop staff to the wardrobe supervisor.

The wardrobe supervisor supervises all [[Dresser (theater)|dressers]] working on a production. In consultation with the [[production manager]], [[stage manager]] and sometimes the [[theatre director|director]], the wardrobe supervisor helps to coordinate and assign dressers to specific performers and tasks. They help determine where and how costume changes are made. Generally, the wardrobe supervisor decides whether a point in a production requires a quick change [[Theater (structure)#Basic elements of a theater structure|backstage]], or if there is time for a normal change in the dressing room. All dressers report directly to the wardrobe supervisor, who acts as primary liaison between dressers, the costumer, and stage management.

==Duties==
The wardrobe supervisor's primary responsibilities include:
* The care and proper maintenance of all [[costume]]s, shoes, [[undergarments]], hats and costume related personal props such as gloves, jewelry, [[parasols]], [[Fan (implement)|fans]] and pocket books. 
* To ensure the proper labeling, hanging, storage and preset of all costume pieces. 
* To create and execute a proper cleaning schedule for all garments, ensuring that [[laundry]] and [[dry cleaning]] are done on a regular basis between performances. They also coordinate the regular changing of [[dress shields]], the application of garment freshening sprays and providing clean undergarments to the performers. 
* To ensure that all costumes are properly pressed or steamed prior to each performance.
*The wardrobe supervisor also regularly inventories and inspects all costumes and coordinates all costume repairs. The majority of minor costume repairs are done on site at the theatre by either the Wardrobe Supervisor or in the cases of many regional theatres, the onsite wardrobe maintenance crew which is connected to the in house costume shop. Most repairs are considered "emergencies", however, and whenever possible they are done onsite at the theatre before and sometimes during the actual performance. The wardrobe supervisor's space in the theatre, with few exceptions, contains a [[sewing machine]], [[glue gun]], and all sewing supplies necessary for any type of emergency repair that could be required. Most wardrobe supervisors are very qualified [[seamstress]]es in their own right. The rule of thumb is that only in the case of very significant damage is a costume sent back to the shop for repair. The one exception to this rule are shoes. Although most supervisor's maintain a regular schedule for polishing and re-spraying of shoes, for safety reasons, actual shoe repair work is always sent out. 
*At the end of a production run, the wardrobe supervisor oversees all aspects of the costume strike. In the case of rented costumes, they coordinate restoring costumes to original condition. This includes ripping out hems or alterations that may have been done for fitting, and removing any added trim or ornamentation. Sometimes this work is extensive enough that the costumes are returned to either the designer's or theatre's shop for laundering and restoration. Regardless, the wardrobe supervisor is responsible for providing a complete and accurate inventory that ensures all pieces are returned.

A good wardrobe supervisor ensures that costumes look as fresh and new for the last performance as they did on opening night.

==Synopsis==
The series follows Whitney Cummings, as she portrays a fictionalized version of herself, and her very supportive live-in boyfriend, Alex. Even though the two have decided that they will not commit to marriage, she does question how committed they are in their 3-year relationship and tries to go as far to prove a point. She begins to fear what she sees as "relationship boredom" and worries what will happen next that could possibly end their relationship. Because of what she sees and hears around her involving other relationships, she uses unconventional methods to keep the romantic flames glowing with Alex, often seeking the help of her close friends. The sitcom is set in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/whitney/video/a-decent-proposal/1362082 |publisher=[[NBC]] |title=Whitney - A Decent Proposal - Video |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018162209/http://www.nbc.com/whitney/video/a-decent-proposal/1362082/ |archivedate=October 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and production==
''Whitney'' was one of two network television shows created by Whitney Cummings to premiere during the [[2011–12 United States network television schedule|2011-12 United States television season]]. The other, which she shares creator credit with [[Michael Patrick King]] and does not star in, is the [[CBS]] series ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' which is produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/05/13/person-of-interest-two-broke-girls-first-to-series-at-cbs-sarah-michelle-gellar-led-ringer-shifts-to-the-cw-342011/9271/ |title="Person of Interest," "Two Broke Girls" First to Series at CBS; Sarah Michelle Gellar-Led "Ringer" Shifts to The CW |publisher=The Futon Critic |date=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Whitney'', Cummings serves as the executive producer, creator and writer with [[Scott Stuber]], Quan Phung, and [[Betsy Thomas]] for [[Universal Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/11/nbc-picks-up-smash-prime-suspects-plus-two-more-sitcoms-to-series/92312 |title=Updated: NBC Picks Up "Smash", "Prime Suspects" and Two More Sitcoms to Series |publisher=TV By the Numbers |date=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beverly D'Angelo]] originally played Patti, Whitney's mother, in the pilot episode before being replaced by [[Jane Kaczmarek]], with parts of the pilot being reshot as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=N. |last=Andreeva |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/jane-kaczmarek-joins-new-nbc-comedy-series-whitney/ |title=Jane Kaczmarek Joins New NBC Comedy Series 'Whitney' |publisher=Deadline.com |date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tabloid, ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Cummings received $60,000 per episode for the first three episodes, and was to receive a salary increase after the show ordered for a full season because of good ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/cummings_going_good_cXGKTNaePwVb3gk9lM8GDI |title=Cummings into her own |publisher=NYPOST.com |date=October 9, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC moved the series to Wednesday beginning January 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/11/14/nbc-mid-season-schedule-harrys-law-to-sunday-grimm-stays-put-up-all-night-moves-later-whitney-to-wednesday-chuck-done-in-january-more/110647/ |title=NBC Mid-Season Schedule: ‘Harry’s Law’ To Sunday, ‘Grimm’ Stays Put, ‘Up All Night’ Moves Later, ‘Whitney’ To Wednesday, ‘Chuck’ Series Finale Set &amp; More |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed the series for a second season, which was to premiere on October 19, 2012. On October 8, 2012, the premiere date for ''Whitney'' was delayed by NBC to give it proper marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/352423/community-and-whitney-premiere-dates-delayed|title=Community and Whitney Premiere Dates Delayed|publisher=E! Online|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2012, NBC announced it would air the season 2 premiere of ''Whitney'' on November 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/animal-practice-canceled-378328|title=NBC Cancels 'Animal Practice,' Adds 'Whitney' to Schedule|last=O'Connell|first=Michael|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the poor critical reception of the show upon its debut that was largely directed at Cummings herself, the producers of ''Whitney'' changed the direction of the series to a more ensemble-like show in the style of ''[[Friends]]'' to reduce the pressure on Cummings, who was also experiencing personal troubles. At the time, her mother had suffered a stroke, and her sister was entering rehab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1331611200 |title=Whitney drops stockings - The Howard Stern Show |publisher=Howardstern.com |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wil Calhoun]] replaced Betsy Thomas as showrunner for the second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Wil Calhoun Joins NBC’s ‘Whitney’ As New Showrunner|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/05/wil-calhoun-joins-nbcs-whitney-as-new-showrunner/|work=Deadline|accessdate=August 23, 2012|date=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Maulik Pancholy did not return to the show for the new season as the show focused more on the relationship between the two leads and less on the ensemble cast as seen in the later part of the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Whitney-Maulik-Pancholy-Not-Returning-1052244.aspx?rss=breakingnews |title=Maulik Pancholy Not Returning to NBC's Whitney - Today's News: Our Take |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced that NBC Stand Up For Diversity winner Tone Bell would join the cast as a character named "RJ".&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter1"/&gt;

On November 9, 2012, NBC ordered five additional scripts for the television series, but only picked up three, increasing its season order to sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/nbcs-whitney-gets-order-for-5-scripts/ |title=NBC’s ‘Whitney’ Gets Order For 5 Scripts |work=Deadline.com |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=November 8, 2012 |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International broadcasts==
The series had been picked up in Canada by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], where it premiered on September 19, 2011, after the season premiere of ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''. It continued air on the same night as the NBC telecasts, but was also scheduled in different timeslots by region. ''Whitney'' ended up becoming the No.1 new comedy of the season during 2011-12 in Canada on CTV. The second season began airing on October 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://falltvpreview.com/show.php?id=1125 |title=CTV Fall Lineup |publisher=Channel Canada |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012092117/http://falltvpreview.com/show.php?id=1125 |archivedate=October 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, India, and Ireland, ''Whitney'' had been picked up by [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Comedy Central]], and began airing on July 3, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/shows/featured/whitney/ |title=Whitney show profile |publisher=Comedycentral.co.uk |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
''Whitney'' originally premiered to mixed reviews from critics, with Cummings herself receiving criticism in online articles and reviews for the series.

As the series progressed, some reviewers remarked about improvements in the show. Willa Paskin of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' found that the series improved structurally from the eighth episode, while the chemistry of the two leads was brought to the forefront. However, she still found that the jokes were not good enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paskin |first=Willa |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/03/21/whitneys_second_coming/ |title="Whitney's" second coming - TV |publisher=Salon.com |date= |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaime Weinman of ''[[Maclean's]]'' agreed with Paskin, additionally noting that the series depicted a more realistic relationship compared with other freshmen sitcoms such as ''[[New Girl (TV series)|New Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinman |first=Jaime |url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/03/23/the-nbc-sitcom-counter-backlash/ |title=The NBC sitcom counter-backlash|work=[[Maclean's]] |date=March 23, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephan Lee, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', compared ''Whitney'' favorably to Cummings' other series, ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'', citing what he perceived to be an increasingly stronger and more multidimensional supporting cast in the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Valby |first=Karen |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/28/whitney-2-broke-girls-contrarian-corner/ |title='Whitney' is better than '2 Broke Girls'|work=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=October 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Fox of Splitsider found that the series began to find its footing as it progressed from its pilot and misleading initial ad campaign.&lt;ref name=splitsider&gt;{{cite web|last=David |first=Jesse |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/02/why-whitney-is-the-best-new-network-sitcom-of-2011-2012/ |title=Why Whitney is the Best New Network Sitcom of 2011-2012 |publisher=Splitsider |date=February 28, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings===
The series debuted on Canada's CTV on September 19, 2011, three days before its U.S. premiere on NBC. The show won its timeslot with two million viewers, buoyed by its lead-in, the much-anticipated [[Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt|ninth-season premiere]] of ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/20/ash-tronomical-return-two-and-a-half-men-draws-largest-audience-ever-in-canada-too-with-5-million-viewers/104380/ |title=Ash-tronomical Return: 'Two and a Half Men' Draws Largest Audience Ever in Canada Too with 5 Million Viewers |publisher=Zap2it |date=September 20, 2011 |first=Robert |last=Seidman |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series made a modest debut in the US, scoring with 6.8 million viewers and a 4.0/6 rating. However, it premiered more importantly to a strong 3.2 18–49 demo rating (on which the cost of advertisement is often dependent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2011/09/tv-ratings-x-factor-holds-charlies-angels-off-to-modest-start.html |title=TV Ratings: 'X Factor' holds, 'Charlie's Angels' off to modest start |publisher=Zap2it |date=September 23, 2011 |first=Mikey |last=O'Connell |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December it had dropped to 4 million viewers and a 1.9 rating, being described by ''Entertainment Weekly'' as in "a ratings murk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/12/02/chelsea-handler-whitney-ratings/ |title=Chelsea Handler can't boost 'Whitney' ratings |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 2, 2011 |first=James |last=Hibberd |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wolf Vostell.jpg|thumb|Wolf Vostell - Signature]]

'''Wolf Vostell''' (14 October 1932 – 3 April 1998) was a German painter and sculptor, considered one of the early adopters of [[video art]] and [[installation art]] and pioneer of [[Happening]] and [[Fluxus]]. Techniques such as blurring and [[Dé-collage|Dé-coll/age]] are characteristic of his work, as is embedding objects in concrete and the use of television sets in his works.

== Biography ==
Wolf Vostell was born in [[Leverkusen]], Germany, and put his artistic ideas into practice from 1950 onwards. In 1953, he began an apprenticeship as a lithographer and studied at the Academy of Applied Art in [[Wuppertal]]. Vostell created his first [[Dé-collage]] in 1954. In 1955-1956, he studied at the École Nationale Superieur des Beaux Arts in Paris and in 1957 he attended the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf Academy of Arts]]. Vostell's philosophy was built around the idea that destruction is all around us and it runs through all of the twentieth century. He used the term ''Dé-coll/age'', (in connection with a plane crash) in 1954 to refer to the process of tearing down posters, and for the use of mobile fragments of reality. Vostell’s working concept of décollage is as a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from media.

His first [[Happening]], ''Theater is in the Street'', took place in [[Paris]] in 1958, and incorporated auto parts and a TV.&lt;ref name="Ian Chilvers p. 742"&gt;Ian Chilvers &amp; John Glaves-Smith, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press, p. 742&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he took part in the first European Happening in Paris and he produced his first objects with television sets and car parts. He was impressed by the work of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which he encountered in 1964 in the electronic studios of the German radio station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]], and in 1959 he created his electronic ''TV Dé-coll/age''. It marked the beginning of his dedication to the [[Fluxus]] Movement, which he co-founded in the early 1960s. Vostell was behind many Happenings in New York, Berlin, Cologne, Wuppertal and Ulm among others.&lt;ref name="Ian Chilvers p. 742"/&gt; In 1962, he participated in the Festum Fluxorum, an international event in [[Wiesbaden]] together with [[Nam June Paik]], [[George Maciunas]]. In 1963 Wolf Vostell became a pioneer of [[Video art]] and [[Installation art|Installation]] with his work ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'' shown at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York, and now in the collection of the [[Museo Reina Sofía]] in Madrid. The Smolin Gallery sponsored two innovative Wolf Vostell events on TV; the first, ''Wolf Vostell and Television Decollage'', featured visitors to the gallery who were encouraged to create poster art on the walls.&lt;ref name="Salter2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salter|first=Chris|title=Entangled: Technology and the Transformation of Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBJbIP0fMr0C&amp;pg=PA122|year=2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-19588-1|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 his Happening ''Miss Vietnam'' dealt with the subject of the Vietnam war. In 1968, he founded Labor e.V., a group that was to investigate acoustic and visual events, together with [[Mauricio Kagel]], and others.

Wolf Vostell was the first artist in art history to integrate a television set into a work of art. This installation was created in 1958 under the title ''The black room'' is now part of the collection of the art museum [[Berlinische Galerie]] in Berlin. Early works with television sets are ''Transmigracion'' I-III from 1958 and ''Elektronischer Dé-coll/age Happening Raum''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/elektronische-decollage/ Electronic Dé-coll/age Happening Room 1968]&lt;/ref&gt;(''Electronic Dé-coll/age Happening Room'') an Installation from 1968. In 1974, his first major retrospective took place in the ARC 2 at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, an expanded version of which was shown at the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]], in 1974.

[[File:Goethe Heute.jpg|thumb|right|Wolf Vostell, ''Goethe Heute'', 1967]]

Vostell’s automobile-concrete-sculptures made from cars and concrete are to be found in Cologne ''Ruhender Verkehr'' (''Stationary traffic'') from 1969, in Berlin ''Zwei Beton-Cadillacs in Form der nackten Maja'' (''Concrete Cadillacs'') from 1987 as well as ''VOAEX'' (''Viaje de (H)ormigón por la Alta Extremadura'') from 1976 in the Museo Vostell Malpartida in Malpartida de Cáceres, Spain and ''Concrete Traffic'' from 1970 in Chicago.

Vostell also gained recognition for his drawings and objects, such as images of American B-52 bombers, published under the rubric "[[capitalist realism]]" and as a result of his inclusion of television sets with his paintings. [[Nam June Paik]] and Vostell were both participants in the [[Fluxus]] movement and the work of both artists involved a critique of the fetishization of television and the culture of consumption. The catalogue raisonné of his screen prints and posters has been published in the ''[[Nouvelles de l'estampe]]'' by Françoise Woimant and Anne Moeglin-Delcroix in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;''Nouvelles de l'estampe'', 1982, n°63, p.&amp;nbsp;17-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the town of Cologne honoured Vostell with a major retrospective of his work. His pieces were distributed over 6 exhibition venues: Stadtmuseum Köln, Kunsthalle Köln, Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn, Kunsthalle Mannheim, Schloss Morsbroich Leverkusen and Städtisches Museum Mülheim / Ruhr. Under the artistic direction of [[David Vostell]], the documentary ''Vostell 60 - Rückblick 92'' (''Vostell 60 - Review 92'') was created.

Vostell's grave is at the Cementerio Civil de la Almudena in [[Madrid]].

== Wolf Vostell Archive ==
At more or less the same time, Vostell founded the Vostell Archive. With great fervour and strict consistency, Wolf Vostell collected photographs, artistic texts, private correspondence with colleagues such as [[Nam June Paik]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Dick Higgins]] and many others, as well as press cuttings, invitations to exhibitions and events or books and catalogues which document wolf Vostell's work and that of his contemporaries. His private library with more than 6000 books has formed part of the Archive. Wolf Vostell’s extensive oeuvre is documented in photographic form and makes up part of the archive. About 25000 documents from four decades make the Vostell Archive a treasure of art history. Since 2005 the archive has been housed in the Museo Vostell Malpartida and is available to art historians, journalists and authors.

'''The Women's Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.)''' also known as Let MOMA Know, was a demonstration held on June 14, 1984 to protest the lack of women artists represented in [[Museum of Modern Art|The Museum of Modern Art]]'s re-opening exhibition "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Women March on MOMA|last=Lubell|first=Ellen|date=June 19, 1984|work=Village Voice|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition, which included 165 artists, had 14 women among them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Women Artists Picket MOMA|last=Shepard|first=Joan|date=June 15, 1984|work=New York Daily News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945948899|title=Openings : a memoir from the women's art movement, New York City 1970-1992|last=Sabra,|first=Moore,|isbn=9781613320181|edition= First|location=New York, NY|oclc=945948899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event ==
The event's acronym, W.A.V.E., is a nod to [[Flag Day]], which is observed on June 14 in the [[United States]]. 400 demonstrators, wearing [[suffragette]] yellow and white, marched in front the entrance to MoMA's newly expanded 53rd street building; a well received renovation that doubled its gallery space and increased traffic to the museum.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voices.revealdigital.com/cgi-bin/independentvoices?a=d&amp;d=DFDEGHA19840601&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1|title=WOMEN ARTISTS NEWS Summer 1984 — Independent Voices|website=voices.revealdigital.com|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pcparch.com/project/museum-of-modern-art|title=Museum of Modern Art Expansion|website=Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/15/magazine/the-new-moma.html|title=THE NEW MOMA|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|date=1984-04-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-29|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Demonstrators had three demands: that MoMA exhibit works by women artists from their permanent collection, that it display women's work in loaned exhibitions, and that it create a policy to acquire women's work in the future.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The WCA created pins to parody MoMA's "Museum of Modern Art OPENS" staff badges, upon which they included the addition "But Not to Women Artists." Cards were distributed listing the names of 100 well known female artists who were not featured in the exhibit, including [[Alice Neel]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Jaune Quick–to–See Smith|Jaune Quick-to-See Smith]], [[Faith Ringgold]] and [[Louise Bourgeois]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One spokesperson for the museum, Louisa Kreisberg, noted that a film series in the exhibition featured four women of the six films shown, and that the staff at the museum was roughly 65% female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Protest at the Modern For More Women's Art|last=Anderson|first=Susan Heller|date=June 15, 1984|work=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizers ==
The event was organized by the New York chapter of the [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (WCA), and supported by three additional feminist arts organizations; The [[Heresies Collective]], [[Women's Interart Center]], and [[New York Feminist Art Institute]]. Individual organizers for the event were artists [[Sabra Moore]], and [[Betsy Damon]] and curator and President of WCA New York, [[Annie Shaver-Crandell]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5330">[[Image:Xochiquetzal.jpg|thumb|Xochiquetzal, from the [[Codex Rios]], 16th century.]]
In [[Aztec mythology]], '''Xochiquetzal''' ({{lang-nci-IPA|Xōchiquetzal|ʃoːtʃiˈketsaɬ}}), also called '''Ichpochtli''' {{lang-nci-IPA|Ichpōchtli|itʃˈpoːtʃtɬi||}}, meaning "maiden",&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;''Nahuatl Dictionary.'' (1997). Wired Humanities Project. University of Oregon. Retrieved September 1, 2012, from [http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso link]&lt;/ref&gt; was a goddess associated with concepts of fertility, beauty, and female sexual power, serving as a protector of young mothers and a patroness of pregnancy, childbirth, and the crafts practised by women such as weaving and embroidery. In pre-Hispanic Maya culture, a similar figure is [[Goddess I]].

==Name==
The name ''Xōchiquetzal'' is a compound of ''[[wikt:xochitl|xōchitl]]'' (“flower”) and ''[[wikt:quetzalli|quetzalli]]'' (“precious feather; quetzal tail feather”). In Classical Nahuatl morphology, the first element in a compound modifies the second, and thus the goddess' name can literally be taken to mean “flower precious feather”, or ”flower quetzal feather”. Her alternative name, ''Ichpōchtli'', corresponds to a personalized usage of ''[[wikt:ichpochtli|ichpōchtli]]'' (“maiden, young woman”).

==Description==
[[Image:Ichpuchtli.jpg|thumb|left|Xochiquetzal in [[Codex Borgia]].]]

Unlike several other figures in the complex of Aztec female earth deities connected with agricultural and sexual fecundity, Xochiquetzal is always depicted as an alluring and youthful woman, richly attired and symbolically associated with vegetation and in particular flowers. By connotation, Xochiquetzal is also representative of human desire, pleasure, and excess, appearing also as patroness of artisans involved in the manufacture of luxury items.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen (1991, p.163); Miller &amp; Taube (1993, p.190); Smith (2003, p.203)&lt;/ref&gt;

She was followed by a retinue consisting of [[birds]] and [[butterfly|butterflies]].  Worshippers wore animal and flower masks at a festival, held in her honor every eight years. Her twin was [[Xochipilli]] and her husband was [[Tlaloc]], until [[Tezcatlipoca]] kidnapped her and she was forced to marry him.  At one point, she was also married to [[Centeotl]] and [[Xiuhtecuhtli]].  By [[Mixcoatl]], she was the mother of [[Quetzalcoatl]].

Ichpōchtli is an alternative form of Xochiquetzal representative of beauty, sex, crafts, fertility, dance, music, singing, weaving, magic, and love spells. [[Tagetes|Marigolds]] are sacred to her.

Anthropologist Hugo Nutini identifies her with the [[Virgin of Ocotlan]] in his article on patron saints in [[Tlaxcala]].&lt;ref&gt;Nutini (1976), ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Y.M.C.A.'''" is a song by the American disco group [[Village People]]. It was released in 1978 as the only single from their third studio album ''[[Cruisin' (album)|Cruisin']]'' (1978). The song reached Number 2 on the US charts in early 1979 and reached Number 1 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] around the same time, becoming the group's biggest hit. It is one of fewer than 40 [[Single (music)|singles]] to have [[list of best-selling singles|sold 10 million]] (or more) physical copies worldwide.  A [[medley (music)|medley]] with "[[Hot Cop]]" reached number 2 on ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard's]]'' [[Dance Music/Club Play Singles]] chart.&lt;ref name=chart&gt;{{cite web|title=The Village People Awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-village-people-mn0000808201/awards|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song remains popular and is played at many [[sporting events]] in the U.S. and Europe, with crowds using the dance in which the arms are used to spell out the four letters of the song's title. "Y.M.C.A." appeared as Space Shuttle Wakeup call on mission [[STS-106]], on day 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/audio/shuttle/sts-106/html/ndexpage.html |title=Audio Wakeup Call Index |publisher=Spaceflight.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, "Y.M.C.A." was entered into the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' when over 44,000 people danced to the song with Village People singing live at the [[2008 Sun Bowl]] game in [[El Paso, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Jan |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/dancing-without-stars-ymca-other-record-breaking-dance-20110202-225100-660.html |title=Dancing Without the Stars: "YMCA" and Other Record-Breaking Dance Events – Yahoo TV |publisher=Tv.yahoo.com |date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Y.M.C.A." is number 7 on [[VH1]]'s list of The 100 Greatest Dance Songs of the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/other/vh1.shtml |title=the VH1's 100 Greatest Dance Songs @ |publisher=Disco-disco.com |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Victor Willis]], lead singer and lyricist, recalls that while in the studio, [[Jacques Morali]] asked him, "What exactly is the [[YMCA]]?"  After Willis explained it to him, he saw the expression on Morali's face and said, "Don't tell me, Jacques, you want to write a song about it?" and they quickly wrote the track for the album ''[[Cruisin' (album)|Cruisin']]''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Willis Interview, SiriusXM Radio, Studio 54 Channel, Marc and Myra Show, September 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release, the YMCA threatened to sue the band over trademark infringement. The organization ultimately settled with the composers out of court and later expressed pride regarding the song saluting the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/61754/how-did-real-ymca-react-disco-song-about-it|title=How Did the Real YMCA React to the Disco Song About It?|date=February 20, 2015|website=Mentalfloss.com|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song became a Number 1 hit throughout the world (although not in the [[United States]] where it was kept out of the top spot by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s "[[Le Freak]]" and [[Rod Stewart]]'s "[[Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]"). It has remained popular at parties, sporting events, weddings, and functions ever since.

In 2011, Willis filed a notice of copyright termination to the song as lyricist under the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] which allows recording artists and writers to reclaim their master recordings and publishing. In a landmark ruling in 2012, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California]] ruled that Willis can terminate his copyrights granted to the publishers Can't Stop Productions and Scorpio Music because "a joint author who separately transfers his copyright interest may unilaterally terminate the grant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/village-people-ymca-lawsuit-victor-willis-321576 |title=Village People Songwriter Victor Willis Wins Case Over Termination of 'Y.M.C.A.'

Willis now owns 50% of the song previously credited to Belolo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/jury-decides-village-people-ymca-779420|title=Jury Decides Village People 'Y.M.C.A.'

==Content==
Taken at face value, the song's [[lyrics]] extol the virtues of the [[YMCA|Young Men's Christian Association]]. In the [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures#Gay male culture|gay culture]] from which the Village People sprang, the song was implicitly understood as celebrating the YMCA's reputation as a popular [[cruising for sex|cruising]] and [[casual sex|hookup]] spot, particularly for the younger men to whom it was addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, Caryn E. glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture [http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/ymca_S.pdf YMCA]&lt;/ref&gt; Willis, the group's lead singer and lyricist, said through his publicist that he did not write "Y.M.C.A." as a gay anthem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.towleroad.com/2007/08/village-people-.html |title=Village People Cop: Y.M.C.A. Not about Gay Cruising |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as a reflection of young urban black youth fun at the YMCA such as [[basketball]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. That said, he has often acknowledged his fondness for [[double entendre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Gay Village People Co-Founder Says 'YMCA' Not A Gay Song|newspaper = [[The Huffington Post]]|first = Benjamin|last = Boles|date = February 7, 2014|accessdate = December 19, 2016|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/07/02/the-village-people-ymca_n_5543849.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Victor Willis on life &amp; music, post-Village People|first = George|last = Varga|date = August 2, 2015|url = http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/music/sdut-victor-willis-interview-2015aug02-story.html|accessdate = December 19, 2016|newspaper = [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Willis says that he wrote the song in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070802/village_people_070802?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |title='Macho Man,' 'Y.M.C.A.' about straight fun: publicist – CTV News |publisher=CTV.ca |date=August 2, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220183557/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070802/village_people_070802?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |archivedate=February 20, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial goal of Morali and Belolo was to attract disco's gay audience by featuring popular gay fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3492500086.html|title=The Village People – FREE The Village People information {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: Find The Village People research|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although co-creator Morali was gay and the group was initially intended to target gay men, the other group members were straight men, who simply enjoyed disco culture. Therefore, the group became more popular and more mainstream over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gawker.com/village-person-says-y-m-c-a-isnt-about-gays-is-pro-1493380284|title=Village Person Says "Y.M.C.A."

==Song structure==
The song, played in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[G♭ major]], begins with a [[brass instruments|brass]] riff, backed by the constant pulse that typified disco. Many different instruments are used throughout for an overall orchestral feel, another disco convention, but it is brass that stands out.

As with other Village People hits, the lead vocals are handled by Willis and the background vocals are supplied by Willis and professional background singers. The distinctive vocal line features the repeated "Young man!" [[ecphonesis]] followed by Willis singing the verse lines. The background vocals join in throughout the song.

Willis's version of the song is used in the film, ''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'', though by that time [[Ray Simpson]] had replaced him as the policeman.

==Impact and legacy==
''[[VH1]]'' placed "Y.M.C.A." at #7 in their list of '''100 Greatest Dance Songs''' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1dance.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Dance Songs|website=www.rockonthenet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste Magazine]]'' ranked the song number 1 in their list of '''The 60 Best Dancefloor Classics''' in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/02/the-60-best-dance-floor-classics.html?p=6|title=The 60 Best Dancefloor Classics|publisher=pastemagazine.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of hand movement and dance==
[[Image:YMCA dance.jpg|thumb|The YMCA dance demonstrated in a [[photomontage]]. In this rendition, the M (second from left) is done in a popular variant.]]
[[Image:Ymca dance.jpg|thumb|Members of the grounds crew of [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] pause to do the YMCA dance.]]
''YMCA'' is also the name of a [[group dance]] with cheerleader Y-M-C-A choreography invented to fit the song. One of the phases involves moving arms to form the letters Y-M-C-A as they are sung in the chorus:

:'''Y''' {{emdash}}arms outstretched and raised upwards
:'''M''' {{emdash}}made by bending the elbows from the 'Y' pose so the fingertips meet in front of the chest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialvillagepeople.com/VP%20Live%20page/pages/020_20.htm |title=Official Village People website, July 4, 2004 |publisher=Officialvillagepeople.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214163935/http://www.officialvillagepeople.com/VP%20Live%20page/pages/020_20.htm |archivedate=February 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''C''' {{emdash}}arms extended to the left
:'''A''' {{emdash}}hands held together above head

The dance originated on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]''. During the January 6, 1979 episode, which featured the Village People as guests throughout the hour, the dance was performed by audience members while the group performed "YMCA." Clark then said to Willis that he would like to show him something. Clark again played the song with the audience doing the YMCA hand gestures. Willis immediately picked up on the dance and mimicked the hand movements back at the audience as other Village People members stared at him with puzzled looks. Clark then turned to Willis and said, "Victor, think you can work this dance into your routine?"  Willis responded, "I think we're gonna have to."&lt;ref&gt;''American Bandstand'' 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 retrospective article for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', Randy Jones has opined that the dance may have originated as a misunderstanding: The group's original choreographed dance had the group clapping above their heads during the chorus and he believes that the audience, believing them to be making the letter "Y", began following suit.&lt;ref name=Oralhistory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearlman|first1=Jeff|title=Y.M.C.A (An Oral History)|website=Spin|url=http://www.spin.com/2008/05/ymca-oral-history/|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the sixth inning of [[New York Yankees]] [[baseball]] [[game]]s at [[Yankee Stadium]], the grounds crew traditionally grooms the [[infielder|infield]] while leading the crowd in the dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweblicist.com/wordpress/2007/08/05/ny-yankee-stadium-7th-inning-stretch/|title=NY- Yankee Stadium- 7th Inning Stretch|work=I Photo New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In September 2012, a [[Slovenia]]n musical group and stand-up comedians [[Slon in Sadež]] released a [[Slovene language|Slovene]] parody of the YMCA-song with the title "NNLB".

The representatives of each of the four Village People characters did the arm dance in order after Pharaoh recited the appropriate verse of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Badash |url=http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/funny-or-not-funny-snls-obama-explains-sequester-using-village-people/politics/2013/03/04/61738 |title=Funny Or Not Funny?

*In November 2013, Chris Pennington released a parody of the song directed at [[Montreal Canadiens]] head coach [[Michel Therrien]], entitled "Why not P.K.?", expressing sentiment that Therrien was not giving star Canadiens [[defenceman]] [[P. K. Subban]] enough ice time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nesn.com/2013/11/p-k-subban-anthem-implores-more-ice-time-for-defenseman-catchy-song-inspired-by-village-people-audio/ |title=P.K.
