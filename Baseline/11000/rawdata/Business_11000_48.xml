'''Adam Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSA}} ({{OldStyleDateNY|16 June|5 June}} 1723&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/smith_adam.shtml|title=Adam Smith (1723-1790)|website=BBC|quote=Adam Smith's exact date of birth is unknown, but he was baptised on 5 June 1723.}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish [[economist]], [[philosopher]] and [[author]] as well as a [[Ethics|moral philosopher]], a pioneer of [[political economy]] and a key figure during the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/enlightenment/features_enlightenment_enlightenment.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is best known for two classic works, ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) and ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of economics.

Smith studied [[social philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot [[John Snell]]. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at [[Edinburgh]], leading him to collaborate with [[David Hume]] during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.

Smith laid the foundations of classical [[free market]] economic theory. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of [[Division of labour#Adam Smith|division of labour]] and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of [[William Hogarth]] and [[Jonathan Swift]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.&lt;ref name="100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith"&gt;[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ "100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith"]. Retrieved 31 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===

Smith was born in [[Kirkcaldy]], in the County of [[Fife]], Scotland. His father, also Adam Smith, was a Scottish [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet|Writer to the Signet]] (senior [[Solicitor#Scotland|solicitor]]), [[Advocate#Scotland|advocate]] and [[Prosecutor#Scotland|prosecutor]] (judge advocate) and also served as comptroller of the customs in Kirkcaldy.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720, he married Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife. His father died two months after he was born, leaving his mother a widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date of Smith's baptism into the [[Church of Scotland]] at Kirkcaldy was &lt;!-- 5 June is OS; 5 June is NS. --&gt;5 June 1723&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth,&lt;ref name="rae 1895 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is unknown. Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist [[John Rae (biographer)|John Rae]], Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him.{{efn|In ''Life of Adam Smith'', Rae writes: "In his fourth year, while on a visit to his grandfather's house at Strathendry on the banks of the Leven, [Smith] was stolen by a passing band of gypsies, and for a time could not be found. But presently a gentleman arrived who had met a gypsy woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that was crying piteously. Scouts were immediately dispatched in the direction indicated, and they came upon the woman in Leslie wood. As soon as she saw them she threw her burden down and escaped, and the child was brought back to his mother. [Smith] would have made, I fear, a poor gypsy."&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5" /&gt;}} Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Burgh School of Kirkcaldy]]—characterised by Rae as "one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period"&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;—from 1729 to 1737, he learned [[Latin]], mathematics, history, and writing.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"/&gt;

===Formal education===

Smith entered the [[University of Glasgow]] when he was 14 and studied moral philosophy under [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"/&gt; Here, Smith developed his passion for [[liberty]], [[reason]], and [[free speech]]. In 1740, Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], under the [[Snell Exhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book V, Chapter II of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith wrote: "In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching."
Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rae 1895 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Robert Scott, "The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Economics |publisher=New Age Publishers |isbn=81-224-1830-9 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref name="rae 1895 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 24–25"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book V of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at [[List of universities in England|English universities]], when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt;

Smith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson"—a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, W.&amp;nbsp;R. "The Never to Be Forgotten Hutcheson: Excerpts from W.&amp;nbsp;R. Scott," ''Econ Journal Watch 8(1):'' 96–109, January 2011.[http://econjwatch.org/articles/the-never-to-be-forgotten-hutcheson-excerpts-from-wr-scott]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam Smith's mother.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|Portrait of Smith's mother, Margaret Douglas]]
===Teaching career===
Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 in Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Lord Kames]].&lt;ref name="rae 1895 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lecture topics included [[rhetoric]] and ''[[belles-lettres]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. ([1762] 1985). ''Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres'' [1762]. vol. IV of the Glasgow Edition of the ''Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'' (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1984). Retrieved 16 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and later the subject of "the progress of opulence". On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of "the obvious and simple system of [[Natural and legal rights|natural liberty]]". While Smith was not adept at [[public speaking]], his lectures met with success.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750, Smith met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smith, Adam (bap. 1723, d. 1790) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=September 2004 |author=Winch, Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching [[logic]] courses, and in 1752, he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow]] died the next year, Smith took over the position.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43" /&gt; He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as "by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]".&lt;ref name="rae 1895 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith published ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined "mutual sympathy" as the basis of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]. He based his explanation, not on a special "moral sense" as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.

[[File:François Quesnay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[François Quesnay]], one of the leaders of the [[Physiocracy|physiocratic]] school of thought|alt=A drawing of a man sitting down]]
Following the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of [[Doctor of Law]]s (LL.D.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/smith/photogallery/honorarydegree/|title=MyGlasgow - Archive Services - Exhibitions - Adam Smith in Glasgow - Photo Gallery - Honorary degree|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith resigned from his professorship in 1764 to take the tutoring position. He subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he had resigned partway through the term, but his students refused.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tutoring and travels===
Smith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects, such as etiquette and manners. He was paid [[Pound sterling|£]]300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16" /&gt; Smith first travelled as a tutor to [[Toulouse]], France, where he stayed for a year and a half. According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he "had begun to write a book to pass away the time".&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16" /&gt; After touring the south of France, the group moved to [[Geneva]], where Smith met with the philosopher [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allan Ramsay - David Hume, 1711 - 1776. Historian and philosopher - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Hume]] was a friend and contemporary of Smith's.|alt=A man posing for a painting]]
From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here, Smith met [[Benjamin Franklin]], and discovered the [[Physiocracy]] school founded by [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiocrats were opposed to [[mercantilism]], the dominating economic theory of the time, illustrated in their motto ''[[Laissez-faire|Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!]]'' (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!).

The wealth of France had been virtually depleted by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]]{{efn|During the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]], the population shrunk by 4 million and agricultural productivity was reduced by one-third while the taxes had increased. Cusminsky, Rosa, de Cendrero, 1967, ''Los Fisiócratas'', Buenos Aires: Centro Editor de América Latina, p. 6}} and [[Louis XV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XV]] in ruinous wars,{{efn|1701–1714 War of the Spanish Succession, 1688–1697 War of the Grand Alliance, 1672–1678 Franco-Dutch War, 1667–1668 War of Devolution, 1618–1648 Thirty Years' War}} and was further exhausted in aiding the [[American Revolution|American insurgents]] against the British. The excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution was considered a source of unproductive labour, with France's agriculture the only economic sector maintaining the wealth of the nation.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that "with all its imperfections, [the Physiocratic school] is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Campbell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, vol. 2b, p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic ''classe steril''—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.

===Later years===
In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next decade to writing his ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he befriended [[Henry Moyes]], a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude.  Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and [[Thomas Reid]] in the young man's education.&lt;ref&gt;''Dr [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] to [[Thomas Creevey]]'', 24 February 1793, Lpool RO, Currie MS 920 CUR&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a member of the [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]] in 1775. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother (who died in 1784)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|title=The Story of Civilization: Rousseau and Revolution|date=1 July 1967|publisher=MJF Books|ISBN=1567310214}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Panmure House (Edinburgh)|Panmure House]] in Edinburgh's [[Canongate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1787 to 1789, he occupied the honorary position of Lord [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

Smith died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness. His body was buried in the [[Canongate Kirkyard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his deathbed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist [[Joseph Black]] and the pioneering geologist [[James Hutton]].&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned an early unpublished ''History of Astronomy'' as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as ''[[Essays on Philosophical Subjects]]''.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 25"/&gt;

Smith's library went by his will to [[David Douglas, Lord Reston]] (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter= Adam Smith's Will |title=A Catalogue of the Library of Adam Smith |editor=Bonar, James |editor-link= James Bonar (civil servant) |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |year=1894 |pages= XIV |oclc=2320634 |url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueoflibr00smit#page/n19/mode/2up |ref=harv |via=Internet Archive}|accessdate= 13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Bannerman). On the death of her husband, the Reverend W.&amp;nbsp;B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878, Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor [[Robert Oliver Cunningham]] of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death, the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879, her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church) in Edinburgh and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972.

==Personality and beliefs==

===Character===
[[File:Smith medallion portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|[[James Tassie]]'s enamel paste medallion of Smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonar|1895|pp=xx–xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=An enamel paste medallion, depicting a man's head facing the right]]

Not much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 88" /&gt; He never married,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of "inexpressible benignity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to talk to himself,&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53" /&gt; a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Skousen|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness,&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53" /&gt; and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32" /&gt; According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] factory, and while discussing [[free trade]], Smith walked into a huge [[Tanning (leather)|tanning pit]] from which he needed help to escape.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 14"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up {{convert|15|mi|km}} outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz 14" /&gt;

[[James Boswell]], who was a student of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the [[The Club (Literary Club)|Literary Club]], says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], that 'he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood'.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell's '[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', 1780.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdamSmith1790b.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Smith by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], 1790|alt=A drawing of a man standing up, with one hand holding a cane and the other pointing at a book]]

Smith has been alternately described as someone who "had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment" and one whose "countenance was manly and agreeable."&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|2010|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, "I am a beau in nothing but my books."&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt; Smith rarely sat for portraits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Dugald |title=The Works of Adam Smith: With An Account of His Life and Writings |publisher=Henry G. Bohn |location=London |year=1853 |page=lxix |oclc=3226570 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FbYCAAAAYAAJ |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by [[James Tassie]] and two [[etching]]s by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=376–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th-century reprints of ''The Wealth of Nations'' were based largely on Tassie's medallion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonar|1895|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious views===
Considerable scholarly debate has occurred about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Times obituary of Adam Smith|journal=[[The Times]]|date=24 July 1790|pages=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Times/1790/Obituary/Adam_Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglo-American economist [[Ronald Coase]] has challenged the view that Smith was a deist, based on the fact that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds.&lt;ref name="Coase"&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|pp=529–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the "[[Great Architect of the Universe]]", later scholars such as [[Jacob Viner]] have "very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God",&lt;ref name="Coase-God"&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|p=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the ''Wealth of Nations'' in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the "great phenomena of nature", such as "the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals", has led men to "enquire into their causes", and that "superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods".&lt;ref name="Coase-God" /&gt;

Some other authors argue that Smith's social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God's action in nature.&lt;ref name="hidden theology"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=L. |doi=10.1080/713765225 |title=The hidden theology of Adam Smith |journal=The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought |volume=8 |pages=1–29 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was also a close friend and later the executor of David Hume, who was commonly characterised in his own time as an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name="hume on religion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ |title=Hume on Religion |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to [[William Strahan (publisher)|William Strahan]], in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eric Schliesser |year=2003 |journal=Hume Studies |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=327–62 |title=The Obituary of a Vain Philosopher: Adam Smith's Reflections on Hume's Life |url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v29n2/schliesser/schliesser-v29n2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==

===''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''===
{{Main article|The Theory of Moral Sentiments}}
In 1759, Smith published his first work, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments,'' sold by co-publishers [[Andrew Millar]] of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/|title=Andrew Millar Project, University of Edinburgh|website=millar-project.ed.ac.uk|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith continued making extensive revisions to the book until his death.{{efn|The 6 editions of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' were published in 1759, 1761, 1767, 1774, 1781, and 1790, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith, Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence Vol. 1 The Theory of Moral Sentiments [1759]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although ''The Wealth of Nations'' is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, Smith himself  is believed to have considered ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' to be a superior work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek "mutual sympathy of sentiments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&amp;item=biography |title=Biography of Smith |accessdate=14 May 2008 |publisher=[[Liberal Democrat History Group]] |year=1997 |author=Falkner, Robert |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611110312/http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&amp;item=biography |archivedate=11 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgement, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgements creates an incentive to achieve "mutual sympathy of sentiments" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Wight, Jonathan B. ''Saving Adam Smith''. Upper Saddle River: Prentic-Hall, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel. ''A History of Economic Thought''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brue, Stanley L., and Randy R. Grant. ''The Evolution of Economic Thought''. Mason: Thomson Higher Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. They claim that in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the "impartial spectator" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. [[James Otteson|Otteson]] argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar "market model" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language.&lt;ref&gt;Otteson, James R. 2002, ''Adam Smith's Marketplace of Life''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Ekelund|Ekelund]] and Hebert offer a differing view, observing that self-interest is present in both works and that "in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;Ekelund, R. &amp; Hebert, R. 2007, ''A History of Economic Theory and Method'' 5th Edition. Waveland Press, United States, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Wealth of Nations''===
{{Main article|The Wealth of Nations}}

Disagreement exists between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776). Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's [[invisible hand]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Campbell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 2a, p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – Book&amp;nbsp;IV, Chapter&amp;nbsp;II – and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the "wealth of nations" in the first sentences, which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour.

Smith used the term "[[invisible hand|the invisible hand]]" in "History of Astronomy"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1980, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 3, p. 49, edited by W.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;D. Wightman and J.&amp;nbsp;C. Bryce, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "the invisible hand of Jupiter", and once in each of his ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]''&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 1, pp. 184–85, edited by D.&amp;nbsp;D. Raphael and A.&amp;nbsp;L. Macfie, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1759) and [[The Wealth of Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 2a, p. 456, edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Cambell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1776). This last statement about "an invisible hand" has been interpreted in numerous ways.

[[File:19th-century building at location where Adam Smith lived, 1767-1776.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Smith House|Later building on the site]] where Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations''|alt=A brown building]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]
Smith's statement about the benefits of "an invisible hand" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that "Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits".&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their "conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 145, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants "in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (''The Wealth of Nations,'' I.i.10)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about "an invisible hand" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] – [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] "Economics" refers six times to Smith's "invisible hand". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.&amp;nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&amp;nbsp;D., 1989, ''Economics'', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; quotes Smith's "invisible hand" statement substituting "general interest" for "public interest". Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.&amp;nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&amp;nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes: "Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market."

[[File:Smith - Inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, 1922 - 5231847.tif|thumb|170px|1922 printing of ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'']]
Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote "The Wealth of Nations". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[François Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated ''The Wealth of Nations'' to him had he not died beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, D., 1799, ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.'', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, 21 January, and 18 March 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—"general plenty" and "universal opulence"—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures "The Wealth of Nations". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the "Wealth of Nations" summarise this policy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;
* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,
* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Smith added that the "abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and dissent===
[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The "invisible hand" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small ("atomistic") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the "invisible hand" fails. Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: "the reason that the [[invisible hand]] often seems invisible is that it is often not there."&lt;ref&gt;''The Roaring Nineties'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]

Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).&lt;ref&gt;''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', 1982, 6 volumes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===In economics and moral philosophy===
''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith – Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.&lt;ref name="100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith" /&gt; 

In light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain embraced free trade and Smith's ''laissez-faire'' economics, and via the [[British Empire]], used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.&lt;ref&gt;L.Seabrooke (2006). "Global Standards of Market Civilization". p. 192. Taylor &amp; Francis 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, George&amp;nbsp;J. (1976). "The Successes and Failures of Professor Smith," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 84(6), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1831274 pp. 1199]–213, 1202.

[[Paul Samuelson]] finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the [[general equilibrium]] modelling of [[Walras]] a century later. Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], and [[Karl Marx]] in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Paul A. (1977). "A Modern Theorist's Vindication of Adam Smith," ''American Economic Review'', 67(1), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1815879 p. 42.] Reprinted in J.C. Wood, ed., ''Adam Smith: Critical Assessments'', pp. 498–509. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8FY8mo5zX4C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA498=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] criticised Smith for a lack of technical rigour, yet he argued that this enabled Smith's writings to appeal to wider audiences: "His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the "[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Das Kapital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name="Roemer"&gt;[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). "Marxian Value Analysis". ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). "Marx, Karl Heinrich", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'' v. 3, pp. 372, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.

The body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for "economic science" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term "[[political economy]]" used by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#PPA2,M1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jevons, W. Stanley |year=1879 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#PPR3,M1 |title=The Theory of Political Economy |page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach'', 2nd ed., Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical economics systematised [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Antonietta (1987). "Marginalist Economics", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or "economic man" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in "The Secret History of the Dismal Science" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The "Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=§Book I, Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.&lt;ref&gt;"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy" in ''Postclassical Economics'' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&amp;Levy,%20final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all. (Source: ''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In British Imperial debates===
Smith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. ''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Benians, ‘Adam Smith’s project of an empire’, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire "on the cheap" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846–1946'' (Oxford, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shield Nicholson, ''A project of empire: a critical study of the economics of imperialism, with special reference to the ideas of Adam Smith'' (London, 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; As Marc-William Palen notes: "On the one hand, Adam Smith’s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith’s theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before."&lt;ref&gt;Marc-William Palen, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9159669&amp;fileId=S0018246X13000101 “Adam Smith as Advocate of Empire, c. 1870–1932,”] ''Historical Journal'' 57: 1 (March 2014): 179–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.

===Portraits, monuments, and banknotes===

Smith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the [[Pound sterling|£]]50 notes issued by the [[Clydesdale Bank]] in Scotland,&lt;ref name="clydesdale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |title=Clydesdale 50 Pounds, 1981 |publisher=Ron Wise's Banknoteworld |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030185820/http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |archivedate=30 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotbanks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |title=Current Banknotes : Clydesdale Bank |publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003071439/http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |archivedate=3 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2007 Smith's image also appeared on the new series of [[Bank of England £20 note|£20 notes]] issued by the [[Bank of England]], making him the first Scotsman to feature on an [[Bank of England note issues|English banknote]].&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |title=Smith replaces Elgar on £20 note |accessdate=14 May 2008 |publisher=BBC |date=29 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324062831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |archivedate=24 March 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:6 Burlington Gardens facade Smith.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of Smith built in 1867–1870 at the old headquarters of the [[University of London]], 6 Burlington Gardens]]

A large-scale memorial of Smith by [[Alexander Stoddart]] was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}}-tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the [[Royal Mile]] outside [[St&amp;nbsp;Giles' Cathedral]] in Parliament Square, near the [[Mercat cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adam Smith sculpture to tower over Royal Mile |date=26 September 2007 |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |author=Blackley, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century sculptor [[Jim Sanborn]] (best known for the ''[[Kryptos]]'' sculpture at the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) has created multiple pieces which feature Smith's work.

A bust of Smith is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]].

===Residence===
Adam Smith resided at Panmure House from 1778 to 1790. This residence has now been purchased by the [[Edinburgh Business School]] at [[Heriot Watt University]] and fundraising has begun to restore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The restoration of Panmure House |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/misc/the-restoration-of-panmure-house |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122103606/http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/misc/the-restoration-of-panmure-house |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adam Smith's Home Gets Business School Revival |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/adam-smith-s-home-gets-business-school-revival-byl368j8Sii~TiQiBHwEyw.html |work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.

===As a symbol of free-market economics===
[[File:Sanborn-CSU.jpg|thumb|upright|''Adam Smith's Spinning Top'', sculpture by [[Jim Sanborn]] at [[Cleveland State University]]|alt=A sculpture of an upside down cone]]

Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the [[Adam Smith Institute]] in London, the Adam Smith Society&lt;ref name="urlThe Adam Smith Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721032612/http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archivedate=21 July 2007 |title=The Adam Smith Society |accessdate=24 May 2008 |publisher=The Adam Smith Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Adam Smith Club,&lt;ref name="urlThe Australian Adam Smith Club"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmithclub.org/ |title=The Australian Adam Smith Club |accessdate=12 October 2008 |publisher=Adam Smith Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3748 |title=Interview with Milton Friedman |last=Levy |first=David |date=June 1992 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |accessdate=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Greenspan]] argues that, while Smith did not coin the term ''[[laissez-faire]]'', "it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions". Greenspan continues that ''The Wealth of Nations'' was "one of the great achievements in human intellectual history".&lt;ref name="urlFRB: Speech, Greenspan – Adam Smith – 6 February 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050206/default.htm |title=FRB: Speech, Greenspan – Adam Smith – 6 February 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512080427/http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050206/default.htm |archivedate=12 May 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. J. O'Rourke]] describes Smith as the "founder of free market economics".&lt;ref name="urlAdam Smith: Web Junkie – Forbes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2007/0507/086.html |title=Adam Smith: Web Junkie |work=Forbes |accessdate=10 June 2008 |date=5 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520232632/http://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2007/0507/086.html |archivedate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers have argued that Smith's support for ''laissez-faire'' (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. [[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who "wear an Adam Smith necktie" do it to "make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith "was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie." In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and "[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an "extreme dogmatic defender of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]".&lt;ref name="Brown93"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230–32 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.&lt;ref name="Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them [[Luxury tax|luxury-goods taxes]] and tax on rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |title=Market Man |date=18 October 2010 |work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Smith argued for the "impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting "justice" and "certain publick institutions" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ix.51).

Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: "Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves . . . are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state" (''Wealth of Nations,'' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because "we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff "seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ii.39).

[[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called "natural liberty"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of ''laissez-faire''.&lt;ref name="Viner 1927"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Viner, Jacob |date=April 1927 |journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198–232 |doi=10.1086/253837 |title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire |jstor=1823421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Daniel B. Klein|Daniel Klein]] believes using the term "free-market economics" or "free-market economist" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the "Smithian" identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2008 |title=Toward a Public and Professional Identity for Our Economics |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=358–72 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/toward-a-public-and-professional-identity-for-our-economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2009 |title=Desperately Seeking Smithians: Responses to the Questionnaire about Building an Identity |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=113–80 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/desperately-seeking-smithians-responses-to-the-questionnaire-about-building-an-identity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[David Ricardo]] set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.&lt;ref name="New Ideas From Dead Economists"&gt;Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.&lt;ref name="New Ideas From Dead Economists"/&gt;

Some have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Christopher. "Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795–96," ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 110–25, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96]&lt;/ref&gt; although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 1, Chapter 8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life==
Alexei Motlokhov is the son of [[Vladimir Motlokhov]], who works for the Russian fertilizer giant, [[PhosAgro]] (controlled by [[Andrey Guryev]]), and was vice-governor of the Murmansk region from 2000 to 2008, where PhosAgro mines its phosphate.&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt; Motlokhov received a PhD in economics in 2006.&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt;

==Career==
Motlokhov runs the hedge fund Kola Capital with [[Mike Hollings]] and [[Ken Ginsburg]], and they operate the [[Cayman Islands]]-domiciled Kola Global Opportunities Fund, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rob Langston |url=https://hfm.global/hfmweek/news/exclusive-industry-veterans-launch-kola-capital-with-100m/ |title=Industry veterans launch Kola Capital with $100m &amp;#124; HFM Week &amp;#124; An HFM network |publisher=Hfm.global |date=1 August 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Motlokhov is married to Yulia Guryeva-Motlokhov, the daughter of Russian billionaire [[Andrey Guryev]].&lt;ref name="standard1"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Churchill |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/row-over-hedge-fund-bosss-theme-park-plan-for-highgate-a3578156.html |title=Row over hedge fund boss's 'theme park' plan for Highgate &amp;#124; London Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have twin sons and live next door to Guryev, who owns [[Witanhurst]] in Highgate, London's second largest house after [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref name="standard1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caesar|first1=Ed|title=House of Secrets:  Who owns London’s most expensive mansion?|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/01/house-of-secrets?intcid=mod-yml|accessdate=24 May 2015|work=New Yorker|issue=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several local residents wrote to [[Camden London Borough Council|Camden Council]] about a 57-metre long adventure playground that they were planning to build in their back garden, complaining that "The plans are on a commercial scale and it looks like this will be more like a theme park than a playground."&lt;ref name="standard1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5011">[[File:Coto (cropped).jpg|thumb|Alfredo Coto]]
'''Alfredo Coto''' (born October 9, 1941) is a prominent Argentine businessman.

==Life==
Alfredo Coto was born in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1941. His father, Joaquín Coto, was an [[Immigration in Argentina|immigrant]] from [[Galicia (Spain)]], and the owner of a small [[butcher]] shop in the [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] section of the city. Working alongside his father from age nine, and joining him in neighborhood deliveries, Coto became a wholesaler in 1963, buying [[rump roast]] and other cuts from a [[Kosher]] butcher who could not use them.&lt;ref name=majul&gt;Majul, Luis. ''Los nuevos ricos de la Argentina''. Buenos Aires: Editorial Sudamericana, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; He opened his own, [[Boedo]] neighborhood retail butcher in 1969, and managed the shop with his wife, Gloria.&lt;ref name=nacion&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=751855 ''La Nación'': Alfredo Coto, un imperio tras las góndolas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the customer base that the couple had cultivated through wholesale delivery, Coto owned 20 shops by 1976, and began supplying [[steakhouse]]s. He purchased a [[cattle ranch]] in 1978, and in 1981, a [[slaughterhouse]], thus becoming his own supplier. Coto's success made him a target, however, and in 1981, he was held for 11 days in a ransom [[kidnapping]].&lt;ref name=majul/&gt;

Operating 34 retail outlets by 1987, each averaging around 40 tons of [[beef]] and [[offal]] sales a month, he opened his first [[supermarket]] in [[Mar de Ajó]] (a seaside tourist destination).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coto.com.ar/ Coto] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coto Supermarkets]] expanded rapidly afterwards, and in 1992, he opened his first [[hypermarket]]. The company opened five [[shopping mall]]s from the late 1990s onwards (each anchored by a Coto hypermarket), as well as a wholesale distribution and production center in [[Monte Grande]].&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1997/05/23/o-02801d.htm ''Clarín'': Coto lanza dos hipermercados y un centro de distribución] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The chain, a [[sole proprietorship]], remained a [[private company]]; a ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' article at the time, however, outlined that by 1996, it netted over a billion [[US dollars]] in sales, and that its [[net income]] exceeded US$31 million.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt; 

Coto and his chain were reportedly the targets of [[extortion]] during 1996 and 1997, when bombs were placed in five outlets by the self-styled People's Revolutionary Organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=61475 ''La Nación'': Más amenazas de atentados contra Coto] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; More fortunate than other targets, the Coto chain suffered no damages, and the group was later apprehended by police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-4415-2002-04-25.html ''Página/12'': Condenas de hasta 18 años a la ORP que atacó a Bergés] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition of the Norte chain by [[France|French]] retailer [[Carrefour]] in 2000 left Coto as the largest domestic supermarket retailer in Argentina, and Coto remained third overall (behind Carrefour and [[Chile]]an retailer [[Cencosud]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carrefour.com/cdc/finance/publications-and-presentations/financial-releases/-norte-.html Carrefour: Financial releases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720134353/http://www.carrefour.com/cdc/finance/publications-and-presentations/financial-releases/-norte-.html |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The largest domestic grocer in a country where [[inflation]] is problematic, as well as perennially contentious in politics, Coto was personally criticized in a November 2005 press conference by President [[Néstor Kirchner]], who, discussing retailers' role in rising inflation, referred to the businessman using the company's slogan, ''yo te conozco'' ("I know you").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=759065 ''La Nación'': Kirchner volvió a apuntar contra los súper] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coto maintained cordial relations with the government, however,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0172/articulo.php?art=560&amp;ed=0172 ''Diario Perfil'': Kirchner primero pega, después negocia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124114931/http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0172/articulo.php?art=560&amp;ed=0172 |date=January 24, 2012 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and himself later downplayed the inflation issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://criticadigital.com/index.php?secc=nota&amp;nid=9104&amp;pagina=11 ''Crítica de la Argentina'': Coto minimizó alcances de la inflación] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301032140/http://criticadigital.com/index.php?secc=nota&amp;nid=9104&amp;pagina=11 |date=2012-03-01 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''(Alby) Anand Kurian''' is a marketing communications theorist and writer; he has been featured among thirty marketers from around the world. He has conceived and developed the twin marketing management concepts of Reality Plus - Neo People and other allied concepts. His recent concept 'Conflict as a Marketing Tool (CAMT)' was published by Knowledge@wharton and by the Wharton Center for Leadership and Change Management.  

His first book, The Peddler of Soaps, a political novel against religious fundamentalism, was on the best-seller list. 

For his next book, a work of non-fiction, professionals from all over the world such as Narayana Murthy, Javed Akhtar and IIM professors are interpreting his management concepts, in their own areas of specialisation.

== Education ==

He was educated at [[Bombay Scottish School]], [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St. Xavier’s College]], [[Elphinstone College]] and [[Government Law College, Mumbai]].(These institutions were criticized for being elitist.). He was first in his division at the [[University of Cambridge]] Indian School Certificate examination, graduated with honours, and was awarded scholarships throughout an unorthodox academic career.&lt;ref name ="author profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookandborrow.com/AuthorDetails.asp?autID=1171|title= Author Profile |accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IIM Conf3" /&gt;

He qualified as a lawyer; he topped [[Moot Court]]s in [[Mumbai University]], in [[Maharashtra State]] and in [[India]].&lt;ref name ="profile1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicar.net/Mandatory_Disclosure.pdf

His [[thesis]] for his [[PhD]] in [[Management]] was recommended by two former deans of [[Indian Institutes of Management|IIM]] [[Ahmedabad]], and featured original contributions from the co-authors of [[Philip Kotler]]’s classic on marketing.

== Advertising career ==

He trained in advertising in New York and founded Emphasis. The company has conceived and executed advertising work for multinational majors such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Nestlé]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], [[PepsiCo]] and [[Unilever]], and for products such as [[Lay's]], [[Ariel (laundry)|Ariel]], [[Lifebuoy]] and [[Coca-Cola]], making him an early fortune.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Openlib" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgMPfUxE5lQ |title= Emphasis Portfolio'' |accessdate=9 September 2012 |year=2012|publisher=Youtube }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The struggle against religious fundamentalism ==

The rise of [[religious fundamentalism]] occurred at this time; Anand Kurian wrote ''The Peddler of Soaps'', a political novel set against this period. The book predicted the [[2002 Gujarat violence|Gujarat riots]]; it was published just before it erupted.&lt;ref name="Hindu"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/12/12/stories/2002121200380300.htm |title= Interview in ''The Hindu'' |accessdate=22 October 2008 |year=2002|work=The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afaqs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=37160 |title=CHATTERATI |accessdate=22 October 2008 |date=4 December 2002 |publisher=Indian Express Newspapers }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afaqs.com/perl/news/?sid=5300 |title=Part fable, part critique |publisher=Afaqs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725053037/http://www.afaqs.com/perl/news/?sid=5300 |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book found support among intellectuals, celebrities, newspaper editors and national award winning actors; among them were [[Vir Sanghvi]], [[Shabana Azmi]], [[Shobhaa De]] and [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]].&lt;ref name="Openlib2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL3713285M/peddler-of-soaps |title=  Peddler of Soaps|publisher=Open Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=38113 |title= Star endorsements |work=The Indian Express  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Book Launch Peddler of Soaps New Delhi.jpg|thumb|right|Launch of The Peddler of Soaps, New Delhi; with Javed Akhtar and Arnab Goswami]]

Currently based in Singapore, he is working on his next book, a work of non-fiction. Professionals from diverse fields, all over the world – such as [[N. R. Narayana Murthy|Narayana Murthy]], [[R. Balki]], [[Sagarika Ghose]], [[Ashis Nandy]], Abraham Koshy (of [[IIM, Ahmedabad]]), [[Javed Akhtar]] and [[R Gopalakrishnan]]  – are interpreting his concepts, in their areas of specialisation, for the book.&lt;ref name="Openlib2" /&gt;

He is part of an international brand consultancy; he has been cited for multi-media innovations, and has served on juries for professional awards.&lt;ref name="juries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eventfaqs.com/index.php?rlink=topstory/top_stories_inner.php&amp;csrid=2434 |title=Award jury |publisher=Eventfaqs }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been profiled in ‘Marketing people’ (Barnes &amp; Noble), a book about thirty marketers from around the world.&lt;ref name="IIM Conf3"/&gt; 

But his feature film has been long delayed; critics have described him as unorthodox and unconventional.&lt;ref name="Openlib2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MICA2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/article/3/2010032620100326025115791323b0e14/Learning-filmi-funda.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130116115329/http://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/article/3/2010032620100326025115791323b0e14/Learning-filmi-funda.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 January 2013 |title=Filmi Fundas |work=The Times of India, Ahmedabad |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a former Dean of [[IIM, Ahmedabad]] Dr Parikh says, "He draws from [[cultural anthropology]] as well as from [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]]. He straddles both [[left brain|left]] and [[right brain]] territory to create a new, more dynamic picture."

Says another erstwhile Dean of IIM, Ahmedabad,Dr Shingi, "He is a [[polymath|Renaissance man]]; he helps us see, beyond narrow specializations, the complete picture."&lt;ref name="Openlib" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4556">The '''Arthur W. Page Center for Integrity in Public Communication''' is a research center at the [[Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications]] at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. The center is dedicated to the study and advancement of ethics and responsibility in [[corporate communication]] and other forms of public communication.&lt;ref&gt;http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The center is named for [[Arthur W. Page]], widely regarded as the founder of modern corporate [[public relations]], whose views have been distilled into the Page Principles: (1) tell the truth; (2) prove it with action; (3) listen to stakeholders; (4) manage for tomorrow; (5) conduct public relations as if the whole enterprise depends on it; (6) realize that an enterprise's true character is expressed by its people; and (7) remain calm, patient and good-humored.&lt;ref&gt;http://bellisario.psu.edu/page-center/about/arthur-w-page/the-page-principles&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bringing the center to Penn State was the idea of alumnus Lawrence G. Foster, who retired as corporate vice-president of public relations at [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]. The launch was made possible by a $300,000 gift he and his wife Ellen made to the college. Foster worked on the project with Edward M. Block, retired vice-president of public relations at [[AT&amp;T]], and John A. Koten, retired senior vice president of corporate communications at [[Ameritech]]. All three played leading roles in the formation of [http://www.awpagesociety.com The Arthur W. Page Society], which functions as a separate entity.

==The Arthur W. Page Center Awards==
The Page Center annually honors individuals who, over the course of their careers, have demonstrated consistent and fervent commitment to the concept of “truth well told." Three icons of the profession are recognized each February at an awards dinner held in New York City. Hundreds of professionals attend as the honorees are given a Larry Foster Award for Integrity in Public Communication, named after the center's founder.

==Research and projects==

The Page Center seeks to foster a modern understanding and application of the Page principles and Robert Wood Johnson’s business philosophy by supporting innovative research, educational or public service projects in a variety of academic disciplines and professional fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D276 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720032301/http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=276 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center supports three ongoing programs, as set out below.

===Page/Johnson legacy scholars===
As of April 2018, the center has awarded more than $900,000 to scholars and professionals throughout the world to support research that makes important contributions to knowledge, practice or public understanding of ethics and responsibility in public communication or other principles of Arthur W. Page. Topics of research have included digital media, corporate social responsibility, sustainability, advocacy and fake news. &lt;ref&gt;http://bellisario.psu.edu/page-center/grants/legacy-scholar-grants&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oral history collection===
Printable transcripts, streaming video, and searchable indexed content provide history, analysis and individual comment on public relations and the media from the luminaries in the field.  To date, the Center has conducted 31 interviews and has transcribed and indexed many acquired videos from the Arthur W. Page Society and other contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D276 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720032301/http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=276 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Federgruen is known for his work in the development and implementation of planning models for supply chain management and logistical systems. His work on scenario planning is widely cited, the field has gained prominence as computers now allow the processing of large masses of complex data.&lt;ref&gt;Theory and Practice of Leadership, , by Roger Gill , 2006, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Management Consulting: Delivering An Effective Project, by Philip A. Wickham 2004, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

His work on supply chain models has wide applications in, for example, flu vaccine and  the risks of relying too heavily on a single vaccine supplier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/ideasatwork/magazinefeature?top.showsendarticle=yes&amp;main.view=articles.detail&amp;main.id=59882]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also an expert on  applied probability models and dynamic programming. In the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Federgruen was quoted on the subject of applying predictive models to minimize risk in disaster situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/hermes/fall2005/article_bestlaidplans.cfm Columbia Business School: Hermes Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728212656/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/hermes/fall2005/article_bestlaidplans.cfm |date=2007-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OpenTTD-1.1.0-en.jpg|thumb|275px|left|''[[OpenTTD]]'' (2014) is a business simulation game]]


There are many games in this genre which have been designed around numerous different enterprises and different simulations. ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'' can be called a business simulation because the goal of the game is to attract customers and make profits, but the game also involves a building aspect that makes it a [[construction and management simulation]].&lt;ref name="Rollings"/&gt; This genre also includes many of the "tycoon" games such as ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]'' and ''[[Transport Tycoon]]''. Another similar example of a business simulation (that models a startup business) is "SimVenture Classic".

[[Trevor Chan]] is a notable developer of business simulation games,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/articles/425/425910p1.html IGN: Joan of Arc Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; having developed the 1995 game ''[[Capitalism (video game)|Capitalism]]'' which has been described as the "best business simulation game".&lt;ref name="capitalism2review"/&gt; Similar in complexity and functionality is [[Virtonomics]] business simulation. This is a browser-based multiplayer game in which realistic market behavior is formed as a result of the interaction of a large number of players.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inc.com/margarita-hakobyan/2-types-of-brain-games-that-can-substantially-improve-your-decision-making.html INC: 2 Types of Brain Games That Can Substantially Improve Your Decision-Making&lt;/ref&gt;

Active development of Internet technologies and the growth of the Internet audience in recent years gave a powerful impetus to the development of the industry of online games, and in particular, online business simulations.&lt;ref name="bizsims" /&gt; There are many varieties of online business simulations - browser-based and downloadable, single-player and multiplayer, real-time and turn-based. Some online simulations are aimed primarily at the leisure market while others have real world applications in training, education and modelling.

== Real-world applications ==
Because [[business simulation]]s simulate real-world systems, they are often used in management, marketing, [[Simulations and games in economics education|economics]] and hospitality education.&lt;ref name="bizsims"&gt;[http://www.bizsims.edu.au/ Online Business Simulations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ssl&gt;{{cite book | last = Farkas | first = Meredith | title = Social Software in Libraries: Building Collaboration, Communication, and Community Online | publisher = [[Information Today, Inc.]] | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2008-06-18 | isbn =1-57387-275-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlARogbZHqcC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22economic+simulation%22+game | page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some benefits of business simulations are that they permit students to experience and test themselves in situations before encountering them in real life,&lt;ref name=dyn_ss/&gt; they permit students to experiment and test hypotheses,&lt;ref name=dyn_ss/&gt;&lt;ref name=dkskrht&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thole | first = Heinz-Jürgen |author2=Claus Möbus |author3=Olaf Schröder  | title = Domain Knowledge Structure, Knowledge Representation and Hypotheses Testing | journal = Artificial Intelligence in Education: Knowledge and Media in Learning | pages = 410 | publisher = [[IOS Press]] | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9L4reNbo7MQC&amp;pg=PA410&amp;dq=%22economic+simulation%22+game | isbn = 978-90-5199-353-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that subjects seem more real to them than when taught passively from the blackboard.&lt;ref name=dyn_ss&gt;{{cite book | last = Schurr | first = Sandra | title = Dynamite in the Classroom: A How-to Handbook for Teachers | publisher = [[National Middle School Association]] | year = 1994 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HK_uqW_oS7EC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=economic+simulation+game| isbn = 1-56090-041-5 | page = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used extensively in the professional world to train workers in the financial industries,&lt;ref name=udg&gt;{{cite book | last = Rutter | first = Jason |author2=Jo Bryce | title = Understanding Digital Games | publisher = [[Sage Publications, Inc.]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4129-0033-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ji3baoCZL8gC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=%22economic+simulation%22+game|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iscsml_sjf/&gt; hospitality and management,&lt;ref name=iscsml_sjf&gt;{{cite book | last = Fallows | first = Stephen J. |author2=Kemal Ahmet | title = Inspiring Students: Case Studies in Motivating the Learner | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nk49AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=%22business+simulation%22+game | isbn = 0-7494-2872-4 | page = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to study economic models&lt;ref name=ims_ddg/&gt; (an association of professionals, [http://www.absel.org ABSEL], exists for the sole purpose of promoting their use&lt;ref name=udg/&gt;), with some simulations having in excess of 10,000 variables.&lt;ref name=ims_ddg&gt;{{cite book | last = Gatti | first = Domenico Delli | title = Interaction and Market Structure: Essays on Heterogeneity in Economics | publisher = Springer | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5D4V5DwKeKgC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22economic+simulation%22+game | isbn = 3-540-66979-5 | page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic simulations have even been used in experiments, such as those done by Donald Broadbent on learning and cognition that revealed how people often have an aptitude for mastering systems without necessarily comprehending the underlying principles.&lt;ref name=eu_rh&gt;{{cite book | last = Hogarth | first = Robin M. | title = Educating Intuition | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fsffJGkpwVIC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=%22economic+simulation%22+game | isbn = 0-226-34860-1 | page = 184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other games are used to study the behavior of consumers.&lt;ref name=vetl_lcj&gt;{{cite book | last = Jain | first = L.

'''Cavit Çağlar''' (born on 1944, [[Komotini]], [[Greece]]) is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[businessman]] and politician. He was elected to the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] (TBMM) for the [[True Path Party (Turkey)|True Path Party]] (DYP) in 1991, serving as a Minister of State responsible for state-owned banks ([[51st government of Turkey|51]]st and [[52nd government of Turkey]]). He resigned from the DYP in 1996, remaining in parliament as an independent until 1999. He had been a major financial contributor to the political comeback of President [[Suleyman Demirel]].&lt;ref name=TDN1997/&gt; In 2004 he was sentenced to three years ten months for bank fraud.

==Early life==

Çağlar was born in [[Komotini]], [[Greece]] to ethnic Turks, moving to Turkey when he was still at school. He left school at age 15 when his father died to look after his family. He entered the textile business, joining his uncle, a textile merchant in [[Bursa]]. With his uncle's support and state loans, he built up a large industrial and trade group, Nergis Holding, which in 1996 had turnover of around $1bn and exports of around $200m. Based around textiles, by 1996 it also included major real estate investments (including in tourist facilities around the [[Sea of Marmara]]), and publishing and broadcasting ventures, including news channel [[NTV (Turkey)|NTV]].&lt;ref name=TDN1997&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 8 January 1997, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-first-24-hour-tv-news-channel-begins-broadcasts.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=turkeys-first-24-hour-tv-news-channel-begins-broadcasts-1997-01-08 Turkey's first 24-hour TV news channel begins broadcasts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

In 1996 Nergis acquired [[Çukurova Holding]]'s majority stake in [[İnterbank]].&lt;ref name=TBB&gt;TBB, [http://en.tbb.org.tr/Dosyalar/userfiles/file/%C4%B0statistik-%C4%B0ngilizce%20site/Historical%20data/Historical%20Data%20about%20Closed%20Banks.xls Historical Data about Closed Banks - tbb.org.tr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205130050/http://en.tbb.org.tr/Dosyalar/userfiles/file/%C4%B0statistik-%C4%B0ngilizce%20site/Historical%20data/Historical%20Data%20about%20Closed%20Banks.xls |date=2014-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997 [[Etibank]] was privatised to Medya-Ipek Holding, co-owned by Çağlar and [[Dinç Bilgin]], for $155m,&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 3 December 1997, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/this-time-cavit-caglar-buys-etibank.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=this-time-cavit-caglar-buys-etibank-1997-12-03 This time, Cavit Caglar buys Etibank]&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 1998 Çağlar was celebrating a $1bn investment in textile production with Demirel opening the new factories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/caglar-prepares-to-activate-an-investment-of-1-billion.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=caglar-prepares-to-activate-an-investment-of-1-billion-1998-09-29 Caglar prepares to activate an investment of $1 billion]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1998 police uncovered a plot to assassinate Çağlar by a group working for [[Alaattin Çakıcı]], related to the bank privatization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/police-uncover-plan-to-assassinate-businessman.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=police-uncover-plan-to-assassinate-businessman-1998-02-16 Police uncover plan to assassinate businessman]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 1999 [[İnterbank]], then majority-owned by Nergis Holding, was transferred to the [[TMSF]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 9 January 1999, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/interbank-taken-over-by-central-bank.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=interbank-taken-over-by-central-bank-1999-01-09 Interbank taken over by Central Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; It was later merged with [[Etibank]], before being liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 17 January 1999, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=the-week-in-perspective-1999-01-17 The Week in Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 19 June 2004, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tmsf-reaches-agreement-with-former-owners-of-two-failed-banks.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=tmsf-reaches-agreement-with-former-owners-of-two-failed-banks-2004-06-19 TMSF reaches agreement with former owners of two failed banks]&lt;/ref&gt; Later in January, NTV was sold to the [[Dogus Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 13 January 1999, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/dogus-group-buys-ntv.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=dogus-group-buys-ntv-1999-01-13 Dogus Group buys NTV]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1999 prosecutors alleged that in 1998 Interbank had transferred over $650m to Nergis Holding companies - far in excess of legal limits for intra-group transfers.&lt;ref name=TDNentangles/&gt; The total amount owed by Nergis to Interbank was said to be over $1.1bn.&lt;ref name=TDNentangles&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/interbank-fraud-case-entangles-former-politicians.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=interbank-fraud-case-entangles-former-politicians-1999-06-27 Interbank Fraud Case Entangles Former Politicians]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2001 Turkey issued a warrant for his arrest, accusing Çağlar of using a $7.4m business bank loan for personal use. He was arrested in New York in April, and agreed to return to Turkey to face trial after a New York court denied a $5m bail application.&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 30 April 2001, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/dgm-imprisons-former-minister-pending-trial.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=dgm-imprisons-former-minister-pending-trial-2001-04-30 DGM imprisons former minister pending trial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 22 April 2001, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/caglar-agrees-to-waive-extradition.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=caglar-agrees-to-waive-extradition-2001-04-22 Caglar agrees to waive extradition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 20 April 2001, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/us-court-rejects-caglars-offer-to-post-5-mln-bail.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=us-court-rejects-caglars-offer-to-post-5-mln-bail-2001-04-20 US court rejects Caglar's offer to post $5 mln bail]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Çağlar agreed to pay TMSF $1.6bn for debts relating to Interbank. When he failed to keep up payments, some of his other companies were seized, including his 50% stake in BİS Enerji, an electricity generating company in Bursa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 19 October 2009, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/caglars-plant-appetizes-energy-giants.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=caglar8217s-plant-appetizes-energy-giants-2009-10-19 Çağlar's plant appetizes energy giants]&lt;/ref&gt; Hotels, helicopters and media assets were also seized, and the Nergis Holding textile companies suffered financial difficulties, with 785 workers put on unpaid leave for over three months in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 28 March 2008, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/nergis-workers-face-further-unpaid-leave.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=nergis-workers-face-further-unpaid-leave-2008-03-28 Nergis workers face further unpaid leave]&lt;/ref&gt; Yeşim Tekstil was foreclosed by [[Halkbank]] in 2008 after debts reached $45m.&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 4 January 2008,[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/yesim-tekstil-up-for-sale.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=yesim-tekstil-up-for-sale-2008-01-04 Yeşim Tekstil up for sale]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008 Çağlar agreed to sell the remaining textile companies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Turkish Daily News]], 8 October 2008, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/cavit-caglars-companies-up-for-sale.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=cavit-caglars-companies-up-for-sale-2008-10-08 Cavit Çağlar's companies up for sale]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chartered Management Institute''' ('''CMI''') is an [[accredited]] professional institution for [[management]] based in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Organisation/Details/RN5128|title=The Register of Regulated Qualifications - View Organisation : CMI (Chartered Management Institute)|work=ofqual.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major membership classes are ''Member'', ''Fellow'' - for those with significant expertise - and ''Companion'' - the most senior grade.

In addition to supporting its members, the organisation encourages management development, carries out research, produces a wide variety of publications on management interests, and publishes the official members' magazine, ''[[Professional Manager]]''.  The Institute also engages with [[government]] and other [[public bodies]] concerning policy on management and business related issues. ''Professional Manager'' magazine is circulated to over 80,000 members of the CMI.

== Chartered Fellow (CMgr FCMI) ==

The Chartered Manager process requires candidates to demonstrate how they have developed as a manager and how they have applied their leadership and change management skills to achieve significant business impact.

There are three routes to becoming Chartered:

'''Exemption Route''' - Available to those who have completed a CMI Level 5 Diploma or above.

'''Qualified Route''' - Available to those who hold a degree level management qualification.

'''Experiential Route''' - Available to those who have the relevant experience, but who do not currently hold a management qualification.

Criteria and requirements for chartered status in the UK have to be approved by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and as such the Chartered Manager designation is on par with other chartered qualifications in other fields.

Timeline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managers.org.uk/|title=Management - Leadership - CMI - CMI|work=managers.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1945 - Sir Stafford Cripps, the President of the Board of Trade appointed a Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Clive Baillieu (President of the Federation of British Industries - the forerunner of the CBS) to formulate detailed proposals for the establishment of a central institution for all aspects related to management.

One of the reasons behind this move was the realisation that, although there were professional bodies representing functional activities, there was no comparable body for general management thinking and for the development and promotion of better management.

*1947 - Following the recommendations of the [[Baillieu Report]], the British Institute of Management (BIM) was formed.
*1951 - The UK's first Diploma in Management Studies was introduced by the BIM and the Ministry of Education.
*1987 - The BIM, in conjunction with other bodies, issued two pivotal reports, The making of British managers (John Constable and Roger McCormick), and The making of managers (Charles Handy).  These reports led to the formation of the National Forum for Management Education and Development (NFMED) and, subsequently, the Management Charter Initiative (MCI), which spearheaded the issue of the world's first competency-based national management standards.
*1992 - BIM merged with the Institution of Industrial Managers (IIM) to form the Institute of Management (IM).  The awarding body status of the IIM was transferred to the new Institute.

*2008 - National Convention held in Birmingham at the Hilton Metropole

*2011 - Ruth Spellman suddenly leaves CMI in August with Christopher Kinsella being appointed as interim CE
*2011 - A survey of members, conducted by Huw Hilditch-Roberts, concluded that branches should be scrapped in order to improve engagement with the membership.
*2012 - Ann Francke is appointed in June as Chief Executive.
*2013 - New Regional Chairmen appointed and Regional Boards elected to take over from branches in October.
*2014 - Mike Clasper is appointed as President&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directorstalk.com/interview-mike-clasper-new-president-chartered-management-institute/|title=Interview: Mike Clasper the new President of Chartered Management Institute|author=AIM News|work=directorstalk.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113074951/http://www.directorstalk.com/interview-mike-clasper-new-president-chartered-management-institute/|archivedate=2014-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clive Ng''' is a media sector financier and executive. He has focused primarily on Asian business opportunities and has been instrumental in several [[joint-venture]] partnerships between American companies and Asian firms, particularly during the Internet and [[e-commerce]] boom of the late 90s and early 2000s. He has also been a founding shareholder in Asian [[new media]] firms such as [[MTV Japan]] and [[E*TRADE]] Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.forbes.com/profile/clive/18369 Professional Profile], [[Forbes]]

He was also CEO at China Cablecom, a company that wiped out all shareholder's value under him, causing huge losses to small shareholders that were left unaware of what was happening. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ng's work in Asian media began in the mid-1990s, as a proliferation of [[satellite]] space and a spate of programming [[piracy]] during this time inspired huge efforts by many mass media firms, most notably [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corp.]], to develop presences in Asian media markets.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Kevin Murphy, [http://www.iht.com/articles/1994/03/30/wilton.php "Wilton Carpets Asian Screens"], [[International Herald Tribune]], 30 March 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilton Group, PLC===
Working as deputy chairman of Wilton Group, PLC, a former consumer goods distribution firm based in London, UK, that transitioned to media and entertainment investment and finance, Ng spearheaded the company's entry into Asian media markets.

In a 1994 [[joint-venture]] partnership with Hong Kong–based Shaw Brothers Ltd (formerly Shaw Media Corp. and owners of [[Shaw Brothers Studio]], Hong Kong's largest film production company), Ng's Wilton team financed the establishment of a Chinese-language satellite television channel for Chinese-speaking communities in Europe called Chinese Channel. It was the first European network of its kind, broadcasting programs primarily produced by [[Hong Kong Television Broadcasting]] Ltd, the world's largest Chinese-language entertainment producer at the time.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

Later in 1994, Ng acquired for Wilton a 20% stake in the Asian interests of [[Denver]]-based cable television operator United International Holdings (now [[Liberty Global]]), with which Ng had worked previously while managing a [[Denver]] investment fund. He then set up a joint venture between UIH and [[United Artists Theatres]], then the United States' largest cinema operator, to open a series of cineplexes in key cities in Asia. The first was in the [[Bugis Junction]] shopping mall in Singapore, followed by six other locations.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

===Pacific Media, PLC===
In the late 90s, Wilton Group became Pacific Media, PLC. Ng was appointed CEO in 1999, when the company was experiencing a period of financial turmoil. Soon after his appointment as CEO, Ng negotiated an investment deal with Hong Kong Supernet, an Asian Internet provider, that precipitated a 1.89m HKP surge in pre-tax profits, greatly bolstering the financial health and reputation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/company/articles/PCM/10883/pacific-media.thtml "Pacific Media"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/about-us/ Growth Company Investor], October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon being named CEO, Ng transformed Pacific Media into a "shell" company and used it to invest in new Asian Internet ventures beginning in 2000. He secured financing from American [[investment bank]] [[Credit Suisse First Boston]], and set forth a £70 million plan.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Fergusson, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/pacific-shell-to-become-internet-investor-740549.html "Pacific 'shell' to become internet investor"], [[Independent.co.uk]], 14 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/hardware/0,39042972,13024233,00.htm "Asiacontent.com, NBCi in Joint Venture"], [[CNET]] via [[ZDNet]]Asia, 13 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asiacontent.com===
One major result of these "shell" investments was the acquisition of internet company Asiacontent.com, which went public during the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]] in April 2000 to become one of the first Asian [[initial public offering]]s to be listed on [[NASDAQ]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Crane, [http://www.cfoasia.com/archives/200007-51.htm "Road Warriors"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106053624/http://www.cfoasia.com/archives/200007-51.htm |date=6 January 2009 }}, [http://www.cfoasia.com/aboutcfo.htm CFO Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210071925/http://www.cfoasia.com/aboutcfo.htm |date=10 December 2008 }}, July/August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to going public, in January 2000, Ng, with funding from [[Goldman Sachs]],&lt;ref&gt;Cintra Scott, [http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/stocks/will-the-ice-start-to-crack-under-ipos-7549/ "Will the Ice Start to Crack Under IPOs?"], [[SmartMoney]], 10 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; led Asiacontent into a joint venture with NBC Internet Inc (or NBCi), then the Internet arm of the American television network [[NBC]], to create a series of websites in South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, [[Malaysia]] and [[Taiwan]] that would combine [[search engine]] functionality, news feeds and shopping links into sites similar to those of [[Yahoo!]], the worldwide leader at the time. This came on the heels of similar successful NBCi ventures in Italy and France.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bond, [http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4837500-1.html "NBCi Sets Sights on Pacific Rim"], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' via [http://www.allbusiness.com/2984614-1.html AllBusiness.com], 14 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/hardware/0,39042972,13024233,00.htm "Asiacontent, NBCi in Joint Venture"], [[ZDNet]]Asia, 13 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ng's tenure as chairman of Asiacontent, the company also entered into many other major joint ventures in Asian media markets, and Asiacontent soon became the largest distributor of global content in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/m/story/03588244-dfaf-40ad-ac14-bc1891c7a396/0 "Asiacontent.com releases Q1 results"], [[MarketWatch]], 19 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the partnerships were:

*[[DoubleClick]] Inc., an Internet advertising network which sold online advertising space to marketers. The venture formed a new company, DoubleClick Asia, in an effort to capitalise on a late-90s Asian Internet advertising boom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=220891 "DoubleClick Sets Up JV for Greater China, Singapore"], [http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=about ClickZ], 19 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[MTV]] Asia, the television network's Asian arm, and MTVi Group, its interactive division. The partnership with Ng's Asiacontent created new Chinese and [[Korea]]n web presences for [[MTV]].&lt;ref&gt;Davena Mok, [http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4640214-1.html "MTV Goes Online in Mainland China"], [[Billboard magazine]] via [http://www.allbusiness.com/2984614-1.html AllBusiness.com] 20 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[CBS Sportsline]], which joined with Asiacontent to create a network of sports-related websites throughout Asia, including Singapore and [[Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/info/about/press/2000/korea "Sportsline.com ...and Asiacontent.com Launch...Site in Korea"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628045000/http://www.sportsline.com/info/about/press/2000/korea |date=28 June 2008 }}, [[CBS Sportsline]], 19 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John F. Thorsberg, [http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/-sidelines-sports-business-news/story.aspx?guid=%7B0F924CD3-8845-4223-BA02-4A1F1781D71E%7D "Sports Business News"], [[MarketWatch]], 10 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[CNET]] and Asiacontent produced a series of Asian-language [[CNET]] sites across the region.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Ellis, [http://www.time.com/time/asia/asiabuzz/9910/28/ "No There There"] TIME Asia, 28 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
*Licensing agreements to bring [[E!Online]] and France's [[Fashion TV]] to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Don Groves [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117783777.html?categoryid=1000&amp;cs=1 "Web Wary Consumers"], [http://www.variety.com/ Variety], 17 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of 2000, amid the souring tech economy, Ng and Asiacontent Chief Executive Chris Justice expanded the company with an Internet solutions arm called Asiacontent Solutions, which offered [[web development]] and [[content management]] services for the Asian web presences of companies such as [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Hachette Filipacchi]], and [[L'Oréal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asia.internet.com/news/article.php/655261/Asiacontentcom+Moves+into+Solutions+Business+.htm "Asiacontent.com Moves into Solutions Business"], [http://asia.internet.com/ Asia.Internet.Com], 10 October 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]] and ensuing [[stock market]] turmoil, Pacific Media soon became financially troubled. Media firm MediaXposure then invested $20 million in the flagging company in 2003 to keep it operational through the first quarter of 2004. In late 2006, after Pacific Media had regained its financial stability, Ng resigned from Pacific Media's board of directors to pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bankrupt.com/TCREUR_Public/040220.mbx "PACIFIC MEDIA: MediaXposure to Inject up to US$20 million"], [http://www.bankrupt.com/about_ibl.html IBL], 20 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===8 Holdings===
After leaving Pacific Media, Ng formed his own investment [[holding company]], 8 Holdings, which specialised in [[mergers and acquisitions]] of Asian media companies. In 8 Holdings' largest deal, Ng joined in 2005 with Harlan Kleiman, former head of programming for US cable television network [[HBO]], to co-ordinate investors in the acquisition of Chinese television advertising company China Media Network by Metaphor Corp. Ng was named CEO of Metaphor Corp. as part of the acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hcgroup.hc360.com/english/GoDetail.aspx?id=304 "HC Int'l...Transferring Its TV Advertising Business To A Renowned International Investor"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626124438/http://hcgroup.hc360.com/english/GoDetail.aspx?id=304 |date=26 June 2007 }}, [http://hcgroup.hc360.com/english/hcjj.htm HC360.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205060330/http://hcgroup.hc360.com/english/hcjj.htm |date=5 December 2008 }}, 30 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment in feature films===
Ng has also invested in major motion pictures directed by [[Oliver Stone]], including 1993's ''[[Heaven &amp; Earth (1993 film)|Heaven &amp; Earth]]'', the final in Stone's trilogy of films focused on [[the Vietnam War]]; and 1994's ''[[Natural Born Killers]]''.

===Fashion Networks International LLC ===
In 2009, Ng became chairman and principal shareholder of Fashion Networks International LLC, a digital media channel consisting of a network of fashion related websites and blogs.  Fashion Networks' properties include NowManifest, Freshnet.  NowManifest, a curated blog portal, boasts bloggers [[Anna Dello Russo]], editor at large and creative consultant for [[Vogue Japan]], Bryan Grey Yambao, and [[Derek Blasberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.fashionnetworks.se/2010/07/01/our-sites/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525184146/http://blog.fashionnetworks.se/2010/07/01/our-sites/ |archivedate=25 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fashion Networks International was acquired by Fairchild Fashion Media in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwd.com/media-news/digital/ffm-acquires-blogger-network-5908816/print-preview/&lt;/ref&gt;

===China Broadband, Inc. and YOU On Demand (CBBD.OB)===
Ng was a founding partner and served as [[Executive chairman]] of China Broadband, Inc., now known as YOU on Demand Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:YOD), a national [[pay-per-view]] and [[video-on-demand]] platform in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/CBBD.OB/key-developments/article/2032300 "China Broadband, Inc.

Ng resigned from his post in 2010 to pursue other endeavours.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

===China Cablecom===
Clive Ng is Founder and [[Executive chairman]] of China Cablecom Holdings, a [[joint-venture]] provider of cable television services in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Company was founded in October 2006 and was approved for listing onto the [[NASDAQ]] Capital Markets on 30 July 2008.

In September 2007, China Cablecom gained operating rights of the [[Binzhou]] Broadcasting network in Binzhou, Shandong Province. China Cablecom entered into a series of asset purchase and services agreements with a company organised by State Owned Enterprises ("SOE"), owned directly or indirectly by local branches of China's [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] ("SARFT"), in five different municipalities to serve as a holding company of the relevant businesses.

Pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of [[merger]], Jaguar, a special purpose acquisition company merged with and into China Cablecom Holdings, Ltd., its wholly owned [[British Virgin Islands]] subsidiary, for the purpose of re-domesticating Jaguar to the British Virgin Islands on 9 April 2008. This merger was the first of its kind for a US public company.

In May 2008, China Cablecom issued convertible notes with a principal value of $43,175,000 along with 1,524,994 shares of ordinary shares to a number of investors. China Cablecom also announced its achievement of  "Foreign Private Issuer" status, for purposes of the rules and regulations of the [[US Securities and Exchange Commission]]. In addition, the company declared its entrance into a framework agreement with Hubei Chutian Broadcasting and Television Networks Co., Ltd., a local state-owned enterprise owned by the Hubei branches of SARFT. This act established a cable TV operation joint venture.

On 18 June 2008, China Cablecom announced the completion of the first phase, of its framework agreement with [[Hubei]] Chutian Broadcasting and Television Networks Co., Ltd., to acquire a 60 percent economic interest in Hubei Chutian Video &amp; Information Network. This consummation secured over 800,000 additional paying subscribers for China Cablecom. Phase two would represent an additional 800,000 paying subscribers and is pending further due diligence and execution of definitive agreements.

On 9 October 2009, the Company underwent comprehensive [[restructuring]] of its outstanding debt obligations with holders of its Hubei assets and of its debt securities and majority holders of its ordinary shares. The restructuring strengthened the Company's balance sheet by reducing the overall principal amount of its long-term debt obligations and eliminated cash interest obligations on the new debt securities issued in exchange for its outstanding notes. Simultaneous to the restructuring, China Cablecom announced placement of $33 million in senior secured notes used to satisfy the Company's remaining obligations to the Hubei SOE under its amended framework agreement.

On 3 April 2012, the Company reported that, as per its previous announcement, the Company's joint venture partner Hubei Chutian Radio &amp; Television Information Network Company Limited ("Hubei SOE") has agreed to purchase its Hubei assets for a total of RMB 374 million. The Company is pleased to announce today that it has received the first payment of RMB 50 million.
In accordance to the terms of the agreement, the Company has signed a JV Termination agreement with Hubei Chutian Shi Xun Network Company Limited ("Hubei JV"). 
 
The company has announced that it will use proceeds of the sale to reduce the Company's outstanding debt and any excess proceeds will be used to increase shareholder value going forward.
On 20 October 2011, the Company announced that it had received an offer from its joint venture partners to purchase its assets in Hubei. The acceptance by China Cablecom for the offer was mandated by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) and made in compliance with provincial regulatory policies.

On 15 November 2012, China Cablecom Holdings, Ltd. ("China Cablecom" or the "Company") ( OTCBB : CABLF ) announced that it has completed the redemption on the Company's principal note obligations. The notes paid in full include $19.1 million in senior secured, $16.2 million in junior secured, and $4.2 million in unsecured notes.
The Board was pleased with the conclusion of the redemption and feel that their job as board members has been fulfilled upon the repayment of its notes. As a result, the Company announced the resignation of three of its Board members effective immediately. Mr. Robi Hartman, Mr. David Kratochvil, and Mr. Jacob Weiss have agreed to step down following the liquidation of China Cablecom's Hubei assets.
"The Company appreciates the contributions made by Mr. Hartman, Mr. Kratochvil, and Mr. Weiss," says Pu Yue, chief executive officer of China Cablecom. "They have individually served the Board with invaluable and insightful guidance and we wish them the best in their future success."

Instead, their parents should be charged the "cost of rectifying their bad behaviour".&lt;ref name="3news.co.nz"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/No-free-lunches-for-hungry-kids-says-Colin-Craig/tabid/1607/articleID/273895/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= 'No free lunches' for hungry kids, says Colin Craig | date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig has been known to take offence at satirical articles directed at him, including a piece on the satirical website ''[[The Civilian]]'', which he said published a story designed "to make him look ridiculous". He threatened to sue the site unless they published a retraction and paid him $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Colin-Craig-threatens-satirical-website/tabid/1607/articleID/295333/Default.aspx | work=3 News NZ | title= Colin Craig threatens satirical website| date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig withdrew the threat the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Colin-Craig-abandons-defamation-suit/tabid/1607/articleID/295366/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Colin Craig abandons defamation suit| date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===March for Democracy===
Craig first emerged as a conservative activist in 2009&lt;ref name="NZH-07-31-11"/&gt; when he organised and funded a "march for democracy" to protest government decisions not to adhere to three [[Referendums in New Zealand|citizen's initiated referenda]]:&lt;ref name=nzhmarch&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/democracy/news/article.cfm?c_id=171&amp;objectid=10605777

He spent $450,000 organising the march,&lt;ref name=nzhmarch/&gt; and it attracted 5,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10610750

After pre-election polling in this electorate, Craig claimed to have 47% support while the [[National Party of New Zealand|National Party]] candidate Mark Mitchell had 36.3%.&lt;ref name=confident&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10752948 |title=Conservative leader confident he can take Rodney from Nats |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=20 September 2011 |first1=Matthew |last1=Backhouse |first2=Adam |last2=Bennett |date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Colin-Craig-to-stand-in-Rodney/tabid/506/articleID/23214/Default.aspx |title=Colin Craig to stand in Rodney |publisher=Radio Live |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister and National Party leader John Key said that the Conservative Party faced a "massive hurdle" to get a seat in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=New Zealand Press Association |date=8 August 2011 |title=Key won't rule out working with new party}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to preliminary election results, Mitchell won the seat with 52.6% of the vote, and Colin Craig came second with 21.4% of the vote. The Conservative Party also gained 2.76% of the vote nationwide, the fifth-largest share of any party and more than four of the parties that actually won seats, but this was insufficient for any Conservatives to enter Parliament because of the 5% of the party vote or one electorate seat required by the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional voting system]] operating in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.nz|title=Electoral Commission|website=Electoral Commission|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2015}}

Since the Conservative party's conception, Craig has donated $4 million.

In February 2014, the-then [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] co-leader [[Russel Norman]] alleged that Colin Craig held misogynistic and homophobic attitudes during a speech at the Big Gay Out event in Auckland. Norman's comments prompted Craig to file a defamation suit and to demand that Norman issue an apology.

===2015 leadership dispute===
In June 2015, Colin Craig drew criticism from elements of the Conservative Party when he participated in a [[sauna]] interview hosted by [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] reporter [[David Farrier]], which they felt badly reflected on Craig's public image. The interview was part of the television channel's new Sauna Session current affairs series.&lt;ref name="NZHerald 19 June 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farrier|first1=David|title=The Sauna Session That May Bring Down Colin Craig|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/tvshows/newsworthy/sauna-session-with-colin-craig-2015060823#axzz3dYJsninl|accessdate=19 June 2015|agency=[[3 News]]|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following sexual harassment allegations that were published on the right-wing blogger [[Cameron Slater]]'s blog Whale Oil, Craig resigned as party leader on 19 June 2015 and also agreed to "facilitate a review" of the leadership. Craig was also criticised by elements of the Conservative Party for postponing a leadership vote at a scheduled board meeting that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Conservative faction to block Colin Craig's return as leader|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/69559312/conservative-faction-to-block-colin-craigs-return-as-leader|accessdate=19 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slater|first1=Cameron|title=Exclusive: The poem Colin Craig doesn't want you to see|url=http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2015/06/exclusive-the-poem-colin-craig-doesnt-want-you-to-see/|website=Whale oil|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2015, Colin Craig announced that he was not ruling out a return to the Conservative Party's leadership if he found sufficient support from the Party's members. He also threatened to sue several media outlets over allegations that he had paid off his former secretary MacGregor over a complaint of sexual harassment to the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|New Zealand Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watkins|first1=Tracey|title=Colin Craig off to lawyers, would consider a Conservative Party comeback|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/69567213/colin-craig-off-to-lawyers-would-consider-a-conservative-party-comeback|accessdate=21 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June, the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' reported that Craig had settled a "financial dispute" with MacGregor for around NZ$16,000 to $17,000 approximately eight weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bilbey|first1=Lynley|title=Colin Craig entangled in money dispute|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11468628|accessdate=21 June 2015|newspaper=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television channel [[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] also reported that there was a serious falling-out between Craig and several Conservative board members. One board member, John Stringer, has accused Craig of lying to the board and other inappropriate behaviour. In response, Craig has denied these allegations and threatened to take action against Stringer for speaking to the media.&lt;ref name="One News 21 June 2015" /&gt;

During the press conference held on 22 June 2015, Craig admitted that he had acted inappropriately towards his press secretary Rachel MacGregor but denied any charges of sexual harassment. In response, MacGregor accused the former Conservative leader for breaching a confidentiality agreement the pair had reached under Human Rights Commission mediation and disputed his version of the events. Craig's wife Helen Craig also announced that she was standing by her husband and characterised the charges against him as "false allegations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig admits 'inappropriate' conduct|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/69601091/colin-craig-admits-inappropriate-conduct|accessdate=22 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Factual inaccuracies' - former press secretary speaks out after Colin Craig denies allegations|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/factual-inaccuracies-former-press-secretary-speaks-after-colin-craig-denies-allegations-6343893|accessdate=22 June 2015|agency=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davison|first1=Isaac|title=Colin Craig is trying to frame me as a mistress|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11469290|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Craig and MacGregor have also denied that they were involved in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Had you fallen in love with Rachel MacGregor?' - Colin Craig pushed over ex-press secretary|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/had-you-fallen-in-love-rachel-macgregor-colin-craig-pushed-over-ex-press-secretary-6344120|accessdate=23 June 2015|agency=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Colin Craig's ex-aide denies sexual relationship|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/69601091/colin-craigs-exaide-denies-sexual-relationship|accessdate=23 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Craig and MacGregor have also indicated that they would support the lifting of the confidentiality agreement in order to allay uncertainty and speculation.&lt;ref name="Stuff 23 June 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Colin Craig expects 'face-palm moments' ahead|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/69626551/colin-craig-expect-facepalm-moments-ahead|accessdate=23 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Herald'', several board members of the Conservative Party including John Stringer, [[Christine Rankin]], and Laurence Day have indicated support for a change of leadership. A board meeting has been scheduled for 27 June 2015 and Day has also called for Craig to be expelled from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davison|first1=Isaac|title=Calls for Colin Craig's party membership to be cancelled|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11469194|accessdate=22 June 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the resignation of six Conservative Party board members, Craig indicated that a new board and a new leader would later be elected by the Party over the weekend. Craig has not ruled out contesting the leadership poll. It is currently unclear whether the dissolution of the board would favor Craig or any other contender for the Conservative Party's leadership.&lt;ref name="Stuff 23 June 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davison|first=Isaac|title=More board members quit Conservative Party|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11469835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 2015, Colin Craig was formally suspended from the Conservative Party by the party's newly appointed board which consisted of John Stringer and four newly appointed members. Four of the five board members with the exception of Stringer voted to suspend the former Conservative leader's membership. The conference took place in a hotel room at the Heartland Hotel near [[Auckland International Airport]].&lt;ref name="NZH 27 June 2015" /&gt;
According to One News, Craig has since challenged the legality of Stringer and the board's actions; claiming that Stringer had been suspended from the Party. He has also not ruled out contesting the Conservative Party's leadership. Craig's remarks have been dismissed by Stringer, who has become the Party's interim leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig has Conservative Party membership suspended|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/colin-craig-has-conservative-party-membership-suspended-6347983|accessdate=27 June 2015|publisher=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]|date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2015, John Stringer resigned his positions as chairman and board member to preserve the neutrality of the second Board so he and Craig could resolve their differences in court separately. According to the ''New Zealand Herald'', a statement by former chairman Brian Dobbs that Stringer had been suspended meant that the decision by the interim board to suspend Colin Craig's membership was invalid.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 5 July 2015" /&gt; It transpired that the "suspension" of Stringer was nothing more than a phone call by Dobbs to Nathaniel Heslop (who had already resigned) and Stringer was never notified of any hearing or meeting being the only other Board member still active. Dobbs then resigned hours later with Stringer not being notified he was 'suspended" until a week later which was ignored. Documents later emerged that Craig had threatened Dobbs with personal liabilities of the party debts and letters flowed from Craig's lawyers to Dobbs. On 7 July, Craig also sent a personal letter to Conservative Party members to apologize for his behaviour and to gauge whether he had sufficient support to return to the Party's leadership.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz 7 July 2015" /&gt; On 29 July 2015, Colin Craig announced that he was going to sue several opponents including Conservative Party member John Stringer, the right wing blogger [[Cameron Slater]] and [[New Zealand Taxpayers' Union]]'s president Jordan Williams for alleged defamation. In addition, Craig also circulated a booklet, entitled "Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas", which he claimed outlined a "campaign of defamatory lies" against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Corazon|last2=Davison|first2=Isaac|title=Colin Craig sues 'dirty politics brigade'|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11488774|accessdate=11 August 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Craig |first=Colin |date=2015 |title=Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas |url=http://votecolincraig.co.nz/documents/Dirty%20Politics.pdf |location=Auckland |publisher=Colin and Helen Craig |agency= |access-date=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925161400/http://votecolincraig.co.nz/documents/Dirty%20Politics.pdf |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2015, Craig also announced his intention to contest the Auckland mayoral election in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Simon|title=Colin Craig could run for Auckland Mayor|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/70746613/colin-craig-could-run-for-auckland-mayor|accessdate=11 August 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August 2015, John Stringer lodged a complaint against Colin Craig with the [[New Zealand Police]], alleging that the later had exceeded his allocated election fund legal limit by NZ$2,000 when contesting the East Coast Bays electorate in 2014.  In addition, Stringer criticized Craig's management of the Conservative Party's 2014 election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hutching|first1=Chris|title=Stringer reveals allegations he has taken to the police|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/stringer-reveals-allegations-he-has-taken-police-ch-176899|accessdate=11 August 2015|publisher=''[[National Business Review]]''|date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Stringer submitted a dossier of documents to both the Police and the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Peter|last2=Robson|first2=Sarah|title=Colin Craig documents given to police|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/colin-craig-documents-given-to-police-2015081115#axzz3iY3Nkw7R|accessdate=11 August 2015|agency=3 News|date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August 2015, Jordan Williams served proceedings in defamation against Colin Craig and several Conservative Party officials in response to Craig's statements at the July press conference and in the circular ''Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Nicholas|title=Legal action taken against Colin Craig|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11497297|accessdate=16 August 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2015, Colin Craig filed a defamation suit against the Party's former chairman, John Stringer.

On 7 November 2015, Colin Craig was outed as the anonymous "Mr X" who posed as a party whistleblower that was interviewed in the "Dirty Politics" booklet delivered earlier in July. Despite acknowledging that he had fabricated the interview by posing as the interviewee, he defended his actions on the grounds that "talking about himself" in the third person was a common literary tool. He also stood by his assertions in the "Dirty Politics" booklet and vowed to continue his involvement in the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Marika|title=Ex-Conservative leader Colin Craig outed as Mr X|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/73727758/exconservative-leader-colin-craig-outed-as-mr-x|accessdate=8 November 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|publisher=''[[The Sunday Star-Times]]''|date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November, Craig announced that he would not contest the Conservative Party's leadership in lieu of a police investigation over his Party's spending during the 2014 general election. However, he also indicated that he would contest the 2017 general elections if he was cleared and if the Party wanted him back.&lt;ref name="NZH 16 Nov 2015" /&gt; On 24 November, it was reported that Craig had demanded that the blogger Cameron Slater pay him NZ$15,000 as compensation for reproducing a poem written for his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor on his blog Whale Oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Colin Craig claims $15,000 from Whale Oil blogger Cameron Slater for publication of 'Two of Me' poem|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/74343529/colin-craig-claims-15000-from-whale-oil-blogger-cameron-slater-for-publication-of-two-of-me-poem|accessdate=25 November 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Defamation lawsuit===
On 5 September 2016, Colin Craig appeared in the Auckland High Court to face a defamation lawsuit filed by Taxpayers' Union executive director Jordan Williams. Williams had filed the lawsuit after Craig alleged that Williams lied when he said that Craig had sexually harassed his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor. A jury of seven men and five women were selected for the trial, which is scheduled to take place for five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig in court to defend defamation Action|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/312572/colin-craig-in-court-to-defend-defamation-case|accessdate=6 September 2016|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September, Williams submitted text message correspondence between Craig and MacGregor as evidence of Craig's alleged sexual harassment. Williams has also alleged that Craig had breached a confidentiality agreement with McGregor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Sexual harassment allegations against Colin Craig detailed for first time|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/83944394/colin-craig-called-manipulative-during-defamation-case-against-him|accessdate=6 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 2016, the former Conservative Party deputy [[Christine Rankin]] took the stand to testify in support of Williams' defamation suit. Rankin testified that revelations about Craig's alleged inappropriate relationship with MacGregor had led her to question Craig's suitability to lead the Party. That same day, Williams took the stand to read portions of Craig's poems to MacGregor. He also alleged that Craig's defence team had tried to link him to the ''[[Dirty Politics]]'' scandal by alleging that he had taken part in a smear campaign against the former head of the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Colin Craig allegedly told Christine Rankin his secretary was 'mentally ill'|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/83989754/colin-craigs-alleged-love-letters-read-aloud-to-court|accessdate=8 September 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September, the judge discharged a juror after he revealed that he had a connection to a witness who was scheduled to give evidence for Craig later in the trial. As a result, the trial would proceed with eleven jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig defamation trial: Juror discharged|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11705810|accessdate=8 September 2016|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September, Craig's lawyer Stephen Mills [[Queen's Council|QC]] cross-examined Williams, who admitted that he had never seen the actual "sex text" between Craig and MacGregor. He also presented correspondence between Craig and MacGregor and contended that their relationship was consensual. The following day, Mills continued his cross-examination of Williams and suggested that William's motives for releasing the letters and emails were link to an ulterior motive of removing Craig as Party leader. Williams admitted this was the case but asserted that Craig's alleged inappropriate relationship with MacGregor made him an unsuitable leader for a "Christian movement based on family values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig trial: all you need to know|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11706663|accessdate=11 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September, the former Conservative board member John Stringer alleged that Craig was involved romantically with other women besides Rachel MacGregor. He also denied that there was a "dirty politics" strategy against Craig and alleged that Crag had disciplines, harassed, and attacked members that had disagreed with him. In his testimony, Stringer also alleged that Craig had created a "cult-like culture of confidentiality within the Conservative Party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollingworth|first1=Adam|title=Colin Craig needed chaperone around MacGregor - Stringer|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/colin-craig-needed-chaperone-around-macgregor---stringer-2016091212|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Newshub|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 and 15 September, Craig's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor took the stand to testify about Craig's alleged sexual harassment during the three-year period she had spent working as his press secretary. In her testimony, MacGregor cited a disagreement about her pay rate as the final straw in her decision to resign as press secretary two days before the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]]. In addition, MacGregor admitted that Craig had once fallen asleep on her lap but denied singing Christian hymns to him during that incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Rachel MacGregor's text messages to Colin Craig read to court|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84256582/former-conservative-leader-colin-craig-under-huge-pressure-lawyers-say|accessdate=15 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tahana|first1=Yvonne|title=Claims Colin Craig slept on Rachel MacGregor's lap while she sung him hymns|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/claims-colin-craig-slept-rachel-macgregors-lap-while-she-sung-him-hymns|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=One News|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September, the former Auckland City councillor Aaron Bhatnagar testified in support of Williams. He dismissed Craig's claim that he had supplied the text correspondence between Craig and MacGregor to Williams as false allegations that had damaged his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Former councillor Aaron Bhatnagar: Colin Craig 'impugned my reputation'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11710269|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of 15 September, Colin Craig and his lawyer Stephen Mills began presenting evidence for his defence after Jordan Williams and his team concluded their evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Colin Craig to defend defamation case|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84281588/colin-craig-to-defend-defamation-case|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September, Craig denied William's allegations that he had sexually harassed MacGregor and likened their relationship to that of siblings. Craig also testified that MacGregor had proposed to marry him but that he had turned her offer down because he was already married. In his testimony, he argued that his rejection of MacGregor's proposition had led her to resign as press secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Did she think I would leave my wife?|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11711164|accessdate=16 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fagans|first1=Josh|title=Colin Craig denies sexual harassment, explicit texts, but admits there was a kiss|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84324546/colin-craig-denies-sexual-harassment-explicit-texts-but-admits-there-was-a-kiss|accessdate=16 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September, Craig denied sending any sex text messages to Rachel McGregor but during cross-examination was unable to provide evidence supporting his claim. While hundreds of text messages from MacGregor's phone had been submitted as evidence, Craig's complete phone records have not been supplied to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Craig can't prove he didn't send messages|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11712720|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Craig denied that he charged a 29.5% interest rate on MacGregor's loan in order to coerce her into dropping her sexual harassment claim against him. He maintained that he had imposed the interest rate after she had resigned because she had defaulted on a $19,000 loan.&lt;ref name="RNZ 20 Sept"&gt;{{cite news|title=Craig charged 29.5% interest on loan to MacGregor|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/313766/craig-charged-29-point-5-percent-interest-on-loan-to-macgregor|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September, Craig's wife Helen Craig testified that MacGregor had privately called her to confess that she was having an emotional relationship with Craig. She added that MacGregor had admitted kissing Craig on the night of the 2011 general election. Helen also confirmed that she had forgiven her husband. Helen also testified that she and Craig had drawn up a set of " working rules"  to govern his working relationship.&lt;ref name="RNZ 20 Sept" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Court hears of 'relationship rules' between Rachel MacGregor and Colin Craig|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/84440974/macgregor-took-restraining-order-against-colin-craig-associate|accessdate=20 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Craig had admitted kissing McGregor, he denied undressing or having sexual intercouse with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig on kiss with press secretary|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11713454|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September, the investigative journalist [[Nicky Hager]] testified as part of Colin Craig's defense. In his testimony, he alleged that the information that had been released about Colin Craig on blogs like Cameron Slater's Whale Oil matched the patterns he had documented in his book ''[[Dirty Politics]]'', which had inspired Craig's pamphlet "Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig defamation trial: Dirty Politics author Nicky Hager takes the stand|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11714115|accessdate=21 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Dobbs, the former chairman of the Conservative Party, also testified that he and several other board members had expressed their discomfort with Craig and MacGregor's relationship. He criticized Craig for proceeding with the a 2015 sauna interview with a journalist without consulting him first. Dobbs also disclosed that Williams had showed him a collection of love letters, poems, emails, and other correspondence between Craig and MacGregor in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig defamation trial: Nicky Hager gives evidence|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/313866/colin-craig-defamation-trial-hager-gives-evidence|accessdate=22 September 2016|publisher=Radio New Zealand|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September, former Conservative Party board member Laurence Day disputed Rachel MacGregor's claim that Colin Craig had sexually harassed her on the grounds that Williams had failed to present the incriminating alleged "sext" text message. He alleged that Williams was trying to use the sexual harassment allegations to turn the party board members against Craig. Meanwhile, [[Family First New Zealand|Family First]] director [[Bob McCoskrie]] described Williams' leak of the alleged sexual harassment allegations as part of an "organized campaign" to unseat Craig. Day and McCoskrie supported Craig's assertion that his relationship with MacGregor had been inappropriate but consensual. McCoskrie defended Craig's pamphlet as a response to the alleged "organized campaign" against Craig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Former Conservative board member says a male secretary wouldn't have flattered Colin Craig|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84531305/family-first-director-bob-mccoskrie-says-colin-craigs-poetry-bad|accessdate=22 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September, several Conservative Party staff members testified in Craig's defense. Two staffers Bev Adair-Beets and Angela Storr alleged that MacGregor had tried to exploit her relationship with Craig and disputed her sexual harassment allegations. Another staffer Kevin Stitt vouched for the accuracy of the allegations presented in Craig's "Dirty Politics" pamphlet. The left-wing blogger [[Martyn "Bomber" Bradbury]] also alleged that Williams had embarked on what he described as a "political hit" job against the former Conservative leader. While on the stand, the plaintiff Williams disputed Craig's defense lawyer Stephen Mill's charge that he had used MacGregor for political gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Jordan Williams emotional and angry in court|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11715434|accessdate=23 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September, lawyers for both Jordan Williams and Colin Craig entered closing arguments. William's lawyer Peter Knight argued that the love letters and poems were proof that Williams had not been lying about Craig's alleged sexual harassment against MacGregor. In response, Craig's lawyer Stephen Mills asserted Craig had a right to defend himself through his "Dirty Politics" pamphlet. Mills also contended that Williams had broken MacGregor's trust by passing information on her relationship with Craig to other Conservative Party officials and [[Cameron Slater]]'s blog Whale Oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig trial: 'Jordan Williams wanted leader gone'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11718475|accessdate=28 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig's lawyer makes final push to clear his name|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/colin-craigs-lawyer-makes-final-push-to-clear-his-name-2016092811|accessdate=28 September 2016|publisher=Newshub|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September, after ten hours of deliberations, the jury unanimously found Craig guilty on two counts of defamation against Williams. Craig was ordered to pay $1.3 million in compensation and punitive damages to Williams. While Williams and his supporters including Cameron Slater have welcomed the decision, Craig's lawyers have announced that they would be appealing the verdict and challenging the size of the damages awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wade|first1=Amelia|title=Colin Craig loses defamation case, ordered to pay $1.3m damages|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11715326|accessdate=30 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bath|first1=Brooke|last2=Dennett|first2=Kelly|title=Colin Craig ruled to have defamed Jordan Williams|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84790345/colin-craig-jury-returns-in-defamation-case|accessdate=30 September 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic defamation damages award v Craig appealed ===
On 12 April 2017, High Court Justice Katz ruled that the compensation damages of $1.27 million constituted a "miscarriage of justice". The decision was welcomed by Colin Craig as a vindication of his assertion that he was responding to attacks on his character by Jordan Williams however the judge's decision related only to the amount of damages awarded to Williams against Craig by the jury not their verdict that Williams had been defamed by Craig which stood.

Justice Katz indicated that the two parties had until 26 April 2017 to consent to the High Court substituting its own award or setting aside the earlier verdict and ordering a retrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$1.27m Colin Craig defamation damages ruled excessive|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/328704/$1-point-27m-colin-craig-defamation-damages-ruled-excessive|accessdate=13 April 2017|agency=Radio New Zealand|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Verdict may be set aside in Colin Craig v Jordan Williams defamation case|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11837168|accessdate=13 April 2017|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Williams filed an appeal of the Katz decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11847282|title=Jordan Williams appeals to try to avoid retrial in Colin Craig defamation case|website=NZ Herald|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Craig did not file an acceptance of this action by 26 April actioning an inevitable re-trial however Jordan Williams then filed an appeal of the judge's decision seeking the jury damages award in his favour stand.  He released a press statement late April saying "Colin Craig argued that the jury's damages award was too high. The judge agreed but the High Court is only able to reset the damages if both parties agree...I don't want Rachel MacGregor or my mother or any other of my witnesses to have to go through it all again. The jury made clear findings. At every stage Mr Craig has wanted to stretch things out. We have no assurance he would not appeal after a new trial...So an appeal now could get to the key issues directly. It is the best way forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-nz/news/national/williams-appeals-in-craig-defamation-case/ar-BBAsUHO|title=Williams appeals in Craig defamation case|website=www.msn.com|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Rights Review Tribunal record damages awarded against Craig ===
On 3 October, it was reported that the  Human Rights Review Tribunal had, earlier in 2016, ordered Craig to pay Rachel MacGregor $128,780 in compensation for breaching the non-disclosure agreement with MacGregor by giving interviews about her. Because of the Williams defamation trial, the decision had been covered by blanket suppression until after the Williams v Craig verdict.

As of 2016, this amounts to the highest amount awarded by the Human Rights Review Tribunal.  In addition, Craig paid MacGregor $100,000 relating to her legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Rachel MacGregor awarded $128k after Colin Craig breaches confidentiality|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/84900004/rachel-macgregor-awarded-damages-after-colin-craig-breached-confidentiality|accessdate=4 October 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
On 4 October, the Conservative Party's board chairman Leighton Baker (confirmed as new leader of the party on 24 January 2017&lt;ref&gt;Conservative Party website press release 24 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that Colin Craig had resigned his membership and was not holding any positions in the party. However, Craig has not ruled out playing a role with the Conservatives after his legal problems were resolved.&lt;ref&gt;4 October 2016 Newshub and Paul Henry Breakfast&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 2016, Craig won his bid for his upcoming defamation case against former Party official John Stringer to be heard before a judge rather than a jury&lt;ref&gt;Conservative Party doesn't want Colin Craig back|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/conservative-party-doesnt-want-colin-craig-back-2016100407|accessdate=6 October 2016|publisher=Newshub|date=6 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as with the Williams case which Craig lost with historic damages. The ''Craig v Stringer'' case had been scheduled to be heard in the Christchurch High Court before Justice Gendall for a three-week period on 6 March 2017 (''Craig v Stringer''). In late 2016 John Stringer succeeded before Justice Nation in having granted on application a Judicial Settlement Conference under r7:79 in Christchurch, at which on 30 January 2017 Craig and Stringer settled their differences and the case against Stringer was dropped. No money exchanged hands and the settlement was sealed by the court and will not be released.&lt;ref&gt;The Press/STUFF Adele Redmond 6:42pm 1 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2016, Judge Mary Beth Sharp of the Auckland District Court dismissed both of Craig's copyright lawsuits against Cameron Slater and Jordan Williams over the publication of Craig's poem ''Two of Me'' calling the claims "vexatious" and "improper" and a "deception perpetrated on the court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Colin Craig's latest lawsuit thrown out; called vexatious|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/87263343/colin-craigs-latest-lawsuit-thrown-out-called-vexatious|accessdate=7 December 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2017, Colin Craig filed a $240,000 lawsuit against former employee Jacqueline Stiekema regarding defamatory statements she had allegedly made on a [[Facebook]] page and other defamatory publications she had made to a third person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig suing again|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2017/04/colin-craig-suing-again.html|accessdate=13 April 2017|agency=Newshub|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March 2017 Associate Judge Bell transferred the application to strike out the case to the district court.&lt;ref&gt;High Court decisions. "[http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZHC/2017/614.html]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 defamation trials===
Craig and blogger Cameron Slater both sued each other for defamation following the 2014 election. The cases were held in May 2017 and Craig represented himself in the four week trial. The Judge reserved his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/93193627/closing-submissions-heard-in-colin-craig-defamation-trial|title=Closing submissions heard in Colin Craig defamation trial|website=Stuff|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Braunias |first1=Steve |title=Craig v Slater: The end of the affair |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11868133 |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

8 May - 1 June 2017 the Craig v Slater (and Slater v Craig counterclaim) CIV2015-404-1923 was heard in the Auckland High Court before Justice Toogood.  Slater was represented by Brian Henry and Craig represented himself. The trial went a week past its scheduled three weeks. Craig said the case came down to credibility and whom the judge believed was telling the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2017/06/craig-v-slater-day-17-media-roundup/|title=Craig v Slater Day 17 (media roundup) – Whale Oil Beef Hooked - Whaleoil Media|date=1 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slater sued Craig for alleged defamatory statements in his booklet "Dirty Politics &amp; Hidden Agendas" (2015) and Craig sued Slater for making alleged defamatory statements on his blog. These included that Craig: had sexually harassed Rachel MacGregor; lied about it; and covered it up after settling a sexual harassment hearing in the Human Rights Commission and then the Human Rights Review Tribunal; and that there was a "second woman".

It dramatically transpired during the trial that Slater had been rung by a barrister that he knew (and whose identity vocation and area of practice he had chosen to keep anonymous) was in fact working for Colin Craig. There was disagreement over phone calls on 24 and 25 June 2015 initiated by the barrister and allegedly by Mr Craig which left Slater with an inference the barrister (a sexual harassment specialist) was representing a "second victim" with whom "Craig was a factor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2017/06/craig-v-slater-final-media-roundup-now/|title=Craig v Slater final media roundup... for now – Whale Oil Beef Hooked - Whaleoil Media|date=2 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither the barrister nor Craig ever revealed the conflict of interest nor did Craig correct Slater's inference at any stage leading up to and during most of the trial (the "second woman" was a central factor in both the earlier ''Craig v Stringer'' and ''Williams v Craig'' proceedings based on that evidence). Craig instead chose to sue all three parties for this contention which he knew was false yet allowed Slater to infer without correction until the much later trial.

The judge reserved his decision on 1 June 2017 to be delivered "as quickly as possible."

The Slater trial was the second in a triumvirate of trials central to a cluster of ancillary proceedings involving Craig (in the District Court; in hearings; in tribunals; and with the police; the Privacy Commission and the Electoral Commission all based on independent complaints). The main three trials (all filed 2015) concern the so-called "Dirty Politics Brigade" (Jordan Williams; Cameron Slater; John Stringer)  alleged in the Craig's booklet "Dirty Politics &amp; Hidden Agendas (2015) named after the Hager book "Dirty Politics" (2014). The Williams trial concluded 30 September 2016; the Slater-Craig trials 1 June 2017; and Stringer v Craig &amp; Others CIV2015-404-2524 is anticipated later in 2017 which will be the largest of the three. The latter has six defendants including Helen Craig but one of the defendants (a lawyer) settled with John Stringer in May 2016. Stringer and Craig also settled "Craig v Stringer" (CIV2015-409-0575) on 30 January 2017 in the Christchurch high court for zero an unrelated but parallel proceeding to the three main trials which largely concern the same issues and the same people.

On 9 June, it was reported that Colin Craig had filed a lawsuit against his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor. He was criticized by MacGregor, her advocate Ruth Money, and Jordan Williams for abusing the legal process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Satherley|first1=Dan|title=Colin Craig sues ex-press secretary Rachel MacGregor|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/06/colin-craig-sues-ex-press-secretary-rachel-macgregor.html|accessdate=14 June 2017|publisher=Newshub|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Helen|title=Rachel MacGregor please with Colin Craig to let her 'get on with my life'|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/93611318/rachel-macgregor-unaware-of-defamation-proceedings|accessdate=14 June 2017|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June, MacGregor filed a counter-suit against her former employer for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rachel MacGregor counter-sues Colin Craig for defamation|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/93899563/rachel-macgregor-countersues-colin-craig-for-defamation|accessdate=31 July 2017|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July, Judge Garry Harrison dismissed Craig's lawsuit against the former employee Jacky Stiekema, who had previously worked as a trust accounts manager for his company Centurion Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holye|first1=Craig|title=Judge throws out Colin Craig's bid to sue former employee for defamation|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/95304867/judge-throws-out-colin-craigs-bid-to-sue-former-employee-for-defamation|accessdate=31 July 2017|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second strike-out of Craig suit 1 September 2017===

On Friday 1 September 2017 Judge Harrison delivered a second strike-out of a Craig defamation suit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/338504/colin-craig-ordered-to-pay-17k-in-costs-to-woman-he-tried-to-sue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/95304867/judge-throws-out-colin-craigs-bid-to-sue-former-employee-for-defamation&lt;/ref&gt;

In the judges' four page decision Craig was ordered to pay Mrs Jacky Stiekema [Craig v Stiekema Civ2915-404-002882] $17600 in costs following his earlier refusal to discontinue what was described as frivolous litigation [para 12 of the decision] against her by senior barrister Peter McKnight of Wellington firm Langford Law. In the Stiekema case it was concluded Craig sought to obtain emails (that did not exist) between John Stringer (see above) and Mrs Stiekema for ulterior purposes (so Craig could use any material discovered against Stringer elsewhere); ruled a "[[fishing expedition]]" in relation to Craig by Associate Judge Osborne in the Christchurch High Court in yet another Craig proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defamationupdate.co.nz/sites/all/pdf/2016/Craig-v-Stringer-2016-NZHC-768.pdf See para 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Judge Harrison decision followed an earlier decision in Wellington by Judge Sharp in December 2016 to strike-out Craig's litigation Craig v Social Media Ltd and Jordan Williams described as "vexatious," "malicious" and "a deception on the court."  In both instances Craig is appealing the judgements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.districtcourts.govt.nz/assets/unsecure/2017-05-08/2017-NZDC-2366-Colin-Craig-v-Social-Media-Consultants-Ltd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; View the full judgement here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.districtcourts.govt.nz/all-judgments/2016-nzdc-24911-craig-v-social-media-consultants-ltd/&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacky Stiekema (described in blog posts by Stringer as "Grandma Quilts" to protect her privacy&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnews.indywatch.org/archiver/worldnews.indywatch.org/resources/timemachine/2015/329/pacific.html See 14:01]&lt;/ref&gt; because she makes quilts and is a grandmother) was an ex-employee of Craig's (a senior Trust Account Manager of several years at Centurion) and had years earlier (2012) successfully taken Craig to the Employment Court for which she was awarded several thousand dollars. It was felt in some quarters that perhaps the more recent litigation was in retaliation for this as it appeared difficult to ascertain Craig's motivation for suing Stiekema and that he had failed "to disclose a serious tort".&lt;ref&gt;see 6 of Harrison 1 September 2017 ref ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Stiekema's 2012 Employment Court hearing the first negative media publicity emerged about Craig with references in the media to Craig explaining "shortness" being due to "sin" (with biblical allusions to Zaccheus the tax collector) and Stiekema's uncomfortableness with "prayer meetings" run by Craig at the business despite Stiekema's strong personal Christian faith (see STUFF report &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/6876016/Colin-Craig-preached-shortness-a-sin-claim&lt;/ref&gt; which followed years later with the saga detailed above and claims in the media "NZ women are the most promiscuous in the world" during the 2014 election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/kiwi-women-most-promiscuous--colin-craig-2012050911&lt;/ref&gt;

===New litigation, 2017&amp;ndash;2018===
In late 2017 Craig was facing additional strike-out applications including a recall and possible strikeout of his Christchurch high court case against John Stringer (mid-October 2017; that was settled by Stringer in January 2017 for zero), still to be heard. He is involved in multiple proceedings including a new suit announced against his former sexual harassment complainant Rachel MacGregor and a counter suit from her against Craig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Satherley |first1=Dan |title=Colin Craig sues ex-press secretary Rachel MacGregor |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/06/colin-craig-sues-ex-press-secretary-rachel-macgregor.html |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"/&gt;

On 24 September 2018, Craig dropped his damages claim against MacGregor but stated that he was still pursuing his defamation claim against his former press secretary. MacGregor has also pursued a defamation claim against hwe former employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Warhurst |first1=Lucy |title=Colin Craig drops damages claim, but presses ahead with suit against Rachel MacGregor |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/09/colin-craig-drops-damages-claim-but-presses-ahead-with-suit-against-rachel-macgregor.html |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October, Auckland High Court Judge Kit Toogood ruled that Craig had committed "moderately serious sexual harassment" against MacGregor. He also ruled that Cameron Slater had defamed Craig in five untrue statements but declined to award damages, stating that "the reputational damage which Mr Craig suffered throughout the events traversed at length in this judgment resulted almost entirely from his own actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Satherley |first1=Dan |title=Colin Craig 'guilty of moderately serious sexual harassment' against Rachel MacGregor, judge rules |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/10/colin-craig-guilty-of-moderately-serious-sexual-harassment-against-rachel-macgregor-judge-rules.html |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hurley |first1=Sam |title=Judge rules Cameron Slater defamed Colin Craig who sexually harassed Rachel MacGregor |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12148439 |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Livingston |first1=Tommy |title=Colin Craig defamed by Cameron Slater, but also found 'guilty' of sexual harassment |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/108071391/colin-craig-defamed-by-cameron-slater-but-also-found-guilty-of-sexual-harassment |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a '''communication-enabled business process''' (CEBP) is to optimize [[business process]] by reducing the human latency that exists within a process flow. For example, a mortgage approval process may be experiencing human latency because the person assigned to providing an approval is on vacation or busy working on something else. To reduce this latency, CEBP leverages [[unified communications]]  capabilities (i.e. UC services) by embedding them into the business process flow. The result is a more efficient, more automated closed-loop process; translating into significant ROI.

If the person does not provide the necessary approval within a designated period of time then the business process would invoke a UC service such as “notify and respond” from an [[IP PBX]], voice portal/IVR, conferencing application, etc. These embedded UC services would “notify” the person that they need to do something. If the person does not “respond” to the notification then it can be escalated to a manager in the same manner.

==Types of services==
In fact, there are a number of UC services that could be embedded within a business process to reduce human latency. These could include: conference [on demand], alert, escalate, contact resident expert, etc.; all of which create measurable business value.

==Advantages==
The great thing about CEBP is that it can be applied horizontally across different lines of business and different industries. Virtually every business process is hampered by human latency. Some other use cases that CEBP can be applied to include: roadside assistance, stock portfolio alerts, personal information loss, claims processing, inventory management, etc. Here is a more detailed example:

===CEBP example===
In claims processing, the organization’s goal is to decrease claim close times and improve their closure rate. However, this process is often hampered by several inefficiencies – the paperwork process can be manually intensive; time-sensitive dependencies on member signatures exist, resulting in significant delays in the approval process.

A CEBP solution would be implemented to automate and communications-enable the claims process with embedded UC services like: reminders, alerts, and notifications.

Quantifiable business results could include: decreased close times; greater agent/specialist productivity, enabling them to spend more time adjusting claims rather than fielding calls on the claims; increased revenue and member satisfaction/retention.

== CEBP versus unified communications ==
Many UC vendors claim that they do CEBP today. However, one very important distinction needs to be made…there is a difference between communications integrated into business process and communications enabled business process. 

It is person triggered as illustrated in examples like adding a click-to-dial function to an ERP or CRM application. As described above, CEBP is much more sophisticated in its ability to automate business process flows; it is usually event triggered, providing a much stronger ROI to many lines of business and vertical industries.

{{Capitalism |expanded=Ideologies}}
'''Dirigisme''' or '''dirigism''' ({{ety|fr|diriger|to direct}}) is an economic doctrine in which the state plays a strong directive role, as opposed to a merely [[Regulation|regulatory]] role, over a [[capitalist]] [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/dirigisme ''Dirigisme''] Oxford Dictionaries. Retrieved 25 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As an economic doctrine, dirigisme is the counterpart to [[laissez-faire]], stressing a positive role for state intervention in curbing productive inefficiencies and [[market failure]]s. Dirigiste policies often include [[indicative planning]], state-directed investment, and the use of market instruments (taxes and subsidies).

The term emerged in the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war]] era to describe the economic policies of [[France]], which included substantial state-directed investment, the use of [[Indicative planning|indicative economic planning]] to supplement the [[market mechanism]], and the establishment of [[state enterprise]]s in strategic domestic sectors. It resulted in an unprecedented [[economic]] and [[demography|demographic]] growth, leading to the coinage of the term ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' ("Thirty Glorious [years]").

The term has subsequently been used to classify other economies that pursued similar policies, most notably the [[Four Asian Tigers|East Asian tiger economies]], and more recently the economy of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Models of dirigisme in East Asia: perspectives from Eastern Europe, 1996"&gt;''Models of dirigisme in East Asia: perspectives from Eastern Europe'', by Dragsbæk Schmidt, Johannes. 1996. Between Western Europe and East Asia, p. 196-216, {{ISBN|0333666046}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is [[state capitalism]].

Most modern economies can be characterized as ''dirigiste'' to some degree&amp;nbsp;– for instance, the state may exercise directive action by performing or subsidizing research and development of new technologies, through government procurement (especially [[military]]) or through state-run research institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/features/2013/06/the-myth-of-the-meddling-state-nothing-ventured/ |title=The Myth of the "Meddling" State |author=Mariana Mazzucato |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=Public Finance International |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In France==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
Before the [[Second World War]], France had a relatively fragmented [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system. The many small companies, often family-owned, were often not dynamic and efficient{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} in comparison to the large industrial groups in [[Germany]] or the [[United States]]. The Second World War laid waste to France. Railroads and industries were destroyed by aerial [[bombardment]] and [[sabotage]]; industries were seized by Nazi Germany; in the immediate postwar years loomed the spectre of long years of [[rationing]] (such as the one enforced in the [[United Kingdom]]). Some sections of the French business and political world lost authority after [[Vichy France|collaborating with the German occupiers]].

Post-war French governments, from whichever political side, generally sought rational, efficient economic development, with the long-term goal of matching the highly developed and technologically advanced economy of the [[United States]]. The development of French dirigisme coincided with the development of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]]: the [[École Nationale d'Administration]] supplied the state with high-level administrators, while leadership positions in industry were staffed with [[Corps of Mines (France)|Corps of Mines]] state engineers and other personnel trained at the [[École Polytechnique]].

During the 1945–1975 period, France experienced unprecedented [[economic growth]] (5.1% on average) and a [[demography|demographic]] boom, leading to the coinage of the term ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' ("Thirty Glorious [years]").

Dirigisme flourished under the [[right-wing|centre-right]] governments of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Georges Pompidou]]. In those times, the policy was viewed as a middle way between the American policy of little state involvement and the Soviet policy of total state control. In 1981, [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]] president [[François Mitterrand]] was elected, promising greater [[state enterprise]] in the economy; his government soon [[nationalization|nationalised]] industries and banks. However, in 1983 the initial bad economic results forced the government to renounce dirigisme and start the era of ''rigueur'' ("rigour"). Dirigisme has remained out of favour with subsequent governments, though some of its traits remain.

===Indicative planning===
The main French tool under dirigisme was [[indicative planning]] through plans designed by the ''Commissariat général du plan'' ("Commission for the Plan"). Indicative planning used various incentives to induce public and private actors to behave in an optimal fashion, with the plan serving as a general guideline for optimal investment. During this period France never ceased to be a capitalist economy directed by the [[accumulation of capital]], profit-maximizing enterprise and [[Market economy|market-based allocation]] of producer goods.

In contrast to [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type central planning]] practiced in the former [[Eastern bloc|Soviet bloc]], where economic planning substituted market allocation and operated the factors of production according to a binding plan, the French state never owned more than a minority of industry and did not seek to replace markets with planning. The idea of dirigisme is to complement and improve the efficiency of the market through indirect planning intended to provide better information to market participants. This concept is held in contrast to a planned economy, which aims to replace market-based allocation of production and investment with a binding plan of production expressed in units of physical quantities.

===State ownership===
Because French industry prior to the Second World War was weak due to fragmentation, the French government encouraged mergers and the formation of "[[national champions]]": large industry groups backed by the state.

Two areas where the French government sought greater control were in [[infrastructure]] and the transportation system. The French government owned the national railway company [[SNCF]], the national electricity utility [[Electricité de France|EDF]], the national natural gas utility [[Gaz de France|GDF]], the national airline [[Air France]]; [[France Télécom|phone]] and [[La Poste (France)|postal]] services were operated as the [[Postes, télégraphes et téléphones (France)|PTT]] administration. The government chose to devolve the construction of most [[Freeway|autoroutes]] (freeways) to semi-private companies rather than to administer them itself. Other areas where the French government directly intervened were defense, nuclear and aerospace industries ([[Aérospatiale]]).

This development was marked by ''volontarisme'', the belief that difficulties (e.g. postwar devastation, lack of natural resources) could be overcome through willpower and ingenuity. For instance, following the [[1973 energy crisis]], the saying "In France we don't have oil, but we have ideas" was coined. Volontarisme emphasized [[modernization]], resulting in a variety of ambitious state plans. Examples of this trend include the extensive use of [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] (close to 80% of French electrical consumption), the [[Minitel]], an early online system for the masses, and the [[TGV]], a [[high-speed rail]] network.

==Other economies with dirigiste characteristics==
Economic dirigisme has been described as an inherent aspect of [[fascist]] economies by Hungarian author, [[Iván T. Berend]] in his book ''An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván T. Berend]], An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Fascist systems created by [[Benito Mussolini]] ([[Italy]]), [[António de Oliveira Salazar|António Salazar]] ([[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]]), [[Francisco Franco]] ([[Spain]]) and [[Adolf Hitler]] ([[Germany]]) are a varied mix of elements from numerous philosophies, including: [[nationalism]], [[authoritarianism]], [[militarism]], [[corporatism]], [[collectivism]], [[totalitarianism]], and [[anti-communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker|first=David|date=June 2006|title=The political economy of fascism: Myth or reality, or myth and reality?|journal=New Political Economy|volume=11|issue=2|pages=227–250|doi=10.1080/13563460600655581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirigisme has been brought up as a politico-economic scheme at odds with ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the context of French overseas holdings. Countries such as Lebanon and Syria have been influenced by this motif&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=4&amp;article_id=86003 The Daily Star] - 'Youssef Chaitani's 'Post-Colonial Syria and Lebanon' chronicles the history of division between the neighbors', 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to varying degrees throughout the post-colonial period.

The economies of the East Asian tigers are sometimes characterised as being "dirigiste" due to the strong role played by the state in [[Developmental state|development planning]] and guiding investment.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. 
Dirigisme is also seen in [[India]]. The state has complete control and ownership of railways; majority control and stake in banking, insurance, electricity, and oil and gas industries; and has substantial control over telecommunication, port and shipping industries.&lt;ref name="EnergyStats2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Statistics 2017|url=http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy_Statistics_2017.pdf|website=mospi.nic.in|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="factual"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2007/09/01001100/India-growth-story-is-attracti.html|title= India growth story is attracting talent from govt establishments|newspaper=Mint|date=1 September 2007|first=Jeetha|last=D'Silva|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCIabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipindia.com/newsite/DisplayContent.asp?CategoryID=1&amp;ContentID=1|title=About Us|work=Official webpage of the Shipping Corporation of India|accessdate=3 June 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106162636/http://www.shipindia.com/newsite/DisplayContent.asp?CategoryID=1&amp;ContentID=1 |archivedate = 6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-27/news/29820591_1_par-with-private-insurers-sovereign-guarantee-policies], Sovereign guarantee for all policies issued by LIC will continue.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earl Raymond Hagaman''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CNZM}} (12 September 1925 – 25 May 2017) was an American-born New Zealand hotel operator. 

==Biography==
Hagaman was born in [[Los Angeles]] on 12 September 1925.&lt;ref name="2014 Press profile"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Matthews |first1=Philip |title=Hagamans building an empire |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/9725378/Hagamans-building-an-empire |accessdate=25 May 2017 |work=[[The Press]] |date=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com.au/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=try&amp;db=cabirth1905&amp;h=1208450 |title=California birth index, 1905–1995 |year=2005 |website= |publisher=Ancestry.com Operations |accessdate=25 May 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961 to March 1981, he was married to Barbara Jean Fairbank.&lt;ref name="Barbara Fairbank"&gt;{{cite news |last1=van Beynen |first1=Martin |title=Former wife 'not pursuing estate'&lt;!-- Print title shown; online title was: "Earl Hagaman's ex-wife not pursuing estate 'at the moment'" --&gt; |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/94581274/earl-hagamans-exwife-not-pursuing-estate-at-the-moment |accessdate=12 July 2017 |work=[[The Press]] |date=12 July 2017 |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to New Zealand in 1983&lt;ref name="Barbara Fairbank" /&gt; after visiting his friend Ralph Brown, who had moved to New Zealand in 1972. Brown and Hagaman invested in hotels and out of this venture, Scenic Group developed.&lt;ref name="2014 Press profile" /&gt; At the time of his death, Hagaman's hotel empire employed around 1000 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Earl Hagaman, multi-millionaire businessman who sued Andrew Little, has died |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11863022 |accessdate=25 May 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Hagaman bought the house of Sir [[Robertson Stewart]] in the [[Christchurch]] suburb of [[Ilam, New Zealand|Ilam]], and lived there for the rest of his life. The house had a 2007 rating valuation of just under NZ$4m.&lt;ref name="2014 Press profile" /&gt;

In the [[2014 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2014 New Year Honours]], Hagaman was appointed a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to business, tourism and philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2014 | title=New Year honours list 2014|date=31 December 2013 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagaman was in his 60s when he hired a financial controller for Scenic Group; she was in her early 20s. Hagaman's fourth marriage was failing and he later married his employee – Lani Hagaman.&lt;ref name="2014 Press profile" /&gt; They had three children together, and Hagaman had four children from prior relationships.&lt;ref name="Stuff obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=High-profile hotel magnate Earl Hagaman dies, aged 92 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/92961749/highprofile-hotel-magnate-earl-hagaman-dies-aged-92 |accessdate=25 May 2017 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earl and Lani Hagaman's wealth was estimated by the ''[[National Business Review]]'' at [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]180m.&lt;ref name="2014 Press profile" /&gt;

The Hagamans were large donors to various causes, including [[St. Andrew's College, Christchurch|St. Andrew's College]] (NZ$250k), [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral]], the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], and the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT Party]].&lt;ref name="2014 Press profile" /&gt; The Hagamans have donated more than NZ$10m.&lt;ref name="Stuff obit" /&gt; The Hagamans sued [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] leader [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] for defamation and sought $2.3m in damages. Whilst Little was found guilty of defaming Earl Hagaman on one count, the jury could not decide on all other claims, and the High Court judge thus let all claims retire. Shortly after the verdict in April 2017, Lani Hagaman declared that she would seek a retrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Walls |first1=Jason |title=Lani Hagaman will continue to pursue Little in court for defamation |url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/lani-hagaman-will-continue-pursue-little-court-defamation-jw-201874 |accessdate=25 May 2017 |work=[[National Business Review]] |date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lani Hagaman laid an appeal in September 2017, after her husband had died. She must overcome the legal hurdle that according to the Law Reform Act 1936, a defamation case cannot continue after a person's death. Her lawyers argue that the case had already been heard, and they want to test whether the trial judge advised the jury correctly on the point of qualified privilege that [[member of parliament|members of parliament]] enjoy speaking inside [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hutching |first1=Chris |title=Hagaman defamation suit heat still on as widow continues fight &lt;!-- Lani Hagaman seeks Court of Appeal direction in Andrew Little defamation case--&gt; |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/97251896/lani-hagaman-seeks-appeal-court-direction-in-little-defamation-case |accessdate=8 October 2017 |work=[[The Press]] |date=27 September 2017 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, property claims by his former wife Fairbanks appeared in the Christchurch [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] after having previously been filed in a [[California superior courts|Californian superior court]].

'''Erna Low''' (28 July 1909 – 12 February 2002) was  an [[Austria]]n [[Jewish]]  businesswoman who settled in England and is best known for her work in the ski travel industry.

Low has been cited as a pioneer in the development of the [[package holiday]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pioneer of the package holiday|journal=Ski|date=September 1978|volume=43|issue=1|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was the founder of [http://www.ernalow.co.uk/ Erna Low] Travel Services Ltd. She worked in the holiday industry for over sixty years. She retired in 1995.

==Early years==

Low was born in [[Vienna]] in 1909 as the only daughter of Eduard Carl Lӧwe and his wife Emma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frary|first=Mark|title=Aiming High|year=2013|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=1780883544|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnFHlhoQmLwC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=aiming+high+frary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She remained in the city throughout her childhood and education.

She became the [[Austria]]n [[javelin throw|javelin]] champion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A talented athlete|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before moving to [[England]] in 1931, with ten borrowed pounds in her pocket, to research a [[PhD]] thesis on [[Lord de Tabley]], a Victorian poet and botanist. During her studies, Low traced the grandchildren of de Tabley and was invited to stay at the family home in [[Knutsford]], [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low invited to meet Lord de Tabley's family|newspaper=The Times|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in [[Bloomsbury]], Low earned a basic living as a language tutor, but decided that she needed to earn more to finance trips back to [[Austria]] to visit her sick mother and fulfil her passion for [[skiing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's desire to travel home|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low's business career in the travel industry began in 1932 when she placed an advertisement in the ''[[Morning Post]]''. It read:

'[[Winter Sports]] – [[Austria]], fortnight, £15 only, including rail and hotel, arranged by young Viennese Graduette for young people leaving [[Christmas]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's first advert|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low set up a permanent home in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and became a citizen in 1940, changing her name from Lӧwe to Low in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low changes her name|newspaper=The Independent|date=18 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== War Years ==

The outbreak of [[World War II]] made ski trips to [[Austria]] impossible, so Low planned alternative visits to [[Switzerland]].
 
For much of the war she worked for the [[BBC]] in [[Worcestershire]] where she would monitor German broadcasts for the Intelligence Service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Working for the BBC|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she disliked this role and chose to become a lecturer in the [[Army Education Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erna Low's occupation during the war|url=http://www.ernalow.co.uk/about-us-history|publisher=Erna Low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She then developed the 'house-party' concept. Low recognised that families were separated by war service and offered the opportunity for people to meet one another at [[Christmas]]. She leased [[boarding school]]s and invited paying guests to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'house party'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This venture became a company in 1946 and was later known as Enjoy Britain Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enjoy Britain Ltd.|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1947 – 1979: Erna Low Travel Service ==

In 1947, Low set up Erna Low Travel Service Ltd out of Reece Mews, South Kensington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lurotbrand.co.uk/flipbook/mewsnews2010-winter/ Mews News]. ''Lurot Brand. ''Published Winter 2010. Page 5. Retrieved 16 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked with schools to run school courses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Low runs school trips|journal=Climber and Rambler|year=1970|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and utilised the post-war demand for foreign travel to develop holidays for which the majority was paid before departure. A foreign exchange allowance of £50 meant that travel experts were in demand and Low's company provided this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low takes advantage of the foreign exchange allowance|newspaper=The Times|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low was very adept at finding new resorts for her clients in both the summer and winter market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'house party'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=February 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erna Low's 1948 brochure said: “[[Winter sports]] are on the map again”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's view of winter sports|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/27/guardianobituaries2|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by 1950, it included 24 continental trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Erna Low Travel Service Ltd expands|newspaper=The Independent|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Low placed emphasis on the personal touch and until the mid-1950s, she accompanied each group on their trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erna Low's personal touch|url=http://www.ernalow.co.uk/about-us-history|publisher=Erna Low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An all-inclusive fortnight in a first-class hotel with Erna Low cost 38 guineas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The all-inclusive holiday|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and after the introduction of [[charter flights]] in 1954, she even reduced costs by advising her clients to travel in ski clothes to save on excess baggage expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's eye for value|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=February 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weekend train trips to [[Austria]] became a regular feature in this period of the company's development and customers were provided with a music carriage for entertainment during their 24-hour rail journey on the 'snow train'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'Snow Train'|newspaper=The Independent|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low's business continued to grow and in 1972, with a staff of sixty and a turnover of £1.5 million, she opted to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low sells the company|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She bought her name back in 1975 with the business struggling, but sold again in 1979 to become a consultant to the travel industry.

== Late career ==

Low reinvented her company in 1981 under the name Erna Low Consultants Ltd. In this role, Low concentrated on developing the health spa market throughout [[Europe]]. She became the official representative in the [[UK]] of resorts at [[La Plagne]], [[Les Arcs]] and [[Flaine]], while she was decorated for her services to tourism by [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's honours|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low continued to work in the 1990s and gained membership of the [[Chartered Institute of Marketing]] for her feasibility study on [[Strathpeffer]]. She was also the vice-president of both the Kensington Chamber of Commerce and Women of the Year Association, and won a 'Women Mean Business' award at the age of 83.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Responsibilities|newspaper=The Times|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low handed control of the company to her successor and loyal employee, Joanna Yellowlees-Bound, in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low hands over the company|newspaper=The Independent|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000, the company was entered into the British Travel Industry's 'Hall of Fame'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry into the 'Hall of Fame'|url=http://www.ernalow.co.uk/about-us-history|publisher=Erna Low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Low was renowned for her formidable style, and she was never known to avoid confrontation. On one occasion, a senior executive with a rival company won an award at a trade ceremony. Clearly bitter at a setback earlier in his career, he said: “You once refused to employ me, and look where I am now.” Low's response provided an insight into the way in which she worked. “I still wouldn't employ you,” she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's confrontation with a former employee|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low was a consummate networker and taught royalty, actors and politicians to ski.

Despite her often intimidating façade, Low made many friends through business and while travelling. She was the godmother to a number of children, including the actress [[Emily Lloyd]], following a friendship with her grandmother, Uli Lloyd-Pack who worked for Low for over 30 years, and Uli Lloyd-Pack’s son, [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friendship with the Lloyd-Pack family|newspaper=The Times|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low never married and chose to live alone in [[South Kensington]] with her dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low lived alone|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

Low died at the age of 92 on 12 February 2002 at her home in [[London]].

== The Future of Erna Low Ltd ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MarkFraryAimingHigh.jpg|right | thumb| The cover of Mark Frary's book]] --&gt;

The company continues to operate in the ski industry with Low's principles forming an integral part of Erna Low's identity under the direction of Joanna Yellowlees-Bound.  The company, still based in the mews house in South Kensington from where Miss Low lived and worked, has since branched out into real estate and has a successful property company, Erna Low Property, with an office in Arc 1950, in the French Alps.

Erna Low Ltd marked the 80th-year anniversary of Low's ''[[Morning Post]]'' advertisement in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erna Low Ltd Anniversary|url=http://www.ernalow.co.uk/80|publisher=Erna Low}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Mark Frary's biography, ''Aiming High'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frary|first=Mark|title=Aiming High|year=2012|publisher=Troubador Publishing|isbn=9781780883540}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched at the [[Coronet Cinema]] in [[London]] on 11 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anniversary Event|url=http://blog.ernalow.co.uk/2012/11/video-from-the-erna-low-80th-anniversary-event/|publisher=Erna Low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, Erna Low Ltd produced a short film of Low’s life from many thousands of hours of archive cine films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Films|url=http://www.ernalow.co.uk/archive-videos|publisher=Erna Low|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Export subsidy''' is a government policy to encourage export of goods and discourage sale of goods on the domestic [[Market (economics)|market]] through direct payments, low-cost [[loans]], tax relief for exporters, or government-financed international advertising. An export subsidy reduces the price paid by foreign importers, which means [[Domestic market|domestic]] consumers pay more than foreign consumers. The [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) prohibits most subsidies directly linked to the volume of [[exports]], except for [[Least Developed Countries|LDCs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm8_e.htm Anti-dumping, subsidies, safeguards: contingencies, etc], Understanding the WTO: The Agreements&lt;/ref&gt; Incentives are given by the government of a country to exporters to encourage export of goods.  

Export subsidies are also generated when internal price supports, as in a guaranteed minimum price for a [[commodity]], create more production than can be consumed internally in the country. (These [[price]] supports are often coupled with import tariffs, which keeps the domestic price high by discouraging or taxing imports on the difference between the world price and the mandatory minimum.) Instead of letting the commodity rot or destroying it, the government exports it. [[Saudi Arabia]] is a net exporter of [[wheat]], [[Japan]] often is a net exporter of [[rice]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

At the WTO's Tenth Ministerial Conference, which was held in [[Nairobi, Kenya]] from 15 to 19 December 2015, the WTO member states agreed to eliminate export subsidies for agricultural products; least-developed nations have until the end of 2018 to eliminate agricultural export subsidies (until 1 January 2017 in relation to cotton exports), while developed nations agreed to eliminate most such subsidies immediately.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTO members secure “historic” Nairobi Package for Africa and the world|url=https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news15_e/mc10_19dec15_e.htm|website=World Trade Organization|accessdate=20 December 2015|date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Trade Organization strikes 'historic' farming subsidy deal|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35145377|accessdate=20 December 2015|work=BBC News|date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WTO, [https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/FE_S_S006.aspx?Language=ENGLISH&amp;SourcePage=FE_S_S002&amp;Context=RD&amp;PostingDateFrom=18/12/2015&amp;PostingDateTo=21/12/2015&amp;IsEnglishSelected=True&amp;IsFrenchSelected=True&amp;IsSpanishSelected=True&amp;IsAllLanguageSelected=True&amp;FullTextHash=371857150&amp;languageUIChanged=true# Ministerial Declaration on Cotton], accessed 21 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Export subsidies can cause [[inflation]]: the government subsidises the industry based on costs, but an increase in the subsidy is directly spent on wage hikes demanded by employees. Now the wages in the subsidised [[industry]] are higher than elsewhere, which causes the other employees demand higher [[wage]]s, which are then reflected in prices, resulting in inflation everywhere in the [[economy]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Some countries provide indirect export subsidies in the form of tax reductions. In the United States closely held exporters of U.S. made goods may get a reduction of tax using an Interest Charge Domestic International Sales Corporation (IC-DISC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aicpa.org/Publications/TaxAdviser/2012/October/Pages/clinic-story-05.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Basil Zochonis''' (1852–1929) was a Greek businessman, who was the founder of [[PZ Cussons]], one of the [[United Kingdom]]'s largest personal health care and consumer goods manufacturing businesses.

==Career==
Brought up in [[Greece]], George Zochnis initially joined the trading house of ''Fisher &amp; Randall'' in [[Freetown]] in [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name=pz&gt;[http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/33870627/patersonzochonis.pdf Paterson Zochonis: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112213702/http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/33870627/patersonzochonis.pdf |date=2011-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, together with [[George Paterson (businessman)|George Paterson]], he founded [[PZ Cussons|Paterson Zochonis]] and built it into a large trading house.&lt;ref name=pz/&gt; It imported West African goods ([[Arecaceae|palm products]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s etc.) into the [[United Kingdom]] and then exported them to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=pz/&gt;  It also exported [[United Kingdom|British]] goods ([[textiles]] etc.) to West Africa.&lt;ref name=pz/&gt;

He died in 1929.&lt;ref name=pz/&gt; After his death control of the business passed to Constantine Zochonis, his [[nephew]], and then more recently, to John Zochonis (Constantine's [[son]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/business/s/212/212612_sir_john_zochonis.html Sir John Zochonis] Manchester Evening News, 9 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''guaranteed rental''' is a transaction whereby a party looking to acquire a property in order to rent it out on a retail basis (i.e., nightly or weekly), typically a [[property manager]] or [[vacation rental]] manager, rents from the owner of the property a large block of time, typically several months or even years. Through the transaction the acquirer provides the owner of the property with a guaranteed sum over the term of the contract.  
The acquirer then has the right to rent the property in question out on a retail basis, keeping all related revenues. This transaction is popular with parties seeking to shift the risk and/or management burden associated with renting property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/buy-to-let/10718950/Landlords-warned-of-rental-guarantee-pitfalls.html Landlords warned of 'rental guarantee' pitfalls], "The Telegraph". Web. 02 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/can-guaranteed-rental-schemes-save-struggling-landlords-1776031.html Can guaranteed rental schemes save struggling landlords?], "The Independent UK". Web. 02 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a transaction is similar to [[leaseback]] arrangements more frequently used by [[property developers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E9Amkpj-AIQC&amp;pg=PA441&amp;lpg=PA441&amp;dq=developer+lease+back+property+after+sale+guarantee+rental+income&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7RWedACvt&amp;sig=1dN0qpu3jaAenAIavphxvR1BBZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pCKOU9qVL5ffsAScmILABw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=developer%20lease%20back%20property%20after%20sale%20guarantee%20rental%20income&amp;f=false], Ratcliffe, John, Michael Stubbs, and Miles Keeping.

== Benefits and risks of wholesale rentals ==

=== Property owners ===

Through a wholesale contract a property owner is able to receive a guaranteed sum over the term of the contract. This takes the risk out of trying to rent the property him or herself, often with financial discount. Depending on how the contract is structured, the property owner may also shift more or less of the costs, maintenance, repairs, and other property owner responsibilities to the acquirer during the term of the contract. One potential downside is that by selling the right to rent to a third party, the homeowner loses some control over how that property is managed during the term, though this can also be negotiated and agreed within the contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/75053/property_tips/free_advice_on_guaranteed_property_rental_schemes.html], "Street Directory". Web. 03 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property managers ===

Through a wholesale contract a property manager is able to acquire new inventory to manage on a retail basis, increasing revenues. When acquired at the right price, such contracts can also increase profit margins. By purchasing the weeks during the term, the manager has increased control over how the property is managed. One potential downside is the increased risk of providing a guarantee - if the property does not rent as well as predicted in the retail market, the manager still is obligated to pay the property owner the agreed upon sum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.propertyangel.in/blog/types-of-property-management-companies], "PropertyAngel.in". Web. 03 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Types of guaranteed rental contracts ==

=== Bilateral contracts ===

Wholesale rentals can be negotiated directly between homeowners and property managers. Such contracts can be good where the parties trust one another, and the numbers are easily agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E9Amkpj-AIQC&amp;pg=PA441&amp;lpg=PA441&amp;dq=developer+lease+back+property+after+sale+guarantee+rental+income&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7RWedACvt&amp;sig=1dN0qpu3jaAenAIavphxvR1BBZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pCKOU9qVL5ffsAScmILABw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=developer%20lease%20back%20property%20after%20sale%20guarantee%20rental%20income&amp;f=false], Ratcliffe, John, Michael Stubbs, and Miles Keeping. Urban Planning and Real Estate Development. Routledge, Jan 19, 2009, p. 440-441.&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Marketplaces ===

Property owners and property managers can also come to terms through wholesale rental marketplaces. Through such marketplaces property managers compete against one another, bidding up the price offered and ultimately paid to property owners. By creating a market-derived price for properties’ rental weeks, such marketplaces often make it quick and easy for property owners and property managers to come to agreement and sign wholesale rental contracts.&lt;ref name=tnooz&gt;[http://www.tnooz.com/article/Vacation-Futures-wholesale-vacation-rental-marketplace# Startup pitch: Vacation Futures creates the wholesale vacation rental marketplace], "tnooz".

'''Oracle Hyperion Planning''' is a budgeting and forecasting application that aims at improving business predictability. It used to be owned by [[Hyperion Solutions Corporation]], which was purchased by [[Oracle Corporation]] in March 2007. Oracle Hyperion Planning uses [[Essbase]] (a [[multidimensional database]] product sold by [[Hyperion Solutions Corporation|Hyperion]]) as a database and calculation engine, a relational repository for business logic, and includes a [[web-based]] [[user interface]].

The software itself is a collection of [[JavaServer Pages]] and [[Java Servlets]] that provide a web interface, as part of an [[N-tier]] architecture: a [[relational database]] ([[Microsoft SQL Server]], [[IBM DB2]] or [[Oracle database]]), [[Java EE]] [[servlet container]] ([[Apache Tomcat]], [[IBM]] [[WebSphere]], [[BEA Weblogic]] or [[Oracle Application Server]]), and the [[Essbase]] server itself make up a full installation of the product.

The '''[[ibm.com|IBM]] Center for The Business of Government''' produces and disseminates thought leadership that focuses on public management issues facing government executives at all levels. According to its mission statement, the center seeks to connect public management research to practice in order to improve government effectiveness and performance. It does this by funding independent third-party research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelman|first=Steve|title=How IBM supports academic research on the business of government|url=http://fcw.com/blogs/lectern/2012/06/chenok-ibm-center.aspx|publisher=FCW The Business of Federal Technology|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing a bi-annual magazine, producing a weekly radio interview program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Business of Government Hour|url=http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?nid=159|publisher=FederalNewsRadio.com|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; convening discussions with practitioners and academics, and hosting forums and various blogs and other online content.

==History==
The center was originally formed in 1998 as the [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] Endowment for The Business of Government. When IBM acquired the management consulting arm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers in 2002, it was renamed. The center is led by Executive Director Dan Chenok,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigelt|first=Matthew|title=Dan Chenok to take reins at IBM think tank|url=http://fcw.com/articles/2012/06/04/chenok-breul-ibm.aspx|publisher=FCW The Business of Federal Technology|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former career federal executive for information policy and technology at the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB).

The IBM Center for The Business of Government is one of several dozen [[good government]] organizations located in Washington, D.C. that provide context and offer insights and practical, actionable recommendations that address federal government mission and management challenges.

== Research and publications ==
The IBM center includes in its name “Business of Government” to emphasize its focus on the management and operation—not the policies—of government. It seeks to “bridge the gap” between research and practice by helping to stimulate and accelerate the production of actionable research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Public Administration, Research and Theory|volume=21|issue=suppl1|pages=i99-i112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Unlike traditional scholarly outlets, the IBM Center makes explicitly clear that its reports are to be ‘written for government executives and managers’ and that in making the decision to fund research proposals, it looks for very practical findings and recommendations—not just theory and concepts—in order to assist executives and managers to more effectively respond to mission and management challenges."
&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Public Administration, Research and Theory, Volume 21, Issue (suppl 1) pp. i99-i112&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the IBM Center for The Business of Government has published more than 250 research reports and books in areas such as public sector management and performance, technology and innovation, security and privacy, acquisition and procurement, and citizen engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hardy|first=Michael|title=The Chenok era dawns at IBM center|url=http://fcw.com/articles/2012/06/30/buzz-chenok-breul.aspx|publisher=FCW The Business of Federal Technology|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports are commissioned through a competitive funding process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM Center for The Business of Government - Research Stipends Synopsis:|url=https://researchfunding.duke.edu/detail.asp?OppID=5127|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall. Funded researchers have included academics from top schools of public management and business, including Harvard University, the London School of Economics, Syracuse University and Johns Hopkins University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6684">'''Ian Lenagan''' (born 1946, Scholes, [[Wigan]]) is a business entrepreneur, theatre producer and shareholder of [[London Broncos]], chairman and owner of [[Wigan Warriors]], and former owner of [[Oxford United F.C.]] In 2016 he was appointed Chairman of the [[Football League]].

==Early life==

Born in Scholes, Wigan, Lenagan attended St Patrick's Primary School as a child and gained an appreciation for [[rugby league]], playing for the local amateur club also named St Patrick's.

He was educated at West Park Grammar School in St Helens before eventually moving onto university. Lenagan attended both [[Manchester University|Manchester]] and [[Liverpool University|Liverpool]] universities and graduated with a [[BSc]] in [[Mathematics]] and a [[MSc]] in [[Magnetohydrodynamics]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Factfile - Ian Lenagan"&gt;{{cite news

==Career==
=== Workplace Systems ===
In 1985 Lenagan set up his own business, Workplace Systems, in [[Milton Keynes]], to develop and supply [[software]] products for workforce management. Following its first successful contract with [[Asda]], the business became very successful and expanded abroad to places across Europe, Australasia, the US and the Middle East. Major retailers known to use Workplace Systems include [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]], [[Focus (DIY)|Focus]], [[Sports Café]], [[Next (clothing)|Next]] and [[Morrisons]]. With the success of Workplace Systems, the company was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 2000 under the name Telework Systems PLC to incorporate another company founded by Lenagan in 1981, TeleWare, which focused on the telephony software products market.

A decline in the telephone market saw TeleWare sold off to its management in 2003 and the company change its name to WorkPlace Systems International plc, 49% owned by Ian Lenagan.&lt;ref name="Company Profile - Workplace International PLC"&gt;{{cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, Workplace Systems was acquired by a Lloyds Banking Group-backed management buyout, and Lenagan stepped down from his role as chairman, receiving £19m from the buyout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/boss-of-workplace-systems-bags-19-million-from-buyout-6377110.html |title=Boss of WorkPlace Systems bags £19 million from buyout |newspaper=Evening Standard |location=London |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre producer ===
Lenagan is also a successful theatre producer, with over 30 productions to his name. His most recent [[West End Theatre|West End]] hit is a co-production of ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' starring [[Christian Slater]].

=== Rugby league and football clubs ===
Lenagan is a huge [[rugby league]] fan. His successful business ventures have allowed him to become involved in the sport and in July 2005 he took over as chairman and majority shareholder of [[London Broncos#2006–2011: Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]], buying 65% of the shares and also taking a place on the board of directors. He also became a major shareholder in [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], who were controlled by long-time friend [[Nick Merry]]. In July 2012 he replaced Kelvin Thomas as chairman of the League Two club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18826760 |title=Oxford United chairman Kelvin Thomas to leave role |date=13 July 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenagan sold his interest in Oxford United and left the board in 2016 when he was appointed Chairman of the Football League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oufc.co.uk//news/article/oxford-united-board-3135474.aspx |title=Darryl Increases Shareholding as Ian Lenagan Moves On |publisher=Oxford United F.C. |date=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 it was announced after months of speculation that Lenagan would become the new owner of [[Wigan Warriors]] rugby league club, his boyhood team. Lenagan bought the club from former [[JJB Sports]] magnate and [[Wigan Athletic]] chairman [[Dave Whelan]]. As well as buying the club Lenagan also bought the training facilities at [[Edge Hall Road]], the former stadium of [[Orrell R.U.F.C.]] as well as a 50-year lease on the [[JJB Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Warriors Look to Future Under New Ownership"&gt;{{cite news

A '''line''' is a concept in western comic books which denotes a specific couple of publications by a publisher. Sometimes taking place in a separate continuity or more loose continuity (such as [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] by [[DC Comics]]) or exploring a kind of subject matter and or genre which the publisher does not want to involve in their main franchise or so called "universe".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-dark-matter-line-details/&lt;/ref&gt; Often lines which explore more "realistic" or "dark" subject matters are published under a companies sub [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s (such as [[Ultimate Marvel]] or [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] by [[Marvel Comics]]) to distinguish it from their main superhero lines. Sometimes a line can be published under an imprint but not always be part of a larger continuity within their imprint (such as [[The Punisher (MAX line)|''The Punisher'' MAX line]] which is not in continuity with most other Marvel Max titles). A line can consist of several different titles, ongoing series, limited series, one-shots, annuals, specials or trades and be by many different artists but are [[advertised]] and [[marketed]] as part of the line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howtolovecomics.com/2016/10/25/resurrxion/&lt;/ref&gt; So called crossover events are often followed by a line of tie-in comics to the event miniseries from other unrelated titles to connect them. 

[[Dark Horse Comics]] has several lines which focuses on their licensed film properties such as ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. The [[Aliens (Dark Horse Comics line)|''Aliens'' line]] consists only of limited series, one-shots and graphic novels due to the publishers wish to allow artistic freedom. Dark Horse's [[Star Wars (Dark Horse Comics line)|''Star Wars'' line]] was ended in 2014 due to Disney moving their [[Star Wars comics|''Star Wars'' comics]] to Marvel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsarama.com/21137-dark-horse-s-star-wars-line-to-end-august-2014.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://gizmodo.com/the-greatest-dark-horse-star-wars-comics-to-buy-before-1670419639&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Horse also publishes a line of comics which are creator owned but are connected through common oversight by editor [[Karen Berger]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darkhorse.com/Blog/2471/dark-horse-comics-announces-line-comics-and-graphi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/dc-entertainment/263977/dark-matter-is-dcs-new-artist-centric-comic-book-line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/books/2017/04/20/dc-comics-superstars-unite-for-new-dark-matter-line/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsarama.com/23460-dc-comics-new-line-a-first-glance.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/movies-tv/news/a30291/dc-comics-launching-comic-book-line-for-girls/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbr.com/dc-announces-full-rebirth-line-twice-monthly-books-lowered-price-point/&lt;/ref&gt; Most companies have several simultaneously running lines.&lt;ref&gt;http://io9.gizmodo.com/5811314/what-you-need-to-know-about-that-huge-dc-comics-relaunch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/comics/article/58710-dark-horse-originals-line-bends-the-rules.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/11/marvel-augmented-reality/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/11/escape-claws-why-wolverine-had-to-die-for-the-sake-of-marvel-comics/382291/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsarama.com/15662-leaving-an-imprint-10-defunct-marvel-publishing-lines.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léon L. Gallet''' (1832–1899), watchmaker, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and past family patriarch of the [[Gallet &amp; Co.|Gallet Watch Company]] of Switzerland,&lt;ref name=GGhist&gt;"Gallet Watch Company History" [http://www.galletwatch.com/new_yesterday.html Gallet-hist]&lt;/ref&gt; is considered as one of the primary architects and founders of the 19th century industrialization of the Swiss watchmaking industry.

==Life==
The son of Julien Gallet (1806–1849), who moved the family watchmaking business from Geneva, Switzerland, to the manufacturing district of La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1826, Léon L. Gallet was responsible for the creation of numerous Swiss and American watch brands.&lt;ref&gt;Jewelers' Circular Keystone, May 17, 1899, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the prestigious Fabrique Electa, which became the upscale line of the jewelry department at Macy’s Department store in New York City during the first quarter of the 20th century. Léon L. Gallet also established the brands National Park, Continental Watch Company, Jerome Park, Bridgeport, Eureka, Commodore, Union Square, and Lady Racine.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen H. Pritchard, Swiss Timepiece Makers 1775-1975, (2 Bände), West Kennebunk 1997&lt;/ref&gt; While the appearance and function of many of Gallet’s timepieces were tailored to the tastes of the American consumers, all of the movements in these watches were manufactured in Switzerland.

Léon Gallet played a philanthropic role in the business, cultural, and social life of his native home. As well as his prominent position as a member of both the legislature of Neuchâtel and the Council of La Chaux-de-Fonds, he was for many years, the president of the Société des Amis des Arts (Fine Arts Society) and Grand Master of the Free Masons. Together with Louis &amp; Jules Courvoisier, Ernest Francillon of Longines, and Constant Girard-Perregaux, Léon Gallet founded the Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society for the Industries of the Jura Area) in 1876. The purpose of this organization was to assist in the promotion and distribution of products from Switzerland's Watch Valley while addressing the growing threat of competition in European markets from American watch manufacturers.

Upon his death in 1899, Léon Gallet bequeathed a sum of 43,000 Swiss Francs (today equivalent to 1,000,000 Swiss Francs or approx. 1,000,000 US dollars) to his hometown of La Chaux-de-Fonds, of which 25,000 Swiss Francs were earmarked to build the [[Musée International d'Horlogerie]] (International Watch Making Museum).&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, Catherine; Piquet, Jean-Michel (2002), Musée International d'Horlogerie, Catalogue of Selected Pieces, Switzerland: Institut l'homme et le temps, {{ISBN|2-940088-10-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Donated by Léon Gallet’s son Georges, the museum’s collection was started with a body of over 100 of Gallet's most complicated and valuable timepieces, including the world's first wristwatch produced for mass consumption in 1892. The balance of the bequeathed funds was used to construct the Musée des beaux-arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds (Beaux Arts Museum of La-Chaux-de-Fonds), designed by renowned painter [[Charles l’Eplattenier]] and architect René Chapallaz, [[Le Corbusier]]'s architecture teacher.

Prior to his passing, Léon Gallet commissioned René Chapallaz, to design "Villa Gallet". Situated in "Parc Gallet" in the southern part of La Chaux-de-Fonds, "Villa Gallet" still retains its original name and is considered as an important historic contribution to the Swiss [[Art Nouveau]] movement of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;L'Inventaire Suisse d'Architecture: 1850-1920, Volume 3, Bienne, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Coire, Davos.

== Léon L. Gallet &amp; The Industrialization of the Swiss Watch Industry ==

Any study of the 19th century industrialization of [[Switzerland]]’s “Watch Valley” is not complete without mentioning the role of watchmaker and entrepreneur, Léon L. Gallet.

In the years following [[American Civil War|America’s Civil War]], a powerful shift of that country’s concentration moved from agriculture to industry. With this shift came great advancements in manufacturing as centrally located factories replaced small workshops, and large scale production of items with interchangeable parts quickly displaced less efficient hand-crafting. An immediate beneficiary of this progress was America’s watch and clock industry, as northern coal powered factories began turning out hundreds of high quality timepieces per day. On the horizon for these newly empowered companies was the inevitable expansion beyond domestic borders to embark in direct competition with the Swiss watchmaking industry.

Léon L. Gallet and [[Ernest Francillon]] of [[Longines]], two Swiss watchmakers who were actively selling their wares in North America, saw the writing on the wall. Recognizing the only way that the small workshops of Switzerland’s “[[Watch Valley]]” could compete against the growing threat posed by larger American manufacturers was to unite. At the prompting of Gallet and Francillon, a new organization was created. The Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society of the [[Jura Mountains|Jura Industries]]) was formed to bring together the individual strengths of the region’s numerous independent watchmaking houses as a powerful cooperative entity.

Yet, in spite of the formation of this new organization, the warnings of Gallet and Francillon were met with skepticism by the other members of the group. Decades of success as the world’s primary supplier of fine timepieces had resulted in a self-assured complacency within [[Switzerland]]’s watchmaking industry.

Then on the 10th of May, 1876, the great [[Centennial Exposition|Philadelphia International Exhibition]], created to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of [[United States Declaration of Independence|America’s Declaration of Independence]], opened to the public. Among the many displays was the indisputable evidence of the manufacturing superiority of such American companies as [[Waltham Watch Company|Waltham]] and [[Elgin National Watch Company|Elgin]], each capable of finishing many hundred watches per day.

Jacques David, Swiss watchmaker and machine designer, was dispatched to America by Ernest Francillon to witness the exhibitions first-hand, and report his findings back to the Intercanonal Society. Léon L. Gallet followed shortly behind, arriving in [[Philadelphia]] the next month. What both men witnessed at the exhibition further confirmed the concerns of Gallet and Francillon.

On his return to Switzerland in November, Jacques David wrote a long detailed report on the mens' findings to the Intercantonal Society of the Jura Industries. While David’s report helped to wake the Swiss watchmaking industry from its comfortable complacency, increased revenues were needed for the Society’s members to initiate the developments required to meet these new challenges.

By the time that the Philadelphia Exposition opened to the public in 1876, Léon L. Gallet had already established sales offices in both [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]], going back over ten years. He had personally suffered a number of long ocean voyages to deliver his wares and to conduct business. Besides his acute knowledge of the growing threat posed by worldwide competition from US manufactures, Gallet understood the tastes of the American consumer and the opportunities the new world also held for the Jura watchmakers.

With the now available joint resources from fellow manufacturing members of the Intercantonal Society, Gallet decided to take the competitive battle directly to the enemy. Not only could the rapidly expanding base of American consumers provide opportunities for increased sales of Swiss watches, these sales could provide the needed revenues to meet the expected competitive challenges in Europe.

Utilizing his own movements, as well as components by such friends as Auguste [[Agassiz family|Agassiz]], Ernest Francillon, Constant [[Girard-Perregaux]], Jules Jeanneret, and Louis and Jules Courvoisier, Gallet began production of 30 new watch brands, most designed specifically to appeal to the taste of the America consumer.

Within a short period, exports of Swiss watches to America rapidly increased, greatly expanding the reach of watchmakers whose previous market was limited only to the local economies. As a result, Leon L. Gallet’s American marketing activities helped to provide the needed capital for the watchmakers of the Jura region to industrialize, and successfully meet one of the greatest challenges in Swiss timekeeping’s history.

The son of Abraham Bleustein, a Russian-Jewish furniture salesman in northern Paris, Marcel Bleustein left school at the age of 14 to help out in the family furniture business. He founded Publicis in 1926 in a small apartment above a butcher's shop. In 1935, he purchased Radio LL from the radio manufacturer [[Lucien Lévy]].
He renamed it Radio Cité, and introduced France's first news broadcasts as well as its first radio jingles. Radio Cité also helped launch singer [[Édith Piaf]].

In 1939, Marcel Bleustein married Sophie Vaillant, an English teacher who was the granddaughter of [[Edouard Vaillant]], a well-known 19th century Socialist politician. They had three daughters, including [[Elisabeth Badinter]], a prominent feminist writer and philosopher who chairs the supervisory board of Publicis Groupe. When the Second World War broke out, Marcel Bleustein's companies were confiscated by the German occupation forces as "Jewish properties". He joined the Resistance, took the code-name Blanchet, and was detached to serve as a co-pilot for the US [[Eighth Air Force]], flying bombing missions over France and Holland. When the war ended, he rebuilt Publicis from scratch, introducing the first opinion polls in France and developing the then-American fields of consumer research and brand analysis. [http://2.262.00515.X]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} He retained his Resistance name of Blanchet, adding it legally to his original name. After the war, Mr. Bleustein-Blanchet reopened Publicis and, calling them on the phone himself, rapidly regained old and new clients, notably Shell, Colgate-Palmolive, L'oreal, Renault, Dim and many others. In 1957 he opened the first "Publicis Drugstore" on the ground level of Publicis' headquarters, 133 avenue des Champs Elysées, former location of the Astoria hotel. The "Drugstore" was a huge success and immediately became the rendez vous point of the cool parisian youth. 
 
During the 1970s, under the leadership of Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet and his successor, [[Maurice Lévy (Publicis)|Maurice Lévy]], Publicis became an international communications group and is now the third largest communications group in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adage.com/article/global-news/publicis-quarter-organic-revenue-growth-7-1/145176/ Publicis' Second-Quarter Organic Revenue Growth Is 7.1%]. ''Advertising Age'' (29 July 2010). Retrieved 17 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, twelve years after his death, the [[American Advertising Federation]] announced that Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet would become the first non-American to be named to the [[Advertising Hall of Fame]].

In 2013, he received the ''Thinkers50 Innovation Award'' — given to a management thinker who is re-shaping the way we think about and practice innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkers50.com/t50-awards/awards-2013/ |title=Distinguished Achievement Awards 2013 |work=Thinkers 50 |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gallery.mailchimp.com/dec9e7dbfe150d92bafee193e/files/innovation_PRESS_RELEASE3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Navi Radjou Wins 2013 Thinkers50 Innovation Award |date=14 November 2013 |publisher=Gallery.mailchimp.com |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, his book Jugaad Innovation was shortlisted for the ''2013 Thinkers50 CK Prahalad Breakthrough Idea Award''.

Named by ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' as an "expert in corporate innovation," he was also honoured by the ''[[Financial Times]]'', which called his co-authored work on National Innovation Networks – the first-ever ranking of countries by their collaborative aptitude to integrate innovation capabilities across multiple regions – as "ambitious" and "sophisticated".&lt;ref&gt;Countries and companies need to band together in networks, ''[[Financial Times]]'', 24 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His latest research on "polycentric innovation" – a new approach that multinationals can use to integrate globally distributed R&amp;D and innovation capabilities – has been featured in ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''Global Intelligence for the CIO'', and ''[[Le Monde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725141517/http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation |archivedate=25 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, his concept of "[[indovation]]" — the unique process by which innovations are developed in India to serve a large number of people sustainably — has been featured in ''[[The Financial Times]]'' and in several conferences organised by Asia Society.&lt;ref&gt;The Age of 'Indovation' Dawns, James Lamont, 14 June 2010, ''[[The Financial Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Radjou and his co-authors’ work on jugaad (innovation) has been criticized by Indian academics and scientists such as Rishikesha Krishnan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-why-india-needs-to-move-beyond-jugaad/20110207.htm|title=Why India needs to move beyond jugaad, Rediff.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vijay Govindarajan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/interviews/vijay-govindarajan-innovation-interview/story/191907.html|title=Jugaad not the answer to India's problems: Vijay Govindarajan, Business Today|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anil Kumar Gupta|Anil Gupta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4170842/This_is_not_Jugaad|title=This is not Jugaad|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Raghunath Anant Mashelkar|RA Mashelkar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/jugaad-has-created-the-wrong-image-for-india-raghunath-anant-mashelkar-veteran-scientist/articleshow/33297319.cms|title=Jugaad has created the wrong image for India: Raghunath Anant Mashelkar, Veteran scientist, Economic Times.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who believe the practice of jugaad can lead only to makeshift solutions that are unsafe, unscalable, and unsustainable.

Radjou addressed this criticism in an article in ''Thinkers'' magazine arguing that jugaad isn’t intrinsically good or bad. Jugaad is a creative mindset: it is the ''intention'' (good or bad) of the person using this ingenious mindset that determines the quality of the outcome (positive or negative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thinkers.in/jugaad-innovation-converting-adversity-into-opportunity-2/|title=Jugaad Innovation: Converting Adversity Into Opportunity, Thinkers magazine.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4068">'''William Edward "Ned" Herrmann''' (1922 – December 24, 1999) was an American creativity researcher and author, known for his [[research]] in [[creative thinking]]&lt;ref name="NH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbdi.com/ned_herrmann.htm |title=Ned Herrmann (1922-1999): Pioneer of creative thinking in the corporation and founder of Whole Brain Technology |accessdate=2006-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306232953/http://www.hbdi.com/ned_herrmann.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2005 |df= }}. at ''hbdi.com'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and whole-brain methods. He is considered the "father of brain dominance technology."&lt;ref&gt;Lumsdaine, Edward, and Monika Lumsdaine. "Creative problem solving." ''Potentials, IEEE'' 13.5 (1994): 4-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Crandall (1999) ''Celebrate Customer Service.'' p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
At [[Cornell University]], Herrmann majored in both [[physics]] and [[music]] in the Class of 1943. He continued to study at the Graduate Studies R.P.I., New York University.&lt;ref name="NH"/&gt;

After graduation Hermann became manager of [[Management Education]] for [[General Electric]] (GE) in 1970. His primary responsibility was to oversee training program design; specifically, maintaining or increasing an individual's [[productivity]], [[motivation]], and [[creativity]].

In 1978, Herrmann created the "Herrmann Participant Survey Form."  He profiled workshop participant's thinking styles and learning preferences in accord with brain dominance theory.  This quickly evolved into a theory of stable brain quadrants, independent of brain anatomy facts, each with its own characteristic “genius.”  He developed the [[Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument]] (HBDI), the scored and analyzed Participant Survey, and designed the [[Applied Creative Thinking Workshop]] (ACT), which remains a leading personality assessment instrument and workshop topic in corporate training.

Herrmann's contributions brought him worldwide recognition. In 1992, he received the Distinguished Contribution to Human Resource Development Award from the [[American Society for Training &amp; Development]] (ASTD). In 1993, he was elected [[President (corporate title)|President]] of The American Creativity Association.

== Work ==
Herrmann was a pioneer in exploring, explicating and expanding understanding of the brain in close-up view as a four quadrant system. He was one of the first to ascertain, through testing, how individuals use or prefer one, two, three or all four possible brain quadrants.  His approach to brain balance was to encourage experiments, use and exercise of weaker quadrants through live, in-person games, small group processes and discussion.  This evolved into more and better ideas about whole-brainedness.

He spent 30 years from approximately 1964-1996, exploring and explicating [[Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument]] to [[teaching]], [[learning]], increased self-understanding and enhanced creative thinking capabilities, on both an individual and corporate level.

== Business career ==
After receiving higher education Oleksandr Tretyakov starts own business. From 1995 to 2002 he was the president of ATEK-95, one of the major oil trading companies in Ukraine. Oleksandr Tretyakov’s business interests also include real estate and media.

In 2006 Oleksandr founded Glavred Media, a media holding which included the most influential Ukrainian information agency UNIAN, Glavred magazine and website, Profile and Telecity magazines, Nova and Izvestiya v Ukraine (eng. News in Ukraine) newspapers, Telekritika (eng. Telecritics) website, and City TV channel. Ihor Kolomoyskyi, one of the top Ukrainian businessmen and a co-owner of Privat Group, becomes Oleksandr’s business partner in the media holding. The establishment of the holding was officially announced in August 2007. At the beginning of 2010, after Viktor Yanukovych won the presidential election, Tretiakov sells all his media assets.

== Political career ==
In 2002 Oleksandr entered politics and became actively engaged with it. He was elected a Member of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine from the People's Movement of Ukraine (Narodnyi Rukh Ukrajiny) of "Nasha Ukrayina" ("Our Ukraine") faction (number 41 on the party list). He was a member of the People's Movement of Ukraine.

Oleksandr Tretyakov becomes one of the closest confidants to the opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko, and for a long time he was in the inner circle of the future President and subsequently the Head of the State. He was also one of financial sponsors of Our Ukraine opposition faction.

In the summer of 2004, when the election campaign headquarters of the presidential candidate Yushchenko is formed, Tretiakov is appointed deputy head of the headquarters, managing organizational and financial issues. During the Orange Revolution he was a member of the Committee of National Salvation. Many media sources have mentioned the politician as one of the sponsors of the Orange Revolution.

In the autumn of 2004, after poisoning of presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko, he accompanied Yushchenko during his medical treatment in Austria. From September 2004 to the very day of inauguration in January 2005, Viktor Yushchenko and his family lived in Oleksandr Tretyakov’s house because of security concerns.

After inauguration, on 27 January 2005 by one of his first decrees the newly elected President Viktor Yushchenko appoints Oleksandr Tretyakov as his First Assistant – Head of the Cabinet of the President of Ukraine. Tretyakov holds this office until December 2005, during this period introduces the structural reform of the Presidential Secretariat.
In March 2005 he becomes one of the founders of Our Ukraine political party, he was actively engaged in party building, being responsible for party organization, media and financial issues. The politician believed that the Yushchenko – Tymoshenko ‘orange team’ should run for the 2006 parliamentary election as a single bloc.

In 2005-2006 Tretyakov was a member of the supervisory board of Ukrnafta, Oschadbank, and Ukrtelecom.

In September 2005, during political crisis in Ukraine that broke out after public accusations of President Yushchenko’s closest aides in corruption, Tretyakov asked the President to suspend him from his position for the time of investigation. At the same time Victor Yushchenko dismissed the Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and the entire government, as also the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Petro Poroshenko. In September 2005 the President eliminated the office of the First Assistant to the President, announcing it during his speech at the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the day of voting on Yurii Yekhanurov’s appointment as the Prime Minister of Ukraine.

Later, in September–October 2005 an interdepartmental inquiry panel announced that no evidence proving the claims of corruption and no instances of abuse of power were found; in autumn 2005 and March 2006, two interim inquiry panels of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine have also confirmed that the accusations were groundless.

Tretyakov won lawsuits in courts of all instances, seeking protection of honor and dignity (on 25 November 2005 Pechersk District Court of Kyiv found groundless all corruption charges brought against him. On 10 July 2006 Kyiv Court of Appeal upheld this judgement).

In December 2005 Tretyakov became an external Presidential Adviser, holding this position until October 2006 when he resigned due to disagreement with the personnel policies of the President. 

In March 2006 the politician was elected to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of the 5th convocation (number 41 on the party list). In the spring of 2007 as part of a group consisting of 150 deputies wrote a letter of request for early resignation, which allowed President Yushchenko to dissolve the parliament and appoint early election of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

At the early parliamentary elections in October 2007 Oleksandr Tretyakov for the third time became a Member of Parliament from Our Ukraine - "Narodna Samooborona"'s (People's Self-Defense Bloc party) list, running from "Nasha Ukrayina" ("Our Ukraine" party) (number 56 on the list).

During his term at the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of the 6th convocation he held the office of Deputy Head of Our Ukraine - People's Self-Defense (OU-PSD) faction and the First Deputy Chairman of the Committee for Transport and Communication.

Tretyakov is a strong supporter of the democratic coalition and one of the key lobbyists of formation of the OU-PSD – YTB (Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc) coalition in December 2007 and the OU-PSD – YTB – Lytvyn Bloc in November 2008.

During his term at the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of the 4th, 5th, and 6th convocations he participated in creation of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania, and served as the Assembly’s Co-chairman from Ukraine.

In February 2010, on the eve of the second round of the presidential election, Tretyakov severed himself from "Our Ukraine" in protest against the introduction of amendments to the Law on Election of the President of Ukraine, when the election commission formation rules were changed just a few days before the voting day, thus creating conditions for election fraud. At that time, some MPs from Our Ukraine party of the OU-PSD faction have voted, along with the Party of Regions, for the amended law and President Yushchenko signed it.

After Viktor Yanukovych won presidential election Oleksandr Tretiakov went into opposition.

== Political career after 2012==

At the parliamentary elections in 2012 he ran as a non-party self-nominee in the people's deputies of Ukraine in the Kyiv district (Svyatoshinsky district). According to the voting results, he took the 2nd place losing to the candidate from the "Batkivschyna"("Fatherland") party Volodymyr Ariev.&lt;ref name="KPresultsUKPE201291112"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/results-of-the-vote-count-continuously-updated-315153.html Results of the vote count], [[Kyiv Post]] (9 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013-2014, he actively supported Evromaydan, bought some 500 bullet-proof vests, thousands of bags for barricade construction, tents, sleeping bags, clothes, etc. The Tretyakov's office in Podol hosted protesters for heating and overnight stay, activists from the Right Sector, militiamen from Lviv region and other activists. Since the beginning of the war in Donbass has bought ammunition for volunteer battalions in the power operation zone, provided financial support to families of participants in the power operation from Svyatoshinsky district of Kyiv.

In the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 parliamentary election]] Tretyakov was again re-elected after again winning single-member districts number 219 in Kyiv; this time as a [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://vibori2014.rbc.ua/ukr/okrug/kiev/odnomandatny-219 Candidates and winner for the seat in constituency 219 in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election], [[RBK Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Verkhovna Rada of the 8th convocation he heads the Committee on veterans, combatants, participants in the anti-terrorist operation and people with disabilities. In his first legislative initiatives, he raised issues of ensuring adequate social protection for participants in the power operation in Donbass, volunteers, members of volunteer formations, the provision of appropriate statuses for combatants, participants in the war, war invalids The Committee recommended the adoption of the Law on Amendments to the Law of Ukraine "On the Status of War Veterans, the Guarantees for their Social Protection," which defined the separate status of "The Affected Participant of the Dignity Revolution", and regulated the benefits and guarantees for their social protection. This law was signed by the President of Ukraine on November 21 (посмотрите в тексте: 21 ноября какого года? Там не понятно).

He supports the creation of the Ministry of Veterans Affairs in Ukraine similar to the existing departments in the US, Canada, Australia, Croatia and other countries: "We need to urgently develop an effective mechanism for the implementation of social protection in this area and create a government body that will be responsible for the effective implementation of state strategy for the social protection of veterans", Tretyakov said.

In 2017, the electronic declaration of Olexandr Tretyakov for 2015/2016, one of the first among the people's deputies was fully tested in the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption. During the check no violations were revealed.

Olexandr Tretyakov publishes reports on his work in the parliament on the regular basis.

In January 2018, the public network Opora included Alexander Tretyakov in the top three most effective Committee Heads of the Verkhovna Rada. Tretyakov has the highest indicator of legislative efficiency: 22 adopted bills out of 62 initiated.

== Political Views ==
A supporter of Ukraine's European integration, he called a mistake the rejection of the Euro-Atlantic integration (at the 2008 Summit in Bucharest, Ukraine was not added to the NATO Membership Action Plan, and in 2010, after Viktor Yanukovych came to power, the Verkhovna Rada voted to exclude Ukraine's integration into the Euro-Atlantic security space from the national priority interests). He is confident that Ukraine's accession to NATO will ensure the country's security, its independence and sovereignty.
He opposed the participation of Viktor Yushchenko in the 2010 presidential election. According to Tretyakov, Yushchenko's main mission in 2010 was to hold fair elections, but the democratic camp was supposed to be represented by a single high-rated candidate, and it was Yulia Tymoshenko at that period of time.
Harshly criticizing any manifestations of separatism he stands for a single conciliar Ukraine.
He is a supporter of power decentralization, provision of local councils with broad powers and limiting the amount of revenues from the regional budgets to the central treasury.

The title covers the time of the 1920s - the [[Roaring Twenties]] - at the time of the [[Prohibition in the United States]]. The game's story takes place in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]] where, due to the ban of any alcohol in this era, Mafia organizations were able to become powerful off the back of the illegal [[speakeasy]]s.

In a time where criminal [[gang]]s rule the city and a handful of morally-questionable men were able to succeed through illegal gambling, high-strength spirits and shady machinations, the player's storyline takes place as the main character creates his empire in this melting pot of illegality. Boss D'Angelo is an immigrant who was born in a small village in [[Sicily]] and has just arrived in [[Atlantic City]]. He has to work his way up the ladder through the [[Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven|Mafia]]-like world. Working his way up from nothing, He must establish himself in the criminal underworld by buying and raiding businesses and attacking rivals, all the while simultaneously fulfilling his version of the [[American dream]].

==Story==

Arriving at Atlantic City, Boss D'Angelo begins his foothold on the criminal empire as he makes money off the prohibition and gambling trade. Sending money back to his brother, he keeps his status as a mob boss secret from him as he works for Louie, a Capo under the eye of Danny Corsini, the leader of the Mafia in Atlantic City. His enemies ranges from independent gangsters to the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which is at bitter odds with the growing immigration problem. Eventually tired of working for Louie, he was sent to perform one last job which was revealed to be a trap, as Danny Corsini was the intended target. The Boss thwarts the assassination and becomes a Capo under Corsini.

Expanding his criminal empire eventually allows his brother to come to Atlantic City but not as a brother in crime an [[FBI]] Agent in New York. When the Boss' attempts to set up a source of income through the gambling/nightclub trade draw suspicion to him, Danny Corsini attempts to defend him killing his brother. Forced to turn on Corsini, the Boss emerges victorious. Knowing that his position is fragile, he attempts to unite the Jewish Gangs and Irish Mob in an alliance only for it to be attacked by the KKK. With the D'Angelo mob as the sole survivor of the struggle, the Boss is named Capo de Tutti. He later earns money through real estate and by supporting Mr. Smith as mayor which gives him great influence in the city, upon reaching Michigan Ave his brother offers one last chance for the Boss to come clean, the Boss rejects the idea of selling his men out and eliminates the witnesses who planned to rat out the boss. The Boss came out clean and triumphant and made amends with his brother and owns a private island which he calls Nova Sicilia and his brother left the agency to pursue his dream of being a shipwright and vowed to never speak of their days in the prohibition again.

'''The Japanese Incentive'''

Somewhere in between the meeting of his brother and the death of Louie Castaneda, Boss D'Angelo receives a lucrative offer from a Japanese Yakuza Hikaro Eda and Fritz, a backer who wanted to help Eda exert his influence into America as laws back then prohibited Asians from owning property. There he meets the beautiful Mikoto Mori, the trophy wife of the Yakuza boss. Little did the boss know, she has a personal vendetta against Hikaro and the Boss now is caught in between love for the woman and the wrath of a powerful man.

The story begins with Karl Fritz who approaches the Boss with a deal from Hikaro Eda, an influential Japanese man who had him muscle into McGyure Clan's turf and quickly proves his worth to Hikaro and was tasked with a smuggling job from him. Upon preventing the McGyure Clan from destroying the cargo did he realize what was he smuggling, his wife Kumiko Mori. Angered by the McGyure's attempt at murdering her he personally wipes out the clan and earns a promising alliance with the Yakuza. When Hikaro and his men were attacked at a Cherry Blossom festival by members of the Ku Klux Klan did Hikaro sent him to find who tried to kill him and the Boss learned that Hikaro's own wife was the culprit. Sickened by this senseless conflict he tries to run off with her in an attempt to escape from the criminal underworld only to be dragged down by Hikaro when he tries to kill them both. Then she reveals her past, her family's lands was taken away by Eda and her sister was killed by Hikaro and she was forced to become the bride and assassin of Hikaro. They both work together to take down Eda and eventually have feelings for one another but the heist on Eda's personal assets goes awry when Mikoto goes off to try and kill Eda only to die in the process, in a fit of rage the Boss personally attacks Eda and gets his revenge for Mikoto as he bitterly says that she was the first and last woman he had ever truly loved.

=== Trivia ===
Omerta, the game's title, refers to the infamous [[honor code]] called ''"[[Omertà]]"'', a ''"[[Code of silence]]"'' which binds members of the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] or similar criminal organizations to professional discretion against any third parties.

Upon the official retail-release of the boxed- and digital distributed version, the game was also simultaneously released on [[GOG.com]] without any [[copy-protection]], nor other [[digital rights management]] restrictions.&lt;ref name="GOG.com"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[GOG.com|GoG.com]] |title='Omerta - City of Gangsters' on ''Good Old Games''|url=http://www.gog.com/gamecard/omerta_city_of_gangsters |date=2013-01-31 |access-date=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Beginning with small deals, the player gradually expands his criminal career, eventually advancing highly enough to establish his own business. The player can purchase untenanted shops, buildings and structures to establish his own bar, brewery or distillery. The player can also buy out an opposing ''speakeasy''. A more legal way for generating income is buying apartments to obtain leasing. Warehouses can be acquired to extend storage.

As the game progresses, the character can recruit companions, create his own gang, and conquer the territories of rival gangsters. Characters provide specific [[Role-playing game system|role-playing elements]] based on their individual characteristics and equipment. In these [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]] confrontations, the player expands his influence by using henchmen to drive other godfathers out of business, to ultimately reign supreme as the unchallenged patron of Atlantic City.&lt;ref name="Kalypso-Announce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=13774 |title=Guns, Money, Honor - Kalypso Unveils "Omerta – City of {{Sic|nolink=y|Gang|ters|expected=Gangsters}}" |last1=Official forum moderator |first1="Melbourne" |date=6 March 2012 |work=Official forum |publisher=[[Kalypso Media]] |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to co-operative and competitive multiplayer game-play, the game offers a [[Open-ended (gameplay)#Sandbox mode|sandbox mode]] to freely explore the game world – six district maps covering ''Atlantic City''.

=== Historical background ===
[[File:Traymore1930.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The renowned Traymore Hotel in Atlantic City, circa 1930]]
The game provides an explorable three-dimensional world which is displayed through a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|Top-down perspective]]. The in-game world represents, according to the publisher Kalypso Media,&lt;ref name="Kalypso-AtlanticCity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=16677 |title=New Images from "Omerta – City of Gangsters" (Buildings)|last1=Official forum moderator |first1="Melbourne" |date=25 September 2012 |work=Official forum |publisher=[[Kalypso Media]] |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an almost accurate and historical correct reproduction of the American city ''Atlantic City'' of this period.

Real vintage buildings and places are present like the [[Traymore Hotel]], the [[Absecon Light]]house, the ''Atlantic City Jail-house'' or the board-walk "Eastern Promenade" as well as streets like ''Illinois Avenue'' or the ''North Carolina Avenue'' which ends at the beach. Beside those real buildings the remaining ones - which are shown in [[Art Deco]] - are very similar to each other and seems to consist only of a few types.

== Licensing of name ==
Kalypso Media licensed the name 'Omerta' from the [[MMORPG]] browser based game of the same name, [[Omerta (video game)|Omerta]].

== Reception ==
[[Metacritic]] aggregated a score of 54 from 100 points for the Windows version.&lt;ref name="Meta-PC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters |title=Omerta: City of Gangsters for PC Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More - Metacritic |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |authorlink=Metacritic |date=31 January 2013 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''PCGamer'' gave the PC-version a rating of 78 out of 100 points, praising the game's mechanics as well as the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] while comparing its combat style elements to [[X-COM]] or [[Jagged Alliance]]. The story is described as too superficial and simple, just depth-less. The atmospheric music, on the other hand, was lauded as a brilliant melange of the [[Jazz]], [[Ragtime]] and [[Klezmer]] music of the period.

{{Quote|'''"Not as tough or as deep as it could be, Omerta is still a destination well worth a visit."'''|Tim Stone|PCGamer.com&lt;ref name="PCGamer-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/omerta-city-of-gangsters-review/ |title=Omerta: City of Gangsters review |last=Stone |first=Tim |date=January 31, 2013 |work=Review |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rating the game at just 30 percent, ''Metro GameCentral'' tested the PC-version as well. Initially intrigued by the promise of a new kind of "made-men" game, the turn-based combat system was ultimately deemed ungainly.

{{Quote|'''"You can see the basis of a good game here but Omerta gets almost everything wrong, from the shallow game-play to the bland, characterless gangster atmosphere."'''|Roger Hargreaves|GameCentral&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Metro.co.uk&lt;ref name="GameCentral-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/02/04/omerta-city-of-gangsters-review-refuse-the-offer-3379811/ |title=Omerta: City Of Gangsters review – refuse the offer |last=Hargreaves |first=Roger |date=February 4, 2013 |work=Review |publisher=GameCentral&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Metro.co.uk |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Hooked Gamer'' gave the PC-version a rating of 8.4 out of 10. It describes the game as "different", and the turn-based combats as short but satisfying.

The '''Pacific Basin Development Council''' is a [[non-profit]] organization that was established in early 1980s by the [[governor]]s of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], and [[Hawaii]].  The Council is concerned with the  economic and social development of the [[Pacific Islands]], and conducts research and implements projects to that end.  The Pacific Basin Development Council is managed by a [[board of directors]].  

==Withdrawal of Hawaii==
In 1996, Governor [[Ben Cayetano]] withdrew Hawaii from the Pacific Basin Development Council as part of state [[budget]] cuts.  At that time, each of the four members of the Council paid [[annual dues]] of $63,000.

'''Prudential regulation''' is type of [[financial regulation]] that requires financial firms to control risks and hold adequate capital as defined by [[capital requirements]].  This is in contrast to consumer protection rules that are also part of financial regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1670460/Prudential-regulation.html |title=Prudential regulation |publisher=This is Money |date=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prudential regulation can be split into [[microprudential regulation]] that focuses on the individual firms and making sure that they can withstand shocks and [[macroprudential regulation]] that looks at the whole financial system and [[systemic risk]].  

Some countries have separated their financial regulators along the lines of prudential/consumer protection such as the UK with the [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]] or in Australia with the [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47807">'''Psychological trauma''' is a type of damage to the [[mind]] that occurs as a result of a distressing event. Trauma is often the result of an overwhelming amount of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] that exceeds one's ability to cope, or integrate the [[emotion]]s involved with that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|title=Trauma Definition|work=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805161505/http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may result from a single distressing experience or recurring events of being overwhelmed that can be precipitated in weeks, years, or even decades as the person struggles to cope with the immediate circumstances, eventually leading to serious, long-term negative consequences.

Because trauma differs between individuals, according to their subjective experiences, people will react to similar traumatic events differently. In other words, not all people who experience a potentially traumatic event will actually become psychologically traumatized. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Storr CL, Ialongo NS, Anthony JC, Breslau N|year=2007|title=Childhood antecedents of exposure to traumatic events and post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=164|issue=1|pages=119–25|pmid=17202553|doi=10.1176/ajp.2007.164.1.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for some people to develop [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]) after being exposed to a major traumatic event.&lt;ref name=":01"&gt;"Among individuals who do develop post-traumatic stress after exposure to a traumatic event, some develop symptoms sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD"

This discrepancy in risk rate can be attributed to [[protective factor]]s some individuals may have that enable them to cope with trauma; they are related to temperamental and environmental factors from among others. Some examples are mild exposure to stress early in life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fenoglio KA, Chen Y, Baram TZ|year=2006|title= Neuroplasticity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis early in life requires recurrent recruitment of stress-regulation brain regions|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=26|issue=9|pages=2434–2442|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4080-05.2006|pmid=16510721|pmc=2408688}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychological resilience|resilience]] characteristics, and active seeking of help.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wingo, Aliza P, Ressler KJ, Bradley B|year=2014|title=Resilience characteristics mitigate tendency for harmful alcohol and illicit drug use in adults with a history of childhood abuse: A cross-sectional study of 2024 inner-city men and women|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=51|pages=93–99|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.01.007|pmid=24485848|pmc=4605671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)]] defines trauma as direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's physical integrity, witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, or injury experienced by a family member or close associate. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the [[in vivo]] environment. The person's response to aversive details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|title=DSM-IV-TR – DSM Library|publisher=|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma can be caused by a wide variety of events, but there are a few common aspects. There is frequently a violation of the person's core assumptions about the world and their [[human rights]], putting the person in a state of extreme [[Mental confusion|confusion]] and insecurity. This is seen when institutions depended upon for survival violate, humiliate, [[Betrayal Trauma|betray]], or cause major losses or separations instead of evoking aspects like positive self worth, safe boundaries and personal freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=DePrince, A.P.|author2=Freyd, J.J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|chapter=The Harm of Trauma: Pathological fear, shattered assumptions, or betrayal?|editor=J.

Parts of the brain in a growing child are developing in a sequential and hierarchical order, from least complex to most complex. The brain's neurons are designed to change in response to the constant external signals and stimulation, receiving and storing new information. This allows the brain to continually respond to its surroundings and promote survival. Our five main sensory signals contribute to the developing brain structure and its function.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perry (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Infants and children begin to create internal representations of their external environment, and in particular, key attachment relationships, shortly after birth. Violent and victimizing attachment figures impact infants' and young children's internal representations.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Coates SW, Davies M, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Kolodji A, Robinson JL|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author3link=Susan Coates|year=2007|title=Caregiver traumatization adversely impacts young children's mental representations of self and others|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume=9|issue=3|pages=187–205|doi=10.1080/14616730701453762|pmid=18007959|pmc=2078523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more frequent a specific pattern of brain neurons is activated, the more permanent the internal representation associated with the pattern becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Krenawi; Graham; Kanat-Maymon, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This causes sensitization in the brain towards the specific neural network. Because of this sensitization, the neural pattern can be activated by decreasingly less external stimuli. 
Childhood abuse tends to have the most complications with long-term effects out of all forms of trauma because it occurs during the most sensitive and critical stages of psychological development.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"/&gt; It could also lead to violent behavior, possibly as extreme as serial murder. For example, Hickey's Trauma-Control Model suggests that "[[Childhood trauma|childhood trauma]] for serial murderers may serve as a triggering mechanism resulting in an individual's inability to cope with the stress of certain events."&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, E. W. (2010). ''Serial Murderers and Their Victims.'' Blemont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often psychodynamic aspects of trauma are overlooked even by health professionals: "If clinicians fail to look through a trauma lens and to conceptualize client problems as related possibly to current or past trauma, they may fail to see that trauma victims, young and old, organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of reliving and warding off traumatic memories, reminders, and affects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effects of Psychological Trauma on Children and Adolescents|url=http://mentalhealth.vermont.gov/sites/dmh/files/report/cafu/DMH-CAFU_Psychological_Trauma_Moroz.pdf|format=PDF|date=June 30, 2005|author=Moroz, Kathleen J.|publisher=Vermont Agency of Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
People who go through these types of extremely traumatic experiences often have certain symptoms and problems afterward. The severity of these symptoms depends on the person, the type of trauma involved, and the emotional support they receive from others.  The range of reactions to and symptoms of trauma can be wide and varied, and differ in severity from person to person. A traumatized individual may experience one or several of them.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

After a traumatic experience, a person may '''re-experience''' the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called [[Trauma trigger|triggers]], can be uncomfortable and even painful. Re-experiencing can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, as well as their ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events are recurring. Flashbacks can range from distraction to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing of symptoms is a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.

Triggers and cues act as reminders of the trauma and can cause [[anxiety]] and other associated emotions. Often the person can be completely unaware of what these triggers are. In many cases this may lead a person suffering from traumatic disorders to engage in disruptive behaviors or self-destructive coping mechanisms, often without being fully aware of the nature or causes of their own actions. [[Panic attack]]s are an example of a psychosomatic response to such emotional triggers.

Consequently, intense feelings of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may always seem to be present due to re-experiencing past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or [[flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback]]s may haunt the person, and [[nightmare]]s may be frequent.&lt;ref name="Loyola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|title=Loyola College in Maryland: Trauma and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028034430/http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|archivedate=2005-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insomnia]] may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions, but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generation, thus making genetics one of the components of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frommberger|first=Ulrich|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder – a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person may not remember what actually happened, while emotions experienced during the trauma may be re-experienced without the person understanding why (see [[Repressed memory|Repressed Memory]]). This can lead to the traumatic events being constantly experienced as if they were happening in the present, preventing the subject from gaining perspective on the experience. This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion. This can lead to mental health disorders like [[acute stress disorder|acute stress]] and anxiety disorder, [[traumatic grief]], [[undifferentiated somatoform disorder]], [[conversion disorder]]s, [[brief psychotic disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], adjustment disorder, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rothschild B|title=The body remembers: the psychophysiology of trauma and trauma treatment |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-393-70327-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, emotional exhaustion may set in, leading to distraction, and clear thinking may be difficult or impossible. [[Emotional detachment]], as well as [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] or "numbing out" can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Dissociation includes depersonalisation disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, etc. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, cognitive and affective impairment. This is significant in brain scan studies done regarding higher order function assessment with children and youth who were in vulnerable environments.

Some traumatized people may feel permanently damaged when trauma symptoms do not go away and they do not believe their situation will improve. This can lead to feelings of despair, transient paranoid ideation,  loss of [[self-esteem]], profound emptiness, suicidality, and frequently [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. If important aspects of the person's self and world understanding have been violated, the person may call their own identity into question.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/facts/general/fs_effects.html |title=Effects of Traumatic Experiences: A National Center for PTSD Fact Sheet |accessdate=2005-12-09 |last=Carlson |first=Eve B. |author2=Josef Ruzek  |publisher=National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder |doi= |archiveurl=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth/factsheets/effects |archivedate=2004-06-12 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often despite their best efforts, traumatized parents may have difficulty assisting their child with emotion regulation, attribution of meaning, and containment of post-traumatic fear in the wake of the child's traumatization, leading to adverse consequences for the child.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Coates SW, Kaminer T, Coots T, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Schonfield IS, Marshall RD, Liebowitz MR, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Myers MM|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author2link=Susan Coates|year=2008|title=Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers|journal=Journal of Trauma and Dissociation|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–149|doi=10.1080/15299730802045666|pmid=18985165|pmc=2577290}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such instances, seeking counselling in appropriate mental health services is in the best interests of both the child and the parent(s).
==Cause==

===Situational trauma===
Trauma can be caused by man-made, technological disasters and natural disasters,&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"&gt;Neria, Y., Nandi, A., &amp; Galea, S. (2008). Post-traumatic stress disorder following disasters: a systematic review. Psychological medicine, 38(4), 467–480. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; including war, abuse, violence, mechanized accidents (car, train, or plane crashes, etc.) or medical emergencies.

Responses to psychological trauma:
Response to psychological trauma can be varied based on the type of trauma, as well as socio demographic and background factors.&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"/&gt;
There are several behavioral responses common towards stressors including the proactive, reactive, and passive responses. Proactive responses include attempts to address and correct a stressor before it has a noticeable effect on lifestyle.  Reactive responses occur after the stress and possible trauma has occurred and are aimed more at correcting or minimizing the damage of a stressful event.  A passive response is often characterized by an emotional numbness or ignorance of a stressor.

Those who are able to be proactive can often overcome stressors and are more likely to be able to cope well with unexpected situations.  On the other hand, those who are more reactive will often experience more noticeable effects from an unexpected stressor. In the case of those who are passive, victims of a stressful event are more likely to suffer from long-term traumatic effects and often enact no intentional coping actions. These observations may suggest that the level of trauma associated with a victim is related to such independent coping abilities.

There is also a distinction between trauma induced by recent situations and long-term trauma which may have been buried in the unconscious from past situations such as [[childhood abuse]]. Trauma is sometimes overcome through healing; in some cases this can be achieved by recreating or revisiting the origin of the trauma under more psychologically safe circumstances, such as with a [[Psychotherapy|therapist]].

===In psychoanalysis===
{{main article|Psychoanalysis}}

French neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] argued in the 1890s that psychological trauma was the origin of all instances of the mental illness known as [[hysteria]].  Charcot's "traumatic hysteria" often manifested as a paralysis that followed a physical trauma, typically years later after what Charcot described as a period of "incubation".
[[Sigmund Freud]], Charcot's student and the father of [[psychoanalysis]], examined the concept of psychological trauma throughout his career.  [[Jean Laplanche]] has given a general description of Freud's understanding of trauma, which varied significantly over the course of Freud's career: "An event in the subject's life, defined by its intensity, by the subject's incapacity to respond adequately to it and by the upheaval and long-lasting effects that it brings about in the psychical organization".&lt;ref name = Laplanche&gt;{{cite book |author1=Laplanche, J.  |author2=Pontalis, J.B. | year=1967 | title=The Language of Psycho-Analysis | publisher=W. W. Norton and Company | isbn=978-0-393-01105-0  | pages=465–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] claimed that what he called "[[The Real]]" had a traumatic quality external to symbolization. As an object of anxiety, Lacan maintained that The Real is "the essential object which isn't an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety ''par excellence''".&lt;ref name="seminar_II"&gt;Lacan, J., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II: The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis 1954–1955'' | p.164 (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1991), {{ISBN|978-0-393-30709-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress disorders===
{{main article|Posttraumatic stress disorder|Complex post-traumatic stress disorder}}
All psychological traumas originate from stress, a physiological response to an unpleasant stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9|title=Physiology of Psychology|author=Carlson, Neil|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossarth-Maticek, R., Eysenck, H.J., &amp; Boyle, G.J. (1994). An empirical study of the diathesis-stress theory of disease. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 1'', 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Long term stress increases the risk of poor mental health and mental disorders, which can be attributed to secretion of glucocorticoids for a long period of time. Such prolonged exposure causes many physiological dysfunctions such as the suppression of the immune system and increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seyle, H.|title=The Stress of Life|journal=McGraw Hill|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does it affect the body physiologically, but a morphological change in the hippocampus also takes place. Studies showed that extreme stress early in life can disrupt normal development of hippocampus and impact its functions in adulthood. Studies surely show a correlation between the size of hippocampus and one's susceptibility to stress disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunson|title=Mechanisms of late-onset cognitive decline after early-life stress|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=2005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In times of war, psychological trauma has been known as shell shock or [[combat stress reaction]]. Psychological trauma may cause an [[acute stress reaction]] which may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  PTSD emerged as the label for this condition after the [[Vietnam War]] in which many veterans returned to their respective countries demoralized, and sometimes, addicted to psychoactive substances. The symptoms of PTSD must persist for at least a month for diagnosis. The main symptoms of PTSD consist of four main categories: trauma (i.e. intense fear), reliving (i.e. flashbacks), avoidance behavior (i.e. emotional numbing), and hypervigilance (i.e. continuous scanning of the environment for danger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frommberger, Ulrich|year=2014|title=Post-traumatic stress disorder – a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|volume=111|issue=5|pages=59–65|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2014.0059|pmid=24612528|pmc=3952004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that about 60% of the US population reported as having experienced at least one traumatic symptom in their lives, but only a small proportion actually develops PTSD. There is a correlation between the risk of PTSD and whether or not the act was inflicted deliberately by the offender.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"/&gt; Psychological trauma is treated with therapy and, if indicated, psychotropic medications.

The term ''continuous post traumatic stress disorder'' (CTSD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straker|first=Gillian|title=The continuous traumatic stress syndrome: The single therapeutic interview|journal=Psychology and Society|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced into the trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, high levels of violence usually associated with civil conflict and political repression. The term is also applicable to the effects of exposure to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic as well as to the effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in high-risk occupations such as police, fire and emergency services.

As one of the processes of treatment, confrontation with their sources of trauma plays a crucial role. While debriefing people immediately after a critical incident has not been shown to reduce incidence of PTSD, coming alongside people experiencing trauma in a supportive way has become standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNally RJ |author2=Bryant RA |author3=Ehlers A | title=Does early psychological intervention promote recovery from posttraumatic stress? | journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume=4 | issue=2 | year=2003 | pages=45–79| doi = 10.1111/1529-1006.01421|pmid=26151755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vicarious===
Vicarious trauma affects workers who witnesses their clients' trauma. It is more likely to occur in situations where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and seeing oneself in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2008/phac-aspc/H72-21-178-2000E.pdf|title=Guidebook on Vicarious Trauma: Recommended Solutions for Anti-Violence Workers|publisher=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may also result if workers witness situations that happen in the course of their work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/dr-john-bradford-won-t-work-magnotta-case-because-of-ptsd-1.2571463|title=Russell Williams profiler won't work Magnotta case because of PTSD|publisher=CBC|date= March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of help seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.

==Assessment==

As "trauma" adopted a more widely defined scope, traumatology as a field developed a more interdisciplinary approach. This is in part due to the field's diverse professional representation including: psychologists, medical professionals, and lawyers. As a result, findings in this field are adapted for various applications, from individual psychiatric treatments to sociological large-scale trauma management. However, novel fields require novel methodologies. While the field has adopted a number of diverse methodological approaches, many pose their own limitations in practical application.

The experience and outcomes of psychological trauma can be assessed in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Briere, John |author2=Scott, Catherine |title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc |location=California |year=2006 |pages=37–63 |isbn=978-0-7619-2921-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk of imminent danger to the self or others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment. In most cases, it will not be necessary to involve contacting emergency services (e.g., medical, psychiatric, law enforcement) to ensure the individuals safety; members of the individual's [[social support]] network are much more critical.

Understanding and accepting the psychological state an individual is in is paramount. There are many misconceptions of what it means for a traumatized individual to be in psychological crisis. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and incapable of self-comfort. If treated humanely and respectfully the individual is less likely to resort to self harm. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and to communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance, the individual will be taken seriously rather than being treated as delusional. It is vital for the assessor to understand that what is going on in the traumatized person's head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., post-traumatic symptoms, dissociation, [[substance abuse]], somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established [[rapport]] and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]], and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.

During assessment, individuals may exhibit activation responses in which reminders of the traumatic event trigger sudden feelings (e.g., [[distress (medicine)|distress]], anxiety, [[anger]]), memories, or thoughts relating to the event. Because individuals may not yet be capable of managing this distress, it is necessary to determine how the event can be discussed in such a way that will not "retraumatize" the individual. It is also important to take note of such responses, as these responses may aid the clinician in determining the intensity and severity of possible post traumatic stress as well as the ease with which responses are triggered. Further, it is important to note the presence of possible avoidance responses. Avoidance responses may involve the absence of expected activation or emotional reactivity as well as the use of avoidance mechanisms (e.g., substance use, effortful avoidance of cues associated with the event, dissociation).

In addition to monitoring activation and avoidance responses, clinicians carefully observe the individual's strengths or difficulties with affect regulation (i.e., affect tolerance and affect modulation). Such difficulties may be evidenced by mood swings, brief yet intense [[depressive episode]]s, or [[self-mutilation]]. The information gathered through observation of affect regulation will guide the clinician's decisions regarding the individual's readiness to partake in various therapeutic activities.

Though assessment of psychological trauma may be conducted in an unstructured manner, assessment may also involve the use of a structured interview. Such interviews might include the [[Clinician Administered PTSD Scale|Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale]] (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI; Bryant, Harvey, Dang, &amp; Sackville, 1998), Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES; Pelcovitz et al., 1997), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders- Revised (SCID-D; Steinberg, 1994), and Brief Interview for post-traumatic Disorders (BIPD; Briere, 1998).

Lastly, assessment of psychological trauma might include the use of self-administered psychological tests. Individual scores on such tests are compared to normative data in order to determine how the individual's level of functioning compares to others in a sample representative of the general population. Psychological testing might include the use of generic tests (e.g., [[MMPI-2]], [[MCMI-III]], SCL-90-R) to assess non-trauma-specific symptoms as well as difficulties related to personality. In addition, psychological testing might include the use of trauma-specific tests to assess post-traumatic outcomes. Such tests might include the post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa, 1995), Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS: Davidson et al., 1997), Detailed Assessment of post-traumatic Stress (DAPS; Briere, 2001), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI: Briere, 1995), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, 1996), Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ: Kubany et al., 2000), and Trauma-related Guilt Inventory (TRGI: Kubany et al., 1996).

Children are assessed through activities and therapeutic relationship, some of the activities are play genogram, sand worlds, coloring feelings, Self and Kinetic family drawing, symbol work, dramatic-puppet play, story telling, Briere's TSCC, etc.&lt;ref name="GilATC"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliana Gil|title=Helping Abused and Traumatized Children: Integrating Directive and Nondirective Approaches|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qe-E0CYLDqcC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60918-474-2|pages=28, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
A number of psychotherapy approaches have been designed with the treatment of trauma in mind—[[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|EMDR]], [[progressive counting (PC)]], [[somatic experiencing]], [[biofeedback]], [[Internal Family Systems Model|Internal Family Systems Therapy]], and [[sensorimotor psychotherapy]].

Trauma therapy allows processing trauma-related memories and allows growth towards more adaptive psychological functioning. It helps to develop positive coping instead of negative coping and allows the individual to integrate upsetting-distressing material (thoughts, feelings and memories) and to resolve these internally. It also aids in growth of personal skills like resilience, ego regulation, empathy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFMXBAAAQBAJ|title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment (DSM-5 Update)|first1=John N.|last1=Briere|first2=Catherine|last2=Scott|date=25 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781483351254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes involved in trauma therapy are:

* Psychoeducation: Information dissemination and educating in vulnerabilities and adoptable coping mechanisms.
* Emotional regulation: Identifying, countering discriminating, grounding thoughts and emotions from internal construction to an external representation.
* Cognitive processing: Transforming negative perceptions and beliefs about self, others and environment to positive ones through cognitive reconsideration or re-framing.
* Trauma processing: Systematic desensitization, response activation and counter-conditioning, titrated extinction of emotional response, deconstructing disparity (emotional vs. reality state), resolution of traumatic material (in theory, to a state in which triggers no longer produce harmful distress and the individual is able to express relief.)
* Emotional processing: Reconstructing perceptions, beliefs and erroneous expectations, habituating new life contexts for auto-activated trauma-related fears, and providing crisis cards with coded emotions and appropriate cognitions. (This stage is only initiated in pre-termination phase from clinical assessment and judgement of the mental health professional.)
* [[Gestalt therapy|Experiential]] processing: Visualization of achieved relief state and relaxation methods.

A number of complementary approaches to trauma treatment have been implicated as well, including yoga and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pradhan|first=Basant|last2=Kluewer D’Amico|first2=Jessica|last3=Makani|first3=Ramkrishna|last4=Parikh|first4=Tapan|date=2015-07-10|title=Nonconventional interventions for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder: Ketamine, repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and alternative approaches|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35–54|doi=10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|issn=1529-9732}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trauma-sensitive yoga]] has been specifically developed for the purposes of use with traumatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emerson|first=D.|last2=Sharma|first2=R.|last3=Chaudhry|first3=S.|last4=Turner|first4=J.|date=2009|title=Trauma-sensitive yoga: principles, practice, and research|url=|journal=International Journal of Yoga Therapy|volume=19|pages=123-128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quality Air Force''' (QAF) was an initiative inside the United States Air Force in the 1990s that attempted to apply [[quality control]] to all activities.  The effort was associated with [[Merrill McPeak|General Merrill McPeak]].  

Quality control had been developed to help industrial manufacturers increase profits by reducing waste and producing consistent, defect-free physical goods.  Most Air Force personnel could not figure out how to apply the techniques of manufacturing's quality control to most of the duties of their Air Force missions, which are often human services depending upon individual skills, with little repetition and numerous exceptions, and difficult to measure in physical terms.

In order to be competitive for promotions it became a requirement for airmen to show that they were executing Quality Air Force in their duties and using it to show improvements.  

The Air University Press printed books on QAF subjects that were distributed to airmen worldwide.

'''''The Big Kahuna''''' is a 1999 American [[business]] [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] directed by John Swanbeck, and produced by [[Kevin Spacey]], who also starred in the lead role. The film is [[Film adaptation|adapted]] from the play ''[[Hospitality Suite]]'', written by [[Roger Rueff]], who also wrote the screenplay. John Swanbeck makes few attempts to lessen this film's resemblance to a stage performance: the majority of the film takes place in a single hotel room, and nearly every single line of dialogue is spoken by one of the three actors. The famous 1997 essay ''[[Wear Sunscreen]]'' is featured at the end of the film.

==Plot==
Larry Mann ([[Kevin Spacey]]) and Phil Cooper ([[Danny DeVito]]), who are both experienced marketing representatives working for an industrial lubricants company, attend a trade convention in [[Wichita, Kansas]], in the [[American Midwest]]. They are joined in their hospitality suite by Bob Walker ([[Peter Facinelli]]), a young man from the company's research department. Larry and Phil are close friends with a long history together. Larry faces urgent financial difficulties that he alludes to only obliquely; Phil has recently come through a recovery program for [[alcoholism]]. Bob, an earnest young [[Baptist]], has few if any regrets. Larry explains that their single goal is to arrange a meeting with Dick Fuller, the CEO of a large company ("[[Kahuna|the Big Kahuna]]").

While the three wait in their suite for the convention downstairs to finish, Larry and Phil explain to Bob how to develop and discern character. They also make Bob the bartender for the evening even though he drinks infrequently. Larry remarks that as he has quit smoking, Phil has quit drinking and Bob is religious, it makes them "practically Jesus".

Even though he makes a poor bartender, Bob spends the evening talking to people. In doing so, he inadvertently chats with the Big Kahuna, who invites him over to a private party at another hotel. Larry and Phil excitedly coach Bob through their pitch on industrial lubricants down to an amount of information Bob can handle and supply him with their business cards.

As the pair wait for Bob, they reflect on the nature of human life. However, Bob returns to drop a bombshell: he used the time to discuss religion rather than pitch the company's product. Larry, dumbfounded, challenges Bob and leaves the room devastated. Phil explains to Bob that proselytizing is just another kind of sales pitch. He explains that making real human-to-human contact requires honesty and a genuine interest in other people. Phil gives his reason why he and Larry have a friendship: trust. He then tells Bob that until he can recognize what he should regret, he will not grow in character.

The next morning Phil packs his things. As Larry checks out, he sees Bob talking again to the "Big Kahuna" in the lobby. They exchange a knowing smile suggesting Bob is using his time with the Big Kahuna more judiciously. The soundtrack during the credits is "Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen)", a setting of an essay by [[Mary Schmich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Kahuna' Goes Over In A Big Way |date=May 19, 2000| |first=Jay |last=Boyar |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-05-19/entertainment/0005180364_1_danny-devito-kevin-spacey-larry |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The film currently holds a 74% 'fresh' rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the consensus "Wonderful adaptation of the stage play."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|big_kahuna|The Big Kahuna}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received a 56/100 "mixed or average reviews" on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|the-big-kahuna|The Big Kahuna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TOMRA was listed in [[Oslo Børs]] on 18 January 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oslobors.no/ob_eng/markedsaktivitet/#/details/TOM.OSE/data|title=Tomra Systems: Details|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Oslo Børs]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tried to secure a position in the American market to no avail.&lt;ref name="Green_Machine"/&gt; It was then successfully attempted to enter the market in 1990s. By 1999, sales in the US accounted for more than half of total revenues. In 2006, TOMRA delivered more than 8000 new reverse vending systems to Germany.&lt;ref name="Green_Machine"/&gt;

TOMRA's sensor-based sorting technology business was first established in 2004 with the acquisition of ''TiTech Visionsort AS'', a provider of optical recognition and sorting technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/news-and-media/news/2004/tomra-acquires-leading-recycling-company/|title=TOMRA acquires leading recycling company|last=|first=|date=2004-07-12|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was renamed to ''Tomra Sorting Solutions'' in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waste-management-world.com/a/titech-rebrands-as-tomra-sorting-solutions|title=Titech Rebrands as Tomra Sorting Solutions|last=|first=|date=2012-02-17|website=Waste Management World|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), from ''Ferd AS'' for 219 million NOK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/news-and-media/news/2004/formal-closing-of-titech-acquisition-completed/|title=Formal closing of TiTech acquisition completed|last=|first=|date=2004-08-25|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010-2016 ===
Via several acquisitions, TOMRA had grown into a global company since the 2000s and secured 75% global market share in [[Reverse vending machine|RVMs]] and 60% Material Recovery from Collection Solutions and 40%-65% in Sorting Solutions.&lt;ref name="Oslo_Bors"/&gt;

On 12 December 2010, TOMRA's subsidiary ''TiTech'' acquired [[Dublin]]-based food technology company ''Odenberg'', a designer of equipment used for producing 65 per cent of all [[French fries]] worldwide, for up to 57.5 million Euro from ''ACT Venture Capital'' in Dublin and members of the Van den Bergh family in Belgium;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/irish-food-tech-firm-odenberg-sold-for-up-to-57-5m-1.687350|title=Irish food tech firm Odenberg sold for up to €57.5m|last=Hancock|first=Ciaran|date=2010-12-15|website=[[The Irish Times]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odenberg's chilling/freezing unit was later considered a non-core business and sold in 2013 as to a newly formed company, ''Power Food Technology Ltd.'', of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/90662-new-types-of-foreign-material-a?page=2|title=Mergers and Acquisitions in Inspection Systems|last=Knights|first=Mikell|date=2013-05-13|website=Food Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2011, TOMRA sold the assets of ''Tomra Pacific, Inc.'', a recycler of used beverage containers in California, to ''rePlanet, LLC'' for approximately $25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inpublic.globenewswire.com/2012/01/02/TOMRA+divests+its+California+operation+HUG1574496.html|title=TOMRA divests its California operation|last=|first=|date=2012-01-02|website=[[GlobeNewswire]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, TOMRA purchased 100% of Belgium-based food [[Optical sorting|sorting]] specialist ''Best Kwadraat'' for 138 million Euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Processing-Packaging/Best-acquired-by-TOMRA-Group-for-138m|title=Best acquired by TOMRA Group for €138m|last=Harrington|first=Rory|date=2012-06-04|website=Bakery and Snacks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 TOMRA signed an agreement to acquire ''Compac Holding Ltd.,'' a New Zealand-based provider of packing house automation systems that sort fresh produce based on weight, size, shape, color, surface blemishes, and internal quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1610/S00354/tomra-acquires-nz-sorting-machine-manufacturer-compac.htm|title=TOMRA acquires NZ Sorting Machine Manufacturer Compac|last=|first=|date=2016-10-12|website=Scoop Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $70 million plus up to $230 million in earn-outs available to Compac founders;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/correct-230m-earn-outs-available-compac-vendors-assuming-turnaround-b-200119|title=Up to $230 million in earn-outs available to Compac founders|last=Smellie|first=Pattrick|date=2017-03-01|website=National Business Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the transaction was completed in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/solutions-and-products/sorting-solutions/food/newsletter-food-for-thought/2017/a-closer-look-compac/|title=TOMRA completes COMPAC acquisition|last=|first=|date=2017-03-08|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition law compliance ==
In 2001, the EU Commission performed an investigation of Tomra’s competition law compliance. Based on this investigation, the Commission concluded in March 2006 that TOMRA in their opinion had foreclosed competition in the period 1998 to 2002 in the market for reverse vending machines in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden by implementing an exclusionary strategy. TOMRA appealed the decision to the European General Court in 2006.

In September 2010, the Court issued their judgment where they dismissed Tomra’s appeal both on the substance and on the amount of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62006TJ0155&amp;from=EN|title=JUDGMENT OF THE GENERAL COURT (Fifth Chamber): Case T-155/06 Tomra Systems ASA and Others vs European Commission|last=|first=|date=2010-09-09|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOMRA consequently accrued 28.2 million Euro (NOK 226.1 million) for the fine and accumulated interest in the third quarter financial statement for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/news-and-media/news/2010/third-quarter-2010-results/|title=Third quarter 2010 results|last=|first=|date=2010-10-19|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOMRA appealed this decision again but finally lost the case in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://united-kingdom.taylorwessing.com/en/news-insights/details/when-will-discounts-and-rebates-in-supply-agreements-be-anti-competitive-2012-05-09.html|title=When will discounts and rebates in supply agreements be anti-competitive?|last=|first=|date=2012-05-09|website=[[Taylor Wessing]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tomra T-820 BC Blue.jpg|thumb|right|The images shows a TOMRA T-820 BC (Bottle and Crate) machine.]]

'''Vladimir Stefanovich Litvinenko''' ({{lang-ru|Влади́мир Стефа́нович Литвине́нко}}, born 14 August 1955) is a [[Russia]]n academic, businessman and [[Vladimir Putin]]'s campaign manager.&lt;ref name="Bureau"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/03/02/the-fabulous-riches-of-putins-inner-circle/ | title=The fabulous riches of Putin’s inner circle | publisher=The Bureau Investigates | accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also rector of [[Saint Petersburg Mining University]] in [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="Bureau"/&gt;

==Career==
Litvinenko has been the rector of Saint Petersburg Mining University since the 1990s. He oversaw Vladimir Putin's dissertation work in 1996, which is alleged to include significant amounts of [[plagiarism]] and is speculated perhaps to have not even been written by Putin (i.e. that he paid somebody to write it for him). Litvinenko has been criticised for not spotting the plagiarism.&lt;ref name=cdi.org&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2006-78-3a.cfm|title=It All Boils Down to Plagiarism|publisher=Cdi.org|date=2006-03-31|accessdate=2010-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806181040/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2006-78-3a.cfm|archive-date=2009-08-06|dead-url=yes|df=}} Clifford Gaddy: "Mr. Litvinenko -- who was directly involved in the dissertation, allegedly helped [Putin] choose the topic and was more or less the advisor for the dissertation -- is himself a member of the higher accreditation commission, which is the government-appointed body to be the watchdog over standards about degree-granting, dissertations and quality control for higher education in Russia. So it’s extra scandalous that he would be involved in this case of, at minimum, shoddiness and plagiarism, possibly something worse, which would be the literal purchase, either by money or political influence, of a dissertation by someone who didn’t actually do the work. That second point is not clear. I don’t have proof about that. All I have is proof about the plagiarism."&lt;/ref&gt; According to his daughter Olga, Vladimir Litvinenko himself wrote the dissertation.&lt;ref name="Ester-Maria"/&gt;

Litvinenko was Putin's political campaign manager in 2000 and 2004.

On June 11, 2014, he was given an honorary doctorate by the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology]], Saxony, Germany.&lt;ref name=Freiberg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tu-freiberg.de/en/presse/rector-of-the-st-petersburg-mining-institute-to-receive-an-honorary-doctorate|title=Rector of the St. Petersburg Mining Institute to receive an honorary doctorate|publisher=tu-freiberg.de|date=2014-06-11|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Litvinenko owns nearly 15% of [[PhosAgro]], a [[phosphate]] mining company&lt;ref name="Bureau"/&gt; in the Arctic.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kramer|first1=Andrew E.|last2=Herszenhornmarch |first2=David M.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/world/europe/ties-to-vladimir-putin-generate-fabulous-wealth-for-a-select-few-in-russia.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1&amp;hp | title=Midas Touch in St. Petersburg: Friends of Putin Glow Brightly | work=The New York Times|date=March 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 7, 2012 | pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mine had been at one time partly owned by [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]].&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; He claims that he was paid in shares for some consulting that he did in 2004 and that this "did not contradict any laws".&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt;

Phosagro was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in July 2011 and Litvinenko was listed among its new owners, as chairman.&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; When Litvinenko owned 5%, the stock was worth about $260 million.&lt;ref name="Bureau"/&gt; In April 2014, he acquired a further 4.9% from [[Andrey Guryev]], who controls the company, for $269 million.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fedorinova|first1=Yuliya|title=Putin Campaigner Buys $269 Million Phosagro Stake From Guryevs|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-28/putin-campaigner-buys-269-million-phosagro-stake-from-guryevs|accessdate=25 May 2015|work=Bloomberg|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Litvinenko has a daughter, [[Olga Litvinenko|Olga]], born in 1983,&lt;ref name="Ester-Maria"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ester-maria.com/olga | title=Ольга Литвиненко | publisher=Ester-Maria.com | accessdate=June 8, 2012|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used to be a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="Daughter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/piter/2012/04/24/973803.html | title=Дочь Владимира Литвиненко: У моего отца "синдром Ивана Грозного" | publisher=Rosbalt.ru |date=April 24, 2012| accessdate=June 8, 2012|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 Vladimir and his wife were looking after Olga's daughter [[Ester-Maria Litvinenko]] (born in 2009), and refused to give her back to Olga.&lt;ref name="Daughter"/&gt; Olga has described this as a [[kidnapping]] and has instigated legal proceedings to get her daughter back. Olga describes her father as "the richest rector in Russia" and an "[[Russian oligarchs|oligarch]]" ("самый богатый ректор России, олигарх"&lt;ref name="Ester-Maria"/&gt;). When Olga fled the country in summer 2011, Vladimir reported to the police that Olga and her other son, Mikhail, had been kidnapped and his daughter's assets were frozen.&lt;ref name="Daughter"/&gt; According to Olga, all lawyers defending her were arrested and sentenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telewizjarepublika.pl/litvinenko-putin-chce-pokazac-europie-ze-prawo-rosji-obowiazuje-wszedzie,13502.html Litvinenko: Putin wants to show Europe that Russia's law applies everywhere], telewizjarepublika.pl, November 5th 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Brenton Boggs IV''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|OBE}} (December 18, 1918 &amp;ndash; July 7, 2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20110113.93253735/BDAStory/BDA/deaths|title=Obituary|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a pioneering [[Canada|Canadian]] leader in military and commercial aviation.

==Early years==
Born in [[Douglas, Arizona]], United States, on December 18, 1918, William Brenton (Bill) Boggs relocated to [[Noranda, Quebec]] with his parents in 1927. He graduated from [[McGill University]], mechanical engineering, and became an Engineering Officer of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] in 1940. During his [[World War II]] service, he notably served as Senior Engineering Officer of 331 Wing of Wellington bombers dispatched to Tunisia, North Africa to support the Allied landings in Sicily and Italy, for which contributions he was appointed to the [[Order of the British Empire]] (O.B.E.) in 1944.

==Civilian career==
Boggs' early civilian career included positions with [[Air Canada|Trans-Canada Airlines]] (1945-1950) and [[Canadair]] (1950-1957) before he joined Can-Car, a subsidiary of [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]], and became vice president of Hawker Siddley. In 1965, he became President of [[de Havilland Canada]] (DHC). During this term, he was involved with the development of the 30-seat [[Dash-7]] commuter aircraft. He then became President and eventually Chairman of Canada Systems Group (CSG), and, in 1983, President and CEO of The Canadian Data and Professional Service Organization.

Boggs was invited back to DHC in 1984, as Chairman, President and CEO, when that company was being prepared for privatization. When the [[Boeing Company]] bought DHC in 1986, Boggs became Vice Chairman of [[Boeing Canada]]. In 1987 he became Chairman of Field Aviation Holdings Inc. He remained there until he retired in 1995.

==Honours and legacy==
In addition to being made an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1944, Boggs was invested as an [[Order of Canada|Officer into the Order of Canada]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|2446}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a Fellow of the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute (CASI) in 1967 and served twice as Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada (AIAC) (1967–68; 1987–88). In 1983 he was named Fellow of the Canadian School of Management. In 2003, he was inducted into [[Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame]].
