Protests began the night of 12 June 2009, following the announcement that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won nearly 63% of the vote, despite several reported irregularities.  However, all three opposition candidates claimed the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged, with Rezaee and Mousavi lodging official complaints. Mousavi announced he "won't surrender to this manipulation", before lodging an official appeal against the result to the [[Guardian Council]] on [[Timeline of the 2009 Iranian election protests#June|14 June]].&lt;ref name=join/&gt; Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] ordered an investigation into the claims of electoral fraud and irregularities, as requested by Green Movement leaders.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{Cite news|title=Election Battles Turn Into Street Fights in Iran |publisher=[[ABC News]] |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7830630 |date=13 June 2009 |accessdate=13 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibzFCQPv?url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7830630 |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnsonMurphy"&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Anna Johnson |author2=Brian Murphy |title=Iranian protester killed after opposition rally |date=15 June 2009 |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090615/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election |accessdate=20 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618115353/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090615/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election |archivedate=18 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chinaview"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Iran's supreme leader orders investigation into claims of vote fraud |date=15 June 2009 |work=China View |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/15/content_11546228.htm |accessdate=18 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibzHnLho?url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/15/content_11546228.htm |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadinejad called the election "completely free" and the outcome a "great victory" for Iran, dismissing the protests as akin to little more than "passions after a soccer match".&lt;ref name=join1&gt;{{Cite news|date=14 June 2009|accessdate=23 June 2009|title=Iranian leader: Fiery clashes over election 'not important'|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-06-13-iran-vote-saturday_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Prior to 2005===
{{main|History of the Islamic Republic of Iran}}
{{See also|Politics of Iran|Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|Iranian reform movement}}
Since 1980 following the [[Iranian Revolution|collapse of the Shah's regime in 1979]]. The government is based on the concept of [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|Velayat-e Faqih]], which is a system of governance in which a ''faqih'' was to serve as the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]. However, following calls that this idea was undemocratic, the system was moderately altered into the current "Islamic Republic", in which a [[Assembly of Experts|council of clerics]], who are elected by the people, choose the Supreme Leader who, per the constitution, has to be a cleric (though this was altered in 1988). The Supreme Leader, in turn appoints the members of the twelve member [[Guardian Council]], who approve laws and candidates for elections, even at the presidential level. The President of Iran is not the commander-in-chief, and the control of the military, police, and the parallel [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] is under the control of the Supreme Leader. The Revolutionary Guards is a constitutionally protected paramilitary force that operates alongside the regular Armed forces, whose primary function is to protect the Islamic Republic. The Revolutionary Guards also have an auxiliary wing called the [[Basij]], who provide support in enforcing religious laws and suppressing dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', W.W. Norton, (2005), p.88, 316–318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/world/middleeast/19basij.html?_r=1&amp;ref=global-home |title=Shadowy Iranian Vigilantes Vow Bolder Action |work=New York Times |author=Neil MacFarquhar |accessdate=19 June 2009 |date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not considered full members of the Revolutionary Guards, and lack the training given to full-time members, although they can be called up at any time to assist the regular forces in times of trouble. Though Ayatollah Khomeini and his successor Ayatollah Khamenei, claimed that this system was democratic and the Revolutionary guards are necessitated to protect the government from military coups and foreign interference, critics contend that this system only serves to keep like-minded conservatives in power and marginalize any opposition, while using the Revolutionary guards to silence any dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308224 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=8 October 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308301 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146307117 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=7 September 2005 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/media.asp?id=10588595 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Media - Articles |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date= |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=1779650752 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=11 January 2004 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic Republic has not escaped popular opposition in the past. During the 1980s, the Marxist-Islamist, [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mojahedin Khalq]] was instrumental in opposing Ayatollah Khomeini through large protests and bombings against politicians such as [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]], [[Shahid Beheshti]], and Khamenei himself, who escaped an assassination attempt that left his right arm paralyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/countries/bl_IranRevolutionTerror.htm |title=Religion in Iran - Terror and Repression |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily News - June 1981"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id112.htm |title=The Daily News - June 1981 |publisher=Eightiesclub.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=72375 |title=Iran ABC News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=1981-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1981 [[Hafte Tir bombing]], Ayatollah Khomeini declared the Mojahedin and anyone opposed to the Islamic republic, "enemies of god" and pursued a mass campaign of torture, rape, and execution against members of the Mojahedin, [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority)|Fadaiyan]], and [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh]] parties as well as their families, close friends, and even anyone who was accused of insufficient Islamic behavior, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Iranians who were usually tried in secret kangaroo courts run by hard line clerics.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.243&lt;/ref&gt; Following the failed [[Operation Mersad]] in 1988, Khomeini [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners|ordered all prisons to execute those still in captivity]], resulting in an estimated 30,000 dead. Since then, no organized opposition has surfaced in Iran and following this experience, the Iranian Government usually employs heavy handed tactics to marginalize any attempt at regime removal and usually justifies this with the "enemy of god" classification.

In 1997, following the unexpected victory of a little-known reformist cleric [[Mohammad Khatami]], there was a revival of a moderate faction within the government whom the public believed had the ability to reform and curb the power of the conservatives and make the system somewhat democratic, and that Khamenei was willing to trust this faction in the hopes that it could recover the country after the eight-year war with Iraq, which Rafsanjani and the conservatives had failed to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1373476.stm |title=BBC News, 6 June 2001 Profile: Mohammad Khatami |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-06-06 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than promoting a reform of the system, the reformists began questioning the concept of the Islamic republic itself and following the exposure of the [[Chain Murders of Iran|murders of dissidents by the intelligence services]] in reformist newspapers (which were run by former Revolutionary Guards and intelligence agents now turned reformists), the government began to distrust Khatami and his faction, a conflict which reached the breaking point after the 1999 [[Iran student protests, July 1999|student protests]], after which hardliners such as [[Mohammad Ali Jafari]], [[Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf]], and [[Qasem Soleimani]] were promoted to take control of the Revolutionary Guards and the Security Services to crack down on most reformist movements. Despite reformists gaining a majority in the Majlis in 2000 and Khatami winning the 2001 election as well, Khamenei would oppose any attempts at liberalization of the government or society.&lt;ref&gt;"Men of principle", ''The Economist''. London: 21 July 2007. Vol. 384, Iss. 8538; pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Most Iranians and observers in general have regarded the reform movement to have been a failure with [[Saeed Hajjarian]], the main theorist behind the movement, declaring in 2003 that "the reform movement is dead. Long live the reform movement".&lt;ref&gt;اصلاحات مرد زنده باد اصلاحات&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadinejad's first term===
{{main|Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005–13)}}
In 2005, Tehran Mayor [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was elected to the presidency, defeating now reformist [[Ali-Akbar Rafsanjani]], placing the conservatives in charge of the government once more. Ahmadinejad would focus his presidency on confronting Israel. His speeches gained international infamy, which usually called for the destruction of Israel and claimed that the [[Holocaust]] was fabricated. The funding of anti-Israeli groups went up exponentially, particularly towards [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]], which have been labeled as Terrorist groups by the United States. Despite Iran's huge oil and gas reserves, those sectors have been relatively neglected in favor of a nuclear energy program that has cost billions of dollars and has been condemned by Israel and the United States, who claim that the program is a cover up for a much larger nuclear weapons program. As a result, the United Nations has placed sanctions on the Iranian government, which has had a heavy impact on the economy, reducing the value of the rial from a low of 8,000 to the dollar in 2005 to 10,000 to the dollar in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203093100/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |archivedate=3 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has been experiencing high birth rates since 1988, both due to an increase in standard of living and government encouragement of large families, with an estimated 60 percent of the country being under the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uesco.org/education/wef/countryreports/iran/rapport_2.html Country Reports - Iran]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===The election===
The [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|election of the president of Iran in 2009]] was preceded by [[Iran 2009 election#Opinion polls|many Iranian surveys]] and a survey by the US-based Terror Free Tomorrow organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/ |title=Terror Free Tomorrow |accessdate=18 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jc8EoPnz?url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/ |archivedate=7 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Terror Free Tomorrow opinion poll, conducted from 11 to 20 May 2009, predicted the high participation and showed similar ratios for the candidates to the later official result, with over a quarter yet undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahmadinejad Front Runner in Upcoming Presidential Elections; Iranians Continue to Back Compromise and Better Relations with US and West.

The election for presidency took place on 12 June 2009. Unlike the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|election in 2005]], the 2009 election featured high participation. The results of the elections were announced only 2 hours after the end of the votes, which may seem impossible. The [[Iran 2009 election#Result|official results]] were rejected by all three opposition candidates, who claimed that the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged. The last presidential election had already been [[Iranian presidential election, 2005#Election controversies|controversial]], but this time it escalated. Candidates [[Mohsen Rezaee]] and Mousavi have lodged official complaints. Mousavi announced that he "won't surrender to this manipulation" before lodging an official appeal against the result to the [[Guardian Council]] on 14 June.&lt;ref name=join/&gt;

According to an analysis by Professor Walter R. Mebane, Jr. from the Department of Statistics of the [[University of Michigan]], considering data from the first stage of the 2005 presidential election produces results that "give moderately strong support for a diagnosis that the 2009 election was affected by significant fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mebane|first=Walter R.|title=Note on the presidential election in Iran, June 2009|date=18 June 2009|format=PDF|url=http://www.umich.edu/~wmebane/note18jun2009.pdf| accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK-based think-tank Chatham House also suspected fraud in the voting process for a number of reasons:&lt;ref name="chatham"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Analysis of the Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Election|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/Middle%20East/iranelection0609.pdf|date=26 June 2011|author1=Ali Ansari|author2=Daniel Berman|author3=Thomas Rintoul|publisher=Chatham House and the Institute of Iranian Studies, University of St Andrews|accessdate=21 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005142556/http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/Middle%20East/iranelection0609.pdf|archive-date=5 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| More than 100%
|In two Conservative provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, a turnout of ''more than 100%'' was recorded.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;
|-
| No swing
|At a provincial level, there is no correlation between the increased turnout, and the swing to Ahmadinejad.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt; This challenges the notion that his victory was due to the massive participation of a previously silent Conservative majority.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;
|-
| Reformist votes
|In a third of all provinces, the official results would require that Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, and all former centrist voters, and all new voters, but ''also took up to 44% of former Reformist voters'', despite a decade of conflict between these two groups.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;

|In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, and Ahmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas. The claim that this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces in 2009 flies in the face of these trends.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;

{{Main|Timeline of the 2009 Iranian election protests|Results of the Iranian presidential election, 2009}}

On Saturday 13 June after election results announced that Ahmadinejad had won, supporters of Mousavi took to the streets to protest. The next day, protests grew, as did violence. On the night of 14 June the pro-Ahmadinejad [[Basij]] paramilitary group raided Tehran University, injuring many. On 15 June millions of protesters marched on Azadi street and Mousavi made his first post-election appearance.

On 16 June, protests continued, and the [[Guardian Council]] announced a partial recount would be conducted; however, the vote was not annulled. On Wednesday 17 June another large protest occurred; some members of the [[Iranian national football team]] wore green wristbands in support of Mousavi during their game against South Korea. On Thursday, 18 June more than 100,000 protesters held a candlelight vigil in Tehran following Mousavi's call for a day of mourning for those killed in protests. The Guardian Council invited the three major challengers to meet to discuss their grievances.

On Friday, 19 June, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini spoke during religious services, saying the election was legitimate and called the large voter turnout and resulting victory (for Ahmadinejad) a "divine assessment" and that protests would no longer be tolerated. However, the opposition did not accept this and the protests occurred, albeit on a smaller scale. The next day, 20 June, fewer protesters took to streets. At the protests that did occur, said to number in the tens of thousands of people, much violence occurred, causing many would-be protesters to stay in their homes the next day, Sunday, 21 June. On 20 June, a young Iranian woman, identified as [[Neda Agha-Soltan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=French |publisher=egoblog.net |title=Her name was Neda |url=http://egoblog.net/2009/06/21/her-name-was-neda/ |accessdate=21 June 2009 |date=21 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibz2nxSW?url=http://egoblog.net/2009/06/21/her-name-was-neda/ |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shot and died in front of cameras on Kargar Avenue in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BreakForNews.com |title=Unidentified Woman Shot Dead in Karegar Ave – 20 June 2009 |url=http://breakfornews.com/KarekarAveShooting090620.htm |accessdate=20 June 2009 |date=20 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibz44O18?url=http://breakfornews.com/KarekarAveShooting090620.htm |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly graphic amateur videos of the killing rapidly spread [[Viral video|viral]] across the Internet after being posted to Facebook and YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Youtube|title=Basij shots to a young woman in Tehran's Saturday 20 June protests |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=185vPe_gROA |accessdate =20 June 2009|date=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, riot police broke up the main rally in Tehran with tear gas and live fire into the air.

During Friday, 26 June, prayers were broadcast live on television, and [[Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami]] is reported to have said that "Anybody who fights against the Islamic system or the leader of Islamic society, fight him until complete destruction" and called for the execution of leading demonstrators as they are "people who wage war against God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6583797.ece |accessdate=27 June 2009 |location=London |work=The Times |first=Martin |last=Fletcher |title=Leading demonstrators must be executed Ayatollah Khatami demands |date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, 29 June, the Guardian Council certified the results of the controversial election.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran Council Certifies Disputed Election Results|author=Michael Slackman|date=29 June 2009|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set off a wave of protests, disregarding the Iranian government's ban on street marches.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; The Iranian intelligence chief alleged that western and "Zionist" forces were responsible for inciting the protests. Four of the nine British officials arrested on 28 June 2009 remain in custody under those charges.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

Late July, protest had reportedly entered a "Phase II", using tactics such as the boycott of goods advertised on state-controlled television; attempting to deny power to state-run TV evening news broadcasts by turning on all electric appliances just before the news; "blitz" street demonstrations "lasting just long enough to chant `Death to the dictator!` several times", but not long enough for security forces to arrive; identifying paramilitary [[Basij]] vigilantes linked to the crackdown and putting marks in the opposition color green, or pictures of protest victims in front of their homes; scribbled anti-regime slogans on money. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The new protest is reportedly based on the idea of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] that "even the most powerful cannot rule without the cooperation of the ruled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912941,00.html?xid=rss-world |work=Time |first=Robin |last=Wright |title=Iran's Protesters: Phase 2 of Their Feisty Campaign |date=27 July 2009|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term as President of Iran in an official inauguration in Tehran. Protests were held outside the Parliament during the inauguration, with protesters chanting "death to the dictator".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/world/52524657.html|title=Ahmadinejad sworn in as Iran president amid crisis|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=5 August 2009}}{{Dead link|date=August 2009|bot=WebCiteBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major protests would continue after the inauguration as well.

While the [[Death of Neda Agha-Soltan|death of Neda]] attracted widespread media attention, ''The Guardian'' is also maintaining a list of numerous other people who have ostensibly been either killed or arrested since the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Iran election: faces of the dead and detained |accessdate=5 July 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2009/jun/29/iran-election-dead-detained |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 June 2009 |first=Simon |last=Jeffery |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724091446/http://www.guardian.co.uk//world//interactive//2009//jun//29//iran-election-dead-detained|archivedate=24 July 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has issued very little official information on who has been killed or arrested (except Neda Agha-Soltan, whose video circulated quickly on the Internet). Hospitals were prohibited from registering the dead bodies or injured people, as a medical student at Rasoul-Akram hospital witnessed on the night of 15 June: "Nine people died at our hospital and another 28 had gunshot wounds...

The families of those who died were allegedly subjected to penalties and bureaucratic [[red tape]], such as being asked to sign paperwork that they do not have complaints against the government prior to being allowed to claim bodies. When the death was due to gunshot wounds, some were reportedly asked to pay a $3,000 fee, ostensibly for the bullet used by security forces.&lt;ref name="wsjalipour"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124571865270639351 |title=Son's Death Has Iranian Family Asking Why|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=23 June 2009 |first=Farnaz |last=Fassihi|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126194701/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124571865270639351.html|archivedate=26 January 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on burial locations have also been reported,&lt;ref name="wsjalipour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="makanbbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8113552.stm|title=Death video woman 'targeted by militia'|publisher=BBC News|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iranian government did not permit a memorial service for Neda Agha-Soltan.&lt;ref name="makanbbc"/&gt; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] speculates that the [[Arba'een|Shi'ite cycle of mourning]] on the third (23 June), seventh (27 June), and 40th (30 July) day after a person's death may give the protests sustained momentum, similar in fashion to what occurred during the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Iranian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wright |first=Robin |title=In Iran, one woman's death may have many consequences |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=23 June 2009 |date=21 June 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906049,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622174825/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1906049%2C00.html |archivedate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Torture of prisoners====
Opposition leaders have claimed that the prisoners have been tortured and raped in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090812/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_23|title=Pro-reform party blames Iran's president for abuse|accessdate=13 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition leaders and world leaders condemned the abuse.

Former chairman of Iranian parliament [[Mehdi Karroubi]] stated that male and female prisoners have been raped in the prison and their genitals were torn, but it is not yet proven. He asked the head of the assembly to investigate the issue in a letter to the head of [[Assembly of Experts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1494473.php/Opposition-party-leader-claims-sexual-abuse-in-Iranian-prisons |title=Opposition party leader claims sexual abuse in Iranian prisons |accessdate=9 August 2009 |author1=James Wray |author2=Ulf Stabe |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j5ISFK5N?url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1494473.php/Opposition-party-leader-claims-sexual-abuse-in-Iranian-prisons |archivedate=17 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's police chief, Gen.

Additionally, several of the detained died while in prison. Authorities claimed that the deaths were caused by "pre-existing conditions". However, examinations of the bodies showed signs of torture, including broken bones, finger nails torn off, and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090812/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_23|title=Pro-reform party blames Iran's president for abuse|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=13 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theaustralian&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26093533-2703,00.html|title=Ahmadinejad's Basiji run a regime of rape, murder to suppress critics|work=The Australian|accessdate=4 October 2009 |first1=Martin |last1=Fletcher |date=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian film maker [[Reza Allamehzadeh]] made a documentary about Azar Al-Kanan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Azar Ale-Kanan &amp;#124; Iranian.com |url=http://iranian.com/main/2009/aug/azar-ale-kanan |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j6930NAT?url=http://iranian.com/main/2009/aug/azar-ale-kanan |archivedate=17 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=16 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent Iranian human rights activist and former political prisoner in Iran who became one of the victims of torture, sexual abuse, and finally, rape. The documentary was released after ex-chairman of Iranian parliament Mehdi Karroubi called for investigation of sexual abuse of protesters in prisons by Iranian police and the judicial system, both under the responsibility of the Supreme Leader. Karroubi's letter angered conservatives and the head of Iranian parliament, [[Ali Larijani]], and senior cleric and representative of the Supreme Leader, [[Ahmad Khatami]], denied the reports of sexual abuse. Following the denials, on 16 August 2009, [[Fereshteh Ghazi]], in an article in [[Rooz]], wrote her story and described the torture and sexual violence in Iranian prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=تکان دهنده تر از دروغ – roozonline.com |url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article////107/-1738c4bd99.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jD3gG533?url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article////107/-1738c4bd99.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=16 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June, Belgian national television reporter Jef Lambrecht from the [[Flanders|Flemish]] public television broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] and his sound technician, Vandervorst, were arrested in Tehran. They had been doing a story on the riots and had gotten caught in the middle of the violence. While Lambrecht had taken a punch, Vandervorst was arrested by riot police. When Lambrecht went to check where Vandervorst was being taken, he was promptly arrested as well. Both were taken to the Ministry of Information and detained in the basement. They were both released after two hours with strict instructions not to make any photos or film recordings of the protests. At the same time, two Dutch reporters from Nova were also arrested and deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VRT-reporter opgepakt in woelig Teheran |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=LO2BDPIV |language=Dutch |date=15 June 2009 |work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ic2uaN8l?url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=LO2BDPIV |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This directly appeals to the notion of injustice and redemption at the heart of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{Cite news|title=Demanding to be counted |url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13856232 |work=The Economist |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ic2vgQmU?url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13856232 |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 July 2009 |date=18 June 2009 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, were [[Irreligion in Iran|irreligious]] in their protests.

For Iran, one of the links of communication exist solely because of the ideology the revolutionary movement was based upon Islamism (Poursaied, p.&amp;nbsp;136). The religious institutions were used to communicate from one revolutionary group to another. These institutions consist of "mosques, ritual centres, and even charity funds,&lt;ref&gt;Poursaeid Farzad, “Democracy Promotion, Authoritarian Resiliency, and Political Unrest in Iran", ''Discourse: An Iranian Quarterly'', Volume 10 (Winter/Spring 2012):119–143.&lt;/ref&gt; and these venues allowed people to gather right under the nose of the government in order to become organised.

Protesters have deliberately dressed modestly.

A bystander, [[Neda Agha-Soltan]], who was killed by authorities, has been mythologised by the opposition as a [[Shahid|martyr]]. The status of a martyr is revered in Shia Islam. To prevent this from happening, the authorities have tried to call off [[janaza|funeral services]] for her, which according to Shia Islam, must be held on the third, seventh, and 40th day after the martyr's passing. Robert Tait and Matthew Weaver of ''The Guardian'' noted that it was [[funeral procession]]s on the 40th day of [[mourning]] of fallen protesters in 1979 that created momentum in toppling the [[Pahlavi dynasty|shah's regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How Neda Soltani became the face of Iran's struggle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/22/neda-soltani-death-iran|author1=Robert Tait |author2=Matthew Weaver |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of martyrdom resonates deeply amongst the Shiite Muslim population of Iran.

'''''Arche''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|i}}; {{lang-grc|[[:wikt:ἀρχή|ἀρχή]]}}) is a Greek word with primary senses "beginning", "origin" or "source of action". ({{lang|grc|εξ’ ἀρχής}}: from the beginning, οr {{lang|grc|εξ’ ἀρχής λόγος}}: the original argument), and later "first principle" or "element", first so used by [[Anaximander]] (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23). By extension, it may mean  "first place, power", "method of government", "empire, realm", "authorities" (in plural: {{lang|grc|ἀρχαί}}), "command".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*a%3Aentry+group%3D318%3Aentry%3Da%29rxh%2F ἀρχή], ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The first principle or element corresponds to the "ultimate underlying substance" and "ultimate undemonstrable principle".&lt;ref&gt;Peters Lexicon:1967:23&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[philosophical]] language of the [[archaic Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC), ''arche'' (or ''archai'') designates the source, origin or root of things that exist.  In [[ancient Greek philosophy]], [[Aristotle]] foregrounded the meaning of ''arche'' as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Presocratic Philosophy. Vol 3|author=Barry Sandywell|year=1996|publisher=Routledge New York|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=k561uXI-uPgC&amp;printsec }} pp. 142–144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythical cosmogonies==
In the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] (8th to 7th century BC), the origin of the world is [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], considered as a divine primordial condition, from which everything else appeared. In the creation "chaos" is a gaping-void, but later the word is used to describe the space between the earth and the sky, after their separation. "Chaos" may mean infinite space, or a formless matter which can be differentiated.&lt;ref&gt;This is described as a large windy-gap, almost unlimited ([[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]) where are the roots and the ends of the earth, sky, sea and [[Tartarus]]: [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm online ''The Theogony of Hesiod'']. Translation H.G.Evelyn White (1914): 116, 736-744&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg}} p 83&lt;/ref&gt; The conception of the "divine" as an origin influenced the first Greek philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase: "Divine is that which had no beginning, neither end" is attributed to [[Thales]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the [[Orphic]] cosmogony, the unaging [[Chronos]] produced [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]] and Chaos and made in divine Aether a silvery egg, from which everything else appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|author=G.S.Kirk,J.E.Raven and M.Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;printsec}} p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythological cosmogonies of the Near East, the universe is formless and empty and the only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. In the [[Babylonia]]n creation story, [[Enuma Elish]] the primordial world is described as a "watery chaos" from which everything else appeared. Something similar is described in [[Book of Genesis]] where the spirit of God is moving upon the dark face of the waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg}} p 58, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hindu]] cosmology, which is similar to the [[Vedic]] cosmology, in the beginning there was nothing in the Universe but darkness. The self-manifested being created the primordial waters and established his seed into it. This turned into a golden egg ([[Hiranyagarbha]]) from which everything else appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matsya Purana]] (2.25-30)[http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/matsya_purana.php online]; The creation&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Arche'' in Ancient Greek philosophy==
The heritage of Greek [[mythology]] already embodied the desire to articulate reality as a whole and this universalizing impulse was fundamental for the first projects of speculative theorizing. It appears that the order of "being" was first imaginatively visualized before it was abstractly thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Precocratic Philosophy vol.3|author=Barry Sandywell|year=1996|publisher=Routledge New York|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=k561uXI-uPgC&amp;printsec }} p.28,42&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ancient [[Greek philosophy]], ''arche'' is the element and the first principle of existing things. This is considered as a permanent substance or nature (physis) either one or more which is conserved in the generation of rest of it. From this all things first come to be and into this they are resolved in a final state. This source of entity is always preserved. ([[Aristotle]]-Metaph.A, 983, b6ff). [[Anaximander]] was the first philosopher that used ''arche'' for that which writers from Aristotle onwards called "the substratum" ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] Phys. 150, 22).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg }} p 55, 77&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosophers ascribed to ''arche'' divine attributes. It is the divine horizon of substance that encompasses and values all things.

[[Thales]] of [[Miletus]] (7th to 6th century BC), the father of philosophy, claimed that the first principle of all things is water,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK 7 B1a.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and considered it as a substance that contains in it motion and change. His theory was supported by the observation of moisture throughout the world and coincided with his theory that the earth floated on water. His ideas were influenced by the Near-Eastern mythological cosmogony and probably by the [[Homeric]] statement that the surrounding [[Oceanus]] (ocean) is the source of all springs and rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pre-socratic Philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg}} p 89, 93, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Thales' theory was refuted by his successor and esteemed pupil, [[Anaximander]]. Anaximander noted that water could not be the arche, because it could not give rise to its opposite, fire. Anaximander claimed that none of the [[Classical element|elements]] ([[earth]], [[fire]], [[air]], [[water]]) could be arche for the same reason. Instead, he proposed the existence of the [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]], an indefinite substance from which all things are born and to which all things will return.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''Comments on Aristotle's Physics'' (24, 13).&lt;DK 12 A9, B1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apeiron'' (endless or boundless) is something completely indefinite and Anaximander was probably influenced by the original ''chaos'' of Hesiod (yawning abyss). He probably intended it to mean primarily "indefinite in kind" but assumed it also to be "of unlimited extent and duration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pre-socratic Philosophers|author=G.S.Kirk, J.E.Raven and M.Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg}} p 110&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''arche'' is called "eternal and ageless". (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg}} p 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], Anaximander's pupil, advanced yet another theory. He returns to the elemental theory, but this time posits air, rather than water, as the arche and ascribes to it divine attributes. He was the first recorded philosopher who provided a theory of change and supported it with observation. Using two contrary processes of [[rarefaction]] and [[condensation]] (thinning or thickening), he explains how air is part of a series of changes. Rarefied air becomes fire, condensed it becomes first wind, then cloud, water, earth, and stone in order.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel.W.Graham.  [http://www.iep.utm.edu/anaximen/ ''The internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Anaximenes''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pre-socratic Philosophers|author=C.S.Kirk, J.E.Raven and M.Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg}} p 144&lt;/ref&gt; The ''arche'' is technically what underlies all of reality/appearances.

'''Artificial languages''' are [[language]]s of a typically very limited size which emerge either in computer simulations between artificial agents, robot interactions or controlled psychological experiments with humans. They are different from both [[constructed language]]s and [[formal language]]s in that they have '''''not''''' been consciously devised by an individual or group but are the result of (distributed) conventionalisation processes, much like [[natural language]]s. Opposed to the idea of a central ''designer'', the field of '''artificial language evolution''' in which artificial languages are studied can be regarded as a sub-part of the more general [[cultural evolution]] studies.

==Origin==
The idea of creation of artificial language arose in 17th and 18th century as a result of gradually decreasing international role of Latin. The initial schemes ere mainly aimed at the development of a rational language free from inconsistence of living language and based on classification of concepts. The material of living languages also appears later.

== Motivation ==

The lack of empirical evidence in the field of [[evolutionary linguistics]] has led many researchers to adopt computer simulations as a means to investigate the ways in which artificial agents can self-organize languages with natural-like properties.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research is based on the hypothesis that [[natural language]] is a [[complex adaptive system]] that emerges through interactions between individuals and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of its users. By explicitly building all assumptions into computer simulations, this strand of research strives to experimentally investigate the dynamics underlying [[language change]] as well as questions regarding the [[origin of language]] under controlled conditions.

Due to its success the paradigm has also been extended to investigate the emergence of new languages in psychological experiments with humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Because the focus of the investigations lies on the conventionalisation dynamics and higher-level properties of the resulting languages rather than specific details of the conventions, artificially evolved languages are typically not documented or re-used outside the single experiment trial or simulation run in which they emerge. In fact, the limited size and short-lived nature of artificial languages are probably the only things that sets them apart from ''natural'' languages, since ''all'' languages are artificial insofar as they are [[conventional]] (see also [[Constructed language#Planned, constructed, artificial]]).

== Uses ==

Artificial languages have been used in research in developmental psycholinguistics. Because researchers have a great deal of control over artificial languages, they have used these languages in '''[[statistical language acquisition]]''' studies, in which it can be helpful to control the linguistic patterns heard by infants.

A '''buffer zone''' is generally a [[wikt:zone|zonal]] area that lies between two or more other areas (often, but not necessarily, [[country|countries]]), but depending on the type of buffer zone, the reason for it may be to segregate regions or to conjoin them.
Common types of buffer zones are [[demilitarized zone]]s, [[border zone]]s and certain restrictive easement zones and [[Green Belt|green belts]]. Such zones may be, but not necessarily be, comprised by a sovereign state, forming a [[buffer state]].

Buffer zones have various purposes, political or otherwise. They can be set up to prevent violence, protect the environment, protect residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents or natural disasters, keep prisoners intent on escaping from rapidly acquiring hostages or a hiding place, and have uses in several other scenarios. Buffer zones often result in large uninhabited regions which are themselves noteworthy in many increasingly developed or crowded parts of the world.{{examples|date=October 2013}}

== Conservation ==

For use in nature conservation, a buffer zone is often created to enhance the protection of areas under management for their [[biodiversity]] importance. The buffer zone of a [[protected area]] may be situated around the periphery of the region or may be a connecting zone within it which links two or more protected areas, therefore increasing their dynamics and conservation productivity. A buffer zone can also be one of the [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|protected area categories]] (e.g. category V or VI of IUCN Protected Area) or a classification scheme (e.g. NATURA 2000) depending on the conservation objective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/10/ A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: Buffer Zones]&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'buffer zone' initially gained prominence in the conservation of natural and cultural heritage through its usage in the establishment of [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Convention, and the term was intended to be used as follows:

{{cquote|A buffer zone serves to provide an additional layer of protection to a [[World Heritage site|World Heritage property]]. The concept of a buffer zone was first included in the ''Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention'' in 1977. In the most current version of the ''Operational Guidelines'' of 2005 the inclusion of a buffer zone into a nomination of a site to the World Heritage List is strongly recommended but not mandatory.|cquote}}

The buffer zone is one of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practices]] (BMPs). A buffer zone is intended to avert the effect of negative environmental or human influences, whether or not it embodies great natural or cultural value itself.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Oliver, and Piatti, Giovanna (ed.) ''World Heritage and
Buffer Zones'', International Expert Meeting on World Heritage and Buffer Zones Davos, Switzerland 11 – 14 March 2008 (Paris: UNESCO, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The importance and function of a buffer zone and the necessary protective measures derived thereof is a relatively new concept in conservation science and can differ greatly for each site.&lt;ref&gt;Ebregt, Arthur and de Greve, Pol, ''Buffer Zones and their Management: Policy and Best Practices for Terrestrial Ecosystems in Developing Countries'' (Wageningen: Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological functions (conservation) ==

=== Improve water quality ===
It shows that the quality of surface water in many countries is getting worse because humans do not use land properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=S. R.|last2=Caraco|first2=N. F.|last3=Correll|first3=D. L.|last4=Howarth|first4=R. W.|last5=Sharpley|first5=A. N.|last6=Smith|first6=V. H.|date=1998-08|title=Nonpoint Pollution of Surface Waters with Phosphorus and Nitrogen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2641247|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|issue=3|pages=559|doi=10.2307/2641247|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the buffer zone occupies a small area, it greatly improves the quality of water in the agricultural [[wikt:drainage basin|watershed]] due to its filtering effect on nutrients in the underground water and surface water. 

Because farmland is sprayed with large amounts of pesticides, some of which can seep into surface water. It will have a negative impact on fish and other aquatic life, which can lead to environmental damage. Vegetation buffer has been proved to be an effective filter for sediment, especially for sediment-bound pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syversen|first=Nina|last2=Bechmann|first2=Marianne|date=2004-05|title=Vegetative buffer zones as pesticide filters for simulated surface runoff|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=22|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|issn=0925-8574}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pesticides are sprayed in excess, a vegetation buffer can be built to reduce the penetration of pesticides into surface water. The buffer zone also prevents heavy metals or toxins from spreading to [[Protected area|protected areas]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deroanne-Bauvin|first=J|last2=Delcarte|first2=E|last3=Impens|first3=R|date=1987-01|title=Monitoring of lead deposition near highway: A ten years study|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|journal=Science of The Total Environment|volume=59|pages=257–266|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|issn=0048-9697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stabilize the riverbanks ===
When the riverbanks are low, due to the plant root can enter the interior of the riverbank vertically, the sediment of riverbank is affected by the action of plant root, and the ability to resist erosion is higher than that without plant root. But when the riverbanks are higher, the roots of the plants do not penetrate deeply into the soil, and the lakeshore soil is not very strong. Herbaceous plants can play a role to some extent, but in the long term, vegetation buffer zone can effectively solve the problem of water level rise and water erosion. 

The adsorption capacity of buffer zone can reduce the speed of surface runoff and increase the effective water content of soil. Through increasing soil organic matter content and improving soil structure, it has a positive effect on soil water storage performance. In addition, plant roots make the soil stronger, withstand waves and rainstorm, mitigate the erosion of riverbanks by [[Flood|floods]], and effectively control the erosion of the beach. 

=== Provide food and habitat to wildlife ===
The riparian buffer zones have been used in many areas to protect the habitats of many animals which are being devastated by increased human activity. The areas around the buffer zone can form the habitat of many animals, the woody parts and leaves of plants can become food for small [[Aquatic animal|aquatic animals]]. The buffer zone itself can also support the life activities of various [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and birds. Plants and animals can migrate or spread in response to these buffer zones and then increasing the biodiversity in the area. 

A study shows that the species and number of animals and plants in riparian zones are higher than in other ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturtevant|first=Brian R|date=1998-10|title=A model of wetland vegetation dynamics in simulated beaver impoundments|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=112|issue=2-3|pages=195–225|doi=10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|issn=0304-3800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their ability to provide abundant water, soft soil and stable climate, small animals such as ''[[Mouse-eared bat|Myotis]]'' and ''[[Marten|Martes]]'' prefer to live along riverbanks rather than in hilly areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=A. T.|date=1990-02-20|title=Use of Riparian and Upland Habitats by Small Mammals|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1381312|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=71|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.2307/1381312|issn=1545-1542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buffer zone can also provide a good environment for upland habitat, which is in line with the living conditions of freshwater [[Turtle|turtles]], making them more dependent on the wetland environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Vincent J.|last2=Gibbons|first2=J. Whitfield|date=1995-12|title=Terrestrial Buffer Zones and Wetland Conservation: A Case Study of Freshwater Turtles in a Carolina Bay|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1365–1369|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection level of the buffer zones will affect the habitat range of amphibians and [[Reptile|reptiles]], and the environmental management of the wetland habitat around buffer zone is extremely important. 

=== Provide [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value ===
As an important part of riparian zone, the vegetation buffer zones form a variety of [[landscape]], and the landscape pattern of combining land and water improves the aesthetic value of river basin landscape. The riparian buffer is rich in plant resources, and the wetland, grassland and forest ecosystem make the landscape more beautiful. In addition, some recreational facilities can be built in the buffer zone to provide better living conditions for residents or tourists and improve people's quality of life. 

In the buffer zone, those trees up to 6 meters tall greatly enhance the aesthetic value of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borin|first=Maurizio|last2=Passoni|first2=Matteo|last3=Thiene|first3=Mara|last4=Tempesta|first4=Tiziano|date=2010-01|title=Multiple functions of buffer strips in farming areas|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|journal=European Journal of Agronomy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|issn=1161-0301}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tall trees have luxuriant branches and leaves, especially their upright posture, making them of higher ornamental value. Some colorful landscape tree species can be planted on both sides of rivers with tourism and sightseeing value to improve the aesthetic value of the place. The establishment of vegetation buffer zone can increase green land, improve forest coverage, beautify environment and visual effect, improve people's living environment, enrich humanistic landscape and enhance aesthetic value. we need to call on people to pay attention to the importance of the buffer zone, encourage local residents to participate in the protection and management of the buffer zone, and set up checkpoints around the buffer zone to make it more secure and effective.

{{The Works of Aristotle}}

The '''''Categories''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Κατηγορίαι ''Katēgoriai''; [[Latin]] ''Categoriae'') is a text from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'' that enumerates all the possible kinds of things that can be the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] or the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of a [[proposition]].  They are "perhaps the single most heavily discussed of all Aristotelian notions".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robin 1995 "Logic". In J. Barnes (ed) ''The Cambridge companion to Aristotle'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is brief enough to be divided, not into books as is usual with [[Corpus Aristotelicum|Aristotle's works]], but into fifteen chapters.

The ''Categories'' places every [[Object (philosophy)|object]] of human [[apprehension (understanding)|apprehension]] under one of ten categories (known to medieval writers as the Latin term '''''praedicamenta''''').  Aristotle intended them to enumerate everything that can be expressed without composition or structure, thus anything that can be either the subject or the predicate of a proposition.

==The text==

===The antepraedicamenta===
The text begins with an explication of what is meant by "[[synonym]]ous," or [[Wiktionary:univocal|univocal]] words, what is meant by "[[homonym]]ous," or [[Wiktionary:equivocal|equivocal]] words, and what is meant by "[[paronym]]ous," or [[Wiktionary:denominative|denominative]] (sometimes translated "derivative") words.

It then divides forms of speech as being:
* Either simple, without composition or structure, such as "man," "horse," "fights," etc.
* Or having composition and structure, such as "a man fights," "the horse runs," etc.
Only composite forms of speech can be true or false.

Next, he distinguishes between what is said "of" a subject and what is "in" a subject.  What is said "of" a subject describes the kind of thing that it is as a whole, answering the question "what is it?"  What is said to be "in" a subject is a predicate that does not describe it as a whole but cannot exist without the subject, such as the shape of something.  The latter has come to be known as [[inherence]].

Of all the things that exist, 
# Some may be predicated (that is, said) of a subject, but are in no subject; as ''man'' may be predicated of James or John (one may say "John is a man"), but is not in any subject.
# Some are in a subject, but cannot be predicated of any subject. Thus a certain individual point of grammatical knowledge is in me as in a subject, but it cannot be predicated of any subject; because it is an individual thing.
# Some are both in a subject and able to be predicated of a subject, for example [[science]], which is in the mind as in a subject, and may be predicated of [[geometry]] as of a subject ("Geometry is science").
# Last, some things neither can be in any subject nor can be predicated of any subject. These are ''individual substances'', which cannot be predicated, because they are individuals; and cannot be in a subject, because they are substances.

===The praedicamenta===
Then we come to the [[category of being|categories]] themselves, whose definitions depend upon these four forms of predication.&lt;ref&gt;The forms of predication were called by the medieval [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] the ''[[antepraedicamenta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note, however, that although Aristotle has apparently distinguished between “being in a subject”, and “being predicated truly of a subject”, in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' these are treated as synonymous. This has led some to suspect that Aristotle was not the author of the ''Categories''{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's own text in Ackrill's standard English version is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Aristotle|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Translation is universally recognized as the standard English version of Aristotle. See the [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5967.html publisher’s blurb]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Of things said without any combination, each signifies either '''substance''' or '''quantity''' or '''qualification''' or a '''relative''' or '''where''' or '''when''' or '''being-in-a-position''' or '''having''' or '''doing''' or '''being-affected'''. To give a rough idea, examples of '''substance''' are man, horse; of '''quantity''': four-foot, five-foot; of '''qualification''': white, grammatical; of a '''relative''': double, half, larger; of '''where''': in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of '''when''': yesterday, last-year; of '''being-in-a-position''': is-lying, is-sitting; '''of having''': has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; '''of doing''': cutting, burning; of '''being-affected''': being-cut, being-burned. ([[Bekker numbers|1b25-2a4]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A brief explanation (with some alternative translations) is as follows:
# '''[[Substance theory|Substance]]''' ({{lang|grc|οὐσία}}, ''ousia'', essence or substance).&lt;ref&gt;Note that while Aristotle's use of ''&lt;span lang=el&gt;ousia'' is ambiguous between 'essence' and substance' there is a close link between them. See his [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Substance'' is that which cannot be predicated of anything or be said to be in anything. Hence, ''this particular man'' or ''that particular tree'' are substances. Later in the text, Aristotle calls these particulars “primary substances”, to distinguish them from ''secondary substances'', which are universals and ''can'' be predicated. Hence, Socrates is a primary substance, while man is a secondary substance. ''Man'' is predicated of Socrates, and therefore all that is predicated of man is predicated of Socrates.
# '''[[Quantity]]''' ({{lang|grc|ποσόν}}, ''poson'', how much). This is the extension of an object, and may be either [[wiktionary:Discrete|discrete]] or [[wiktionary:Continuous|continuous]].  Further, its parts may or may not have relative positions to each other. All medieval discussions about the nature of the continuum, of the infinite and the infinitely divisible, are a long footnote to this text.  It is of great importance in the development of mathematical ideas in the medieval and late Scholastic period. Examples: two cubits long, number, space, (length of) time.
# '''Qualification''' or [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] ({{lang|grc|ποιόν}}, ''poion'', of what kind or quality). This determination characterizes the nature of an object. Examples: white, black, grammatical, hot, sweet, curved, straight.
# '''Relative''' ({{lang|grc|πρός τι}}, ''pros ti'', toward something). This is the way one object may be related to another. Examples: double, half, large, master, knowledge.
# '''Where''' or [[Space|place]] ({{lang|grc|ποῦ}}, ''pou'', where). Position in relation to the surrounding environment. Examples: in a marketplace, in the Lyceum.
# '''When''' or [[time]] ({{lang|grc|πότε}}, ''pote'', when). Position in relation to the course of events. Examples: yesterday, last year.
# '''[[Human position|Being-in-a-position]]''', posture, attitude ({{lang|grc|κεῖσθαι}}, ''keisthai'', to lie). The examples Aristotle gives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting from an action: ''‘Lying’, ‘sitting’, ‘standing’.'' Thus ''position'' may be taken as the end point for the corresponding action. The term is, however, frequently taken to mean the relative position of the parts of an object (usually a living object), given that the position of the parts is inseparable from the state of rest implied.
# '''Having''' or state, [[Condition (philosophy)|condition]] ({{lang|grc|ἔχειν}}, ''echein'', to have or be). The examples Aristotle gives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting from an affection (i.e. being acted on): ''‘shod’, ‘armed’.'' The term is, however, frequently taken to mean the determination arising from the physical accoutrements of an object: one's shoes, one's arms, etc. Traditionally, this category is also called a ''habitus'' (from Latin ''habere'', to have).
# '''Doing''' or [[Action (philosophy)|action]] ({{lang|grc|ποιεῖν}}, ''poiein'', to make or do). The production of change in some other object (or in the agent itself ''qua'' other).
# '''Being affected''' or [[Affection (philosophy)|affection]] ({{lang|grc|πάσχειν}}, ''paschein'', to suffer or undergo). The reception of change from some other object (or from the affected object itself ''qua'' other). Aristotle's name ''paschein'' for this category has traditionally been translated into English as "affection" and "passion" (also "passivity"), easily misinterpreted to refer only or mainly to [[affection|affection as an emotion]] or to [[passion (emotion)|emotional passion]].  For action he gave the example, ''‘to lance’, ‘to cauterize’;'' for affection, ''‘to be lanced’, ‘to be cauterized.’'' His examples make clear that action is to affection as the active voice is to the passive voice — as ''acting'' is to ''being acted on''.

The first four are given a detailed treatment in four chapters, doing and being-affected are discussed briefly in a single small chapter, the remaining four are passed over lightly, as being clear in themselves.  Later texts by scholastic philosophers also reflect this disparity of treatment{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.

===The postpraedicamenta===
In this part,&lt;ref&gt;This part was probably not part of the original text, but added by some unknown editor, {{Harvtxt|Ackrill|1963}} pp. 69—70&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle sets forth four ways things can be said to be opposed. Next, the work discusses five senses wherein a thing may be considered ''prior'' to another, followed by a short section on simultaneity. Six forms of movement are then defined: generation, destruction, increase, diminution, alteration, and change of place. The work ends with a brief consideration of the word 'have' and its usage.

[[File:Dialectical Behavior Therapy Cycle EN.jpg|thumb|The stages used in dialectical behavior therapy]]

'''Dialectical behavior therapy''' ('''DBT''') is an evidence-based&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2963469 | pmid=20975829 | volume=3 | issue=9 | title=Dialectical behavior therapy: current indications and unique elements | year=2006 | journal=Psychiatry (Edgmont) | pages=62–8 | last1 = Chapman | first1 = AL}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychotherapy]] designed to help people suffering from [[borderline personality disorder]] (BPD). It has also been used to treat mood disorders as well as those who need to change patterns of behavior that are not helpful, such as [[self-harm]], [[suicidal ideation]], and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/an-overview-of-dialectical-behavior-therapy/0001096|title=An Overview of Dialectical Behavior Therapy – Psych Central|date=17 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach is designed to help people increase their emotional and cognitive regulation by learning about the triggers that lead to reactive states and helping to assess which coping skills to apply in the sequence of events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help avoid undesired reactions.

A modified form of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), DBT was developed in the late 1980s by [[Marsha M. Linehan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is DBT? |url=http://behavioraltech.org/resources/whatisdbt.cfm |publisher=The Linehan Institute |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a psychology researcher at the [[University of Washington]], to treat people with borderline personality disorder  and chronically suicidal individuals.

DBT combines standard cognitive behavioral techniques for [[Emotional self-regulation|emotion regulation]] and reality-testing with concepts of [[distress tolerance]], acceptance, and [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindful awareness]] largely derived from [[Buddhist]] meditative practice. DBT is based upon the biosocial theory and is the first therapy that has been experimentally demonstrated to be generally effective in treating BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Linehan | first1 = M.

==Overview==
Linehan observed "burn-out" in therapists after coping with "non-motivated" patients who repudiated cooperation in successful treatment. Her first core insight was to recognize that the chronically suicidal patients she studied had been raised in profoundly invalidating environments, and, therefore, required a climate of [[Mettā|loving-kindness]] and somewhat unconditional acceptance (not [[Carl Rogers]]' positive [[Humanistic psychology|humanist]] approach, but [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]]'s metaphysically neutral one), in which to develop a successful [[therapeutic alliance]].&lt;ref name="loving kindness" group="note"/&gt; Her second insight involved the need for a commensurate commitment from patients, who needed to be willing to accept their dire level of emotional dysfunction.

DBT strives to have the patient view the therapist as an [[allies|ally]] rather than an [[enemy|adversary]] in the treatment of psychological issues.  Accordingly, the therapist aims to accept and validate the client's feelings at any given time, while, nonetheless, informing the client that some feelings and behaviors are [[maladaptive]], and showing them better alternatives.&lt;ref name=nutshell/&gt;  DBT focuses on the client acquiring new skills and changing their behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choi-Kain|first1=Lois W.|last2=Finch|first2=Ellen F.|last3=Masland|first3=Sara R.|last4=Jenkins|first4=James A.|last5=Unruh|first5=Brandon T.|title=What Works in the Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=Current Behavioral Neuroscience Reports|date=3 February 2017|volume=4|issue=1|pages=21–30|doi=10.1007/s40473-017-0103-z|pmid=28331780|pmc=5340835}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ultimate goal of achieving a "life worth living", as defined by the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)?|url=https://behavioraltech.org/resources/faqs/dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt/|website=Behavioral Tech|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In DBT's biosocial theory of BPD, clients have a biological predisposition for [[emotional dysregulation]], and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Hannah|last2=Tickle|first2=Anna|last3=das Nair|first3=Roshan|title=Process and impact of dialectical behaviour therapy: A systematic review of perceptions of clients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder|journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice|date=16 October 2017|doi=10.1111/papt.12156|pmid=29034599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linehan and others combined a commitment to the core conditions of [[Acceptance and commitment therapy|acceptance and change]] through the  principle of [[dialectic]]s (in which thesis and antithesis are synthesized) and assembled an array of skills for emotional self-regulation drawn from Western psychological traditions, such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and an interpersonal variant, "[[assertiveness]] training", and Eastern meditative traditions, such as [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|Buddhist mindfulness meditation]]. One of her contributions was to alter the adversarial nature of the therapist-client relationship in favor of an alliance based on [[intersubjective]] [[tough love]].

All DBT can be said to involve 4 components:
*Individual – The therapist and patient discuss issues that come up during the week (recorded on diary cards) and follow a treatment target hierarchy. [[Self-harm|Self-injurious]] and [[suicide|suicidal]] behaviors, or life-threatening behaviors, take first priority. Second in priority are behaviors which, while not directly harmful to self or others, interfere with the course of treatment. These behaviors are known as [[Therapy interfering behavior|therapy-interfering behaviors]]. Third in priority are [[quality of life]] issues and working towards improving one's life generally. During the individual therapy, the therapist and patient work towards improving skill use. Often, a skills group is discussed and obstacles to acting skillfully are addressed.
*Group – A group ordinarily meets once weekly for two to two and a half hours and learns to use specific skills that are broken down into four skill modules: core [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]], interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance.
*Therapist Consultation Team – A therapist consultation team includes all therapists providing DBT.  The meeting occurs weekly and serves to support the therapist in providing the treatment.
*Phone Coaching – Phone coaching is designed to help generalize skills into the patient's daily life. Phone coaching is brief and limited to a focus on skills.

No one component is used by itself; the individual component is considered necessary to keep suicidal urges or uncontrolled emotional issues from disrupting group sessions, while the group sessions teach the skills unique to DBT, and also provide practice with regulating emotions and behavior in a [[Therapeutic community|social context]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  DBT skills training alone is being used to address treatment goals in some clinical settings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valentine|first1=Sarah E.|last2=Bankoff|first2=Sarah M.|last3=Poulin|first3=Renée M.|last4=Reidler|first4=Esther B.|last5=Pantalone|first5=David W.|title=The Use of Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training as Stand-Alone Treatment: A Systematic Review of the Treatment Outcome Literature|journal=[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]|date=January 2015|volume=71|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1002/jclp.22114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the broader goal of [[emotion regulation]] that is seen in DBT has allowed it to be used in new settings, for example, supporting [[parenting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zalewski|first1=Maureen|last2=Lewis|first2=Jennifer K|last3=Martin|first3=Christina Gamache|title=Identifying novel applications of dialectical behavior therapy: considering emotion regulation and parenting|journal=[[Current Opinion in Psychology]]|date=June 2018|volume=21|pages=122–126|doi=10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.02.013|pmid=29529427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four modules==
{{Close paraphrasing|date=December 2013}}

=== Mindfulness ===
[[File:Mindfulness1.png|right|thumb|A diagram used in DBT, showing that the Wise Mind is the overlap of the emotional mind and the reasonable mind.]]
{{further|Mindfulness (psychology)}}
Mindfulness is one of the core ideas behind all elements of DBT.  It is considered a foundation for the other skills taught in DBT, because it helps individuals accept and tolerate the powerful emotions they may feel when challenging their habits or exposing themselves to upsetting situations. The concept of mindfulness and the meditative exercises used to teach it are derived from traditional [[Buddhist]] practice, though the version taught in DBT does not involve any religious or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] concepts. Within DBT it is the capacity to pay attention, nonjudgmentally, to the present moment; about living in the moment, experiencing one's emotions and senses fully, yet with perspective. The practice of mindfulness can also be intended to make people more aware of their environments through their 5 senses: touch, smell, sight, taste, and sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linehaninstitute.org/mindfulness/|title=What is Mindfulness? – The Linehan Institute|website=www.linehaninstitute.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness relies heavily on the principle of acceptance, sometimes referred to as "radical acceptance".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Acceptance skills rely on the patient’s ability to view situations with no judgment, and to accept situations and their accompanying emotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This causes less distress overall, which can result in reduced discomfort and symptomology.

==== Acceptance and Change ====
The first few sessions of DBT introduce the dialectic of acceptance and change. The patient must first become comfortable with the idea of therapy; once the patient and therapist have established a trusting relationship, DBT techniques can flourish. An essential part of learning acceptance is to first grasp the idea of radical acceptance: radical acceptance embraces the idea that one should face situations, both positive and negative, without judgment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://behavioraltech.org/downloads/Research-on-DBT_Summary-of-Data-to-Date.pdf|title=DBT Skills Training Manual|last=Linehan|first=Marsha M.|date=2014|website=www.guilford.com|publisher=Guilford Press|access-date=11 December 2016|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance also incorporates mindfulness and emotional regulation skills, which depend on the idea of radical acceptance. These skills, specifically, are what set DBT apart from other therapies.

Often, after a patient becomes familiar with the idea of acceptance, they will accompany it with change. DBT has five specific states of change which the therapist will review with the patient: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/955646721|title=The dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook for bulimia using DBT to break the cycle and regain control of your life|last=Ellen.|first=Astrachan-Fletcher,|date=2009|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|isbn=9781608822560|oclc=955646721}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Precontemplation is the first stage, in which the patient is completely unaware of their problem. In the second stage, contemplation, the patient realizes the reality of their illness: this is not an action, but a realization. It is not until the third stage, preparation, that the patient is likely to take action, and prepares to move forward. This could be as simple as researching or contacting therapists. Finally, in stage 4, the patient takes action and receives treatment. In the final stage, maintenance, the patient must strengthen their change in order to prevent relapse. After grasping acceptance and change, a patient can fully advance to mindfulness techniques.

===="What" skills====
;Observe
:This is used to nonjudgmentally observe one's environment within or outside oneself. It is helpful in understanding what is going on in any given situation.

:DBT recommends developing a "teflon mind", the ability to let feelings and experiences pass without sticking in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Young |first=Kathleen |title=Mindfulness and DBT: "What skills" |work=Dr. Kathleen Young: Treating Trauma in Tucson |date=2010-03-11&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-12-20--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Describe
:This is used to express what one has observed with the observe skill. It is to be used without judgmental statements. This helps with letting others know what one has observed. Once the environment or inner state of mind has been observed with 5 senses, the individual can put words to observations and thus better understand the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-blog/dbt-mindfulness-what-skills|title=Core Mindfulness in Dialectical Behavior Therapy|last=|first=|date=2013-02-15|work=GoodTherapy.org Therapy Blog|access-date=2017-09-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Participate
:This is used to become fully focused on, and involved in, the activity that one is doing.

===="How" skills====
How to do Mindful Meditation.  There are many "scripted" meditations available on YouTube;  for example:  The 3 Minute Meditation;  or The Body Scan.  How to do it (The Body Scan):  You listen to the body scan and you allow your mind to focus on each aspect of your physical self, usually starting at your toes and ending at the top of your head.  As you listen to the body scan and allow your mind to focus in on the body, you will notice your "busy mind" will come into consciousness.  You will notice that thoughts and feelings will attempt to distract you from focusing on each part of your body.  You will notice that some of the thoughts and feelings may be distressing to you.  You may want to stop the meditation because it might be very painful emotionally or physically or because you are having negative or busy thoughts.  Sometimes memories may surface and they may also be difficult emotionally to accept.  How to do Mindful Meditation involves learning to acknowledge the thoughts, feelings and memories without needing to fight them or chase them away.  The paradox:  If we try to fight them, they seem to get bigger;  but when we move into acceptance, they seem to get smaller.  We enter the mindfulness meditation body scan, 3 minute meditation or other meditation sessions with no goals and with a non-striving stance.  Again, if we enter with a goal to "fix my problems by meditating", that goal and pressure to fix something tends to make the problems bigger.  To enter the meditation with a non-goal/non-striving attitude, so having no expectations, paradoxically, usually results in a reduction of stress, pain and other symptoms.
;Nonjudgmentally
:This is the action of describing the facts, and not thinking in terms of "good" or "bad," "fair," or "unfair." These are judgments, not factual descriptions. Being nonjudgmental helps you to get your point across in an effective manner without adding a judgment that someone else might disagree with.

;One-mindfully
:This is used to focus on one thing. One-mindfully is helpful in keeping one's mind from straying into "emotion" by a lack of focus.

;Effectively
:This is simply doing what works. It is a very broad-ranged skill and can be applied to any other skill to aid in being successful with said skill.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dbtselfhelp.com/html/dbt_skills_list.html| title=DBT Skills List | accessdate= 2010-04-26| author=Lisa Dietz| year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distress tolerance===
{{further|Distress tolerance}}
Many current approaches to mental health treatment focus on changing distressing events and circumstances such as dealing with the death of a loved one, loss of a job, serious illness, terrorist attacks and other traumatic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Road To Resiliance" Article: What is resilience?|publisher=American Psychological Association|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/road-resilience.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have paid little attention to accepting, finding meaning for, and tolerating distress.  This task has generally been tackled by person-centered, [[psychodynamic therapy|psychodynamic]], [[psychoanalytic therapy|psychoanalytic]], [[gestalt therapy|gestalt]], or [[narrative therapy|narrative]] therapies, along with religious and spiritual communities and leaders.  Dialectical behavior therapy emphasizes learning to bear pain skillfully.

Distress tolerance skills constitute a natural development from DBT mindfulness skills.  They have to do with the ability to accept, in a non-evaluative and nonjudgmental fashion, both oneself and the current situation.  Since this is a non-judgmental stance, this means that it is not one of approval or resignation. The goal is to become capable of calmly recognizing negative situations and their impact, rather than becoming overwhelmed or hiding from them. This allows individuals to make wise decisions about whether and how to take action, rather than falling into the intense, desperate, and often destructive emotional reactions that are part of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Distract with ACCEPTS
:This is a skill used to distract oneself temporarily from unpleasant emotions.

:*'''A'''ctivities – Use positive activities that you enjoy.
:*'''C'''ontribute – Help out others or your community.
:*'''C'''omparisons – Compare yourself either to people that are less fortunate or to how you used to be when you were in a worse state.
:*'''E'''motions (other) – cause yourself to feel something different by provoking your sense of humor or happiness with corresponding activities.
:*'''P'''ush away – Put your situation on the back-burner for a while. Put something else temporarily first in your mind.
:*'''T'''houghts (other) – Force your mind to think about something else.
:*'''S'''ensations (other) – Do something that has an intense feeling other than what you are feeling, like a cold shower or a spicy candy.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Self-soothe
:This is a skill in which one behaves in a comforting, nurturing, kind, and gentle way to oneself. You use it by doing something that is soothing to you. It is used in moments of distress or agitation.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt; [[New York Jets]] wide receiver [[Brandon Marshall]], who was diagnosed with BPD in 2011 and is a strong advocate for DBT, cited activities such as prayer and listening to jazz music as instrumental in his treatment.

;IMPROVE the moment
:This skill is used in moments of distress to help one relax.

:*'''I'''magery – Imagine relaxing scenes, things going well, or other things that please you.
:*'''M'''eaning – Find some purpose or meaning in what you are feeling.
:*'''P'''rayer – Either pray to whomever you worship, or, if not religious, chant a personal mantra.
:*'''R'''elaxation – Relax your muscles, breathe deeply; use with self-soothing.
:*'''O'''ne thing in the moment – Focus your entire attention on what you are doing right now. Keep yourself in the present.
:*'''V'''acation (brief) – Take a break from it all for a short period of time.
:*'''E'''ncouragement – Cheerlead yourself. Tell yourself you can make it through this and cope as it will assist your resilience and reduce your vulnerability.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;[[Decisional balance sheet|Pros and cons]]
:Think about the positive and negative things about not tolerating distress.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Radical acceptance
:Let go of fighting reality. Accept your situation for what it is.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Turning the mind
:Turn your mind toward an acceptance stance. It should be used with radical acceptance.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Willingness vs. willfulness
:Be willing and open to do what is effective. Let go of a willful stance which goes against acceptance. Keep your eye on the goal in front of you.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

===Emotion regulation===
{{further|Emotional self-regulation}}
Individuals with borderline personality disorder and suicidal individuals are frequently emotionally intense and [[labile affect|labile]]. They can be angry, intensely frustrated, depressed, or anxious.  This suggests that these clients might benefit from help in learning to regulate their emotions. Dialectical behavior therapy skills for emotion regulation include:&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M.H. (1987) In A. Tasman, R. E. Hales, &amp; A. J. Frances (eds.), ''American Psychiatric Press review of psychiatry'' (vol. 8, pp. 103–122). Washington DC: American Psychiatric Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Holmes, P.|author2=Georgescu, S.|author3=Liles, W.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=Further delineating the applicability of acceptance and change to private responses: The example of dialectical behavior therapy|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=7|issue=3|pages=301–311|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/7/3/311.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Identify and label emotions
*Identify obstacles to changing emotions
*Reduce vulnerability to ''emotion mind''
*Increase positive emotional events
*Increase mindfulness to current emotions
*Take opposite action
*Apply distress tolerance techniques&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

Emotional regulation skills are based on the theory that intense emotions are a conditioned response to troublesome experiences, the conditioned stimulus, and therefore, are required to alter the patient’s conditioned response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These skills can be categorized into four modules: understanding and naming emotions, changing unwanted emotions, reducing vulnerability, and managing extreme conditions:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

* '''Learning how to understand and name emotions:''' the patient focuses on recognizing their feelings. This segment relates directly to mindfulness, which also exposes a patient to their emotions. 
* '''Changing unwanted emotions:''' the therapist emphasizes the use of opposite-reactions, fact-checking, and problem solving to regulate emotions. While using opposite-reactions, the patient targets distressing feelings by responding with the opposite emotion. 
* '''Reducing vulnerability:''' the patient learns to accumulate positive emotions and to plan coping mechanisms in advance, in order to better handle difficult experiences in the future. 
* '''Managing extreme conditions:''' the patient focuses on incorporating their use of mindfulness skills to their current emotions, in order to remain stable and alert in a crisis situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Story of emotion====
:This skill is used to understand what kind of emotion one is feeling.
:#Prompting event
:#Interpretation of the event
:#Body sensations
:#Body language
:#Action urge
:#Action
:#Emotion name, based on previous items on list&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====PLEASE====
:This skill concerns ineffective health habits can make one more vulnerable to emotion mind. This skill is used to maintain a healthy body, so one is more likely to have healthy emotions.

::'''P'''hysica'''L''' illness (treat) – If you are sick or injured, get proper treatment for it.
::'''E'''ating (balanced) – Make sure you eat a proper healthy diet, and eat in moderation.
::'''A'''void mood-altering drugs – Do not take other non-prescribed medication or drugs. They may be very harmful to your body, and can make your mood unpredictable.
::'''S'''leep (balanced) – Do not sleep too much or too little. Eight hours of sleep is recommended per night for the average adult.
::'''E'''xercise – Make sure you get an effective amount of exercise, as this will both improve body image and release [[endorphin]]s, making you happier.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====Build mastery====
:Try to do one thing a day to help build competence and control.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====Opposite action====
:This skill is used when you have an unjustified emotion, one that doesn't belong in the situation at hand. You use it by doing the opposite of your urges in the moment. It is a tool to bring you out of an unwanted or unjustified emotion by replacing it with the emotion that is opposite.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====Problem solving====
:This is used to solve a problem when your emotion is justified. It is used in combination with other skills.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====Letting go of emotional suffering====
:Observe and experience your emotion, accept it, then let it go.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

===Interpersonal effectiveness===
Interpersonal response patterns taught in DBT skills training are very similar to those taught in many assertiveness and interpersonal problem-solving classes.  They include effective strategies for asking for what one needs, saying no, and coping with interpersonal conflict.

Individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] frequently possess good interpersonal skills in a general sense. The problems arise in the application of these skills to specific situations. An individual may be able to describe effective behavioral sequences when discussing another person encountering a problematic situation, but may be completely incapable of generating or carrying out a similar behavioral sequence when analyzing their own situation.

The interpersonal effectiveness module focuses on situations where the objective is to change something (e.g., requesting that someone do something) or to resist changes someone else is trying to make (e.g., saying no). The skills taught are intended to maximize the chances that a person's goals in a specific situation will be met, while at the same time not damaging either the relationship or the person's self-respect.

;DEEAR MAN – conveying one's needs to another person
:This acronym is used to aid one in getting what one wants when asking.
:*'''D'''escribe one's situation using specific factual statements about a recent situation.
:*'''E'''xpress the emotions experienced when the situation occurred, why this is an issue and how one feels about it.
:*'''E'''mpathy acknowledge what the other person experienced and their emotions
:*'''A'''ssert one's self by asking clearly and specifically for what behavior change the person seeks.
:*'''R'''einforce one's position by offering a positive consequence if one were to get what one wants.
:*'''M'''indful of the situation by focusing on what one wants and disregard distractions through validation/empathy and redirecting back to the point.
:*'''A'''ppear confident and assertive, even if one doesn't feel confident.
:*'''N'''egotiate with a hesitant person and come to a comfortable compromise on one's request.

;GIVE – giving something
:This skill set aids one maintaining one's relationships, whether they are with friends, co-workers, family, romantic partners, etc. It is to be used in conversations.
:*'''G'''entle: Use appropriate language, no verbal or physical attacks, no put downs, avoid sarcasm unless one is sure the person is alright with it, and be courteous and non-judgmental.
:*'''I'''nterested: When the person one is speaking to is talking about something, act interested in what is being said. Maintain eye contact, ask questions, etc. Avoid the use of a cell phone during an in-person conversation.
:*'''V'''alidate: Show understanding and sympathy of a person's situation. Validation can be shown through words, body language and/or facial expressions.
:*'''E'''asy Manner: Be calm and comfortable during conversation; use humor; smile.

;FAST – keeping [[Self-esteem|self-respect]]
:This is a skill to aid one in maintaining one's self-respect. It is to be used in combination with the other interpersonal effectiveness skills.
:*'''F'''air: Be fair to both oneself and the other person.
:*'''A'''pologies (few): Don't apologize more than once for what one has done ineffectively or for something that was ineffective.
:*'''S'''tick to One's Values: Stay true to what one believes in and stand by it. Don't allow others to encourage action against one's own values.
:*'''T'''ruthful: Don't lie. Lying can only pile up and damage relationships and one's self-respect.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;
This list does not include the "problem solving" module, the purpose of which is to practice being one's own therapist.

Statistically significant decreases in suicidal events and non-suicidal self-injurious events were seen overall (48% reduction, p=0.03; and 77% reduction, p=0.01; respectively). No statistically-significant difference between groups were seen for these episodes (p=.64).

=== Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ===
Exposure to [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|Complex trauma]], or the experience of traumatic events, can lead to the development of Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) in an individual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heide|first=F.

The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) does not recognize it in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]-5 (Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the manual used by providers to diagnose, treat and discuss mental illness), though some practitioners argue that CPTSD is separate from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Posttraumatic Stress Disorder]](PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Richard A.|date=August 2010|title=The Complexity of Complex PTSD|url=https://psychiatryonline.org/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychiatryonline.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.2010.10040606|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=167|issue=8|pages=879–881|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10040606|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPTSD is similar to PTSD in that its symptomatology is pervasive and includes cognitive, emotional, and biological domains, among others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson-Morrison|first=Debra|date=2017|title=Integrative play therapy with adults with complex trauma: A developmentally-informed approach.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pla0000036|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=172–183|doi=10.1037/pla0000036|issn=1939-0629}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPTSD differs from PTSD in that it is believed to originate in childhood interpersonal trauma, or chronic childhood stress&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, and that the most common precedents are sexual traumas.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maercker|first=Andreas|last2=Hecker|first2=Tobias|last3=Augsburger|first3=Mareike|last4=Kliem|first4=Sören|date=January 2018|title=ICD-11 Prevalence Rates of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in a German Nationwide Sample|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0000000000000790|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|pages=1|doi=10.1097/nmd.0000000000000790|issn=0022-3018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the prevalence rate for CPTSD is an estimated .5%, while PTSD's is 1.5%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Numerous definitions for CPTSD exist. Different versions are contributed by the World Health Organization ([[World Health Organization|WHO]]), The International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies ([[International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies|ISTSS]]), and individual clinicians and researchers. Most definitions revolve around criteria for PTSD with the addition of several other domains. While The APA may not recognize CPTSD, the WHO has recognized this syndrome in its 11th edition of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-11). The WHO defines CPTSD as a disorder following a single or multiple events which cause the individual to feel stressed or trapped, characterized by low self-esteem, interpersonal deficits, and deficits in affect regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=International Classification of Diseases|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_182865|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deficits in affect regulation, among other symptoms are a reason why CPTSD is sometimes compared with [[Borderline personality disorder|Borderline Personality Disorder]] (BPD).  

==== Similarities Between CPTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder ====
In addition to [[Emotional dysregulation|affect dysregulation]], case studies reveal that patients with CPTSD can also exhibit [[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]], mood swings, and fears of abandonment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawson|first=David M.|date=2017-06-21|title=Treating Adults With Complex Trauma: An Evidence-Based Case Study|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcad.12143|journal=Journal of Counseling &amp; Development|language=en|volume=95|issue=3|pages=288–298|doi=10.1002/jcad.12143|issn=0748-9633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like patients with Borderline Personality Disorder, patients with CPTSD were traumatized frequently and/or early in their development and never learned proper coping mechanisms. These individuals may use avoidance, substances, dissociation, and other maladaptive behaviors to cope.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thus, treatment for CPTSD involves stabilizing and teaching successful coping behaviors, affect regulation, and creating and maintaining interpersonal connections.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition to sharing symptom presentations, CPTSD and BPD can share neurophysiological similarities. For example, abnormal volume of the [[amygdala]] (emotional memory), [[hippocampus]] (memory), [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (emotion), and orbital prefrontal cortex (personality).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Julian D|last2=Courtois|first2=Christine A|date=2014|title=Complex PTSD, affect dysregulation, and borderline personality disorder|url=https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2051-6673-1-9|journal=Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation|language=En|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9|doi=10.1186/2051-6673-1-9|issn=2051-6673|pmc=4579513|pmid=26401293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another shared characteristic between CPTSD and BPD is the possibility for [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]. Further research is needed to determine the reliability of dissociation as a hallmark of CPTSD, however it is a possible symptom.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because of the two disorders’ shared symptomatology and physiological correlates, psychologists began hypothesizing that a treatment which was effective for one disorder may be effective for the other as well.

==== DBT as a Treatment for CPTSD ====
DBT’s use of acceptance and goal orientation as an approach to behavior change can help to instill empowerment and engage individuals in the therapeutic process. The focus on the future and change can help to prevent the individual from becoming from overwhelmed by their history of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fasulo|first=Samuel J.|last2=Ball|first2=Joanna M.|last3=Jurkovic|first3=Gregory J.|last4=Miller|first4=Alec L.|date=April 2015|title=Towards the Development of an Effective Working Alliance: The Application of DBT Validation and Stylistic Strategies in the Adaptation of a Manualized Complex Trauma Group Treatment Program for Adolescents in Long-Term Detention|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.2015.69.2.219|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=69|issue=2|pages=219–239|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.2015.69.2.219|issn=0002-9564}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a risk especially with CPTSD, as multiple traumas are common within this diagnosis. Generally, care providers address a client’s suicidality before moving on to other aspects of treatment. Because PTSD can make an individual more likely to experience suicidal ideation&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krysinska|first=Karolina|last2=Lester|first2=David|date=2010-01-29|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Suicide Risk: A Systematic Review|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F13811110903478997|journal=Archives of Suicide Research|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/13811110903478997|issn=1381-1118}}&lt;/ref&gt;, DBT can be an option to stabilize suicidality and aid in other treatment modalities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

Some critics argue that while DBT can be used to treat CPTSD, it is not significantly more effective than standard PTSD treatments. Further, this argument posits that DBT decreases self-injurious behaviors (such as cutting or burning) and increases interpersonal functioning but neglects core CPTSD symptoms such as impulsivity, [[Schema (psychology)|cognitive schemas]] (repetitive, negative thoughts), and emotions such as guilt and shame.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ISTSS reports that CPTSD requires treatment which differs from typical PTSD treatment, using a multiphase model of recovery, rather than focusing on traumatic memories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The recommended multiphase model consists of establishing safety, distress tolerance, and social relations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because DBT has four modules which generally align with these guidelines (Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, Affect Regulation, Interpersonal Skills) it is a treatment option. Other critiques of DBT discuss the time required for the therapy to be effective.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landes|first=Sara J.|last2=Garovoy|first2=Natara D.|last3=Burkman|first3=Kristine M.|date=2013-03-25|title=Treating Complex Trauma Among Veterans: Three Stage-Based Treatment Models|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.21988|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=69|issue=5|pages=523–533|doi=10.1002/jclp.21988|issn=0021-9762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals seeking DBT may not be able to commit to the individual and group sessions required, or their insurance may not cover every session.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Approximately 56% of individuals diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder also meet criteria for PTSD.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyers|first=Laura|last2=Voller|first2=Emily K.|last3=McCallum|first3=Ethan B.|last4=Thuras|first4=Paul|last5=Shallcross|first5=Sandra|last6=Velasquez|first6=Tina|last7=Meis|first7=Laura|date=2017-03-22|title=Treating Veterans With PTSD and Borderline Personality Symptoms in a 12-Week Intensive Outpatient Setting: Findings From a Pilot Program|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jts.22174|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|language=en|volume=30|issue=2|pages=178–181|doi=10.1002/jts.22174|issn=0894-9867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the correlation between Borderline Personality Disorder traits and trauma, some settings began using DBT as a treatment for traumatic symptoms.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steil|first=Regina|last2=Dittmann|first2=Clara|last3=Müller-Engelmann|first3=Meike|last4=Dyer|first4=Anne|last5=Maasch|first5=Anne-Marie|last6=Priebe|first6=Kathlen|date=January 2018|title=Dialectical behaviour therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder related to childhood sexual abuse: a pilot study in an outpatient treatment setting|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F20008198.2018.1423832|journal=European Journal of Psychotraumatology|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1423832|doi=10.1080/20008198.2018.1423832|issn=2000-8198|pmc=5774406|pmid=29372016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some providers opt to combine DBT with other PTSD interventions, such as [[Prolonged exposure therapy|Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)]] (repeated, detailed description of the trauma in a psychotherapy session) or [[Cognitive processing therapy|Cognitive Processing Therapy (]]CPT) (psychotherapy which addresses cognitive schemas related to traumatic memories). For example, a regimen which combined PE and DBT would include teaching mindfulness skills and distress tolerance skills, then implementing PE. The individual with the disorder would then be taught acceptance of a trauma's occurrence and how it may continue to affect them throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Participants of clinical trials such as these exhibited a decrease in symptoms, and throughout the 12-week trial, no self-injurious or suicidal behaviors were reported.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Another argument which supports the use of DBT as a treatment for trauma hinges upon PTSD symptoms such as emotion regulation and distress. Some PTSD treatments such as exposure therapy may not be suitable for individuals whose distress tolerance and/or emotion regulation is low.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Amy W.|last2=Rizvi|first2=Shireen L.|last3=Harned|first3=Melanie S.|date=2007|title=Applications of dialectical behavior therapy to the treatment of complex trauma-related problems: When one case formulation does not fit all|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jts.20268|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=391–400|doi=10.1002/jts.20268|issn=0894-9867}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biosocial theory]] posits that emotion dysregulation is caused by an individual’s heightened emotional sensitivity combined with environmental factors (such as invalidation of emotions, continued abuse/trauma), and tendency to [[Rumination (psychology)|ruminate]] (repeatedly think about a negative event and how the outcome could have been changed).&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Florez|first=Ivonne Andrea|last2=Bethay|first2=J.

Noteworthy is that DBT has often been modified based on the population being treated. For example, in veteran populations DBT is modified to include exposure exercises and accommodate the presence of [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), and insurance coverage (ie shortening treatment).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denckla|first=Christy A.|last2=Bailey|first2=Robert|last3=Jackson|first3=Christie|last4=Tatarakis|first4=John|last5=Chen|first5=Cory K.|date=November 2015|title=A Novel Adaptation of Distress Tolerance Skills Training Among Military Veterans: Outcomes in Suicide-Related Events|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S107772291400042X|journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice|volume=22|issue=4|pages=450–457|doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2014.04.001|issn=1077-7229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Populations with [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] BPD may need to spend longer in the “Establishing Safety” phase.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In adolescent populations, the skills training aspect of DBT has elicited significant improvement in emotion regulation and ability to express emotion appropriately.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In populations with comorbid substance abuse, adaptations may be made on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Litt|first=Lisa|date=2013-03-26|title=Clinical Decision Making in the Treatment of Complex PTSD and Substance Misuse|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.21989|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=69|issue=5|pages=534–542|doi=10.1002/jclp.21989|issn=0021-9762}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a provider may wish to incorporate elements of [[Motivational interviewing|Motivational Interviewing]] (psychotherapy which uses empowerment to inspire behavior change). The degree of substance abuse should also be considered. For some individuals, substance use is the only coping behavior they know, and as such the provider may seek to implement skills training before target substance reduction. Inversely, a client’s substance abuse may be interfering with attendance or other treatment compliance and the provider may choose to address the substance use before implementing DBT for the trauma.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

'''Direct trade''' is a form of [[procurement|sourcing]] practiced by certain [[coffee roaster]]s and [[chocolate maker]]s who build direct relationships with the farmers and processors who sell them coffee or cocoa beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/dining/12coff.html|title=To Burundi and Beyond for Coffee’s Holy Grail|last=Meehan|first=Peter|date=2007-09-12|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single set of direct trade standards, and specific trade practices vary as a reflection of business and ethical priorities of the roaster or maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexiconoffood.com/labeling-and-certification/direct-trade|title=Direct Trade|work=Lexicon of Food|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, however, direct trade practitioners view their model as one of mutually-beneficial and transparent trade relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethicalcoffee.net/direct.html|title=What is Direct Trade coffee?|website=www.ethicalcoffee.net|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates explicitly define direct trade as an alternative to [[fairtrade certification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexiconoffood.com/image/direct-vs-fair-trade-coffee|title=Contrasting Direct Trade and Fair Trade Coffee|date=2014-10-02|work=Lexicon of Food|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they seek to address perceived limitations of [[fair trade]] by:

'''Fair Trade''' practices -- such as those certified by Fairtrade International -- are designed to promote ethical trading standards to the benefit of the poorest of coffee producers in developing countries, providing opportunities for assistance with infrastructural growth, access to credit and financing to the farmers, and ensure ethical labor regulations for certified farms. Many studies have found that Fair Trade has brought stabilization to the world coffee market, as well as improved many coffee producing farms world wide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingenbleek, P., &amp; Reinders, T.|first=|date=2013|title=The development of a market for sustainable coffee in The Netherlands: Rethinking the contribution of Fair Trade|url=|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=113 (3).|pages=461-474|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the efficacy of Fair Trade practices have become under a wide range of criticism ranging from less than advertised, to beneficial to large plantations but detrimental to the smallest of farms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruben, R., &amp; Fort.|first=|date=2011|title=The impact of Fair Trade certification for coffee farmers in Peru.|url=|journal=World Development.|volume=40 (3)|pages=570-582|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, unethical disbursement of profits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths, P.|first=|date=July 2011|title=Ethical objections to Fairtrade.|url=|journal=Journal of Business Ethics.|volume=105 (3)|pages=357|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and even claims of a corrupt tool for marketing and profit causing death and destruction to coffee producers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole, N., &amp; Brown, K.|first=|date=2014|title=The problem with Fair Trade coffee.|url=|journal=Contexts, ,13 (1)|volume=13 (1)|pages=13 (1)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A study from 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruben, R., &amp; Zuniga, G.|first=|date=2011|title=How standards compete : Comparative impact of coffee certification schemes in Northern Nicaragua.|url=|journal=Supply Chain Management: An International Journal|volume=16(2)|pages=98-109.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that Fair Trade strategies have a greater impact on the overall infrastructure development of growing coffee farms, and direct trades models show to have a greater impact on increased wages, and an overall improved quality of life, reported by the farmers included in the study. 

While such practices are common among self-identified direct trade coffee roasters and chocolate makers, there is no single definition of direct trade nor set of common standards. A lack of third-party accountability is a frequent criticism leveled by direct trade critics, which include former proponents frustrated by what they perceive as a trend of large, marketing-savvy roasters "who bombard consumers with the term despite not offering any clear definition of its meaning, any evidence of an actual direct trade scheme or the slightest shred of transparency regarding sourcing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycoffeenews.com/2017/05/10/direct-trade-is-dead-long-live-its-founding-principles/|title=Direct Trade is Dead, Long Live its Founding Principles|date=2017-05-10|website=Daily Coffee News by Roast Magazine|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004''' (c 28) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It is concerned with criminal justice and concentrates upon legal protection and assistance to victims of crime, particularly [[domestic violence]]. It also expands the provision for trials without a jury, brings in new rules for trials for causing the death of a child or vulnerable adult, and permits [[bailiff]]s to use force to enter homes.&lt;ref name=guardian20609/&gt;

==Reforms to police and court procedure==
===Non-molestation orders===
Non-molestation orders under the [[Family Law Act 1996]] were amended to provide a criminal sanction for non-compliance, with a maximum sentence of 5 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/28/section/1 section 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances in which such orders could be imposed was extended to include same-sex couples and cohabiting couples on an equal footing with married couples. Former cohabitants are also included.

===Restraining orders===
Restraining orders (preventing the recipient from doing anything specified in the order) can be imposed upon acquitted defendants.&lt;ref&gt;The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/28/section/12 section 12]&lt;/ref&gt; They are imposed if the court "considers it necessary to do so to protect a person from harassment by the defendant". The Court of Appeal in allowing an appeal against conviction may also remit the matter to the Crown Court to consider a restraining order in respect of the otherwise successful appellant.

===Common assault===
The Act deemed [[common assault]] an [[arrestable offence]].&lt;ref&gt;The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/28/section/10 section 10]&lt;/ref&gt; The practical effect of this change was that the police could arrest a suspect at the scene without a warrant, rather than potentially be compelled to leave the suspected assailant with his or her alleged victim. Previously the police would have to allege  [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]], which was arrestable, in order to detain the suspected assailant in borderline cases.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

However, the concept of "arrestable offence" was abolished on 1 January 2006. {{As of|2007}}, police can effect an arrest, even in the case of suspected common assault, in order "to prevent the person in question causing physical injury to himself or any other person."&lt;ref&gt;The [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], section 24(5)(c)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act specified common assault as an [[alternative verdict]] to a count on an [[aggravated assault]] in the [[Crown Court]], though it is not itself an [[indictable offence]].&lt;ref&gt;s.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitness to plead===
Judges, not a specially empanelled jury, now decide if a defendant is fit to plead.".&lt;ref&gt;The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/28/section/22 section 22]&lt;/ref&gt; The regime for dealing with defendants who are unfit to plead or not guilty by reason of insanity (that is, committed the physical acts constituting the offence but without the sane intent) has also been modified. The court, not the Home Secretary, makes the assessment (requiring medical evidence to do so) whether the defendant should be committed to a psychiatric hospital.

==Trial by jury of sample counts only==
Trials with a substantial number of charges can now be split into two phases: trial by jury of "specimen counts" and judge-only trial of the remaining counts.&lt;ref&gt;The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/28/section/17 section 17]&lt;/ref&gt; This further expands the circumstances in which trials can be heard without a jury (see the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]).

The prosecution must satisfy the court that three conditions are met:
* given the number of counts, a trial by jury involving all of them would be impracticable
* each count or group of counts to be tried by a jury can be regarded as a sample of counts for judge-only trial
* it is in the interests of justice

The judge should take into account any ways that jury trial can be made easier, but no such measure should result in a trial where the defendant faces a lesser sentence than would be available with the new measures.

==Causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult==
===Previous difficulties with the law===
An intractable legal problem had arisen in relation to cases where a child or vulnerable adult cared for by two people dies as a result of ill-treatment. It is known that at least one of two people is responsible, but not which. This problem had been analysed in a number of cases. The [[Court of Appeal]] in ''Lane v Lane''&lt;ref&gt;(1986) 82 Cr App R 5&lt;/ref&gt; held that neither person could be convicted, nor the trial proceed past the end of the prosecution case, because there was no evidence specifically pointing to a certain defendant.
[[Lord Goddard]] earlier commented in ''Regina v Abbott''&lt;ref&gt;[1955] 2 QB 497&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Probably one or other must have committed it, but there was not evidence which, and although it is unfortunate that a guilty party cannot be brought to
justice, it is far more important that there should not be a miscarriage of justice and that the law maintained that the prosecution should prove its case."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Law Commission's report commented that this meant one or other parent were potentially "getting away with murder".&lt;ref&gt;See Origins section, Law Commission report 282, paragraph 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act deals with the problem in two ways: firstly by creating an offence of "causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult", and secondly by amending the rules of court procedure to require joint defendants to give their account of events in the witness box, effectively forcing them to incriminate the other if appropriate.

===The new offence===
The offence of "causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult", now referred to as the "new offence", is committed under section 5 of the Act&lt;ref&gt;The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/28/section/5 section 5]&lt;/ref&gt; if the following four conditions apply:
* A child or vulnerable adult dies as a result of an unlawful act of a person in the "same household"
* The defendant was also member of the same household, with frequent contact with the victim, and present at the time of the unlawful act
* There was a risk of serious physical harm to the victim at the time
* Either:
** The defendant did the unlawful act (that is, directly caused the death), or
** Was aware of the risk (or ought to have been), didn't take reasonable steps to do anything about it, and foresaw the circumstances which led up to the unlawful act causing death

Therefore if it can be established that a child or vulnerable adult died as a result of an unlawful act, it need not be proved which of the two responsible members of the household either caused the death or allowed it to happen.

If there was no obvious history of violence, or any reason to suspect it, then the other members of the household would not be guilty of this offence, even in clear cases of homicide. Where there is no reason to suspect the victim is at risk, other members of the household cannot reasonably be expected to have taken steps to prevent the abuse.

===New procedure===
Court procedure is amended to restrict the circumstances in which the trial can be stopped at the end of the prosecution case and before the defence case.

The ambit of the "[[adverse inference]]" (right of the jury to make assumptions about any part of the case, including the guilt of the defendant, based upon his or her failure to answer any question put in court)&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], 
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/section/35 section 35]&lt;/ref&gt; is extended to include an inference on a joint charge of homicide (murder and manslaughter) and the new offence; this means that if a person is charged with either (or both) homicide offences and this new offence, then silence in the witness box can imply guilt of homicide as well as the new offence. This is subject to the usual safeguard&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/section/38 section 38(3)]; see also Murray v UK (1996) 22 EHRR 29, [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]].&lt;/ref&gt; that a person cannot be convicted solely upon the basis of their silence.

The point at which a "no case to answer" submission (see definition&lt;ref&gt;A submission that the prosecution have shown no, or fundamentally inadequate, evidence of the defendant's guilt on all elements of the offence; thus securing a judge-directed acquittal. This can occur at the end of the prosecution case before the defendant is under pressure to give evidence&lt;/ref&gt;) can be made has in certain circumstances been moved to the end of the whole case, not just the prosecution. Joint charges of homicide and the new offence can only be dismissed at the end of the whole case (if the new offence has survived past that stage as well). 

The new offence will survive the "no case to answer" test as long as the fundamentals of the offence are demonstrated - the prosecution do not have to show whether the defendant caused or allowed the death to happen. The defendant will be under pressure to give evidence about what occurred - not to do so would result in the adverse inference being drawn.

=== Criticism ===

A number of issues have been pointed out by legal scholars with the current drafting. David Ormerod, writing in the criminal law textbook ''Smith and Hogan'', notes that the Act deliberately does not define what counts as a "household". Additionally, the Act does not adequately cover some classes of carers who do not live in a household residence but have regular contact—domestic nannies, for instance. The law also leaves unclear whether one carer is legally responsible for not taking steps to protect a vulnerable victim from the risky behaviour of another of his or her carers.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Hogan, 12th edition, p.564-565&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bailiff powers==
The Act permits [[bailiff]]s to use force to enter homes, overturning a centuries-old doctrine, confirmed by ''[[Semayne's case]]'' (1604), that "[[an Englishman's home is his castle]]".&lt;ref name=guardian20609&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 June 2009, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jun/02/bailiffs-karen-buck The poorest need shielding from bailiffs]&lt;/ref&gt; This had been described in the eighteenth century by [[William Blackstone]], who wrote in Book 4, Chapter 16&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch16.htm Blackstone's Commentaries - Book the Fourth - Chapter the Sixteenth : Of Offenses Against the Habitations of Individuals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503193949/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch16.htm |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'':
{{quote|text=''And the law of England has so particular and tender a regard to the immunity of a man's house, that it stiles it his castle, and will never suffer it to be violated with immunity: agreeing herein with the sentiments of ancient Rome, as expressed in the works of Tully;&lt;ref&gt;"Tully" is a common abbreviation for Marcus Tullius [[Cicero]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''quid enim sanctius, quid omni religione munitius, quam domus unusquisque civium?''&lt;ref&gt;''What more sacred, what more strongly guarded by every holy feeling, than a man's own home?''&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason no doors can in general be broken open to execute any civil process; though, in criminal causes, the public safety supersedes the private. Hence also in part arises the animadversion of the law upon eaves-droppers, nusancers, and incendiaries: and to this principal it must be assigned, that a man may assemble people together lawfully without danger of raising a riot, rout, or unlawful assembly, in order to protect and defend his house; which he is not permitted to do in any other case.''}}

In 2009 charities providing advice to debtors said they were seeing bailiffs threatening to break in unless the debtor paid the full fine immediately, as well court and bailiff costs. Previously, charities had been able to advise debtors that bailiffs did not have the right to force entry, and the fine could be referred back to the courts and affordable payment schedules worked out.&lt;ref name=guardian20609/&gt;

In [[economics]], an '''Edgeworth box''', named after [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Schotter |first = Andrew |year = 2008 |title = Microeconomics: A Modern Approach |publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] |isbn = 978-0-324-31584-4 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oH--t0SX7nEC&amp;pg=PA524 |page = 524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a way of representing various distributions of [[Resource (economics)|resources]]. Edgeworth made his presentation in his book ''Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences'', 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author = Lluís Barbé |year = 2010 |title = Francis Ysidro Edgeworth: a portrait with family and friends |publisher = [[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |isbn = 978-1-84844-716-5 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=m93iASHrXnEC&amp;pg=PR12 |page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Edgeworth's original two-axis depiction was developed into the now familiar box diagram by [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] in his 1906 book "Manual of Political Economy"&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/manualedieconomi00pareuoft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.policonomics.com/edgeworth-box/&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized in a later exposition by [[Arthur Lyon Bowley|Bowley]].
The modern version of the diagram is commonly referred to as the '''Edgeworth–Bowley box'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Humphrey |first1 = Thomas M. |title = Early History of the Box Diagram |journal = Economic Quarterly |url = https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/1996/winter/pdf/history.pdf |accessdate = 30 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edgeworth box is used frequently in [[general equilibrium theory]]. It can aid in [[Representation (mathematics)|representing]] the [[competitive equilibrium]] of a simple system or a range of such outcomes that satisfy [[economic efficiency]]. It can also show the difficulty of moving to an efficient outcome in the presence of [[bilateral monopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;John Creedy, 2008. "Francis Ysidro (1845–1926)," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000041&amp;edition=current&amp;q=edgeworth&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=3 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, it serves as a precursor to the [[bargaining problem]] of [[game theory]] that allows a unique numerical solution.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John F. Nash, Jr.]], 1950. "The Bargaining Problem," ''Econometrica'', 18(2),  pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1907266 155-162].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Serrano, 2008. "bargaining," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_B000073&amp;edition=current&amp;q=bargaining&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Imagine two people (Octavio and Abby) with a fixed amount of resources between the two of them &amp;mdash; say, 10 liters of water and 20 hamburgers.  If Abby takes 4 liters of water and 5 hamburgers, then Octavio is left with 6 liters of water and 15 hamburgers.  The Edgeworth box is a rectangular diagram with Octavio's [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] on one corner (represented by the O) and Abby's origin on the opposite corner (represented by the A).  The width of the box is the total amount of one good, and the height is the total amount of the other good.  Thus, every possible division of the goods between the two people can be represented as a point in the box.

[[Indifference curve]]s (derived from each consumer's [[utility function]]) can be drawn in the box for both Abby and Octavio. The points on each person's indifference curve represent equally liked combinations of quantities of the two goods for that person. Hence Abby is indifferent between one combination of goods and another on any one of her indifference curves, and the same is true for Octavio. For example, Abby might value 1 liter of water and 13 hamburgers the same as 5 liters of water and 4 hamburgers, or 3 liters and 10 hamburgers. There are an infinite number of such curves that could be drawn among the combinations of goods for each consumer (Octavio or Abby).

With Octavio's origin (the point representing zero of each good) at the lower left corner of the Edgeworth box and with Abby's origin at the upper right corner, typically Octavio's indifference curves would be convex to his origin and Abby's would be convex to her origin.

When an indifference curve for Abby crosses one of the indifference curves for Octavio at more than one point (so the two curves are not tangent to each other), a space in the shape of a lens is created by the crossing of the two curves; any point in the interior of this lens represents an allocation of the two goods between the two people such that both people would be better off, since the point is on an indifference curve farther from both of their respective origins, and thus, each individual achieves a higher utility.

==Pareto set==

[[File:Contract-curve-on-edgeworth-box.svg|thumb|400px|right|Blue Pareto set (efficient locus) showing points of tangency of [[indifference curve]]s in an Edgeworth box]]

Wherever one of these curves for Abby happens to be [[tangent]] to a curve of Octavio's, a combination of the two goods is identified that yields both consumers a level of utility that could not be improved for one person by a reallocation without decreasing the utility of the other person. Such a combination of goods is said to be [[Pareto optimal]]. The set of tangential points of contact between pairs of indifference curves, if all traced out, will form a trace connecting Octavio's origin (O) to Abby's (A). This curve connecting points O and A, which will not in general be a straight line, is called the [[Pareto set]] or the efficient locus, since each point on the curve is Pareto optimal.

The vocabulary used to describe different objects which are part of the Edgeworth box diverges.  The entire Pareto set is sometimes called the [[contract curve]], while [[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell]], Winston, and Green (1995) restrict the definition of the contract curve to only those points on the Pareto set which make both Abby and Octavio at least as well off as they are at their initial endowment.  Other authors who have a more [[game theory|game theoretical]] bent, such as Martin Osborne and [[Ariel Rubinstein]] (1994), use the term [[core (economics)|core]] for the section of the Pareto set which is at least as good for each consumer as the initial endowment.

In order to calculate the Pareto set, the slope of the indifference curves for both consumers must be calculated at each point.  That slope is the negative of the [[marginal rate of substitution]], so since the Pareto set is the set of points where both indifference curves are tangent, it is also the set of points where each consumer's marginal rate of substitution is equal to that of the other person.

[[File:Shimer Class Chicago.PNG|thumb|An egalitarian dialogue at [[Shimer College]].]]
'''Egalitarian dialogue''' is a dialogue in which contributions are considered according to the validity of their reasoning, instead of according to the status or position of power of those who make them.  Although previously used widely in the [[social sciences]] and in reference to the [[Bakhtin]]ian philosophy of [[dialogue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bakhtin in contexts: across the disciplines |page=142
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=081011268X|isbn=081011268X
|first=Amy |last=Mandelker |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was first systematically applied to [[dialogical education]] by [[Ramón Flecha]] in his 2000 work ''Sharing Words. Theory and Practice of Dialogic Learning''.

Egalitarian dialogue is one of the seven principles of [[dialogic learning]] (Flecha, 2000), the others being cultural intelligence, equality of differences, creation of meaning, instrumental dimension, solidarity, and transformation. The principle of egalitarian dialogue is deeply interrelated with the other principles of dialogic learning. By recognizing all people's [[cultural intelligence]] and respecting differences from an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] standpoint, egalitarian dialogue encourages individuals to create meaning, develop solidarity among different people, and create new instrumental dimensions. This interdependence among the principles of dialogic learning favors constant social transformation.

==Equality of differences==
The recognition and respect of different types of knowledge raises the awareness that each person has something to share, something different and equally important. Therefore, the wider the diversity of voices engaged in egalitarian dialogue, the better the knowledge that can be dialogically constructed. In this sense, dialogic learning is oriented towards equality of differences, stating that true equality includes the right to live in a different way (Flecha, 2000). This perspective, which [[Paulo Freire]] (1997) calls ''unity in diversity'', never defends diversity or difference without simultaneously proposing equality and fairness toward different individual and groups.

Equality of differences is also enacted in the Learning Communities (Valls, 2000; Elboj et al., 2001). The Learning Communities are schools in Spain, Brazil and Chile that have undergone a process of educational and social transformation based on dialogic learning. In the learning communities, the equality of differences principle is shown, among other practices, in the interactive groups (Aubert et al., 2004), where students and adults who have different levels of instruction and are from different backgrounds, teach and learn from each other. Those interactions create [[Zone of Proximal Development]] (Vygotsky, 1978), this showing that [[meaning-making]] and learning do not depend solely on the intervention of professionals, but on all the knowledge brought by anyone related to the students (Flecha, 2000).

==Creation of meaning==
Habermas (2004a, 2004b) has stressed the need to recover the [[lifeworld]] from its systemic colonization by the “steering media” of power, law and bureaucratization. The systemic decolonization is a way of reinventing democracy in public spaces and institutions and for recovering meaning. Habermas' concept of [[lifeworld]] refers to the everyday contexts where people relate to each other and create meaning and structures to organize themselves. In [[Habermas]]' view, and also from a dialogic learning perspective, subjects create meaning through [[intersubjectivity]] or the interaction among subjects engaged in egalitarian dialogue.

Any person can engage in such meaning making dialogue because humans have ''epistemological curiosity'', which when expressed in egalitarian dialogue can criticize and end with what Freire (2001) called the ''bureaucratizing of the mind'', an invisible power of alienating domestication. Such debureaucratization process can be seen in Dialogic Musical Gatherings (CONFAPEA, 2005), where people develop their epistemological curiosity listening to classical music and later engaging in a dialogue about the instruments that were playing, about the composer, his life and his position in a historical context, the style of the music listened to and its relationship with the cultural claims of each participant belonging to the Music Gathering, etc. In this process, meaning is created and recovered because music escapes the system and goes back to people's [[lifeworld]] tearing down the walls of cultural [[elitism]].

==Instrumental dimension==
The Instrumental Dimension of learning, as a principle of dialogic learning, should not be confused with instrumentality or the technocratic colonization of learning. In dialogic learning, as in [[Habermas]] (1984), the instrumental and [[communicative rationality]] are not opposed to each other, but instrumental learning becomes more intense and profound when situated in an adequate dialogical framework. The ability to select and process information is the cognitive tool that best enables one to function confidently in today's society. Dialogue and reflection encourage the development of that ability. Relationships with other people put not only diverse information but also its selection and processing at our disposal(Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16). In addition, "when dialogue is egalitarian, it encourages intense reflection, since people need to understand other positions and express their own" (Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16). In this sense, in egalitarian dialogue, procedures and ends are dialogically agreed. Those work for purposes of understanding, and do not let interactants hide themselves behind means that obscure exclusionary interests.

In education without dialogue, every single item becomes a target for power claims, even methods and instruments for learning, and therefore, the bureaucratization of those elements is inevitable. For this reason, the instrumental dimension of dialogic learning is never purely instrumental. It is also ethical, respectful, characterized by a sense of solidarity that contributes to break up the existing educational structure.

==Solidarity==
[[Social solidarity|Solidarity]] feeds dialogue, but at the same time, egalitarian dialogue, as essential communication, must underlie any act of solidarity (Freire, 1970). That is why, ''egalitarian educational practices must be grounded in conceptions of solidarity'' (Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;20).

The emphasis of [[dialogic learning]] on solidarity as the wheel that drives this perspective on education can be evidenced in the Learning Communities. For instance, in the School for Adults La Verneda-Sant Martí (Sánchez, 1999; Flecha, 2000) all the activities are open to anyone from the community and the city, and are also deeply integrated in the neighborhood. Because of discussing books from the classic literature through dialogic learning, the dialogic literary gatherings help improve the lives of the participants in the gathering but also of other people in the school and the neighborhood, when for example some participants in the gathering  take part of different committees of the school that plan actions of social transformation in the neighborhood, the city and beyond.

In this sense, solidarity is not only understood as an act for identifying and denouncing problems, but also as means to solve them. Solidarity does not only imply denouncing the process of dehumanization, but also announcing the dream of a new society (Freire, 2001). In this regard, solidarity goes beyond rebellious attitudes that do not propose an alternative, and reaches a more radically critical and dialogical position that implies the transformation of oneself, institutions, and the world.

'''Electoral Calculus''' is a [[political forecasting]] [[web site]] which attempts to predict future [[United Kingdom general election]] results. It considers national factors but excludes local issues.

== History ==
The site was developed by Martin Baxter,&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=20100408-11403823 | title=Electoral Calculus | publisher=[[Intute]]  |accessdate=17 October 2011 |quote=An independent UK election prediction site maintained by Martin Baxter. He attempts to apply scientific techniques to the electoral geography of Britain to predict the future general election results.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is a financial analyst specialising in [[mathematical modelling]].&lt;ref name="open ruppert 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruppert|first=Evelyn|title=Data mobilisation and the UK 2010 Election|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/cresc/?p=17|work=CReSC: The Social Life of Methods|publisher=[[Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change]]|date=16 April 2010|accessdate=28 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910073110/http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/cresc/?p=17|archive-date=10 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features ==

The site includes maps, predictions and analysis articles. It has a separate section for [[elections in Scotland]].&lt;ref name="keele"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/por/scotland.htm | title=Scottish Government and Politics on the Internet | publisher=[[Keele University]] | work=School of Politics, International Relations and Philosophy website | accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

The site is based around the employment of scientific techniques on data about Britain's electoral geography,&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; which can be used to calculate the [[uniform national swing]].&lt;ref name="telegraph young 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Toby|title=Who predicted the result correctly?|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100038566/who-predicted-the-result-correctly/|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It takes account of national polls and trends but excludes local issues.&lt;ref name="thisiskent 2012"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/MP-s-course-lose-seat/story-15932772-detail/story.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505065719/http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/MP-s-course-lose-seat/story-15932772-detail/story.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=5 May 2013 | title=MP's on course to lose his seat | work=thisiskent.co.uk | publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]] | date=27 April 2012 | accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculations were initially based on what is termed the ''Transition Model'', which is derived from the additive [[uniform national swing]] model. This uses national swings in a proportional manner to predict local effects.&lt;ref name="electoralcalculus newmodel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/newmodel.html | title=Transition Model |publisher=Electoral Calculus |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |last=Baxter |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Strong Transition Model'' was introduced in October 2007, and considers the effects of strong and weak supporters.&lt;ref name="electoralcalculus strongmodel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/strongmodel.html | title=Strong Transition Model |publisher=Electoral Calculus |date=28 October 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |last=Baxter |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The models are explained in detail on the web site.&lt;ref name="electoralcalculus newmodel" /&gt;

== Reception ==

It was listed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2004 as one of the "100 most useful websites", being "the best" for predictions.&lt;ref name="guardian 2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cream of the crop|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/dec/16/onlinesupplement.shopping|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was described by PhD student Chris Prosser at the [[University of Oxford]] as "probably the leading vote/seat predictor on the internet".&lt;ref name="politicsinspires prosser 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prosser|first=Chris|title=Predicting the next UK general election|url=http://politicsinspires.org/2012/05/predicting-the-next-uk-general-election/|work=Politics in Spires|date=7 May 2012|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its detailed predictions for individual seats have been noted by Paul Evans on the localdemocracy.org.uk [[blog]].&lt;ref name="localdemocracy evans 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Paul |title=Election websites to watch |url=http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2010/03/30/election-websites-to-watch/ |work=localdemocracy.org.uk |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921111914/http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2010/03/30/election-websites-to-watch/ |archivedate=21 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic [[Nick Anstead]] noted in his observations from a 2010 ''Personal Democracy Forum'' event, that [[Mick Fealty]] of [[Slugger O'Toole]] considered Electoral Calculus to be "massively improved" in comparison with the [[swingometer]].&lt;ref name="nickanstead.com 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anstead|first=Nick|authorlink=Nick Anstead|title=General Election 2010 – Action Replay (Personal Democracy Forum Event at the Royal Society for the Arts)|url=http://www.nickanstead.com/blog/?p=1886|work=nickanstead.com|date=15 May 2010|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]], it was cited by journalists [[Andrew Rawnsley]]&lt;ref name="guardian doubly hung "&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/22/andrew-rawnsley-general-election-hung-parliament | title=Why it's very likely the next parliament will be doubly hung |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |last=Rawnsley |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Rawnsley | location=London | quote=The different formulas used by Electoral Calculus and Swingo both translate a six-point Tory poll lead into a Commons in which the Conservatives are short of a majority.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]]&lt;ref name="guardian too late for labour"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/apr/30/tony-blair-labour-cleggmania-michael-white | title=Tony Blair's back.

Surveys of victims of crime have been undertaken in many cities and countries, using a common [[methodology]] to aid comparability, and have generally included questions on sexual violence. The [[United Nations]] has conducted extensive surveys to determine the level of sexual violence in different societies. According to these studies, the percentage of women reporting having been a victim of sexual assault ranges from less than 2% in places such as [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] (1.4%), [[Gaborone]], [[Botswana]] (0.8%), [[Beijing]], [[China]] (1.6%), and [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] (0.3%), to 5% or more in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] (6.0%), [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] (5.8%), [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] (8.0%), and [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]] (5.0%).&lt;ref&gt;The international crime victim survey in countries in transition: national reports.

Rome, United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

No distinction has been made in these figures between rape by strangers and that by intimate partners. Surveys that fail to make this distinction or those that only examine rape by strangers usually underestimate substantially the prevalence of sexual violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewkes R, Abrahams N. The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview. Social Science and Medicine (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from crime surveys, there have been a small number of surveys, with representative samples, that have asked women about sexual violence. For instance, in a national survey conducted in the [[United States of America]], 14.8% of women over 17 years of age reported having been raped in their lifetime (with an additional 2.8% having experienced [[attempted rape]]) and 0.3% of the sample reported having been raped in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Tjaden P, Thoennes N.

The most common form of contact was forced vaginal intercourse.

===Forced sexual initiation===
A growing number of studies, particularly from [[sub-Saharan Africa]], indicate that the first sexual experience of girls is sometimes unwanted and forced. In a case control study, for example, of 191 [[adolescent]] girls (mean age 16.3 years) attending an [[antenatal]] clinic in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and 353 non [[pregnant]] adolescents matched for age and neighborhood
or school, 31.9% of the study cases and 18.1% of the controls reported that force was used during their sexual initiation. When asked about the consequences of refusing sex, 77.9% of the study cases and 72.1% of the controls said that they feared being beaten if they refused to have sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jewkes R | year = 2001 | title = Relationship dynamics and adolescent pregnancy in South Africa | url = | journal = Social Science and Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 733–744 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(00)00177-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced sexual initiation and coercion during adolescence have been reported in many studies of young women and men. Where studies have included both men and women in the sample, the prevalence of reported rape or sexual coercion has been higher among the women than the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matasha E | year = 1998 | title = Sexual and reproductive health among primary and secondary school pupils in Mwanza, Tanzania: need for intervention | url = | journal = AIDS Care | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 571–582 | doi=10.1080/09540129848433|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buga GA, Amoko DH, Ncayiyana DJ | year = 1996 | title = Sexual behaviour, contraceptive practice and reproductive health among school adolescents in rural Transkei | url = | journal = South African Medical Journal | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 523–527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rwenge M.

Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota and Pan American Health Organization, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, nearly half of the sexually active adolescent women in a multi-country study in the [[Caribbean]] reported that their first sexual intercourse was forced, compared with one-third of the adolescent men.&lt;ref&gt;Halco´n L, Beuhring T, Blum R. A portrait of adolescent health in the Caribbean, 2000. Minneapolis,
MN, University of Minnesota and Pan American Health Organization, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lima]], [[Peru]], the percentage of young women reporting forced sexual initiation was almost four times that reported by the young men (40% against 11%, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Caceres CF, Vanoss M, Sid Hudes E | year = 2000 | title = Sexual coercion among youth and young adolescents in Lima, Peru | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 361–367 | doi=10.1016/s1054-139x(00)00096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are not many studies of forced sexual initiation in the United States, and estimates from the studies that do exist vary widely. One study of 5,663 heterosexual women in the United States found that 12.5% had experienced forced sexual initiation. Of the women who were 15 years old or younger when they had their first sexual experience, 22% reported that those initiations were forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Campbell|first = Jacquelyn C.|last2 = Lucea|first2 = Marguerite B.|last3 = Stockman|first3 = Jamila K.|last4 = Draughon|first4 = Jessica E.|date = 2013-02-01|title = Forced Sex and HIV Risk in Violent Relationships|journal = American Journal of Reproductive Immunology|language = en|volume = 69|pages = 41–44|doi = 10.1111/aji.12026|pmc = 3573255|pmid = 23066950}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1992 US National Health and Social Life Survey of over 3,400 adults, more than 4% of women reported coerced sexual initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://popcenter.uchicago.edu/data/nhsls.shtml|title=National Health and Social Life Survey {{!}} The University of Chicago|website=popcenter.uchicago.edu|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of over 24,000 women, the World Health Organization found the following rates of women reporting forced sexual initiation: 30% in a Bangladesh province, 24% in a Bangladesh city, 24% in a Peru province, 17% in an Ethiopia province, 17% in a United Republic of Tanzania province, 14% in a United Republic of Tanzania city, 8% in Samoa, 7% in a Peru city, 6% in a Namibia city, 5% in a Brazil province, 4% in a Thailand city, 3% in a Brazil city, 0.7% in a Serbia and Montenegro city, and 0.4% in a Japan city. In all of these sites except Ethiopia, the younger the woman was at the time of her first sexual experience, the more likely it was that that experience was forced sexual initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/67422|title=WHO IRIS: WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gang rape===
{{main article|Gang rape}}
Gang rape, or mass rape, occurs when a group of people participate in the rape of a single victim. Rape involving at least two or more perpetrators is widely reported to occur in many parts of the world.

===Sexual trafficking===
{{Main article|Human trafficking}}

Each year hundreds of thousands of women and girls throughout the world are bought and sold into [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref name="Migration Information Programme 1995"&gt;Migration Information Programme.

London, Virago Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the United States, according to a report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC).&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in Kyrgyzstan has estimated that around 4,000 people were trafficked from the country in 1999, with the principal destinations being China, Germany, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Of those trafficked, 62% reported being forced to work without pay, while over 50% reported being physically abused or tortured by their employers.&lt;ref&gt;Chauzy JP. Kyrgyzstan Republic: trafficking. Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 20 January 2001 (Press briefing notes).&lt;/ref&gt;

A World Organization against Torture (OMCT) report suggested that more than 200,000 Bangladeshi women had been trafficked between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Benninger-Budel C et al. Violence against women: a

Geneva, World Organization Against Torture, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200,000 Nepali girls have been trafficked to red light areas of India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/15/content_10821971.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and trafficking of Thai women to Japan has also been reported.&lt;ref name="Dinan K 2000"/&gt; Trafficking of women also takes place internally within some countries, often from rural areas to cities.

In recent years, the problem of human trafficking has gotten very serious in Europe, where women from Eastern Europe, as well as from Asia, Africa and Latin America are trafficked to Western Europe. In Netherlands, it is estimated that there are from 1,000 to 7,000 trafficking victims a year. Most police investigations relate to legal sex businesses, with all sectors of prostitution being well represented, but with window brothels being particularly overrepresented.

Out of all [[Amsterdam]]'s 8,000 to 11,000 prostitutes, more than 75% are from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia, according to a former prostitute who produced a report about the sex trade in Amsterdam, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5400641.ece Timesonline.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''Le Monde'' in 1997 found that 80% of prostitutes in the Netherlands were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222727/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Netherlands.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the trafficking of women from Eastern Europe is often organized by people from that same region. The [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|German Federal Police Office]] (BKA) reported in 2006 a total of 357 completed investigations of human trafficking, with 775 victims. Thirty-five percent of the suspects were Germans born in Germany and 8% were German citizens born outside of Germany.&lt;ref name=bka&gt;[https://archive.is/20121217203414/http://www.bka.de/lageberichte/mh.html Reports on human trafficking], by the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North America is also an important destination for international trafficking. A study undertaken under the auspices of the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] estimated that 45,000 to 50,000 women and children are trafficked annually to the United States.&lt;ref name="Richard AO 1999"&gt;Richard AO. International trafficking in women to the United States: a contemporary manifestation of slavery and organized crime.

In Canada, foreign trafficking for prostitution is estimated to be worth $400 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unpac.ca/economy/g_migration.html Women &amp; The Economy - Globalization &amp; Migration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514045035/http://www.unpac.ca/economy/g_migration.html |date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual violence against sex workers===
Whether trafficked or not, [[sex workers]] are at high risk for both physical and sexual violence, particularly where sex work is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnard M | year = 1993 | title = Violence and vulnerability: conditions of work for streetworking prostitutes | url = | journal = Sociology of Health and Illness | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 683–705 | doi=10.1111/1467-9566.ep11434434}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of female sex workers in [[Leeds]], England, and [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, revealed that 30% had been slapped, punched or kicked by a client while working, 13% had been beaten, 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Church S | year = 2001 | title = Violence by clients towards female prostitutes in different work settings: questionnaire survey | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 322 | issue = | pages = 524–525 | doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7285.524|display-authors=etal | pmid=11230067 | pmc=26557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 34% of those who had suffered violence at the hands of a client reported it to police.

==Sexual violence in schools, health care settings, armed conflicts and refugee settings==

===Schools===
For many young women, the most common place where sexual coercion and harassment are experienced is in school. In an extreme case of violence in 1991, 71 teenage girls were raped by their classmates and 19 others were killed at a boarding school in [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]], [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;Perlez J. For the oppressed sex: brave words to live by. New York Times, 6 June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the research in this field comes from Africa, it is not clear whether this reflects a particularly high prevalence of the problem or simply the fact that the problem has had a greater visibility there than in other parts of the world.

Harassment of girls by boys is in all likelihood a global problem.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In Canada, for example, 23% of girls had experienced sexual harassment while attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagley C, Bolitho F, Bertrand L | year = 1997 | title = Sexual assault in school, mental health and suicidal behaviors in adolescent women in Canada | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 361–366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research done in Africa, however, has highlighted the role of teachers there in facilitating or perpetrating sexual coercion. A report by Africa Rights &lt;ref&gt;Omaar R, de Waal A. Crimes without punishment: sexual harassment and violence against female students in schools and universities in Africa. African Rights, July 1994 (Discussion Paper No. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; found cases of schoolteachers attempting to gain sex, in return for good grades or for not failing pupils, in the Democratic [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[Somalia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. A recent national survey in [[South Africa]] that included questions about experience of rape before the age of 15 years found that schoolteachers were responsible for 32% of disclosed child rapes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In [[Zimbabwe]], a retrospective study of reported cases of child sexual abuse over an 8-year period (1990 to 1997) found high rates of sexual abuse committed by teachers in rural primary schools. Many of the victims were girls between 11 and 13 years of age and penetrative sex was the most prevalent type of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagley C, Bolitho F, Bertrand L | year = 1997 | title = Sexual assault in school, mental health and suicidal behaviors inadolescent women in Canada | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 361–366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[East Timor]], there were reports of extensive sexual violence against women by the Indonesian military.&lt;ref name="Pacific Women Against Violence 2000"&gt;Pacific Women Against Violence. Violence against East Timor women. Pacific Women’s Network Against Violence Against Women, 2000; 5:1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; A study in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]], found that women under 25 years were more likely than those aged 25 years and over to report experiencing attempted rape and sexual coercion during the conflict (18% compared with 4%).&lt;ref name="Swiss S et al. 1998 625–629"/&gt; Women who were forced to cook for a warring faction were at significantly higher risk.

Another inevitable consequence of armed conflicts is the ensuing economic and social disruption which can force large numbers of people into prostitution,&lt;ref name="Pacific Women Against Violence 2000"/&gt; an observation that applies equally to the situation of refugees, whether they are fleeing armed conflicts or natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes or powerful storms.

Refugees fleeing conflicts and other threatening conditions are often at risk of rape in their new setting. Data from the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], for instance, indicated that among the boat people who fled [[Vietnam]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 39% of the women were abducted or raped by pirates while at sea, a figure that is likely to be an underestimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mollica RF, Son L | year = 1989 | title = Cultural dimensions in the evaluation and treatment of sexual trauma: an overview | url = | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 363–379 | pmid = 2748443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customary forms of sexual violence==

===Child marriage===
{{main article| Child marriage}}
Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice is legal in many countries and is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent. The majority of them know little or nothing about sex
before they are married. They therefore frequently fear it&lt;ref&gt;George A. Sexual behavior and sexual negotiation among poor women and men in Mumbai: an exploratory study. Baroda, Sahaj Society for Health Alternatives, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and their first sexual encounters are
often forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma V, Sujay R, Sharma A | year = 1998 | title = Can married women say no to sex? Repercussions of the denial of the sexual act | url = | journal = Journal of Family Welfare | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early marriage is most common in Africa and South Asia, though it also occurs in the Middle East and parts of Latin America and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="London 2000"&gt;Early marriage: whose right to choose? London, Forum on Marriage and the Rights of Women and Girls, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"&gt;UNICEF Innocenti Research Center. Early marriage: child spouses. Innocenti Digest, 2001, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ethiopia]] and parts of West Africa, for instance, marriage at the age of 7 or 8 years is not uncommon. In [[Nigeria]], the mean age at first
marriage is 17 years, but in the [[Kebbi State]] of northern [[Nigeria]], the average age at first marriage is just over 11 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt; High rates of child
marriage have also been reported in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="London 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;100. UNICEF Innocenti Research Center. Early marriage: child spouses. Innocenti Digest, 2001, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Asia, child marriage is especially common in rural areas, but exists also in urban areas.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed EM. Violence against women: the legal system and institutional responses. Lahore, AGHS Legal Aid Cell, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumari R, Singh R, Dubey A. Growing up in rural India: problems and needs of adolescent girls. New Delhi, Radiant Publishers, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], the average age at first marriage is 19 years. Seven per cent of girls, though, are married before the age of 10 years, and 40% by the age of 15 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt; In [[India]], the median age at first marriage for women is 16.4 years. A survey of 5000 women in the [[India]]n state of [[Rajasthan]] found that 56% of the women had
married before the age of 15 years, and of these, 17% were married before they were 10 years old. Another survey, conducted in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], found that 14% of girls were married between the ages of 10 and 14 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt;

Elsewhere, in Latin America for instance, early age at first marriage has been reported in [[Cuba]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name="London 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt; In North America and Western Europe, less than 5% of marriages involve girls younger than 19 years of age (for example, 1% in [[Canada]],
[[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], 2% in [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]], 3% in [[Spain]], and 4% in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Indicators on marriage and marital status. In: 1997 Demographic yearbook, 49th ed. New York, NY,
United Nations Statistics Division, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other customs leading to violence===
In many places, there are customs other than child marriage that result in sexual violence towards women. In [[Zimbabwe]], for instance, there is the custom of ''ngozi'', whereby a girl can be given to a family as [[Blood money (restitution)|compensation for a death]] of a man caused by a member of the girl's family. On reaching puberty the girl is expected to have sexual intercourse with the brother or father of the deceased person, so as to produce a son to replace the one who died. Another custom is ''[[chimutsa mapfiwa]]'', according to which, when a married woman dies, her sister is obliged to replace her in the matrimonial home. [[Widow inheritance]] is or was practised by many cultures; when a man died, his widow was forced to marry one of his brothers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4615">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''exact completion''' constructs a [[Regular category#Exact (effective) categories|Barr-exact category]] from any [[finitely complete category]]. It is used to form the [[effective topos]] and other [[realizability topos]]es.

==Construction==
Let ''C'' be a category with finite limits. Then the ''exact completion'' of ''C'' (denoted ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ex''&lt;/sub&gt;) has for its objects pseudo-equivalence relations in ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/reports/00/ECS-LFCS-00-424/ECS-LFCS-00-424.pdf|title=Exact completion and toposes|last=Menni|first=Matias|date=2000|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A pseudo-equivalence relation is like an [[equivalence relation]] except that it need not be jointly monic. An object in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ex''&lt;/sub&gt; thus consists of two objects ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and two parallel morphisms ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that there exist a reflexivity morphism ''r'' from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''r'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;; a symmetry morphism ''s'' from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to itself such that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''s'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''s'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; and a transitivity morphism ''t'' from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × &lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''t'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''p'' and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''t'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q'', where ''p'' and ''q'' are the two projections of the aforementioned [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]]. A morphism from (''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to (''Y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ex''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by an equivalence class of morphisms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that there exists a morphism ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with two such morphisms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; being equivalent if there exists a morphism ''e'' from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''e'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Examples==
* If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, then '''Set'''&lt;sub&gt;''ex''&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to '''Set'''.
* More generally, let ''C'' be a small category with finite limits. Then the [[presheaf (category theory)|category of presheaves]] '''Set'''&lt;sup&gt;''C''&lt;sup&gt;''op''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to the exact completion of the [[coproduct completion]] of ''C''.&lt;ref name="journal1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002240499400103P|title=Some free constructions in realizability and proof theory|journal=[[Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra]]|volume=103|issue=2|pages=117–148|last=Carboni|first=A.|date=15 September 1995|access-date=18 September 2016|doi=10.1016/0022-4049(94)00103-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15291">'''Experiments in Art and Technology''' ('''E.A.T.''') was a non-profit and tax-exempt organization established to develop collaborations between artists and engineers. The group operated by facilitating person-to-person contacts between [[artist]]s and [[engineer]]s, rather than defining a formal process for cooperation. E.A.T. initiated and carried out projects that expanded the role of the artist in contemporary society and helped explore the separation of the individual from technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] (2003). ''[[Digital Art]]'' (World of Art series). London: Thames &amp; Hudson. p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
E.A.T. was officially launched in 1967 by the engineers [[Billy Klüver]] and [[Fred Waldhauer]] and the artists [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Stiles &amp; Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; These men had previously collaborated in 1966 when they together organized ''[[9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering]]'', a series of [[performance art]] presentations that united artists and engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=294|title=9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering : 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering Fonds|website=www.fondation-langlois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 New York artists worked with 30 engineers and scientists from the world-renowned [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] to create groundbreaking performances that incorporated new technology. Artists involved with ''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering'' include: [[John Cage]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Öyvind Fahlström]], Alex Hay, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Steve Paxton]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[David Tudor]], and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=294|title=9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering Fonds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable engineers involved include: [[Bela Julesz]], [[Billy Klüver]], [[Max Mathews]], [[John R. Pierce|John Pierce]], [[Manfred R. Schroeder|Manfred Schroeder]], and [[Fred Waldhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering. Edited by [[Pontus Hultén]] and Frank Königsberg. New York: ''Experiments in Art and Technology: The Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts'', 1966. 14 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Video projection]], [[wireless]] sound transmission, and [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] [[sonar]] had never been seen in the art of the 1960s. These art performances still resonate today as forerunners of the close and rapidly evolving relationship between artists and technology. The performances were held in [[New York City]]'s [[69th Regiment Armory]], on [[Lexington Avenue]] between 25th and 26th Streets as an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the original and historical 1913 [[Armory show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=1734]''Vehicle,'' online, retrieved September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=396] documents, history online, retrieved September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The pinnacle of E.A.T. activity is generally considered to be the [[Pepsi]] Pavilion at Expo '70 at [[Osaka]] [[Japan]] where E.A.T. artists and engineers collaborated to design and program an [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] [[dome]] that included a [[fog]] sculpture by [[Fujiko Nakaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal|Nechvatal, Joseph]]. (2012) ''Immersion Into Noise'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Organized by E.A.T. founders Billy Klüver and Robert Whitman, the project was led by a core design team that also included [[Robert Breer]], [[Forrest Myers|Frosty Myers]], [[David Tudor]],&lt;ref name="medienkunst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/pepsi-pavillon/images/6/?desc=full|title=Media Art Net - E.A.T. – Experiments in Art and Technology: Pepsi Pavilion for the Expo '70|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=6 April 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of over 75 artists and engineers from the US and Japan. The original structure consisted of a [[Buckminster Fuller]]-style [[geodesic dome]] covered by a water vapor cloud sculpture, designed by Fujiko Nakaya, to which the architect John Pearce had devised a way to fit a [[Mylar]] mirror inside the structure.&lt;ref name="medienkunst"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Product Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLYzAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Morgan-Grampian Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[optical]] effect in the [[spherical]] mirror produced real images resembling that of a [[hologram]].&lt;ref name="Rieser2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Rieser|title=The Mobile Audience: Media Art and Mobile Technologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVJIhT2rpYoC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2011|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-3128-X|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the size of the mirror, a spectator looking at an image could walk around it and see it from all sides. On the terrace surrounding the Pepsi Pavilion were seven of Robert Breer’s "Floats", six-foot high [[kinetic sculpture]]s that moved around at less than 2 feet per minute, while emitting sounds.&lt;ref name="HerathKroos2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damith Herath|author2=Christian Kroos|author3=Stelarc|title=Robots and Art: Exploring an Unlikely Symbiosis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_sgDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163|date=4 May 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-10-0321-9|pages=163–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a ""Float"" hit an obstacle or was pushed it would reverse direction.&lt;ref name="Tomkins1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Calvin Tomkins|title=The Scene: Reports on Post-modern Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXNQAAAAMAAJ|year=1976|publisher=Viking Press|isbn=978-0-670-62035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Twenty-eight regional E.A.T. chapters were established throughout the U.S. in the late 1960s to promote [[collaboration]]s between artists and engineers and expand the artist’s role in social developments related to new technologies. In 2002 the [[University of Washington]] hosted a reunion to celebrate the history of these regional liaisons and consider the legacy of E.A.T. for artists working with [[new technologies]] in the 21st century.

E.A.T. activity has entered the canons of [[performance art]], experimental [[noise music]] and theater, bridging the gap from the eras of [[Dada]], [[Fluxus]] and the [[Happenings]]/Actions of the 1960s, through the current generation of [[digital art]]ists for whom multimedia and technology are the norm. The lineage from E.A.T. experimentations in the 1960s which led to media-art explorations of the 1990s and beyond, is the same historical pathway that has led to the ArtScience movement of the 2000s -- the latter an amalgamation of E.A.T., the environmental/ecology movements, and the expanding ontological impact scientific practice has on society. Most recently, E.A.T. included a collaboration with singer songwriter [[Beatie Wolfe]] for its 50 year anniversary, which involved the artist releasing her album as the world's first live 360˚ [[Augmented reality]] stream, from the [[Bell Labs]] anechoic chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130155-augmented-reality-brings-beatie-wolfes-new-songs-to-life/|title=Augmented reality brings Beatie Wolfe’s new songs to life|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.de/collection/life/beatie-wolfe-interview-neues-album-raw-space-stream-ar-vinyl|title=Beatie Wolfe steht auf Vinyl – und macht deshalb Augmented Reality|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-02-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/beatie-wolfe-raw-space-bell-labs|title=AR brings ceremony to Beatie Wolfe’s Raw Space from Bell Labs’ room without echoes|last=O’Dea|first=Ann|date=2017-05-11|work=Silicon Republic|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 [[Billy Klüver]], [[Barbara Rose]] and Julie Martin edited the book "Pavilion", that documented the design and construction of the E.A.T. Pepsi Pavilion for [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/Writings/EAT.pdf|title=Experiments in Art and Technology,a brief history of projects, Vasulka.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=1716|title=9 Evenings and Experiments in Art and Technology: A gap to fill in art history's recent chronicles|publisher=Fondation Langlois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 [[Billy Klüver]]  produced an exhibition of photo and text panels entitled "The Story of E.A.T.: Experiments in Art and Technology, 1960 &amp;ndash; 2001 by Billy Klüver."  It was first shown in [[Rome]] and then again at [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in 2002. The exhibition went to [[Lafayette College]] in the spring 2002, then to the Evolution Festival in Leeds, England, and University of Washington, in Seattle. In 2003 it traveled to [[San Diego State University]] in San Diego, California and then to a gallery in Santa Maria, California run by Ardison Phillips &amp;ndash; who was the artist who managed the Pepsi Pavilion in 1970. From April to June 2003 a Japanese version was shown at a large exhibition at the NTT Intercommunication Center (ICC) in [[Tokyo]] which also included a number of object/artifacts and documents and E.A.T. posters, as well as works of art that Klüver and E.A.T. were involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=236|title=E.A.T. — The Story of Experiments in Art and Technology|website=www.fondation-langlois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar showing took place in Norrköping Museum of Art, [[Norrköping]], Sweden in September 2004; and a small version of the panels were presented in 2008 at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] as part of a celebration of Experiments in Art and Technology. 
In November 2017, the E.A.T. projects were part of the ''VARIATION ArtJaws media art fair and exhibition'' at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris: All the panels and some of the below mentioned documentaries were exhibited.

The [[9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering]] DVD Series (director: Barbro Schultz Lundestam) is an important documentation of the collaborations between the artists and engineers that produced innovative works using these emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;"9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering" {{cite web |url=http://www.9evenings.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305133753/http://www.9evenings.org/ |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical foundations ==
[[File:Derek Parfit at Harvard-April 21, 2015-Effective Altruism (cropped).jpg|thumb|Derek Parfit influenced the psychological research on the future self.]]
Psychological research on the future self often attributes its theoretical foundations to the philosopher [[Derek Parfit]]. Parfit argued that people might differ in the extent they feel similar and connected to themselves in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1093/019824908x.001.0001|title=Reasons and Persons|last=Parfit|first=Derek|date=1986-01-23|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198249085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parfit|first=Derek|date=1971|title=Personal Identity|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2184309|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=80|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.2307/2184309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Parfit’s conceptualization, people act rationally by basing their concern for their future on the degree of connectedness between present and future selves. According to Parfit, it is rational for people that perceive very little connectedness with their future self to act in ways that neglect the future self (e.g., by smoking). 

The psychological work that followed did not similarly argue that people who feel disconnected from their future self ''should'' engage in short-sighted behaviors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rather, the psychology of the future self primarily addresses the descriptive validity of Parfit’s theory. 

== Psychological theory ==
Social psychological and neurological evidence suggests that people think about themselves in the future similar to how they think about other people.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|last2=Olivola|first2=Christopher Y.|last3=Kennedy|first3=Kathleen A.|date=2007-12-04|title=Doing Unto Future Selves As You Would Do Unto Others: Psychological Distance and Decision Making|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=224–236|doi=10.1177/0146167207310023|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ersner-Hershfield|first=Hal|last2=Wimmer|first2=G.

=== Measuring psychological connectedness ===
[[Shane Frederick]] initially tested whether the degree of connectedness with the future self is associated with less discounting of future benefits (in dollar amounts and time).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He measured connectedness by asking participants to rate how similar they expect to be with themselves 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 years in the future. He did not estimate a statistically significant relationship between the degree of connectedness and [[discounting]] of future benefits.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frederick|first=Shane|date=2003|title=Time preference and personal identity|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.471.8534&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Time and decision|volume=|pages=89-113|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, Hal Hershfield and colleagues introduced a new method for measuring psychological connectedness with the future self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ersner-Hershfield|first=Hal|last2=Garton|first2=M. Tess|last3=Ballard|first3=Kacey|last4=Samanez-Larkin|first4=Gregory R.|last5=Knutson|first5=Brian|date=2009-06-01|title=Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow: Individual differences in future self-continuity account for saving|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747683/|journal=Judgment and decision making|volume=4|issue=4|pages=280–286|issn=1930-2975|pmc=2747683|pmid=19774230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting the Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/t03963-000|title=Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale|last=Aron|first=Arthur|last2=Aron|first2=Elaine N.|date=1992|website=PsycTESTS Dataset|access-date=2018-11-12|last3=Smollan|first3=Danny}}&lt;/ref&gt; connectedness was depicted with seven pairs of successively overlapping circles.

The more psychologically connectedness people feel between present and future selves, the more they care about the future, and the less they [[Discounting|discount]] future benefits.

=== Manipulating psychological connectedness ===
The research that followed showed systematic ways to enhance psychological connectedness. Experiments have manipulated connectedness by having participants:

# Interact with a visual depiction of their future self (increased connectedness)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# List ways in which they expect to be similar to themselves in the future (increased connectedness)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Expect an upcoming event (e.g., college graduation) to fundamentally change who they are (decreased connectedness)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The randomized experiments revealed a causal relationship between feeling connected to one’s future self and subsequently making more patient long-term decisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Policy applications ==

=== Finances ===
In one of the first experiments to enhance psychological connectedness with the future self, participants were given immersive [[virtual reality]] technology and instructed to look at themselves in a virtual mirror&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The experimenters randomized whether participants saw an age-progressed version of themselves (meant to look approximately 70 years old) or a current-aged self. Participants that interacted with their future self were more likely to delay present monetary rewards and indicated greater intentions to save for retirement. The effect of interacting with the future self on financial decisions was mediated by enhanced feelings of psychological connectedness. Leveraging the insights from this experiment, firms such as [[Merrill Lynch]] have since adopted web applications with age-progressing software in order to increase retirement savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-releases/consumer-banking/new-merrill-edger-mobile-app-uses-3d-technology-put-retirement|title=New Merrill Edge Mobile App Uses 3D Technology to Put Retirement Planning in Your Hands|publisher=Bank of America|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The finding has been conceptually replicated with multiple diverse samples. In one [[field experiment]], students from economically diverse backgrounds that had weekly interactions with an avatar of their future self demonstrated heightened performance during a [[financial education]] course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-10-23|title=CONNECTING TO YOUR FUTURE SELF: ENHANCING FINANCIAL PLANNING AMONG DIVERSE COMMUNITIES USING VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGY|journal=The Gerontologist|volume=55|issue=Suppl_2|pages=311–311|doi=10.1093/geront/gnv610.04|issn=0016-9013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of researchers, in collaboration with Ideas42, launched another replication with thousands of [[Mexicans|Mexican citizens]]. Before deciding whether to sign-up for an automatic savings account, the treatment group was asked to spend time vividly imagining their lives in the distant future. Compared to a 1% take up rate in the control condition, 3% of people in the treatment condition enrolled in the automatic savings account.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The effect of psychological connectedness on financial decision making is moderated by knowledge about future outcomes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When people are unaware of their future financial needs, regardless of how connected they feel, they are unlikely to save for the future. Similarly, people that have full information about the consequences of their financial actions will only save if they also feel connectedness with their future self. The researchers argue that policy makers who provide information to consumers on retirement savings should also consider simultaneously enhancing psychological connectedness. People are most likely to save rather than spend when they are knowledgeable about the outcomes of their decisions ''and'' feel connected to their future selves.

In 2017, the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] included a measure of psychological connectedness to the future self in its first Financial Wellbeing Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/financial-well-being-survey-data/|title=Financial Well-Being Survey Data|publisher=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Health ===
Applying the existing theory, researchers hypothesized that increasing feelings of connectedness with the future self should cause people to make healthier [[dieting]] and [[Exercise|exercising]] decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutchick|first=Abraham M.|last2=Slepian|first2=Michael L.|last3=Reyes|first3=Monica O.|last4=Pleskus|first4=Lindsay N.|last5=Hershfield|first5=Hal E.|date=2018|title=Future self-continuity is associated with improved health and increases exercise behavior.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|volume=24|issue=1|pages=72–80|doi=10.1037/xap0000153|issn=1939-2192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correlational evidence suggests that feeling psychologically connected to the future self corresponds with greater self-reported health. In randomized experiments, people were prompted to write about a distant future self (in 20 years time) or a near future self (in 3 months). Participants that wrote about a distant future self were more likely to exercise in the days following the writing task compared to participants in the near future condition. 

=== Ethicality ===
People engage in ethically dubious behavior because they tend to neglect the potential future consequences of their behavior.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The more psychologically connected people feel to their future selves, however, the more they care about potential future consequences and avoid ethical transgressions in the present moment. Experiments have found that assigning participants to write about their future selves can decrease support for unethical [[negotiation]] strategies.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hershfield|first=Hal E.|last2=Cohen|first2=Taya R.|last3=Thompson|first3=Leigh|date=2012|title=Short horizons and tempting situations: Lack of continuity to our future selves leads to unethical decision making and behavior|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=117|issue=2|pages=298–310|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2011.11.002|issn=0749-5978|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another set of experiments, after interacting with a 40-year old version of themselves in immersive virtual reality, college students were less likely to cheat on a following task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Gelder|first=Jean-Louis|last2=Hershfield|first2=Hal E.|last3=Nordgren|first3=Loran F.|date=2013-04-16|title=Vividness of the Future Self Predicts Delinquency|journal=Psychological Science|volume=24|issue=6|pages=974–980|doi=10.1177/0956797612465197|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a field experiment, high schoolers in the [[Netherlands]] were randomly assigned to either receive texts from an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] of their future self in the treatment condition or texts from their current self in the control condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=VAN GELDER|first=JEAN-LOUIS|last2=LUCIANO|first2=EVA C.|last3=Weulen Kranenbarg|first3=Marleen|last4=Hershfield|first4=Hal E.|date=2015-03-05|title=Friends With My Future Self: Longitudinal Vividness Intervention Reduces Delinquency|journal=Criminology|volume=53|issue=2|pages=158–179|doi=10.1111/1745-9125.12064|issn=0011-1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a week, the high schoolers in the treatment condition received text messages prompting them to imagine their future circumstances. Following the intervention, high schoolers in the treatment condition were less likely to engage in delinquent and anti-social behavior compared to participants in the control condition.

The '''Global War on Error''' is a campaign to eliminate [[aviation]] errors. The term was coined by Tony Kern, CEO of [[Covergent Knowledge Solutions]].

[[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] manufacturer of [[aircraft]], has adopted the campaign. The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] also incorporated techniques developed by the program.

The campaign is intended to be synergistic with new technology and with the [[FAA]] Safety Management System approach. The campaign was initially funded with a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.

The '''Grenzau Feud''' ({{lang-de|Grenzauer Fehde}}) was a warlike conflict between the troops of [[Koblenz]] in the [[Electorate of Trier]] on the one hand and Lord Philip of [[House of Isenburg|Isenburg]] and Lord Reynard of [[Barony of Westerburg|Westerburg]] on the other at [[Grenzau Castle|Grenzau]] on 20 April 1347. The Koblenz soldiers were ambushed and 172 were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Tilemann Elhen von Wolfhagen: ''The Limburg Chronicle'' (=''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]. Scriptores qui vernacula lingua usi sunt." T.4, P.1 = "''Deutsche Chroniken und andere Geschichtsbücher des Mittelalters.''" Vol. 4, Pt. 1). Published by Arthur Wyss. Hahn, Hanover, 1883,[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0000/bsb00000777/images/?id=00000777&amp;page=31 p.&amp;nbsp;31].&lt;/ref&gt;

Processions and memorial services to commemorate the fallen citizens were held in the churches of Koblenz on the Friday after Easter annually until about 1800. After mass in the [[Church of Our Lady, Koblenz|Church of Our Lady]], a citizen of Koblenz used to climb a stone block on a house opposite (then the parsonage) and told the story of the feud..&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Christian von Stramberg|Christian von Stramberg]]: ''Coblenz, die Stadt. Historisch und topographisch dargestellt'' (= ''Denkwürdiger und nützlicher Rheinischer Antiquarius, welcher die wichtigsten und angenehmsten geographischen, historischen und politischen Merkwürdigkeiten des ganzen Rheinstroms, von seinem Ausfluß in das Meer bis zu seinem Ursprunge darstellt. Mittelrhein.'' Sect. 1, Vol. 4). Vol. 4. Hergt, Koblenz, 1856, [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb11041175.html?pageNo=353 p.&amp;nbsp;327].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grenzau Feud is classified as one of the warlike conflicts surrounding the election of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. From 1314, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] was the [[Roman-German king]]. After 1340, however, the German electors increasingly distanced themselves from Louis and in 1346 elected Charles IV as [[counter-king]]. The election of Charles IV marked the beginning of a civil war between king and counter-king. On the side of Charles were the Archbishop of Trier, [[Baldwin of Luxembourg|Baldwin]], and the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Walram of Jülich|Walram]]. Louis's allies included the Limburg dynasty of [[Gerlach V of Isenburg-Limburg|Gerlach]] and Reinhard of Westerburg. In the course of these disputes, Reinhard captured Grenzau Castle in the [[Westerwald]] mountains. When they attempted to recapture the castle, the troops of Koblenz were ambushed. Following the massacre of 172 Koblenz citizens, Reinhard had to escape and fled to Gerlach at Limburg Castle. Now the Lords of Limburg had the castle as a fiefdom, one third each from the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]], the [[Landgrave of Hesse]] and the Archbishop of Trier. Baldwin advanced on the castle in Limburg and demanded that it was opened, citing the feudal treaty. But Gerlach rejected this, because he was only obliged to remain loyal to Baldwin if the feud did not go against the Reich, the Archbishop and the Landgrave. Baldwin withdrew, leaving it as unfinished business.

===Drawings of real-life objects===
[[File:A Bird in Flight by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh 2016.jpg|300px|thumb|left|''[[A Bird in Flight]]'', by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh is an example of drawing real-life objects with math.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ams.org/mathimagery/displayimage.php?album=40&amp;pid=684#top_display_media|title="A Bird in Flight (2016)," by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |date=March 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Naderi Yeganeh has introduced two methods to draw real-life objects with mathematical formulas.&lt;ref name="articlecosmos"/&gt; In the first method, he creates tens of thousands of computer-generated mathematical figures to find a few interesting shapes accidentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Math Is Beautiful |url= http://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/math-is-beautiful/ |date=January 19, 2016 |first=Lauren |last=Young   |work=[[Science Friday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by using this method, he found some shapes that resemble  birds, fishes and sailing boats.&lt;ref name="articleguardian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Catch of the day: mathematician nets weird, complex fish |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/feb/24/catch-of-the-day-mathematician-nets-weird-complex-fish |date= February 24, 2015 |first=Alex |last=Bellos   |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mathematically Precise Crosshatching |url= http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/symbiartic/mathematically-precise-crosshatching/ |date=August 6, 2015 |first=Glendon |last=Mellow   |work=[[Scientific American]] (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/not-bird|title=This is not a bird (or a moustache) |publisher=[[Plus Magazine]] |date= January 8, 2015|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second method, he draws a real life object with a step-by-step process. In each step, he tries to find out which mathematical formulas will produce the drawing.&lt;ref  name="sciamblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="articlecosmos"/&gt; For example, by using this method, he drew birds in flight, butterflies, human faces and plants using [[trigonometric functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drawing Birds in Flight With Mathematics |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hamid-naderi-yeganeh/mathematical-birds_b_8876904.html |date=January 12, 2016 |first=Hamid |last=Naderi Yeganeh |work=[[Huffington Post]] (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathimagery/displayimage.php?album=40&amp;pid=678#top_display_media |title="Butterfly (1)," by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |date=March 23, 2016 |accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drawing Human Faces With Mathematics |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hamid-naderi-yeganeh/human-faces_b_9274054.html |date=March 8, 2016 |first=Hamid |last=Naderi Yeganeh |work=[[Huffington Post]] (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="sciamblog"/&gt;

===Fractals and tessellations===
He has designed some fractals and tessellations inspired by the [[continents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Tax Collector |url= http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/finkel-4/ |date=April 13, 2015 |first=Gary |last=Antonick   |work=[[The New York Times]] (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathmunch.org/2015/04/15/continents-math-explorers-club-and-i-use-math-for/|title=Continents, Math Explorers’ Club, and "I use math for…" |publisher=mathmunch.org |date=April 2015 |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2015, he described the fractal Africa with an Africa-like octagon and its lateral inversion.&lt;ref name="articleguardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.lms.ac.uk/2016/08/hamid-naderi-yeganeh-fractal-africa/|title=Hamid Naderi Yeganeh: Fractal Africa |publisher=The De Morgan Forum – [[London Mathematical Society]] |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Harrison Bergeron'''" is a [[satirical]] and [[dystopia]]n [[science-fiction]] [[short story]] written by [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and first published in October 1961. Originally published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', the story was republished in the author's ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House]]'' collection in 1968.

==Plot==
In the year 2081, the 211th, 212th, and 213th amendments to the Constitution dictate that all Americans are fully equal and not allowed to be smarter, better-looking, or more physically able than anyone else. The Handicapper General's agents enforce the equality laws, forcing citizens to wear "handicaps": masks for those who are too beautiful, loud radios that disrupt thoughts inside the ears of intelligent people, and heavy weights for the strong or athletic.

One April, 14-year-old Harrison Bergeron, an intelligent, athletic, and good-looking teenager, is taken away from his parents, George and Hazel Bergeron, by the government. They are barely aware of the tragedy, as Hazel has "average" intelligence (a euphemism for stupidity), and George has a handicap radio installed by the government to regulate his above-average intelligence.

Hazel and George watch ballet on television. They comment on the dancers, who are weighed down to counteract their gracefulness and masked to hide their attractiveness. George's thoughts are continually interrupted by the different noises emitted by his handicap radio, which piques Hazel's curiosity and imagination regarding handicaps. Noticing his exhaustion, Hazel urges George to lie down and rest his "handicap bag", {{convert|47|lb|kg}} of weights locked around George's neck. She suggests taking a few of the weights out of the bag, but George resists, aware of the illegality of such an action.

On television, a news reporter struggles to read the bulletin and hands it to the ballerina wearing the most grotesque mask and heaviest weights. She begins reading in her unacceptably natural, beautiful voice, then apologizes before switching to a more unpleasant voice. Harrison's escape from prison is announced, and a full-body photograph of Harrison is shown, indicating that he is {{convert|7|ft|m|spell=in}} tall and burdened by {{convert|300|lb|kg|spell=in}} of handicaps.

George recognizes his son for a moment, before having the thought eliminated by his radio. Harrison himself then storms the television studio in an attempt to overthrow the government. He calls himself the Emperor and rips off all of his handicaps, along with the handicaps of a ballerina, whom he proclaims his "Empress". He orders the musicians to play, promising them nobility if they do their best. Unhappy with their initial attempt, Harrison takes control for a short while, and the music improves. After listening and being moved by the music, Harrison and his Empress dance while flying to the ceiling, then pause in mid-air to kiss.

Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, enters the studio and kills Harrison and the Empress with a ten-gauge double-barreled shotgun. She forces the musicians to put on their handicaps, and the television goes dark. George, unaware of the televised incident, returns from the kitchen and asks Hazel why she was crying, to which she replies that something sad happened on television that she cannot remember. He comforts her and they return to their average lives.

==Characters==
*'''Harrison Bergeron''' is the fourteen-year-old son, who is {{convert|7|ft}} tall, a genius, and an extraordinarily handsome, athletic, strong, and brave person. He wants to live as an unimpeded human being and does not want to obey the laws of the government, which has taken on the responsibility of creating equality for the whole American society. He has been jailed by the Handicapper General's office for planning to overthrow the government. To eliminate any "unfair advantages", the Handicapper General forces him to wear the most extreme handicaps reflecting his extraordinary attributes: huge earphones and spectacles intended to make him half blind and give him tremendous headaches, disfiguring makeup in the form of blackened teeth and a red rubber nose to mask his extraordinary looks, and so many weights to compensate his prodigious strength that they make him look more like a junk yard than a man. When he escapes from jail, the government describes him as "a genius and an athlete" and tells people that he should be regarded as extremely dangerous. When Harrison enters the television studio, he is convinced that he can overthrow the government and declares "I am the Emperor! ... Do you hear? I am the Emperor! Everybody must do what I say at once!". In addition to this talent and egotism, he also possesses artistic and romantic characteristics. He sings and dances with his Empress, defying gravity while doing so. Despite Harrison's superior physical prowess and intellectual faculties, he is stopped when the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers, shoots him and his Empress down with a shotgun.
*'''George Bergeron''' is Harrison's father and Hazel's husband. A very smart and sensitive character, he is handicapped artificially by the government. Like his son, he has to wear mental handicap earphones in his ears to keep him from thinking intensely and analytically. Because he is stronger than average, he has to wear weights around his neck. When his wife Hazel suggests that he could take these weights off for a while to relax, he rejects the idea. He wants to obey the laws and is unwilling to risk punishment for a little comfort. He believes that the situation in 2081 is better than it had been back in the days when fierce competition reigned in society. He has much respect for the rules and represents the common passive citizen who does not critique a government that manipulates individuals. Obeying the rules, he is even incapable of recognizing the tragic situation when his son has been shot to death - a harsh critique of passiveness towards authority.
*'''Hazel Bergeron''' is Harrison's mother and George's wife. Hazel has what is described as perfectly average intelligence, which means that she cannot think deeply about anything. However, she is a well-intentioned character, a loving wife and mother, who tries to comfort her husband by suggesting he removes his handicap weights. She cries when she sees what happens to her son but due to her impaired faculties quickly forgets the subject of her sorrow. In the end all her kindness counts for nothing as her stupidity outruns her good intentions. Hazel has much in common with the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers.
*'''Ballerina''', a beautiful dancer who was burdened with an especially ugly mask and excessive weights ("as big as those worn by two hundred pound men"), as she is the fairest, most beautiful and most graceful of the dancers. She reads an announcement card after the stammering announcer is unable to. It is likely, but not stated, that she is the same dancer who Harrison Bergeron takes as his Empress, who is later shot by Diana Moon Glampers for not wearing her handicaps, and dancing with Harrison Bergeron.
*'''Diana Moon Glampers''', despite appearing in person for only four sentences, represents the oppressive government and enforces the handicapping policies of the government. It is mentioned early on that Hazel resembles Diana, and Hazel mentions improvements she would make to Diana's handicap regulations. She appears ruthless when she kills Harrison and his Empress without warning, and threatens the musicians with a similar fate before the broadcast is interrupted, leaving their future ambiguous. Diana's first and middle names are possibly a reference to Diana, the Roman huntress, virgin goddess of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Khawaja |first=Zainab |date=July 14, 2011 |title=Socialism, Communism, &amp; Harrison Bergeron |url=http://zmeetsworld.com/2011/07/14/harrison-bergeron-an-interpretive-essay/ |website=ZMeetsWorld |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Here, Vonnegut is influenced by his early work as a journalist. His sentences are short and easily understood so as to be largely accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=William Rodney |date=1991 |title=Understanding Kurt Vonnegut |location=Columbia |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dystopian setting enhances his social and political critique by imagining a future world founded on absolute equality through handicaps assigned to various above-average people to counter their natural advantages. A similar subject can be found in [[L. P. Hartley]]'s dystopian novel ''[[Facial Justice]]'' from the previous year of 1960.

Yet Vonnegut also punctuates his dystopia with humor. Even the most horrifying scenes are underlined by jokes or absurdity. When the news announcer is supposed to read a news bulletin he has to hand it to a nearby ballerina because of his speech impediment, and the ballerina then alters her voice to a "grackle squawk" because it would be "unfair" to use her natural voice, described as a "warm, luminous, timeless melody". This absurdity highlights the madness of the world of "Harrison Bergeron".

==Parallels with ''The Sirens of Titan''==
A similar dystopian society to that of "Harrison Bergeron" appears in Vonnegut's 1959 novel ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]''. When the Space Wanderer returns to Earth he finds a society in which handicaps are used to make all people equal, eradicating the supposedly ruinous effects of blind luck on human society. The narrator claims that now "the weakest and the meekest were bound to admit, at last, that the race of life was fair".

The strong are burdened with "handicaps" (consisting of "bags of lead shot" hung from various parts of the body) and the beautiful hide their advantageous appearance through "frumpish clothes, bad posture, chewing gum and a ghoulish use of cosmetics". Unlike in "Harrison Bergeron", the citizens in ''The Sirens of Titan'' choose to wear these handicaps voluntarily as an act of faith towards ''the Church of God the Utterly Indifferent'', although it is suggested that not to do so would invite social condemnation. There are no handicaps for above-average intelligence mentioned in ''The Sirens of Titan''. The society of ''Harrison Bergeron'' addresses differences in intellectual and cognitive ability and their entailing advantages.

== Adaptations ==
The story has been adapted for the screen at least four times.

*[[PBS]] adapted several stories, including "Harrison Bergeron", in ''[[Between Time and Timbuktu]]'' (1972), with Avind Haerum in the title role.
*In 1995 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] produced a full-length made-for-television adaptation entitled ''[[Harrison Bergeron (film)|Harrison Bergeron]]'', starring [[Sean Astin]] as the title character and [[Christopher Plummer]] as John Klaxon. The adaptation diverged from the plot considerably, featuring Harrison being recruited by the National Administration Center, a secret cabal of geniuses within the government who ensure that the handicapped America functions. Working for the television division, Harrison becomes dissatisfied with the status quo and attempts to start another American revolution by taking over the nation's television broadcasting. He broadcasts old unhandicapped movies and music, while encouraging people to remove the brain-handicapping "bands" on their heads.
*In 2006, a short film also entitled ''Harrison Bergeron''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1223957|title=Harrison Bergeron}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released.
*In 2009, another short film called ''[[2081 (film)|2081]]'' was based on the original story and starred [[Armie Hammer]] as the title character. Joe Crowe, managing editor of the online magazine ''Revolution Science Fiction'', described the movie as "stirring and dramatic" and said it "gets right to the point, and nails the adaptation in about 25 minutes."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=4860 2081]" by Jow Crowe, ''Revolution Science Fiction'', retrieved 2010-01-29&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the real world ==
In 2005 the story was quoted by attorneys in a brief before the [[Kansas Supreme Court]]. Vonnegut was quoted as saying that while he did not mind the story being used in the suit, he disagreed with the lawyers' interpretation of it.&lt;ref name="Court_case_2005"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/may/05/vonnegut_lawyers_could| title = Vonnegut: Lawyers could use literary lesson| last = Rothschild| first = Scott| date = 2005-05-05| work = LJWorld.com| accessdate = 2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] quoted the story in ''[[PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin]]''.

'''''Homo magi''''' is a [[fictional]] sub-race of [[magic in fiction |magic]]-using humans in the [[DC Universe]]. The ''Homo magi'' first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #164 (March 1979), and were created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Dick Dillin]].

==Publication history==
The ''Homo magi'' first appeared as "The Hidden Ones" in ''Justice League of America'' #164 (March 1979).&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 1) #164 (March 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; They are referred to as ''Homo magus'' in issue #165, and as ''Homo magi'' in #166. In the storyline, Justice League member [[Zatanna]] is searching for her mother Sindella along with her father [[Zatara|Giovanni Zatara]]. The ''Homo magi'' were also featured in the pages of ''[[Secret Origins]]'' vol. 2 #27 (June 1988) written by [[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] (credited as Ehrich Weiss), [[Randy Lofficier]], and [[Roy Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lofficier.com/resume.htm |title=Lofficier Resume |publisher=Lofficier.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lofficiers, their story in ''Secret Origins'' that re-told the origins of the ''Homo magi'' was revised heavily prior to publication; this is their reason for using a pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lofficier.com/secretorigins.htm |title=Lofficier Secret Origins |publisher=Lofficier.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the original plot, Nommo, a sorcerer from the Empire of ''Kor'' in Ancient [[Africa]], (from [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s "[[She (novel)|She]]") created the ''Flame of Life'' from the life forces gathered after the sinking of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. Nommo later fought [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]] (changed to [[Felix Faust]] by [[DC Comics|DC]]), unwittingly causing the destruction of Kor when he absorbed the full power of the Flame.&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;''Secret Origins'' (vol. 2) #27 (June 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing his name to [[Doctor Mist]], Nommo embarked on a breeding plan to foster the creation of a race of sorcerers known as ''Homo magi''. As part of his centuries - spanning scheme, Dr. Mist created the various ''Stones of Power'' used by [[Arak (comics)|Arak]], [[Doctor Occult]] (not a ''Homo magi''), [[Sargon the Sorcerer|Sargon]], [[Zatara]], etc. and the [[Global Guardians]] after [[World War II]]. [[Zatanna]] is the final product of Dr. Mist's plan for a perfect mate. But Wotan (Felix Faust) returns to steal his power and take revenge.&lt;ref name="origins" /&gt;

==History==

Homo Magus is a sub-race of naturally magic-wielding humans. According to Doctor Mist, the Homo magi evolved in a parallel but separate line, alongside Homo sapiens. Homo magi are naturally adept at magic; since many humans possesses the Homo Magi gene because of their relationships in the distant past, these humans can learn to use indirect magic by perform rituals, but pure Homo Magi or their direct descendants can use direct magic, too.

The Homo magi existed for as long as the human race, but due to their special abilities, they did not expand as the Homo sapiens. Eventually, they started to inbreed with normal humans, resulting in many generations of Homo magi turned to Homo sapiens. As the number of pure Homo magi dwindled, they decided to recede and went into hiding.

==Darkworld==

Darkworld was a dimension created by an unnamed cosmic entity who later fell into a deep sleep. This entity's dreams were responsible for creating the first Lords of Chaos and Lords of Order, Chaon (chaos), Gemimn (order), and Tynan the balancer. These beings and others became the gods of Atlantis. Darkworld was tethered to Atlantis by a massive chain created by Deedra goddess of nature, much in the same way Ifé, the home dimension of the Orishas, is tethered to Earth by an iron chain. 

== Atlantis == 

In the DC Universe the Homo magi apparently originated on the lost continent of Atlantis. The continent was a focal point for unharnessed magical energies (wild magic), and the local Homo sapiens evolved into Homo Magi as a result of their exposure to these energies. Those humans who gained these inherent mystic abilities interbred for thousands of years, concentrating and strengthening the genetic predisposition. Upon the fall of Atlantis, people who carried the predisposition scattered to the four winds. Many humans today are descended from Homo magi. 

Homo magi are genetically compatible with normal humans, and are genetically identical to normal humans. The mysterious property that makes them homo magi is somehow "dominant" like a gene, the child of a normal human and a Homo magi will always be Homo magi. How and why this trait expresses itself the way it does has yet to be recorded. Apparently that altered Atlantean genome is the difference between Homo magi and regular human magic users. Sindella (Zatanna's mother), Arion, Atlan and Tempest are all famously powerful magic users and presumably all Homo magi. Known offspring of Homo magi are Zatanna, daughter of Sindella and the original John Zatara, and Traci Thirteen the daughter of Doctor Thirteen and an unknown female member of the Homo magi. 

== Gemworld == 


The dimension where the Gemworld is located was originally owned by the Lords of Chaos. However, thousands of years ago, when magic began to drop in level on Earth due to a change in the alignment of the stars (due to a star going nova) the sorceress Citrina went there and struck a deal with the Lords of Chaos so she would be allowed to create a realm there for those wizards who wanted to emigrate from Earth. It would seem that Gemworld like Skartaris was colonized by Homo Magi emigrants from Earth. All of Gemworld's inhabitants can use magic, though most only at a very pedestrian level. Gemworld was the home of Amethyst, Princess of Gem World. 

== Hidden City == 


Led by Doctor Mist the Homo magi created a hidden retreat in the mountains of Turkey called Hidden City, out of fears their uniqueness would be absorbed and diluted by the Homo sapiens. Powered by the Medulla Jewel the City is then shifted into another dimension for protection. 

== Kor == 


Another hidden retreat of the ancient Homo magi out of Atlantis was apparently Doctor Mist's African kingdom known as Kor. Seven thousand years ago Doctor Mist, also known as Nommo, was the wizard-king of the mighty African empire of Kor, and he was the guardian and chosen disciple of the mystic Flame of Life. The Flame was coveted by a sorcerer known as Felix Faust. When Faust attempted to kill Nommo, and take the Flame for himself, Nommo absorbed the Flame and used its power to hurl Felix Faust into another dimension, sadly destroying Kor in the process. In order to nurture the growth of the Homo magi and produce a candidate powerful enough to be his bride, Nommo created magical jewels known as the Stones of Life. He gave the stones to the Homo magi to aid in their growth. 

== Land of the Nightshades ==


The Land of the Nightshades was home to Even Eden's (Nightshade) unnamed race of Homo magi exiles. Her brother while possessed by a demon called the Incubus killed all the former inhabitants. 

== New Atlantis ==

Atlantean survivors of the city of Challa-Bel-Nalla, then ruled by Lord Daamon an ancestor of Deimos, formed an alliance with an alien race they called the Red-Moon Gods. These aliens provided the Atlanteans with advanced technology that Travis Morgan would later discover in New Atlantis. 

== Skartaris==

'''The Houston Galveston Institute''' is a non-profit organization that offers a method of collaborative counseling and postmodern therapy to individuals, families and communities of all socioeconomic backgrounds.  The Institute is strongly associated with [[collaborative language systems]] (or [[Collaborative Therapy]]), a type of [[postmodern]] therapy that works with clients within a cooperative partnership that holds their expertise in high regard, and that encourages them to access their own natural resources to develop solutions to their problems. The Houston Galveston Institute is a sponsor of the International Journal of Collaborative Practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collaborative-practices.com/ |title=International Journal of Collaborative Practices |publisher=Collaborative-practices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The beginnings of the Houston Galveston Institute date back to the 1950s at the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] in [[Galveston]], [[Texas]] with the federally funded family therapy project to research the Multiple Impact Theory.  In 1978, the Galveston Family Institute was established by [[Harlene Anderson]], Ph.D., [[Paul Dell]], Ph.D., [[Harold Goolishian]], Ph.D. and [[George Pulliam]], M.S.W. to meet the demands of mental health professionals seeking to increase their understanding of families and further develop their skills in systems-oriented therapy with individuals, couples, families and groups.  From this group, the ideas of Collaborative Language System Theory emerged.  The institute officially became the Houston Galveston Institute in the 1990s when the project expanded beyond Galveston. Other contributors are Diane Gehart, Sue Levin, Diana Carleton, Lynn Hoffmann, [[Tom Andersen]], Vivien Burr, John Cromby, [[Kenneth Gergen]], [[Mary Gergen]], Lois Holzman, Imelda McCarthy, Susan McDaniel, Sheila McNamee, Robert Neimeyer, David Nightingale, Peggy Penn, Sallyann Roth, Jaakko Seikkula, John Shotter, Lois Shawver, and Michael White.

==Collaborative approach==
This type of approach formed at Houston Galveston Institute takes the unique stance that “problems are not solved, but dissolved in language.” &lt;ref&gt;''The client is the expert''; Anderson &amp; Goolishian. (1992).  In K. Gergen &amp; S. McNamee (Eds.) Therapy as Social Construction. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative therapy]] is now recognized as one of the current schools of [[family therapy]] and is included in graduate school textbooks.  Some of the general philosophic assumptions of the theory are:
* Maintaining Skepticism – A critical attitude about how knowledge is ‘known’
* Eluding Generalizations – Avoid the dominant discourse
* Knowledge as an Interactive Social Process – Dialectic, conversational knowledge
* Privileging Local Knowledge – Persons and communities know themselves
* Language as a Creative Social Process – Language creates our knowledge
* Knowledge and Language as Transforming – Conversations change people
* [[Postmodern]] is only One of Many Narratives – One of many languages
These assumptions are post-modern in nature and inform the clinical practice of the [[Collaborative Therapy]] approach. The following list is of the various impacts that these assumptions have on the therapist and therapeutic relationship. 
* Mutually Inquiring Conversational Partnership – Therapy as a partnership
* Relational Expertise – Client and therapist bring their expertise together
* Not-Knowing – Humility before the client
* Being Public – Therapist is open with their invisible thoughts
* Living with Uncertainty – Enjoy the spontaneity of a conversation
* Mutually Transforming – [[Hermeneutic]] circle, reciprocal effect on client and therapist
* Orienting towards Everyday Ordinary Life – Tap into natural resilience of clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harleneanderson.org/CollaborativeTherapyArticleMarch2009.htm |title=Collaborative Practice |publisher=Harleneanderson.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912150103/http://www.harleneanderson.org/CollaborativeTherapyArticleMarch2009.htm |archivedate=2010-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Collaborative therapy shares similar [[epistemological]] roots with [[Narrative Therapy]] and [[Solution-focused therapy]].  These therapies are similar, yet distinct.  An article by Gehart &amp; Paré summarizes the differences between the therapies in the following way: “In collaborative language systems, the “dis-solving” of problems through conversation (Anderson &amp; Goolishian, 1988; Goolishian &amp; Anderson, 1992), in narrative therapy, reauthoring one’s story about the problem (White 2004; White &amp; Epston, 1990), and in solution-focused therapy (SFT), building solutions (Berg, 1994; de Shazer, 1994; Lipchik, 2002)” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Sociopolitical activist or conversational partner?

==Current practice==
The Houston Galveston Institute currently is involved in the use of the Collaborative Approach in training, counseling and researching.  The office is located in [[Houston]]’s [[museum district]] and is serving the [[community]] needs while training students from local, national and international programs.  HGI also provides various training programs for mental health professionals who want to develop a collaborative and postmodern approach to therapeutic work with individuals, couples, families, groups, organizations and community.

==International and national affiliates==
The Institute currently offers an [[International Certificate in Collaborative Practices]] program with participation around the world.  The program is sponsored by the Houston Galveston Institute and the [[Taos Institute]].  It is a response to the numerous practitioners around the world who are interested in expanding their knowledge and competency in collaborative practice. The Certificate Program provides practitioners across disciplines—therapy, organization development, education and research—an intensive, in-depth study of collaborative practices based on postmodern-social construction philosophy. The Program includes the study of the theoretical and philosophical assumptions and their application to practice in a variety of contexts and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collaborativecertificate.org/Houston_Galveston_Instit.html |title=Houston Galveston Instit |publisher=Collaborativecertificate.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723103847/http://www.collaborativecertificate.org/Houston_Galveston_Instit.html |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is offered in [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[United States]], and [[Canada]]. In 2009, the International Journal of Collaborative Practices was founded in order to publish the collaborative works developing worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collaborative-practices.com/ |title=International Journal of Collaborative Practices |publisher=Collaborative-practices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Whores' Day''' or '''International Sex Workers Day''' is observed annually on June 2 of each year, honours sex workers and recognises their often exploited working conditions. The event commemorates the occupation of [[Église Saint-Nizier]] in [[Lyon]] by more than a hundred sex workers on 2 June 1975 to draw attention to their inhumane working conditions.&lt;ref name="diewelt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article3878794/Kirche-soll-Prostituierte-nicht-ausgrenzen.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag – Kirche soll Prostituierte nicht ausgrenzen (International Whores' Day: The church shouldn't exclude the prostitutes) |date=2009-06-07 |language=German |publisher=Die Welt - Online |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been celebrated annually since 1976. In German, it is known as ''Hurentag'' (Whore's Day). In Spanish-speaking countries, it is the ''Día Internacional de la Trabajadora Sexual'', the International Day of the Sex Worker.

== Background ==
[[File:Sex worker statue Oudekerksplein Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Bronze statue ''Belle'' in front of the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] in the [[De Wallen]] red-light district in [[Amsterdam]]. It was unveiled in March 2007 with the inscription "Respect sex workers all over the world."]]
In the 1970s, French police kept sex workers under increasing pressure. The police reprisals&lt;ref name="diewelt"/&gt; forced sex workers to work increasingly in secret. As a result, protection of sex workers decreased and led to more violence against them. After two murders and the unwillingness of the government to improve the situation, [[sex worker]]s in Lyon occupied the Saint-Nizier church in rue de Brest and went on strike. The striking workers sang political chants and demanded decent working conditions and an end to stigma.

The police cleared the church after eight days.&lt;ref name="bszonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiv.bszonline.de/index.php/24-archiv/urbi-et-orbi/2392-829-1-2.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag in Bochum (International Whores' Day in Bochum) |date=2010-05-17 |language=German |publisher=Bochumer Stadt- und Studierendenzeitung (bsz) |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event marks the starting point of an international movement of sex workers for [[sex workers' rights]].&lt;ref name="meritt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexclusivitaeten.de/herstory_leselust_09.html |title=Sag mir, wer die Huren sind (Tell me, where are the whores?) |date= |language=German |publisher=Sexclusivitäten - Laura Méritt |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reading entitled "Women without rooms" in [[Bochum]], [[Germany]] on 29 May 2011 documented that the situation of sex workers has not improved since 1975.

A '''legal maxim''' is an established principle or proposition of [[law]] in [[Western civilization]], and a species of [[aphorism]] and general [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]. The word is apparently a variant of the [[Latin]] ''maxima'', but this latter word is not found in extant texts of [[Roman law]] with any denotation exactly analogous to that of a legal maxim in the Medieval or modern definition, but the treatises of many of the Roman jurists on ''regular definitiones'' and ''sententiae iuris'' are to some degree collections of maxims. Most of the Latin maxims originate from the [[Medieval era]] in European states that used [[Latin]] as their legal language.

The attitude of early [[England|English]] commentators towards the maximal of the law was one of unmingled adulation. In [[Thomas Hobbes]], ''[[Doctor and Student]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;26), they are described as of the same strength and effect in the law as statutes. Not only, observes [[Francis Bacon]] in the Preface to his [[Collection of Maxims]], will the use of maxims be in deciding doubt and helping soundness of judgment, but, further, in gracing argument, in correcting unprofitable subtlety, and reducing the same to a more sound and substantial sense of law, in reclaiming vulgar errors, and, generally, in the amendment in some measure of the very nature and complexion of the whole law.&lt;ref&gt;Combined with a tract entitled ''The Use of the Common Law, for preservation of our Persons, goods, and good Names'', in a book entitled ''The Elements of the Common Lawes of England'', facsimile reprint by Da Capo Press, 1969, may be viewed at [http://www.constitution.org/bacon/ecle.htm Constitution Society]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A similar note was sounded in [[Scotland]]; and it has been well observed that a glance at the pages of Morrisons Dictionary or at other early reports will show how frequently in the older Scots law questions respecting the rights, remedies and liabilities of individuals were determined by an immediate reference to legal maxims.

In later times, less value has been attached to the maxims of the law, as the development of [[civilization]] and the increasing complexity of business relations have shown the necessity of qualifying the propositions which they enunciate. But both historically and practically, they must always possess interest and value.

[[File:Litema.png|thumb|Traditional Tema pattern with inversion and rotation of the model base]] 
'''Litema''' (pronounced: /ditʼɪːma/; also spelled ''Ditema''; Singular: '''Tema''', [[Sesotho]] for "text" or "ploughed land") is a form of [[Sotho-Tswana peoples|Sesotho]] [[mural]] art composed of decorative and symbolic geometric patterns, commonly associated with [[Sesotho]] tradition today practised in [[Lesotho]] and neighbouring areas of South Africa. Basotho women generate litema on the outer walls and inside of homesteads by means of engraving, painting, relief mouldings and/or mosaic. Typically the geometric patterns are combed or scratched into the wet top layer of fresh clay and dung plaster of the wall, and later painted with earth ochers or, in contemporary times, manufactured paint. Patterns most often mimic ploughed fields through a combed texture, or the patterns refer to plant life, and more occasionally to other aspects of the natural world, such as referring to clan totem animal. Litema are transient; they may desiccate and crumble or be washed away by heavy rain. It is common for women of an entire village to apply litema on such special occasions as a wedding or a religious ceremony.&lt;ref name="gerdes-the-sotho-lithema-tradition"&gt;Paulus Gerdes: ''On Mathematical Ideas in Cultural Traditions of Central and Southern Africa''.

As Gary van Wyk (1993:84) pointed out in his analysis of the etymology of the Sesotho noun denoting "Sesotho mural art," ''litema'' also refers to the associated concepts of "ploughed lands", &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bukantswe.sesotho.org/display.php?action=search&amp;word=ploughed+land&amp;type=full |title=Bukantswe dictionary search "ploughed land" |publisher=bukantswe.sesotho.org |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the decorative tradition is symbolically linked to cultivation in many ways. It is derived from the verb stem ''-lema'' (in the [[infinitive]], ''ho lema'' "to cultivate"), which is a reflex of the [[Proto-Bantu language|Proto-Bantu]] root ''*-dɪ̀m-'' "to cultivate (esp. with hoe)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goto.glocalnet.net/jfmaho/pbapp.pdf |title=Select Proto-Bantu Vocabulary |publisher=linguistics.africamuseum.be |date=29 May 2005 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[orthography|orthographic]] &lt;l&gt; in ''li-'' ([[Sesotho nouns#nc 10|Class 10]] [[noun class]] prefix for [[Sesotho nouns]]) is pronounced [d] in Sesotho since [d] is an [[allophone]] of /l/ occurring before the close vowels, /i/ and /u/. The orthographic &lt;e&gt; can have three possible values in Sesotho:  /ɪ/, /ɛ/, and /e/. In &lt;litema&gt; is pronounced /ɪ/, as per the Proto-Bantu root.

==Design==
The litema patterns are characterised by a multi-stage [[symmetry (geometry)|symmetry]]. Patterns are generally arranged in square cells. A wall to be shaped is divided into a grid to form the cells. Each cell is applied with the same pattern, which is usually rotated or mirrored from cell to cell. The symmetry of the overall pattern thus depends on the symmetries present in the basic pattern. There are designs with only one mirror axis in the basic patterns that result in an overall impression of flowing in one direction. Other basic patterns have several axes of symmetry or a [[rotational symmetry]], and give the overall pattern a rather flat ornamental impression. The colour design is restrained, usually only two colours are used&lt;ref name="gerdes-the-sotho-lithema-tradition" /&gt;

==History==
The tradition of mural art in Southern Africa is not of recent origins. While excavations at Sotho-Tswana archaeological sites have revealed hut floors that have survived the elements for as much as 1500 years, the earliest evidence of Sotho-Tswana mural painting stretches back about five centuries (Grant 1995:45 ; Van Wyk 1998:88). It long predates the tradition of Ndebele mural painting that has been globaly popularized. Begun in the 19th century, the [[Southern Ndebele people|Ndzundza Ndebele]] mural art tradition called ''igwalo'' (more widely known as [[Ndebele house painting]]), is said to be a synthesis of a [[Pedi people|Northern Sotho]] ''ditema'' tradition and the [[Nguni people|Nguni]] design traditions employed in beadwork, pottery and basket weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/role-decoration-ndebele-society |title=The role of decoration in Ndebele society |publisher=www.sahistory.org.za |date=1 January 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial record===

One of the earliest written accounts of Basotho mural art is by the missionary Rev. John Campbell. In his 1813 description of Batlhaping ([[Tswana people|South Tswana]]) art, Campbell stated the following:"Having heard of some paintings in Salakootoo's house, we went after breakfast to view them. We found them very rough representations of the camel-leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, lion, tiger, and stein-buck, which Salakootoo's wife had drawn on the clay wall, with white and black paint. However, they were as well done as we expected, and may lead to something better" (Grant 1995:43).

On his second journey in 1820, Campbell, gave an enthusiastic account of what he saw at the house of a certain chief "Sinosee" of the Hurutse lineage of the Sotho-Tswana. Campbell provided both illustrations as well as a verbal description of the chief's house: "The wall was painted yellow, and ornamented with figures of shields, elephants and camel-leopards, etc. It was also adorned with a neat cornice or border painting of a red colour...its walls (of Sinosee's bedroom) were decorated with delightful representations of elephants and giraffes… In some houses there were figures, pillars, etc moulded in hard clay and painted with different colours that would not have disgraced European workmen" (Van Wyk 1996:43; 1998:88).

Campbell's accounts were compiled and published by historian George Stow, in his book ''The Native Races of South Africa'' (1905). Stow also published the earliest known drawings of litema – reproductions of eight designs made by the "[[Koena tribe|Bakuena]]" (the founding clan of the [[Basotho]] nation), which he likely drew himself, based on an unpublished letter by Stow in the South African Library in which he recounts visiting a ruined Bakoena kraal (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's drawings showed textured panels similar to litema engravings still made today as well as painted patterns of dots, stripes, triangles, and zigzags executed in limited colors. 

In his 1861 book, the French missionary Eugene Casallis recalled the litema patterns he had experienced since settling among Basotho in the 1830s, calling the designs "ingenious", which suggests designs more intricate than the Bakoena examples Stow reproduced (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's documentation did not include any designs incorporating plant motifs like those seen in modern-day litema. Van Wyk (1994) suggests that the more modern and "intricate curvilinear designs have a distinctly Victorian or Edwardian flavor that was probably influenced by such turn-of-the-century European products as linoleum patterns, cast-iron moldings and lace". 

===Contemporary Revival===

Almost a century separates Stow's drawings from those done in 1976 by students of the Lesotho National Teachers Training College (Van Wyk 1989:89). Benedict Lira Mothibe, an art lecturer at the college at the time, instructed students to copy litema designs for the purposes of using these in classroom geometry lessons and as copies for potato prints. More importantly, it was an attempt by Mothibe to revive interest in what he considered a worthwhile Sesotho tradition. Gary van Wyk employed these drawings during his extensive field research in South Africa and Lesotho from 1991-1994, recording women's responses to the historical patterns, including the names and meanings they ascribed to them, and later republished several of the drawings. He found that although many of the specific vegetal patterns (e.g. "melons") that had been named in the 1970s had been forgotten by the 1990s and subsumed under a general descriptive category of "blomme", the Afrikaans word for "flowers," nonetheless this designation maintained the close symbolic association between women and vegetative fertility, linked to women's traditional roles as cultivators and foragers. Furthermore, a few patterns recorded by Mothibe were still identifiable and being produced in the early 1990s, such as one that refers to the board for marabaraba, a popular indigenous game like checkers (1998:90-91).   

More recently (2003), Mothibe, in a further contribution towards the cause of preservation, compiled and donated a second edition on litema designs entitled ''Basotho Litema Patterns (With Modifications)'' to the School of Design Technology and Visual Art of the [[Central University of Technology]], [[Free State (province)|Free State]], providing an updated record of designs and their interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.cut.ac.za/litema/historical.html |title=Historical Record |publisher=portal.cut.ac.za/litema |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

Research conducted by Van Wyk and Mathews in the late-1980s and mid-1990s, culminating in two photographically illustrated books titled ''African Painted Houses: Basotho Dwellings of Southern Africa'' (Van Wyk, 1998) and ''The African Mural'' (Chanquion &amp; Matthews, 1989)), suggests that the art of litema cannot be understood in purely aesthetic terms. 

In several works on this topic, Gary Van Wyk (1993, 1994, 1996, 1998) states that Sesotho murals are a form of religious art, appeals to the ancestors for the rain that delivers the fertility that nourishes the fields and thereby sustains the herds and the human community. Murals, he says, can be seen as prayers in paint. If the ancestors are satisfied, they provide rain that washes away the murals, and the cycle of life begins anew. It is fitting that murals are produced by women, who are symbolically linked to the house, which is a metaphor of the womb and of creation, and to the vegetal realm to which women are linked through their traditional roles as cultivators and foragers, and through several other vegetal symbols. The Basotho creation myth, for example, states that the nation emerged from a dark place deep in the earth through a bed of reeds; accordingly it was once customary upon the birth of child inside the earthen house, originally built in an igloo shape, and therefore womb-like, to place a reed in the doorway of the home until the child "crossed the reed" to emerge into the light of day (Van Wyk 1998: 103-107). Similarly, female initiates wear a reed mask, and during their initiation confinement they weave reed mats. 

This symbolic link between the igloo-shaped house and the body later was transferred to modern rectangular homes with flat roofs, where the surrounds of doorways and windows were particularly ornamented, and the name for the litema patterns along the roofline was the "headband". 

"The fecundity of fields and of women is celebrated in the creation of radiant blooms, unfurling fronds, spiralling tendrils and sprouts...Because agricultural labor was traditionally women's work, women who decorate houses can be viewed as picturing this work in the fields upon their walls. The murals are thus African landscapes, composed of the very landscape they represent"(Van Wyk 1994). This is most apparent in litema patterns that consist solely of uncolored combing into mud: these closely mimic the appearance of a plowed field. 

Van Wyk found that red ocher, called ''letsoku'', or "the blood of the earth", symbolized fertility and the blood of both menstruation and sacrifice, underscoring the key link between the ancestors and fertility and accounting for the fact that red ocher is invariably incorporated into every painting scheme. White symbolized the calm, purity and enlightenment that the ancestors promote and desire, while black represented the dark rain clouds that the ancestors deliver if all is calm and well, and these two colors are frequently combined in dense, alternating patterns applied to transitional zones of the architecture, such as the roofline and around doors and windows. Similarly, such patterns elements as triangles and zigzags likely also carried symbolic meanings that have become obscured in recent times. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Van Wyk also photographed murals that expressed political statements, using the colors of the banned African National Congress during the apartheid era, or incorporating specific political graphics or statements. 
	
Tom Mathews in his writings (supported by photographs taken by his son Paul Chanquion) stated that flowers and dots were symbols of fertility. Furthermore, he states that chevron patterns represent water or uneven ground whilst triangles are symbols denoting male and female (Changuion &amp; Matthews, 1989:9,19,55).

In the study conducted by the [[Central University of Technology|CUT]], no persons knowledgeable in the art of litema (Bekker, Thabane and Mothibe) or practising litema artists had any knowledge of a deeper significance other than that of beautifying the home for aesthetic purposes. Some of the artists questioned did however share their opinions concerning the possibility of symbolic meaning. According to artists in the Free State, their mothers (many of whom originate from Lesotho), might have been aware of such meanings, but did not share this information with them during their teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.cut.ac.za/litema/symbolism.html |title=Litema Symbolism |publisher=portal.cut.ac.za/litema |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing System===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ditema tsa Dinoko.jpeg|thumbnail|right|"Ditema tsa Dinoko" written in the writing system of that name]] --&gt;
One popular commentator has claimed that litema represent an ancient Basotho [[logographic]] writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zulumathabo.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/ditema-tsa-basotho-writing-system |title=Ditema Tsa Basotho Writing System |publisher=zulumathabo.wordpress.com |date=1 March 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated above, it is probable that there has always been a symbolic logic associated with litema (perhaps comparable to the tradition of [[Adinkra symbols]] in West Africa), but there is little evidence to assert the historical existence of a formal logography of the kind represented in [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]] or [[Chinese characters]].

Nevertheless, there is indeed a contemporary [[writing system]] (specifically, a [[featural]] syllabary) associated with litema, that can be used to write Sesotho (and all other [[Southern Bantu]] languages). It is called ''[[Ditema tsa Dinoko]]'' ("Ditema syllabary") and is also known by its [[Zulu language|Zulu]] name, ''Isibheqe Sohlamvu'', and various other related names in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isibheqe.org |title=IsiBheqe |publisher=isibheqe.org |date=23 August 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.org.za/LSSASAALASAALT-ConferenceProgramme2015.pdf |title=Isibheqe Sohlamvu: An Indigenous Writing System for Southern Bantu Languages |publisher=linguistics.org.za |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu philosophy]], '''Mauna''' (Silence), which has a voice of its own, refers to peace of mind, inner quietude, [[Samadhi]] and the Absolute Reality. The [[Hindu]] texts insist upon proper understanding of silence by experiencing it through control of speech and practice.

== Background ==

'''Mauna''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मौनम्) or Maunitva (मौनित्व) means – silence, taciturnity, silence of the mind – as in मौनमुद्रा (the attitude of silence) and मौनव्रतम् (a vow of silence) or मौनिन् (observing vow of silence). A [[Sanskrit]] Dictionary gives many words such as – अनिर्वचनम् (silence, not uttering anything), अभाषणम् (silence, not speaking), अवचन (absence of assertion, silence, taciturnity), अव्याहृतम् (silence), निःशब्दम् (silence, a calm), - as referring to silence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author= Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=Silence&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary gives the meaning of the word, Silence, as absence of sound; abstention from sounding, speech, mention, or communication; a time of such absence or abstention, taciturnity. 

[[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|Kumarila]] lists sound as one of the eleven substances and as one of the twenty-four qualities, he does not include silence in any one of these two lists nor does he describe silence as he does sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy 1999 Ed.|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book|pages=336-337|url= http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Understanding silence ==

''Asat'', the word meaning non-existent or indescribable, appears seven times in the [[Rig Veda]]); it differs from the word, ''Mithya'', which means false or untrue, .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Being and What There Is|author=Wilhelm Halbfass|publisher=SUNY Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7cLHPj1dj8C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=asat++rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AzdeU5KWBYuMrAfflIHoCQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=asat%20%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asat'' is the opposite of ''[[Rta]]''. It is the ground of transcendence, the origin of all organized perception, the original ground any and all sounds count in order to sound, and is also called the language of non-Existence. In the sense of "non-Existence" or "inaction", ''Asat'' is simply '''silence'''; in the sense of "obscuring" or "covering" or "chaos, " it is pure noise downwards moving from which tone is a distillation ([[Rig Veda]] VII.104.1,10,11). ''Rta'' is the end of an effective synthesis of sensorium, through a whole range of clear and distinct acts of particular senses and their subsequent insights. ''Asat'' stands as the initial space-ground of indeterminate perception or of sets of organized perceptions, the sounding silence from which the worlds, gods and man emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meditations Through the Rig Veda: Four-Dimensional Man|author=Antonio T. De Nicolas|publisher=iUniverse|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7mNaMDu6o0C&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=silence+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6wZeU661O8eGrgfWtYHQAQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramana Maharshi]] in the 6th paragraph of ''Nān Yār'' reminds us that only after firmly establishing our mind in our heart will our primal thought "I" which is the root of all thoughts disappear for the ever-existing real '''self''' to shine; the place (innermost core of our being) devoid of even a little trace of our primal thought "I" is ''svarupa'' (our own essential self) which alone is called ''mauna'' (silence), it is the state of egolessness. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Happiness and The Art of Being|author=Michael James|publisher=Arul Books|pages=183,193|url= http://www.happinessofbeing.com/Happiness_and_the_Art_of_Being.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiencing silence ==

[[Kena Upanishad]] tells us -  यद्वाचाऽनभ्युदितं येन वागभ्युद्यते – "That which is not uttered by speech that by which speech is revealed" (I.5), - यच्छ्रोत्रेण न शृणोति येन श्रोत्रमिदं श्रुतम् - "That which man does not hear with the ear, that by which man knows the ear", - तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते - "know that to be Brahman and not this that people worship as an object" (I.9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.1|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=49-53|url=https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only when the knower is utterly negative and yet aware that the known conveys Its secret to him, that the process of knowing as emanating from the knower ceases, and that the interval between knowing and not knowing is not covered by any projection of the knower. The sensitive mind ready to receive the subtlest intimation of [[Brahman]] responds to the voice of silence. The mind liberated from even the attribute of ''[[sattva]]'' must stand in front of utter silence. [[Yajnavalkya]] insists that the spiritual man in order to experience Brahman must transcend both silence (''mauna'') and non-silence (''amauna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Call of the Upanishads|author=Rohit Mehta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=38,276|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_aGXsz4C2z8C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=silence+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZBNeU4eTKIWurAfwp4GACQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of silence ==

Human knowledge suffers from the limitation of incompleteness but the [[Vedantic]] view of knowledge is rooted in self-revelation or self-luminosity. The truth of knowledge consists in its non-contradictedness and novelty, and not in mere correspondence or coherence. Metaphysical knowledge essentially implies permanent and changeless certitude. [[Nididhyasana]] with the aid of ''sravana'' (with a basis of the [[Mahavakyas]]) must precede knowledge. [[Sruti]] is the starting point of enquiry. [[Śraddhā|Sraddha]] (Provisional belief), induced by [[Sabda]] or [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agama]] (authoritative statements) and supported by [[Anubhava]] (experiences or realizations), is required to start an enquiry. Knowledge is truth and truth is the foundation of the Upanishads. Truthfulness in speech leads to truthfulness in spirit because in truth is initiation based. Truth is based on the heart, and reason is the true abode of truth. [[Satya]] or truth is a quality of speech and [[Dharma]] is the actualization of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the Upanishads 1999 Ed.|author=Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya|publisher=Pilgrims Book| pages=121-123,136 -137|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Govinda%20Gopal%20Mukhopadhyaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Control of speech is not forced silence. Meditation is the practice of silence. The state of [[Samadhi]] is the boundless ocean of silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vedanta way to Peace and Happiness|author=Swami Adiswarananda|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WocujrSu_sC&amp;pg=PT166&amp;dq=silence+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wA9eU6TRK4XrrAeZkoBI&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absorptive concentration is Samadhi. Superconscious trance is [[Nirbīja|nirbija]] (seedless) because it is objectless and devoid of ignorance which is the seed of bondage. The dispositions of super-conscious trances, brought about by supreme detachment due to faith (which is purity of mind), overpower and counteract the dispositions of conscious trances, when these are destroyed along with the mind to merge in Prakrti, the pure self, liberated, abides in its essential nature and shines forth with its light of transcendental consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy 1999 Ed.|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book|pages=312-313|url= http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attribute-less Brahman denoted by silence ==

The attribute-less [[Brahman]] is explained sometimes by silence. In his commentary on [[Brahma Sutras]] III.ii.17, [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] tells us that Bhadhva, questioned about Brahman by Bashkalin asked him to learn Brahman and became silent; on second and third questioning by Bashkalin he replied – " I am teaching you indeed, but you do not understand. Silence is that Self." The soundless ''Ardhamatra'', that lingers after the three differentiated sounds of [[Pranava]] (''[[Om]]'') die away, is [[Turiya]] or Pure Consciousness, the attributeless Brahman ([[Mandukya Upanishad]] 12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Principal Upanishads|publisher=Courier Diver Publications|pages=33,156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQxXk7pAx0cC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=silence+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fideU5GKH8iLrQeE74BI&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causal and the resultant conditions, the non-apprehension and misapprehension of Reality, do not exist in Turiya. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.2 |publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=213|url= https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silence is Awareness, it is the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the Self ([[Mundaka Upanishad]] II.ii.6) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Know the Upanishads|author=Ramanuj Prasad|publisher=S.Publishers|page=59|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpTC2rIhWegC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=silence++upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ty1eU9G-J8bVrQfJq4HYBw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absolutistic interpretation is that silence is the genuine teaching about the ultimate Reality, because the Absolute is beyond the scope of speech and thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism|publisher=SUNY Press|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=silence+advaita+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ta9dU5b9EoStrAeR0oDACg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20advaita%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kaivalya ==

[[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga]] are dualistic systems; they treat [[Purusa]] and [[Prakrti]] as equally real entities even though absolutely opposed to each other. The concept of [[Kaivalya]] signifies that the aim of these systems is to secure an "aloneness" by severing all connections. The discriminating knowledge does cause the separation of Purusa from Prakrti but Prakrti remains intact to cause further bondage. Kaivalya is false transcendence achieved by cutting oneself of altogether from all manifestation and through the ushering in of a blissful silence. The true transcendence, too, is a state above all manifestation, but not aloof or away from transcendence. True transcendence is also silence, but not the silence that is opposed to movement or change because its inherent nature is not disturbed. True transcendence is not the silence of death benumbing the creative flow of life but the silence of which both death and immortality are equal shadows – यस्य च्छायामृतं यस्य मृत्युः ([[Rig Veda]] X.121.2). The true [[advaita]] never needs the excision of a second in order to achieve its non-duality. The Mimamsakas took the view that nothing but exhaustion of all actions can lead to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the Upanishads 1999 Ed.|author=Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya|publisher=Pilgrims Book| page=64|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Govinda%20Gopal%20Mukhopadhyaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==

[[Yama]] tells [[Naciketa]] ([[Katha Upanishad]] I.iii.13) that the discriminating mind should merge the organ of speech into the mind; he who has extracted and tasted the real essence enjoys true happiness in total silence and all alone united with the source and protecting it ([[Rig Veda]] I.79.3). Sankara explains this unity by citing Badhva’s response to Bashkalin. The silence referred to by Badhva as the indescribable nature of Brahman is meant to be felt somewhere deep within. It is of far greater magnitude than mere looking into one’s own mind, far more acute than even the sharpest intellect that can ever read into and decipher its codes. This silence compels the framing of questions, and by itself is the answer not merely in the sound of speech that covers it and reaches the ears. The letters of the alphabet and the words they constitute do not emit the sound or sounds they represent; the sounds they depict are of no value if there is no meaning attached. The silence spoken of by Badhva by itself speaks out most eloquently because it has a meaning attached to it; we are that meaning as also the interpretation of its subtleness. Rishi Ayasya ([[Rig Veda]] IX.46.2) prays –

: परिष्कृतास इन्दवो योषेव पित्र्यावती |
: वायुं सोमा असृक्षत ||

He states that having acquired the knowledge of the Highest the learned people easily unravel the deeply hidden meaning of the most subtle kind. The letters of the alphabet are the limiting adjuncts of the sounds they denote. The space that exists between two lines is the same that exists between sentences, between words and between letters making up those words. But this space denotes no sound; it is devoid of limiting adjuncts or barriers, the same as the Supreme Being who is a mass of Pure Consciousness devoid of limiting adjuncts. Thus, Space which is silent, unchangeable, eternal and infinite is Brahman. Silence is the [[Avyakta]], the only reality whereas sound is the other Avyakta which is [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] or [[Prakrti]] that projects itself on account of its three qualities ([[guna]]s). Turiya is beyond utterance and is therefore called the Amatra. Sankara tells us that ignorance is the cause of all conditioned experiences, from the darkness of ignorance arises the sense of separateness, and an ignorant person is hardly aware of the continuous perception of Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=61-66|url=http://indiabookmart.com/Book_detail.asp?Bid=The+Illumination+Of+Knowledge&amp;catId=9788188951208 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110713024745/http://indiabookmart.com/Book_detail.asp?Bid=The+Illumination+Of+Knowledge&amp;catId=9788188951208 |archivedate=2011-07-13}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''name-letter effect''' is the tendency of people to prefer the [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] in their [[personal name|name]] over other letters in the [[alphabet]]. Whether [[Human subject research|subjects]] are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out of a set of two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.

Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian [[psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]], the name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for [[initial]]s, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both [[given name|given]] and [[surname|family names]] still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.

Most people [[self-esteem|like themselves]]; the name is associated with the [[psychology of self|self]], and hence the letters of the name are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other words. People who [[self-hatred|do not like themselves]] tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to [[birthday]]s: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as [[mere-exposure effect|frequent exposure]] and early mastery, have been ruled out. In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate [[implicit self-esteem]].

There is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor [[brand]]s matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to [[disaster relief]] following [[hurricane]]s with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following [[Hurricane Katrina]]). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.

== Background ==
Systematic interest in the letter preference began in 1959 with [[brand preference|brand-preference]] studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s for use in package labels.{{sfn|Mecherikoff|Horton|1959||p=114}} In an extension of the studies, [[Human subject research|subjects]] were asked to rank the [[English alphabet]] by the pleasantness of the appearance of [[letter case|capital letter]]s. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the [[coefficient of concordance|coefficients of concordance]] were low),{{sfn|Horton|Mecherikoff|1960|p=253}} a strong [[positive correlation]] was found between a letter's average rank and how [[frequency of letters|frequently]] it occurred as an initial letter of family names.{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|pp=124–125}}

[[Robert Zajonc]], a [[social psychologist]], published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of [[word]]s (e.g. "on" or "off"): in the overwhelming majority of trials the preferred word was also the most common.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|pp=6–7}} Zajonc also tested preferences for [[nonsense word]]s and found that people liked them the more they heard them.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=24}} He interpreted these results as evidence that [[mere exposure effect|mere repeated exposure]] to a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=1}}

Around 1977, Belgian [[experimental psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]] was driving on a highway looking at [[license plate]]s when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a "mere belongingness" as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

== First study ==
In his lab at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], Nuttin [[Design of experiments|designed experiments]] to test the [[hypothesis]] that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}} It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

To find an effect which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a [[yoked control design]] in which two subjects evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–355}}

For example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–356}}

In the first trial, 38 [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] local [[primary school|elementary school]] girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=357}} No [[significant difference]] was found using family name rather than first name or both names.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent [[data analysis]] revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}}

=== Discussion ===
Nuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, [[psychoacoustics|acoustical]], [[applied aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[semantics|semantic]], and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} He framed the effect in the context of [[narcissism]], [[Gestalt theory]] and [[awareness]], as reflected in the title of his 1985 article "Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect", in which "beyond Gestalt" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and "beyond awareness" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=358–359}} Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}

== Second study ==
In 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=381}}{{sfn|Sas|1986}} Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying [[affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=384}}

=== Method ===
Cross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (the only one with a non-[[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=385–386}}

=== Discussion ===
Across languages and letters, the average probability of a letter being chosen as one of the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=390}} The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=391}} There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=392}}

Nuttin analyzed the data to see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for [[Magyarország]]). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=396–397}}

The data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=397}}

As in the first study, the second one also included a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=397–398}} This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While there was a large consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=398}}{{efn-ua|This asymmetry is similar to what Czapiński found when analyzing school-trip companion preferences: much consensus as to who were the three least preferred students, but little in who were the three most preferred.{{sfn|Czapiński|1980|p=203}}}}

== Reception ==
In the light of how surprising the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the [[European Association of Social Psychology|European Association of Experimental Social Psychology]] in 1984,{{sfn|Nuttin|1984}} followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect "so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously think of an [[artifact (error)|artifact]]".{{sfn|Loosen|1990|p=11}}{{efn-ua|Loosen's critique stemmed from misinterpreting Nuttin's experimental design. Loosen thought that subjects in the yoked experiments were randomly selected to form a pair. However, this had not been the case. Nuttin had selected pairs based on minimal overlap of syllables in the subjects' names.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}}} Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was [[spurious relationship|spurious]], but they doubted its psychological relevance.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} In the first five years after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university ([[Ohio State University]], where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Johnson|1986}}{{efn-ua|Because the effect is most profound for initials, Johnson had christened the effect the ''initial-letter effect''. Nuttin did not agree with this [[reductionism]], saying there is no need to create the illusion of two phenomena where there is only one.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=396}}}}

This all changed in 1995, when Greenwald and Banaji pointed out that Nuttin's work was relevant to indirect measurement of self-esteem, which Nuttin himself had actually already suggested.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=11}} After that the original study was cited 14 times in the five years between 1995 and 1999, 50 times between 2000 and 2004, 114 times between 2005 and 2009, and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} The name-letter effect is no longer disputed and Nuttin's work has been called "seminal" by Stieger, Voracek, and Formann in their 2012 meta-analysis of 44 publications on the effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}} Their meta-analysis found no trace of [[publication bias]].{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|pp=66–67}}

== Characteristics ==
In her 2014 [[meta-analysis]] of dozens of name-letter effect studies, Hoorens called the effect robust.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} She noted robustness in:

* Scope: The name-letter effect is stronger for initials than for non-initials, but generally still holds even when excluding initials from analysis.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua| Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis found an effect only for initials, not for letters in other positions.{{sfn|Koole|Smeets|van Knippenberg|Dijksterhuis|1999|p=111}}}}
* Gender: All but two studies found the effect equally strong for women and men.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The exceptions are a study by Albers, Rotteveel, and Dijksterhuis, and one by Stieger, Preyss, and Voracek.{{sfn|Albers|Rotteveel|Dijksterhuis|2009|p=63}}{{sfn|Stieger|Preyss|Voracek|2012|p=51}}}}{{efn-ua|Gender-role orientation, the extent to which an individual adopts and displays traits, attitudes, and behaviors normatively identified as male-typical or female-typical, may also play a part in the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014|p=358}} It can be measured by the gender initial-preference task, which requires participants to rate letters for their gender typicality. Men have been shown to rate their initial letters as more male-typical, whereas women rate their initials as more female-typical.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014}}}}
* Age: The effect has been found in people ranging from school children to university students, middle-aged and old-aged adults.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The only known exception is a study by Kernis, Lakey, and Heppner.{{sfn|Kernis|Lakey|Heppner|2008|p=477}}}}
* Culture: Although there are many differences between [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western cultures]], including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the [[Thai name|family name]] is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=204}} Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for [[Japanese name|initials in Japan]], where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}
* Language: 15 languages have been tested ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, [[Thai language|Thai]]), covering four language families  ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Indo-Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Japonic]]) and five alphabets ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]], Roman, [[Cyrillic]], [[Devanagari]], [[Kana]]). In all cases a name-letter effect was found.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=184}}
* Time: In a study on preferences for initials, Stieger and LeBel found that people who had [[Maiden and married names|changed their name after marrying]] continued to show a preference for the initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage. Also, subjects who had been married less than two years already showed a name-letter effect for their new last name initial.{{sfn|Stieger|LeBel|2012|p=10}}

== Explanations ==
Various explanations for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected.

=== Disproved causes ===

==== Mere exposure ====
People may simply like most what they see most. Letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence of letters and [[phoneme]]s and how attractive they were judged to be.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|Forer|1940|p=589}}{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|p=123}} Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it.{{sfn|Zajonc|1980|p=151}} Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{efn-ua|Nuttin made the assumption that for any given letter, total exposure has been roughly the same for each subject. That is, an adult's name is read or written infrequently compared to all other words.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} Other researchers agreed; Greenwald and Banaji spoke of "reaching an asymptote".{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}}} He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=399}} In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=398–400}}

==== Subjective frequency ====
Subjective frequency is how frequently subjects {{em|think}} a stimulus appears. Name letters may be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the {{em|actual}} frequency was identical.{{sfn|Matlin|1971|p=295}} Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for the name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}} The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect than those who did not like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}}

==== Evaluative conditioning ====
[[Evaluative conditioning]] suggests that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of [[classical conditioning]] in which we come to like or dislike something through an association.{{sfn|Martin|Levey|1987|p=69}} Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the [[cocktail party effect]], it could be that the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}{{sfn|Mack|Rock|1998|p=18}} Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese [[kanji]]) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}

==== Subjective ownership ====
Subjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose the letters from their own name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.{{sfn|Hoorens|1990|p=29}}

==== Mastery pleasure ====
The letters first learned by a child, commonly their own name,{{sfn|Treiman|Broderick|1998|p=112}} may come to have lasting positive associations.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their [[first language|mother tongue]] alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=365}} Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, there should be no name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}{{efn-ua|The effect was not due to the two alphabets sharing letters. It was found for common letters with identical pronunciation (AEKMT), common letters with different pronunciation (BCFPYU), and Roman capitals not appearing in Cyrillic (DFGIJNRVWZ).{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}}} The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principal cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=368}} In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=190}}{{efn-ua|Other studies have since also found the effect to increase over age, for instance, Corenblum and Armstrong in their study of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Native Canadian]] children.{{sfn|Corenblum|Armstrong|2012|p=130}}}} They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet at the same time as the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later.{{efn-ua|Only Thai [[consonant]]s were presented as stimuli. Thai [[vowel]]s can not be used in isolation as their sound depends on their context.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=192}}}} They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=196–201}}

=== Probable cause ===
The effect is thought to arise from unconscious, automatic processes of self-evaluation, with different research groups coming at it from two different angles.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}}

==== Mere ownership ====
Nuttin frames the cause in terms of ownership, which has roots in [[behavioral economics|economic psychology]]. The [[endowment effect]] has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.{{sfn|Kahneman|Knetsch|Thaler|1991|p=193}}{{sfn|Beggan|1992|p=229}} Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just one example of a more general [[mere ownership effect|mere-ownership effect]].{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.

* Most people should like their name. Those that do not should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name relatively highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|pp=177–200}}
* Bilinguals using two different alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should be found in the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}} This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=183–184}}
* Similar effects should be found for other attributes connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more.{{sfn|Nickell|Pederson|Rossow|2003|pp=161–163}} In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong [[birthday-number effect]] for the day of the month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}

==== Implicit self-esteem ====
Another group of researchers has framed the cause in terms of [[social psychology]], specifically the [[self-esteem]] theory. Beginning with [[Anthony Greenwald|Greenwald]] and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from [[implicit self-esteem]], a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}} Most people like themselves.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=10}} The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=10–11}} As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin.{{sfn|Syz|1926|pp=119–126}} It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|p=108}}

* To be an automatic process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, [[Ap Dijksterhuis|Dijksterhuis]] and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each letter of the alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change between the first and second rating.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=672–673}} Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.{{sfn|Hoorens|Takano|Franck|Roberts|2015|p=910}}
* To be an automatic process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, be influenced by deliberate thought. Multiple studies have shown that thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|p=673}}{{sfn|Wilson|Dunn|Kraft|Lisle|1989|p=330}} Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of an automatic process.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=674–676}}
* Unconscious [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]] has been found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency.{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Mirenberg|Hetts|2002|p=170}} Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.{{sfn|Komori|Murata|2008|p=109}}
* If the effect is an automatic process, then the subliminal use of name letters should influence other preferences. Wentura, Kulfanek, and Greve investigated this by the use of a [[priming (psychology)|priming]] technique. They showed subjects the first and last initials of their own name or of a yoked subject's name, too briefly to be noticed. This was immediately followed by words such as "honest" and "lonely". Subjects had to quickly identify the word they had seen as positive or negative. It was found that subjects categorized positive words more quickly if they were first primed with their own initials. There was no effect for negative words. The effects of initial-letter priming were especially strong for subjects with high levels of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Wentura|Kulfanek|Greve|2001|p=657}}{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|pp=101–102}}
* If there is a halo effect spreading to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners.{{sfn|LeBel|Campbell|2009|p=1293}} DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Fiedorowicz|Carvallo|2011|p=127}}

== Application ==
In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the name-letter effect has been exploited to measure self-esteem.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=64}} There are two types of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}} Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to [[introspection]], measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.{{sfn|Spalding|Hardin|1999|p=535}}{{sfn|Krizan|Suls|2008|p=522}}

The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem, surpassed only by the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=233}} There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters of the alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the [[Likert scale|rating scales]] (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}

There is no standard [[algorithm]] for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the [[ipsative|ipsatized]] double-correction algorithm (the so-called "I-algorithm"), as originally recommended and named by LeBel and Gawronski{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=101}}).{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In her meta-analysis, Hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name-letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to the most important psychometric quality of all, [[content validity|validity]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=244}} The algorithms are typically applied to initials only, but can be used for all name letters.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}

Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}} They suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=248}} The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[physical health]], [[social acceptance]], [[unrealistic optimism]], feedback sensitivity, [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], and [[defensiveness]].{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=86}}

== Wider implications ==
Researchers have looked for wider implications of the name-letter effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab.

=== In the lab ===
In controlled studies in the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1099}}&amp;nbsp;The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did like&amp;nbsp;Honda&amp;nbsp;more than non-matching brands).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1108}}&amp;nbsp;They speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things.{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1109}}&amp;nbsp;Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1089}}&amp;nbsp;The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1095}}

Wiebenga and Fennis investigated whether the use of the&amp;nbsp;[[personal pronoun]]s&amp;nbsp;"I" and "my" in branding also had an effect on preferences, given the way these pronouns link to the self. They found that brand names with a generic self-referencing pronoun (e.g. [[iPhone]], [[Myspace]]) were evaluated more positively than non-self-referencing brand names (e.g.&amp;nbsp;[[Xbox]]). The effect behaved like the name-letter effect: when the self was put under threat the effect became stronger, and it disappeared for people with negative self-evaluations.{{sfn|Wiebenga|Fennis|2012|p=733}}

A study by Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase the quality of group work. In a study of&amp;nbsp;[[undergraduate]]&amp;nbsp;students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.{{sfn|Polman|Pollmann|Poehlman|2013}}

=== Outside the lab ===
==== Controversial studies ====
Researchers have looked for evidence of the driving force behind the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of&amp;nbsp;[[implicit egotism]], starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Carvallo|Mirenberg|2004|p=665}} &amp;nbsp;Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}}

Simonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An example of a confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters "Den" compared to with "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, and more likely to be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more "Den" dentists than "Wal" than implicit egotism.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=22–23}}&amp;nbsp;Using both a different data set ([[Twitter]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Google+]]&amp;nbsp;accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.{{sfn| Kooti|Magno|Weber|2014|p=216}}{{efn-ua|Overlooking a cohort confound was also the problem with controversial research that tied initials to death. Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive [[monogram]]s (e.g. ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g. PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999|p=241}} Morrison and Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artefact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. When they grouped the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005|p=820}} Similarly, Smith found statistical errors had led Abel and Kruger wrongly to conclude that [[Major League Baseball]] players whose names have positive initials live longer than players with negative initials.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=211}}{{sfn|Abel|Kruger|2007|p=179}}}}

Dyjas, Grasman, Wetzels, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers criticized the method Pelham et al. used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 "Saint cities" in the US, such as&amp;nbsp;[[St. Louis]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Whereas Pelham et al. pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name (e.g. Louis or Paul), Dyjas et al. used&amp;nbsp;[[Bayesian network|Bayesian hierarchical modelling]]&amp;nbsp;to show that there are several cities where the opposite happens, people moving away from their name Saint city. They concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=7–10}}&amp;nbsp;A different set of cities containing 30 surnames, such as&amp;nbsp;[[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city–surname matches.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=8–9}} Dyjas et al. disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname, but instead cited Simonsohn's argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away, a case of reverse causality.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|p=9}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=15}}

Simonsohn also raised the possibility of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.{{sfn|Anseel|Duyck|2008|p=1059}}&amp;nbsp;But Simonsohn suspected that, like&amp;nbsp;[[Walt Disney]] working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=1087}}

A few controversial studies have linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams found no evidence of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players [[strikeout|striking out]] (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams |2010|p=881}}{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}} Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] than others with initials A or B.{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}}&amp;nbsp;Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams|2011|p=340}}

In response to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something the&amp;nbsp;''[[New Scientist]]''&amp;nbsp;has coined&amp;nbsp;[[nominative determinism]].{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994}} Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were [[metalsmith|smiths]]. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

==== Undisputed studies ====
[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Satellite image of a hurricane|upright|[[Hurricane Katrina]]: people with the initial K especially donated to the disaster relief.]]
Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Mitch|Mitch]]). They found that people who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.{{sfn|Chandler|Griffin|Sorensen|2008|pp=404–410}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|pp=44–45}}&amp;nbsp;Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=46}}

'''Neo-conceptual art''' describes art practices in the 1980s and particularly 1990s to date that derive from the [[conceptual art]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  These subsequent initiatives have included the [[Moscow Conceptualists]], United States neo-conceptualists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and the [[Young British Artists]], notably [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where there is also a [[Stuckism]] counter-movement and criticism from the 1970s conceptual art group [[Art and Language]].

Many of the concerns of the "conceptual art" movement proper have been taken up by many contemporary artists since the initial wave of conceptual artists. While many of these artists may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, [[digital art]], and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[computer art]], [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art]]. Many critics and artists may speak of conceptual aspects of a given artist or art work, reflecting the enduring influence that many of the original conceptual artists have had on the art world.

==New York City==
The idea of neo-conceptual art (sometimes later termed [[post-conceptual art]]) in the United States was clearly articulated by [[Tricia Collins]] and [[Richard Milazzo]] (working as a team called: Collins &amp; Milazzo) in the early 1980s in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/arts/art-now-on-view-new-work-by-freelance-curators.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm ART; Now on View, New Work by Freelance Curators]&lt;/ref&gt; when they brought to prominence a whole new generation of artists through their copious writings and curatorial activity. It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of neo (or post) conceptual art; one that argued simultaneously against [[Neo-Expressionism]] and Picture-Theory Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DAN+CAMERON+ON+Collins+%26+Milazzo.-a057475774] DAN CAMERON ON Collins &amp; Milazzo&lt;/ref&gt; It was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with Neo-Conceptualism (or what some of the critics reductively called “Simulationism” and “Neo Geo”) was first brought together: artists such as [[Ross Bleckner]], [[James Welling]], [[Steven Parrino]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Mark Innerst]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Jonathan Lasker]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Robert Gober]] and [[Saint Clair Cemin]].

==Moscow==
The [[Moscow Conceptualists]], in the 1970s and 80s, attempted to subvert socialist ideology using the strategies of [[conceptual art]] and [[appropriation art]]. The central figures were [[Ilya Kabakov]] and [[Komar and Melamid]]. The group also included [[Eric Bulatov]] and [[Viktor Pivovarov]].

==London==
The [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work was described at the time as neo-conceptual,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Lash and Celia Lury, ''Global Culture Industries: The Mediation of Things'', Polity, 2007, p211. {{ISBN|0-7456-2483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a neo-conceptualist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression. Charles Harrison, a member of the conceptual art group [[Art and Language]] in the 1970s, criticizes the neo-conceptual art of the 1990s as conceptual art "without threat or awkwardness"&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p29. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "vacant" prospect.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p241. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists associated with neo-conceptualism in the UK include [[Martin Creed]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Bethan Huws]], [[Simon Patterson (artist)|Simon Patterson]], [[Simon Starling]] and [[Douglas Gordon]].

==Notable events==
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using models to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

2005: [[Simon Starling]] wins the Turner Prize for ''Shedboatshed'', a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy in the UK==
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the rise to prominence of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs) after the 1988 ''[[Freeze (exhibition)|Freeze]]'' show, curated by Damien Hirst, and subsequent promotion of the group by the [[Saatchi Gallery]] during the 1990s, generated a media backlash, where the phrases "conceptual art" and "neo-conceptual" came to be terms of derision applied to much [[contemporary art]]. This was amplified  by the [[Turner Prize]] whose more extreme nominees (most notably Hirst and Emin) caused a controversy annually.

[[File:Stuckists Death of Conceptual Art demo (3).jpg|thumb|right|170 px|[[Stuckism|Stuckists']] "Death of Conceptual Art" coffin demonstration, 2002]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002 deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/WhiteCube.html "White Cube Demo 2002"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 19 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040907/ai_n12797891 "Visual arts: Saying knickers to Sir Nicholas], ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 September 2004. Retrieved from findarticles.com, 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They staged yearly demonstrations outside the Turner Prize.

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]] (an art school graduate) denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/11/01/nart01.xml ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004 the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/02/nsaat02.xml "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed  April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA collection.

In [[experimental physics]], researchers have proposed '''Non-extensive self-consistent thermodynamic theory''' to describe phenomena observed in the [[Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]].  This theory investigates a [[Fireball concept|fireball]] for [[high-energy particle]] collisions, while using [[Tsallis entropy|Tsallis non-extensive thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; Fireballs lead to the bootstrap idea, or [[self-consistency principle]], just as in the [[Boltzmann statistics]] used by [[Rolf Hagedorn]].&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; Assuming the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] gets variations, due to possible symmetrical change, [[Abdel Nasser Tawfik]] applied the non-extensive concepts of high-energy particle production.&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt;&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt;

The motivation to use the non-extensive statistics from Tsallis&lt;ref&gt;C. Tsallis, J Stat Phys 52, 479-487, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the results obtained by Bediaga et al&lt;ref&gt;I. Bediaga, E.M.F. Curado and J.M. de Miranda, Physica A 286 (2000) 156.&lt;/ref&gt;. They showed that with the substitution of the Boltzmann factor in Hagedorn's theory by the q-exponential function, it was possible to recover good agreement between calculation and experiment, even at energies as high as those achieved at the [[LHC]], with q&gt;1.

==Non-extensive entropy for ideal quantum gas==
The starting point of the theory is [[entropy]] for a non-extensive quantum gas of [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], as proposed by Conroy, Miller and Plastino,&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; which is given by &lt;math&gt;S_q=S_q^{FD}+S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_q^{FD}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Fermi–Dirac entropy and &lt;math&gt;S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Bose–Einstein entropy.

That group&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; and also Clemens and Worku,&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt; the entropy just defined leads to occupation number formulas that reduce to Bediaga's. C. Beck,&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt; shows the power-like tails present in the distributions found in [[high energy physics]] experiments.

== Non-extensive partition function for ideal quantum gas ==
Using the entropy defined above, the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] results are
:&lt;math&gt; \ln[1+Z_q(V_o,T)]=\frac{V_o}{2\pi^2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\int_0^{\infty}dm \int_0^{\infty}dp \, p^2 \rho(n;m)[1+(q-1)\beta \sqrt{p^2+m^2}]^{-\frac{nq}{(q-1)}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since experiments have shown that &lt;math&gt;q&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, this restriction is adopted.

Another way to write the non-extensive partition function for a fireball is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T)=\int_0^{\infty}\sigma(E)[1+(q-1)\beta E]^{-\frac{q}{(q-1)}} dE\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the density of states of the fireballs.

==Self-consistency principle==
Self-consistency implies that both forms of partition functions must be asymptotically equivalent and that the [[mass spectrum]] and the [[density of states]] must be related to each other by
:&lt;math&gt; log[\rho(m)]= log[\sigma(E)] &lt;/math&gt;,
in the limit of &lt;math&gt;m,E&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large.

The self-consistency can be asymptotically achieved by choosing&lt;ref name=depp1&gt;A. Deppman, Physica A 391 (2012) 6380.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m^{3/2} \rho(m)=\frac{\gamma}{m}\big[1+(q_o-1) \beta _o m\big]^{\frac{1}{q_o -1}}=\frac{\gamma}{m}[1+(q'_o-1)  m]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)=bE^a\big[1+(q'_o-1)E\big]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;q'_o-1=\beta _o (q_o-1)&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;a,b,\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants. For &lt;math&gt;q' \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; the two expressions above approach the corresponding expressions in Hagedorn's theory.

==Main results==
With the mass spectrum and density of states given above, the asymptotic form of the partition function is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T) \rightarrow \bigg(\frac{1}{\beta - \beta _o }\bigg)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt; a+1=\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One immediate consequence of the expression for the partition function is the existence of a limiting temperature &lt;math&gt;T_o=1/\beta _o&lt;/math&gt;. This result is equivalent to Hagedorn's result.&lt;ref  name=hage&gt;R. Hagedorn, Suppl. Al Nuovo Cimento 3 (1965) 147.&lt;/ref&gt; With these results, it is expected that at sufficiently high energy, the fireball presents a constant temperature and constant entropic factor.

==Experimental evidence==

Experimental evidence of the existence of a limiting temperature and of a limiting entropic index can be found in [[Jean Cleymans|J. Cleymans]] and collaborators,&lt;ref name=cley1&gt;J. Cleymans and D. Worku, J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 39 (2012)http://iopscience.iop.org/0954-3899/39/2/025006/pdf/0954-3899_39_2_025006.pdf

The '''Online Consciousness Conference''' held at Consciousness Online &lt;ref&gt;http://consciousnessonline.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2008 by Richard Brown, then a graduate student at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]]. The conference was inspired by and partially modeled on the Online Philosophy Conference &lt;ref&gt;http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/online_philosophy_confere/&lt;/ref&gt; started by Thomas Nadellhoffer and Eddie Nahmias, with one major difference being the heavy use of homemade video and audio presentations, and another difference being the restricted focus of the conference on consciousness studies as opposed to all of philosophy.

==The Conferences==
The first conference was held February 20-March 4, 2009 with the theme "Philosophers Facing Phenomenal Consciousness" and a keynote given by [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M. Rosenthal]]. Papers from this conference were subsequently published in the [[Journal of Consciousness Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/jcs_17_3-4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123204645/http://imprint.co.uk/jcs_17_3-4.html |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second conference was held February 19-March 5, 2010 with the theme "Lessons and Limits from the Empirical Study of Consciousness" with keynote talks by Hakwan Lau (psychology Columbia) with commentary by [[Ned Block]], David Rosenthal and [[David Chalmers]], and Collin Clifford (psychology University of Sydney). Papers from it are due to be published in [[Consciousness and Cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://consciousnessonline.wordpress.com/information-for-contributors/&lt;/ref&gt; The third conference was held February 18-March 4, 2011 with the theme "Neurophilosophy and the Philosophy of Neuroscience" and featured invited talks from [[Paul Churchland]], [[Kathleen Akins]], [[Stevan Harnad]] and [[Jesse Prinz]]. 

Past presentations and the discussion at the conference is preserved online and can be viewed at Consciousness Online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4727">'''Parts stress modelling''' is a method in [[engineering]] and especially [[electronics]] to find an expected value for the rate of [[failure]] of the mechanical and electronic components of a system. It is based upon the idea that the more components that there are in the system, and the greater stress that they undergo in operation, the more often they will fail.

'''Parts count modelling''' is a simpler variant of the method, with component stress not taken into account.

Various organisations have published standards specifying how parts stress modelling should be carried out. Some from electronics are:

* MIL-HDBK-217 (US Department of Defense)
* SR-332, Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-332&amp; SR-332, Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* HRD-4 ([[British Telecom]])
* SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-1171&amp; SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;
* and many others

These "standards" produce different results, often by a factor of more than two, for the same modelled system. The differences illustrate the fact that this modelling is not an exact science. System designers often have to do the modelling using a standard specified by a customer, so that the customer can compare the results with other systems modelled in the same way.

All of these standards compute an expected overall failure rate for all the components in the system, which is not necessarily the rate at which the system as a whole fails. Systems often incorporate [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] or [[fault tolerance]] so that they do not fail when an individual component fails.

Several companies provide programs for performing parts stress modelling calculations. It's also possible to do the modelling with a [[spreadsheet]].

All these models implicitly assume the idea of "random failure". Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate, analogous to the process of [[nuclear decay]]. One justification for this idea is that components fail by a process of wearout, a predictable decay after manufacture, but that the wearout life of individual components is scattered widely about some very long mean. The observed "random" failures are then just the extreme outliers at the early edge of this distribution. However, this may not be the whole picture.

All the models use basically the same process, with detailed variations.
* Identify the components in the system
** Such as R123, 10kOhm carbon film resistor
* For each component, determine the '''component model''' to use from the standard
** Such as "resistor, film, &lt; 1 Megohm" or "Connector, multi-pin"
* From the standard's component model, discover what, if any, '''complexity''' parameter is needed, and find the value of that parameter for this component
** Such as pin count for a connector or gate count for a chip
* From the standard's component model, discover what '''thermal stress curve''' applies, and find the value of the '''temperature''' in operation for this component
** The failure rate of connectors may change little with temperature, while that of capacitors may change greatly
* From the standard's component model, discover what, if any, '''part stress''' parameter is needed, what '''part stress curve''' applies, and find the value of that part stress parameter for this component in this application
** A part stress might be the applied power as a fraction of the component's rated power, or the applied voltage as a fraction of the rated voltage
* From the standard's component model, find the '''base failure rate''' for this component, and modify that according to the complexity parameter, the [[operating temperature]] and thermal stress curve, the part stress parameter and part stress curve, with arithmetic specified by the standard. This now is the expected failure rate for this component in this application
* Add up all the results for every component in the system to find the overall failure rate for all components in this system.

Other global modification parameters can be employed, which are assumed to have the same effect on every component failure rate. The most usual are the environment, such as '''ground benign''' or '''airborne, commercial''', and the purchasing quality assurance process. The standards specify overall multiplier factors for these various choices.

A brawl occurred between players of the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine]] and [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australian]] men's national basketball teams during a match held on July 2, 2018 at the [[Philippine Arena]] in [[Bocaue]], [[Bulacan]], Philippines. The match was part of the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)|2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualification]] process.

The brawl caused a disruption of the game in the third quarter lasting more than 30 minutes. Officials suspended 4 Australian players and 9 Filipino players and the game was briefly resumed. All but one of the three remaining Filipino players intentionally fouled out prematurely, ending the game within the same quarter. The Philippines lost by default in favour of Australia.

FIBA imposed sanctions on both sides; game suspensions were given to 10 Filipino players (for a maximum of 6 games) and 3 Australian players (maximum of 5 games). The Philippines' head coach and assistant coach were also sanctioned. Both the national federations of the Philippines and Australia were fined. The three referees who officiated at the match were also suspended for a year. Despite the brawl, both Australia and the Philippines advance to the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers.

The Philippine national team is obliged to play their next home match in the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers behind closed doors with the succeeding two home games being placed under probation. The brawl also played a part in their withdrawal from the [[Basketball at the 2018 Asian Games – Men's tournament|2018 Asian Games]], a decision which was later reversed.

==Background==
===Road to 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup===
For the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup]], members of [[FIBA Asia]] and [[FIBA Oceania]] confederations participated in one qualification process.
For the first round of the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)|joint Asia and Oceania qualifiers]], the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippines]] and [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] were drawn part of Group B along with [[Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team|Chinese Taipei]] and [[Japan men's national basketball team|Japan]].

The Philippines and Australia first played against each other in the qualifiers in [[Melbourne]]. The home side, Australia won over the visitors 84–68. Prior to the start of their second face off, this time in [[Bocaue]], Philippines, the two teams has already qualified for the second round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers.

The last FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifier match of the Philippines prior to their second match-up against Australia was against Chinese Taipei away from home. They won the game by 22 points. The Philippines decided to retain 10 players from the Chinese Taipei game for their next match replacing [[Jio Jalalon]] and [[Allein Maliksi]] with [[Baser Amer]] and [[Carl Bryan Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lintag |first1=Paul |title=Amer added to Gilas for Australia rematch |url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/basketball/news/2018/07/01/fiba-amer-added-gilas-australia-rematch-43779 |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia suffered a 78-79 defeat to Japan prior to their second Philippines game but decided to retain the 12 players in their roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zarate |first1=Noel |title=Australia to use same lineup in Japan loss against Gilas |url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/gilas/story/_/id/23968195/australia-use-same-lineup-japan-loss-gilas |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=ESPN |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed door practice===
There were already tensions between the Australian and Philippine side prior to the start of the brawl-marred game.&lt;ref name="naredo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=FIBA World Cup: After bench-clearing brawl, Gilas loses by default to Australia |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/02/18/fiba-world-cup-after-bench-clearing-brawl-gilas-loses-by-default-to-australia |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the closed-door practice by the Australia national team on July 1, 2018,&lt;ref name="dioquino"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dioquino |first1=Delfin |title=SBP accepts Australia apology for PH Arena incident |url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/gilas-pilipinas/206296-sbp-accepts-australia-apology-removing-sponsors-decals-philippine-arena |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=Rappler |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australians removed the decals of corporate sponsors [[PLDT]] and [[Chooks-to-Go]] on the court reportedly due to player safety issues. Officials from the Philippines national basketball association, the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]] (SBP) criticized the move stating that the Australians should have asked permission. Philippine head coach [[Chot Reyes]] said that the Australians removed the decals for being slippery and added that the decals were approved to use by FIBA. He also mentioned that SBP and FIBA officials were at the venue. Reyes along with SBP official [[Manny V. Pangilinan]] posted the video of the act through [[Twitter]] expressing displeasure of the move saying that they will "not back down" from the Australians.&lt;ref name="removes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Australians remove PLDT decals from PH Arena court |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/01/18/watch-australians-remove-pldt-decals-from-ph-arena-court |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia apologized for the incident and the SBP accepted the apology. The SBP however maintained that the actions of the Australian side were unacceptable. The decals were restored two hours prior to tip-off.&lt;ref name="dioquino"/&gt;

===Pre-game confrontations===
During the pre-game warm-ups, Philippine players began crowding onto the Australian half of the court. [[Calvin Abueva]], a member of the Philippine national basketball team, attempted to trip Australian player Daniel Kickert who countered back by pushing and shoving another member of the Philippine basketball team whom he mistook for Abueva. A short confrontation between the two teams resulted thereafter which had to be defused by the referees before the start of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/basketball/video-shows-pregame-incident-sparked-philippines-brawl/news-story/4909ca06a912a0d6d1c4a7d57346b81e|title=What really sparked brawl madness|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abueva admitted to trying to trip Kickert but insisted that the Australians were already 'bullying' them even before he did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.spin.ph/basketball/fiba/abueva-admits-tripping-kickert-but-insists-sila-nagsimula-a2437-20180704?ref=site_search|title = Abueva admits tripping Kickert but insists: 'Sila nagsimula'|date =July 4, 2018|accessdate = July 8, 2018|website = [[Sports Interactive Network Philippines|Spin]]|publisher = |last = Leongson|first = Randolph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match details==
The Australians dominated the match, outscoring the Philippines in all three quarters played. The host was competitive against the visitors in the first quarter until Australia gained a 9-point lead by second quarter. The Philippines never recovered as Australia later achieved a double-digit lead against the hosts. [[Chris Goulding]] led the Australians in the scoring by contributing 20 points while [[Andray Blatche]] led the Philippines with 12 points.&lt;ref name="gilasloses"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lintag |first1=Paul |title=Gilas loses to Australia by default after fight-marred game |url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/basketball/news/2018/07/02/fiba-gilas-loses-aus-default-fight-marred-game-43830 |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brawl caused a 30-minute stoppage of the match.&lt;ref name="sbs"&gt;{{cite news |title='Sickening': Australia's Boomers in wild qualifier brawl with Philippines |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/sickening-australia-s-boomers-in-wild-qualifier-brawl-with-philippines |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=SBS News |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referees along with security officials left the court and went to the [[OB Van]] of [[ESPN 5]] outside the arena, which was covering the match, to review the brawl from different camera angles. They returned to the court to announce sanctions.&lt;ref name=reffire/&gt;

Match officials ruled that 13 players should be ejected before play was resumed.

This meant that the Philippine national team was left with only three players.

==Aftermath==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
The Philippines lost [[Forfeit (sport)|by default]] due to a lack of eligible players because of the ejection of nine of its players and the remaining players intentionally fouling out. The result of the Philippines-Australia game was allowed to stand. The Philippines ended its first round campaign with four wins and two defeats, both against Australia, settling for second place in Group B while Australia lost only one of its six games topping the group. Both teams advanced to the second round of the qualifiers.&lt;ref name=dioquino2/&gt;

Fearing for their own safety, the Australia national team remained in the Philippine Arena for several hours after the match. They also changed hotels following the game.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKern |first1=James |title=Video shows pre-game incident sparked Philippines brawl |url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/basketball/video-shows-pregame-incident-sparked-philippines-brawl/news-story/4909ca06a912a0d6d1c4a7d57346b81e |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=News.com.au |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===

[[Basketball Australia]] apologized for the brawl, accepting the Australia national team's role in the incident but expressing concern for the involvement of officials and fans in the fight.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Basketball Australia apologises for Boomers 'unsavoury' brawl with Philippines, says players 'bruised and battered' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-03/boomers-left-bruised-and-battered-after-brawl-in-philippines/9934478 |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=ABC.net |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]] apologized to Filipino fans and to the international basketball community for the brawl saying that the incident "breached the bounds of traditional Filipino hospitality" and asserting that "violence has no place in sports".&lt;ref name="sbpsorry"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Saldajeno |first1=Ivan |title=SBP says sorry after it "breached the bounds of traditional Filipino hospitality" |url=https://www.dugout.ph/2018/07/sbp-says-sorry-after-it-breached-bounds.html |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=Dugout Philippines |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both federations later issued a joint statement apologizing for the brawl and admitting full responsibility for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SBP, Basketball Australia apologize for Gilas-Boomers ‘basketbrawl’ |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/659321/sbp-basketball-australia-apologize-for-gilas-boomers-basketbrawl/story/ |accessdate=July 9, 2018 |work=GMA News |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other reactions====
Australia's [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] on their part said while the Australia national team should accept consequences regarding the brawl, they also condemned players, officials, and fans of the Philippine national team, stating what happened to the Australian side following the brawl is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bacnis |first1=Justine |title=Aussie league NBL condemns Boomers actions, Filipino fans |url=https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/aussie-league-nbl-condemns-boomers-actions-filipino-fans/120399 |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=Tiebreaker Times |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippine Basketball Association]] on 3 July 2018 invited players of the Philippine national team for a closed-door meeting scheduled on July 5, 2018 to discuss the incident, which could possibly impose its own fines and suspensions to members of the Philippine basketball team who were involved. No similar actions as of late were to be seen from Basketball Australia.&lt;ref name="pbameeting"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bacnis |first1=Justine |title=PBA sets up meeting with Gilas regarding brawl |url=https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/pba-sets-meeting-gilas-regarding-brawl/120361 |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=Tiebreaker Times |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group selfie took by Filipino player Marc Pingris with the rest of the Philippine national team was criticized as insensitive but head coach [[Chot Reyes]] and [[Quinito Henson]] said that based on how they knew Pingris personally that the selfie was an attempt to defuse tension.&lt;ref name=sawit/&gt;&lt;ref name=insensitive/&gt; Reyes said that he would have stopped Pingris from taking the selfie given the circumstances.&lt;ref name=sawit/&gt;

According to Australia head coach [[Andrej Lemanis]], the brawl may cause the [[National Basketball Association]], who is already reluctant to release its players for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers, to hesitate even more about releasing its players for international play short of the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup]] or the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NBA may react badly to Philippines brawl, says Australia coach |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/04/daniel-kickert-admits-his-elbow-in-filipino-basketball-brawl-was-regrettable |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=The Guardian |agency=Australian Associated Press |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Further allegations====
=====Close door practice sabotage=====
After the brawl-marred game, Australia's coach [[Andrej Lemanis]] accused the Philippines of sabotaging his side's training the day before the match. He stated that when the Australian team went to the training venue, one of the courts in the venue had a rim which was "obviously too high" and when officials came to measure the rim it was too high by {{convert|6|to|7|in|cm}}. Lemanis then alleged that the people helping them in the court disappeared from the venue. He added that it was then that it became evident to his team that the court was unsafe to play on because of the way the decals were installed while reiterating Australia's early acknowledgement of not following the "correct process" in removing the decals. Lemanis said they decided to remove the decals due to time constraints caused by their limited practice time.&lt;ref name=sabotage&gt;{{cite news |title=Boomers coach Andrej Lemanis accuses Philippines of sabotaging Australia’s training session |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/boomers-coach-andrej-lemanis-accused-philippines-of-sabotaging-australias-training-session/news-story/63f83b1fc0d52b2286f09e658102839b |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=Fox Sport |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Racism=====
Alleged incidents of [[racism]] were raised after the brawl. Winston Baltasar, a Filipino freelance photographer covering the event, alleged that Australian players had used [[racial slurs]] [[Anti-Filipino sentiment|against Filipinos]] during an interview at ''The Ticket'', a radio program of Australia's [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. He said that Filipino players had been called "monkeys". The Australian Basketballers' Association and Basketball Australia issued a joint statement calling Baltasar's remarks as "unsubstantiated and highly defamatory" and expressed disappointment with ABC's decision to publish material relating to the remark. In an earlier interview on ''SportsCenter Philippines'', Philippine coach [[Chot Reyes]] said that he hadn't heard any incident of Australian players hurling derogatory remarks towards their Filipino counterparts during the half-time of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Basketball Australia issues statement on allegation |url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/gilas/story/_/id/24039686/basketball-australia-issues-statement-allegation |accessdate=July 9, 2018 |work=ESPN5 |date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
[[FIBA]] opened disciplinary proceedings against both Australia and the Philippines following the brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Philippines v Australia basketball: Mass brawl at World Cup qualifier |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/basketball/44688264 |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee of the match submitted statements and presented evidence to FIBA regarding the match and the brawl&lt;ref name="fibaaskms"&gt;{{cite news |title=FIBA asks Gilas PH to explain side |url=http://manilastandard.net/sports/basketball/269698/fiba-asks-gilas-ph-to-explain-side.html |accessdate=6 July 2018 |work=Manila Standard |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both the basketball federations of Australia and the Philippines were given video copies recording the incident. Both the Australian and Philippine federation were asked by FIBA to submit their own positions stating their sides regarding the brawl by July 10, 2018 but the deadline was later extended to midnight of July 13, 2018 ([[GMT+6]]).&lt;ref name=extend&gt;{{cite news |last1=Terrado |first1=Jonas |title=FIBA extends deadline for SBP, Basketball Australia |url=https://sports.mb.com.ph/2018/07/12/fiba-extends-deadline-for-sbp-basketball-australia/ |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |work=Manila Bulletin |date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions===
Prior to the imposition of sanctions by FIBA, [[Al Panlilio]] of Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) expressed hope that FIBA would view the incident as an isolated case and not affect the hosting rights of the Philippines for the [[2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup]]. He also expected that both federations of Australia and the Philippines would be fined and that it would be a surprise if FIBA would choose to impose indefinite suspensions of the respective basketball federations of Australia and the Philippines. He pointed to [[2010 Acropolis International Basketball Tournament|the incident]] between [[Serbia men's national basketball team|Serbia]] and [[Greece men's national basketball team|Greece]] in 2010 as a precedent for his expectation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Galvez |first1=Waylon |title=Panlilio hopes Gilas-Boomers brawl won’t affect 2023 FIBA World Cup PH hosting |url=https://sports.mb.com.ph/2018/07/04/panlilio-hopes-gilas-boomers-brawl-wont-affect-2023-fiba-world-cup-ph-hosting/ |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=Manila Bulletin |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July, FIBA handed down their decision after conducting disciplinary investigation. 10 players from the Philippine basketball team, its coach [[Chot Reyes]] and assistant coach [[Jong Uichico]], as well as 3 players from Australia were given suspension from playing future games in the qualifiers (six games maximum).&lt;ref name=handsout&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/gilas/story/_/id/24002291/fiba-hands-sanctions-gilas-boomers-brawl|title=FIBA hands out sanctions over Gilas-Boomers brawl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reyes was suspended for a single match while Uichico was suspended for three games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=James |title=Players, coaches and referees banned after mass brawl in FIBA World Cup qualifier |url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1067672/players-coaches-and-referees-banned-after-mass-brawl-in-fiba-world-cup-qualifier |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=Inside the Games |date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the SBP, FIBA was clear that the ban imposed on the Philippine players does not apply to the national team's planned participation in the [[Basketball at the 2018 Asian Games|2018 Asian Games]] in Indonesia, as well as their participation with their respective teams in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], and that the match suspensions are to served in the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers.&lt;ref name="asiangamessanc"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=SBP assures FIBA sanctions won’t apply to Asian Games |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/19/18/sbp-assures-fiba-sanctions-wont-apply-to-asian-games |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines played their next home court match [[Behind closed doors (sport)|behind closed doors]] (against Qatar on September 17, at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Quezon City]], with media coverage{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}), while a ban for two more home games as the country have been placed under a probationary period of three years. However, Samahang Basketball ng Pilipinas executive director Sonny Barrios stated if the behind-closed-doors game went well, the homecourt game ban can be possibly lifted and will be open for fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/20/18/fiba-world-cup-ph-hoops-exec-saddened-to-lose-6th-man-in-closed- FIBA World Cup: Philippine hoops exec saddened to lose 6th man in closed door game] [[ABS-CBN News]] Accessed July 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The country's co-hosting of the [[2023 FIBA World Cup]] is not affected by the sanctions.&lt;ref name=handsout/&gt;

===Impact===
====Philippines' Asian Games participation====
The brawl played a part in the Philippines' withdrawal from the [[Basketball at the 2018 Asian Games|basketball competition of the 2018 Asian Games]]. Before the brawl incident, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) planned to send a national team composed of the core of the [[TNT KaTropa]] of the Philippine Basketball Association. However such plan was cancelled after several players of the ball club along with naturalized player Andray Blatche got involved in the brawl. Though the player suspensions has no bearing in the Asian Games since the sanctions will be served in the next round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers, the SBP decided not to include any of players suspended due to the brawl in the Philippines' Asian Games roster.&lt;ref name="clarkson"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=Clarkson included in Gilas line-up, but will he play in Asian Games? |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/24/18/clarkson-included-in-gilas-line-up-but-will-he-play-in-asian-games |accessdate=July 27, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan was devised to send a national team composed of the core of the [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]] instead of TNT with [[NLEX Road Warriors]] coach Yeng Guiao to mentor the team. The Philippine Basketball Association officially announced the participation of Rain or Shine in the Asian Games on July 26, 2018 with the SBP declaring on the same day that the Philippine national team's withdrawal from the continental games saying that it and the national team intends "regroup, prepare for the process of appealing the FIBA Disciplinary Panel's recent decision, and aim for sustainable success in future tournaments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sarmenta |first1=Yoyo |title=SBP withdraws national basketball team from Asian Games |url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/24199532/sbp-withdraws-national-basketball-team-asian-games |accessdate=July 27, 2018 |work=ESPN 5 |date=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to withdraw was reversed on August 5, 2018 due to "clamor from fans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Manglinong|first=Dan |title=Gilas Pilipinas will compete in 2018 Asian Games after clamor against withdrawal |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/gilas-pilipinas-will-compete-in-2018-asian-games-after-clamor-against-withdrawal/ |accessdate=August 10, 2018 |work=InterAksyon |date=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">'''Pirate havens''' are ports or harbors that are a safe place for [[pirate]]s to repair their vessels, resupply, recruit, spend their plunder, avoid capture, and/or lie in wait for merchant ships to pass by. The areas have governments that are unable or unwilling to enforce [[maritime law]]s. This creates favorable conditions for piracy.

These havens were often near [[ocean|maritime]] [[shipping]] lanes. Although some havens were merely hidden coves, some were established by governments who employed [[privateer]]s to disrupt the overseas trade of rival nations.

Some historic pirate havens included [[Barataria Bay]], [[Port Royal]], and [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]. These provided some [[autonomy]] for privateers and buccaneers.

== On the Barbary Coast ==
Historically, the [[Barbary Coast]] contained a number of pirate havens, notably [[Salé]], [[Algiers]] and [[Tunis]]. These pirate havens were used by [[Barbary corsairs|Corsairs]] from the 16th to the 19th century. The pirates, dubbed "[[Barbary Pirates]]", ravaged European shipping and enslaved thousands of captives. The Pirate Republic of [[Salé]], in 17th century Morocco, was a [[micronation]] with its own seaport [[argot]] known as "Franco," since like other pirate states, it from time to time made treaties with European governments, agreeing not to attack their fleets.

The [[United States Navy#From reestablishment to the Civil War|United States Navy was founded]], in part, to counter the activities of the Barbary pirates, and the United States fought the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s (1801–1805, 1815) to end this threat to its shipping.

Some pirate havens were supposed to have formed [[anarchist]] societies called [[pirate utopia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no8/pirate.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the Somali Coast==
In the early 2000s piracy became common place off the coast of Somalia. During this period, pirate havens included [[Eyl]], in the [[Puntland]] region of northern [[Somalia]], and [[Harardhere]] (Xarard-heere), in the [[Mudug]] province of Somalia. During the same time period Transitional Federal Government of [[Somalia]] was believed to unable to enforce maritime laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=U.S. Captain is Hostage of Pirates; Navy Ship Arrives |journal=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/world/africa/09pirates.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Eyl&amp;st=cse |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2009-04-09 |first1=Mark | last1=Mazzetti | first2=Sharon | last2=Otterman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern havens included [[Garaad]] and [[Hobyo]] in central Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tiede.fi, the Finnish science magazine Tiede, no 5/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{dictionary definition|date=January 2014}}

'''Preconditioning''' occurs when an animal is exposed to a [[stressor]] or [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] in order to prepare it for a later encounter with a similar stressor or stimulus. 

For example, in [[vaccination]]s, a human is exposed to an artificially weakened [[virus]] in order to stimulate the body's [[immune system]] to produce [[antibodies]] that fight the virus. Then, when the live virus is encountered, the body can vigorously defend against it, already having produced the relevant antibodies. See [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]].

{{psychology sidebar}}
'''Reactance''' is an unpleasant motivational arousal (reaction) to offers, persons, rules, or regulations that threaten or eliminate specific [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] [[Free will|freedoms]]. Reactance occurs when a person feels that someone or something is taking away their choices or limiting the range of alternatives.

Reactances can occur when someone is heavily pressured to accept a certain view or [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. Reactance can cause the person to adopt or strengthen a view or attitude that is contrary to what was intended, and also increases resistance to [[persuasion]]. People using [[reverse psychology]] are playing on reactance, attempting to influence someone to choose the opposite of what they request.

==Definition==
Psychological reactance is "an unpleasant motivational arousal that emerges when people experience a threat to or loss of their free behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;Steindl, C., Jonas, E., Sittenthaler, S., Traut-Mattausch, E., &amp; Greenberg, J. (2015). [https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/2151-2604/a000222 Understanding psychological reactance]. Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 223(4), 205–214. doi:10.1027/2151-2604/a000222 PMC:4675534 PMID:27453805&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brehm1966&gt;Brehm, J. W. (1966). ''A theory of psychological reactance''. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brehm1981&gt;Brehm, S. S., &amp; Brehm, J. W. (1981). ''Psychological Reactance: A Theory of Freedom and Control''. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such behavior can be observed when an individual engages in a prohibited activity in order to deliberately taunt the [[authority]] who prohibits it, regardless of the [[utility]] or disutility that the activity confers. An individual's freedom to select when and how to conduct their behavior, and the level to which they are aware of the relevant freedom—and are able to determine behaviors necessary to satisfy that freedom—affect the generation of psychological reactance. It is assumed that if a person's behavioral freedom is threatened or reduced, they become [[motivation]]ally [[arousal|aroused]]. The fear of loss of further freedoms can spark this arousal and motivate them to re-establish the threatened freedom. Because this motivational state is a result of the perceived reduction of one's freedom of action, it is considered a [[counterforce]], and thus is called "psychological reactance".

There are four important elements to reactance theory: perceived freedom, threat to freedom, reactance, and restoration of freedom. Freedom is not an abstract consideration, but rather a feeling associated with real behaviors, including [[Action (philosophy)|actions]], [[emotion]]s, and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]].

Reactance also explains [[denial]] as it is encountered in [[addiction]] counselling. According to William R. Miller,&lt;ref name=Miller2000&gt;Miller, W. R. (2000) ''Motivational Enhancement Therapy: Description of Counseling Approach''. in  Boren, J. J. Onken, L. S., &amp; Carroll, K. M. (Eds.) Approaches to Drug Abuse Counseling, National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2000, pp. 89–93.&lt;/ref&gt; "Research demonstrates that a counselor can drive resistance (denial) levels up and down dramatically according to his or her personal counseling style". Use of a "respectful, reflective approach" described in [[motivational interviewing]] and applied as [[Motivational therapy|motivation enhancement therapy]], rather than by [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], the accusation of "being in denial",  and direct confrontations, lead to the motivation to change and avoid the resistance and denial, or reactance, elicited by strong direct confrontation.&lt;ref name=MillerRollnick1991&gt;Miller, W.R. &amp; Rollnick, S. ''Motivational Interviewing: Preparing People to Change Addictive Behavior''. NY: Guilford Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactance theory assumes there are "free behaviors" individuals perceive and can take part in at any given moment. For a behavior to be free, the individual must have the relevant [[Human body|physical]] and [[Psychology|psychological]] abilities to partake in it, and must know they can engage in it at the moment, or in the near future.

"Behavior" includes any imaginable act. More specifically, behaviors may be explained as "what one does (or doesn't do)", "how one does something", or "when one does something". It is not always clear, to an [[Observation|observer]], or the individuals themselves, if they hold a particular freedom to engage in a given behavior. When a person has such a free behavior they are likely to experience reactance whenever that behavior is restricted, eliminated, or threatened with elimination.

There are several rules associated with free behaviors and reactance:
{{ordered list
| When certain free behaviors are threatened or removed, the more important a free behavior is to a certain individual the greater the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the reactance.
{{ordered list|list-style-type=lower-alpha
 |  The level of reactance has a direct relationship to the importance of the eliminated or threatened behavioral freedom, in relationship to the importance of other freedoms at the time.
 }}
|  With a given set of free behaviors, the greater the proportion threatened or eliminated, the greater will be the total level of reactance.
|  When an important free behavior has been threatened with elimination, the greater will be the threat, and the greater will be the level of reactance.
{{ordered list|list-style-type=lower-alpha
 |  When there is a loss of a single free behavior, there may be by implication a related threat of removal of other free behaviors now or in the future.
 |  A free behavior may be threatened or eliminated by virtue of the elimination (or threat of elimination) of another free behavior; therefore a free behavior may be threatened by the relation of the elimination of (or threat to) another person's free behavior.
 }}
}}
Other core concepts of the theory are [[Rationalization (psychology)|justification]] and legitimacy. A possible effect of justification is a limitation of the threat to a specific behavior or set of behaviors. For example, if Mr Doe states that he is interfering with Mrs. Smith's [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s because of an emergency, this keeps Mrs Smith from imagining that Mr Doe will interfere on future occasions as well. Likewise, legitimacy may point to a set of behaviors threatened since there will be a general assumption that an illegitimate interference with a person's freedom is less likely to occur. With legitimacy there is an additional implication that a person's freedom is equivocal.

==Effects==
In the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of reactance, there is no assumption that a person will be aware of reactance. When a person becomes aware of reactance, they will feel a higher level of self-direction in relationship to their own behavior. In other words, they will feel that if they are able to do what they want, then they do not have to do what they do not want. In this case, when the freedom is in question, that person alone is the director of their own behavior.

When considering the direct re-establishment of freedom, the greater the magnitude of reactance, the more the individual will try to re-establish the freedom that has been lost or threatened. When a freedom is threatened by a [[Peer pressure|social pressure]], then reactance will lead a person to resist that pressure. Also, when there are restraints against a direct re-establishment of freedom, there can be attempts at re-establishment by [[Logical implication|implication]] whenever possible.

Freedom can and may be reestablished by a social implication. When an individual has lost a free behavior because of a social threat, then the participation in a free-like behavior by a similar person will allow one to re-establish one's own freedom.

In summary, the definition of psychological reactance is a motivational state that is aimed at re-establishment of a threatened or eliminated freedom. A short explanation of the concept is that the level of reactance has a direct relationship between the importance of a freedom which is eliminated or threatened, and a proportion of free behaviors eliminated or threatened.

==Empirical evidence==
A number of studies have looked at psychological reactance, providing [[empirical]] [[evidence]] for the behaviour; some key studies are discussed below.

Brehm's 1981 study "Psychological reactance and the attractiveness of unobtainable objects: sex differences in children's responses to an elimination of freedom" examined the differences in sex and age in a child's view of the attractiveness of obtained and unobtainable objects. The study reviewed how well children respond in these situations and determined if the children being observed thought the "grass was greener on the other side". It also determined how well the child made peace with the world if they devalued what they could not have. This work concluded that when a child cannot have what they want, they experience emotional consequences of not getting it.&lt;ref name="Brehm1981/2"&gt;Brehm, Sharon S. (1981). Psychological reactance and the attractiveness of unobtainable objects: Sex differences in children's responses to an elimination of freedom. ''Sex Roles, Volume 7, Number 9'', 937–949&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In this study the results were duplicated from a previous study by Hammock and J. Brehm (1966). The male subjects wanted what they could not obtain, however the female subjects did not conform to the theory of reactance. Although their freedom to choose was taken away, it had no overall effect on them.

Silvia's 2005 study "Deflecting reactance: The role of similarity in increasing compliance and reducing resistance" concluded that one way to increase the activity of a threatened freedom is to [[Censorship|censor]] it, or provide a threatening message toward the activity. In turn a "[[Boomerang effect (psychology)|boomerang effect]]" occurs, in which people choose forbidden alternatives. This study also shows that social influence has better results when it does not threaten one's core freedoms. Two concepts revealed in this study are that a communicator may be able to increase the positive force towards [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] by increasing their credibility, and that increasing the positive communication force and decreasing the negative communication force simultaneously should increase compliance.&lt;ref name="Silvia2005"&gt;Silvia, P. J. (2005). Deflecting reactance: The role of similarity in increasing compliance and reducing resistance. ''Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 27,'' 277–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller and colleagues concluded in their 2006 study, "Identifying principal risk factors for the initiation of adolescent smoking behaviors: The significance of psychological reactance", that psychological reactance is an important indicator in [[Adolescence|adolescent]] [[smoking]] initiation. [[Peer group|Peer]] [[Intimate relationship|intimacy]], peer [[individuation]], and [[Intergenerationality|intergenerational]] individuation are strong predictors of psychological reactance. The overall results of the study indicate that children think that they are capable of making their own decisions, although they are not aware of their own limitations. This is an indicator that adolescents will experience reactance to authoritative control, especially the proscriptions and prescriptions of adult behaviors that they view as [[Hedonism|hedonically]] relevant.&lt;ref name="Miller2006"&gt;Miller, C. H., Burgoon, M., Grandpre, J., &amp; Alvaro, E. (2006). Identifying principal risk factors for the initiation of adolescent smoking behaviors: The significance of psychological reactance. ''Health Communication 19,'' 241–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Dillard &amp; Shen have provided evidence that psychological reactance can be measured,&lt;ref name="DillardShen2005"&gt;Dillard, J., &amp; Shen, L. (2005). On the nature of reactance and its role in persuasive health communication. ''Communication Monographs,'' 72, 144–168.&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the contrary opinion of Jack Brehm, who developed the theory. In their work they measured the impact of psychological reactance with two parallel studies: one advocating [[dental floss|flossing]] and the other urging students to limit their [[alcohol]] intake.

They formed several conclusions about reactance. Firstly reactance is mostly [[Cognition|cognitive]]; this allows reactance to be measurable by [[Self-report inventory|self-report]] techniques. Also, in support of previous research, they conclude reactance is in part related to an [[anger]] response. This verifies Brehm's description that during the reactance experience one tends to have hostile or aggressive feelings, often aimed more at the source of a threatening message than at the message itself. Finally, within reactance, both [[cognition]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] are intertwined; Dillard and Shen suggest they are so intertwined that their effects on [[persuasion]] cannot be distinguished from each other.

Dillard and Shen's research indicates reactance can effectively be studied using established self-report methods. Furthermore, it provided a better understanding of reactance theory and its relationship to persuasive health communication.

Miller and colleagues conducted their 2007 study ''Psychological reactance and promotional health messages: the effects of controlling language, lexical concreteness, and the restoration of freedom'' at the [[University of Oklahoma]], with the primary goal being to measure the effects of controlling language in promotional [[health]] messages. Their research revisited the notion of restoring freedom by examining the use of a short [[postscript]]ed message tagged on the end of a promotional health appeal. Results of the study indicated that more [[Abstract object|concrete]] messages generate greater attention than less concrete (more [[Abstract object|abstract]]) messages. Also, the source of concrete messages can be seen as more credible than the source of abstract messages. They concluded that the use of more concrete, low-controlling language, and the restoration of freedom through inclusion of a choice-emphasizing postscript, may offer the best solution to reducing [[ambiguity]] and reactance created by overtly persuasive health appeals.&lt;ref name="Miller2007"&gt;Miller, C. H., Lane, L. T., Deatrick, L. M., Young, A. M., &amp; Potts, K. A. (2007). Psychological reactance and promotional health messages: The effects of controlling language, lexical concreteness, and the restoration of freedom. ''Human Communication Research,'' 33, 219–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Julius Herrnstein''' (May 20, 1930 – September 13, 1994) was an American psychologist and sociologist. He was an active researcher in animal learning in the [[BF Skinner|Skinnerian]] tradition. He was one of the founders of the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior]].

==Early life and education==
Richard Herrnstein was born on 20 May 1930, in New York City, to a family of Jewish Hungarian immigrants;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Ohles|editor-first1=Frederik |editor-last2=Ohles|editor-first2=Shirley M.  |editor-last3= Ramsay |editor-first3= John G. |title=Biographical Dictionary of Modern American Educators |place=Westport, CT |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1997 |pages=154–155 |chapter=Herrnstein, Richard Julius |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PBj5-zHEMvoC&amp;pg=PA154 |isbn=9780313291333}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Flora Irene (née Friedman) and Rezso Herrnstein, a housepainter.&lt;ref name="SEAL"/&gt; He was educated at the [[High School of Music &amp; Art]] and the [[City College of New York]], receiving a B.A. from the latter in 1952. In 1955, Herrnstein obtained his Ph.D. at [[Harvard University]], with a thesis titled ''Behavioral Consequences of the Removal of a Discriminative Stimulus Associated with Variable-Interval Reinforcement''.&lt;ref name="SEAL"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Nancy M. |editor-last=Jackson |editor-first=Kenneth T. |title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives |place=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=2001 |pages=240–241 |chapter=Herrnstein, Richard Julius |chapter-url= https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/herrnstein-richard-julius |volume=4|isbn=9780684806440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewprom.50webs.com/JewPromSite_files/sheet018.htm|title=Jewish Members of American Academy of Arts and Sciences|website=JewProm|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
His major research finding as an experimental psychologist is the [[matching law]], the tendency of animals to allocate their choices in direct proportion to the rewards they provide. To illustrate the phenomenon, if there are two sources of reward, one of which is twice as rich as the other, Herrnstein found that animals often chose at twice the frequency the alternative that was seemingly twice as valuable. That is known as  matching, both in quantitative analysis of behavior and [[mathematical psychology]]. He also developed [[melioration theory]] with William Vaughan, Jr.

He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of [[psychology]] at [[Harvard University]] and worked with Skinner in the Harvard pigeon lab, where he did research on choice behavior and [[behavioral economics]]. In 1965, and with [[Edwin Boring]], Herrnstein wrote ''A Source Book in the History of Psychology''.

===Intelligence===
Herrnstein's research focused first on natural concepts and [[human intelligence]] in the 1970s, and peaked in prolificacy with the publication of his and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray's]] controversial best-selling book, ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. Herrnstein died of cancer shortly before the book was released.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Five levels of classification capacities: discrimination, rote, open-ended categorization, concepts, and abstract relations (Herrnstein, 1990).

== Matching law ==
{{further|Matching law}}
Perhaps his most notable accomplishment was the formulation of the matching law: choices are distributed according to rates of reinforcement for making the choices. An instance for two choices can be stated mathematically as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_1 + r_2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are rates of response for two alternative responses, and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are rates of reinforcement for the same two responses. Behavior conforming to this law is matching, and explanations of matching and of departures from matching are a large and important part of the literature on behavioral choice.

==Personal life==
Herrnstein married his first wife, Barbara Brodo, on 28 May 1951. The couple had a daughter together, Julia, before their divorce in February 1961. Through his second marriage to Susan Chalk Gouinlock, on 11 November 1961, he fathered two sons named Max and James.&lt;ref name="SEAL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/16/obituaries/richard-herrnstein-64-dies-backed-nature-over-nurture.html|title=Richard Herrnstein, 64, Dies; Backed Nature Over Nurture|work=The New York Times|date=16 September 1994|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-criticism''' involves how an individual evaluates oneself. Self-criticism in [[psychology]] is typically studied and discussed as a negative [[personality trait]] in which a person has a disrupted [[self-identity]].&lt;ref name="Blatt"&gt;Blatt, S.J. (2008). Polarities of experience: Relatedness and self-definition in personality, development, psychopathology, and the therapeutic process. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of self-criticism would be someone who has a coherent, comprehensive, and generally positive self-identity. Self-criticism is often associated with [[major depressive disorder]]. Some theorists define self-criticism as a mark of a certain type of depression (introjective depression), and in general people with depression tend to be more self critical than those without depression.&lt;ref name="Blatt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;Beck, A.T. (1983). Cognitive therapy of depression: New perspectives. In P.J. Clayton &amp; J.E&gt; Barrett (Eds.), Treatment of Depression: Old Controversies and New Approaches (265-290). New York: Raven Press.&lt;/ref&gt; People with depression are typically higher on self-criticism than people without depression, and even after depressive episodes they will continue to display self-critical personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Enns, M.W. &amp; Cox, B.J. (1997). Personality dimensions and depression: Review and commentary. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 42(3), 274-284.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the scientific focus on self-criticism is because of its association with depression.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, L.A., Watson, D., &amp; Mineka, S. (1994). Temperament, personality, and the mood and anxiety disorders. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 103, 103-116. DOI: 10.1037//0021-843X.103.1.103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehret"&gt;Ehret, A.M., Joormann, J., &amp; Berking, M. (2015). Examining risk and resilience factors for depression: The role of self-criticism and self-compassion. Cognition and Emotion, 29(8), 1496-1504. DOI: 10.1080/02699931.2014.992394&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality theory==
[[Sidney Blatt]] has proposed a theory of personality which focuses on self-criticism and dependency.&lt;ref name="Blatt" /&gt; Blatt's theory is significant because he evaluates dimensions of personality as they relate to psychopathology and therapy. According to Blatt, personality characteristics affect our experience of depression, and are rooted in the development of our interpersonal interactions and self-identity. He theorizes that personality can be understood in terms of two distinct dimensions - interpersonal relatedness and self-definition. These two dimensions not only represent personality characteristics, but are products of a lifelong developmental process. Disruption in self-definition or identity leads to self-criticism, and disruption in relatedness leads to dependency. Zuroff (2016) found that self-criticism showed stability across time both as a personality trait and as an internal state.&lt;ref name="Zuroff"&gt;Zuroff, D.C., Sadikaj, G., Kelly, A.C., &amp; Leybman, M.J. (2016). Conceptualizing and measuring self-criticism as both a personality trait and a personality state. Journal of Personality Assessment, 98(1), 14-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a finding is important as it supports the fact that self-criticism can be measured in the same manner as other personality traits.

Similar to Blatt's two personality dimensions, [[Aaron Beck]] (1983) defines social dependency and autonomy as dimensions of personality that are relevant for depression.&lt;ref name="Beck" /&gt; Autonomy refers to how much the person relies on "preserving and increasing his independence, mobility, and personal rights". Furthermore, self-criticism involves holding oneself responsible for any past or present failures. Someone who is a self-critic will attribute negative events as a result of deficiencies in their own character or performance. The personality characteristics that Beck describes as self-critical are usually negative for the person experiencing them. His description of their experience with self-criticism as a personality characteristic is therefore important because it will be similar to their experience of depression.

Self-criticism as a personality trait has been linked to several negative effects. In a study examining behavior differences between personality types, Mongrain (1998) found that self-critics experienced greater negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], perceived support worse than others, and made fewer requests for support.&lt;ref name="Mongrain"&gt;Mongrain, M. (1998). Parental representations and support-seeking behaviors related to dependency and self-criticism. Journal of Personality, 66(2), 151-173. DOI: 10.1111/1467-6494.00007 Moroz, M. &amp; Dunkley, D.M. (2015). Self-critical perfectionism and depressive symptoms: Low self-esteem and experiential avoidance as mediators. Personality and Individual Differences, 87, 174-179. DOI: 10.1016/j.paid.2015.07.044&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were high in self-criticism did not differ in the amount of support they received, only in how they accepted or requested it. Participants categorized as being higher in self-criticism had fewer interpersonal goals as well as more self-presentation goals.&lt;ref name="MZ"&gt;Mongrain, M. &amp; Zuroff, D.C. (1995). Motivational and affective correlates of dependency and self-criticism. Personality and Individual Differences, 18(3), 347-354. DOI: 10.1016/0191-8869(94)00139-J&lt;/ref&gt; Among romantic partners, self-criticism predicts a decrease in agreeable comments and an increase in blaming.&lt;ref name="Santor"&gt;Santor, D.A., Pringle, J.D., &amp; Israeli, A.L. (2000). Enhancing and disrupting ooperative behavior in couples: Effects of dependency and self-criticism following favorable and unfavorable performance feedback. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 24(4), 379-397. DOI: 10.1023/A:1005523602102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Given that self-criticism is typically seen as a negative personality characteristic, it is important to note how some people develop such a trait. As described by the personality theories above, self-criticism often represents a disruption in some characteristic. This disruption could be rooted back in the person's childhood experience. Children of parents who use restrictive and rejecting practices have been shown to have higher levels of self-criticism at age 12.&lt;ref&gt;Koestner, R., Zuroff, D.C., &amp; Powers, T.A. (1991). Family origins of adolescent self-criticism and its continuity into adulthood. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 100(2), 191-197. DOI: 10.1037//0021-843X.100.2.191&lt;/ref&gt; In this same study, women displayed stable levels of self-criticism from age 12 into young adulthood, while men did not. These results show that [[parenting style]] can influence the development of self-critical personality, and these effects may potentially last into young adulthood. Another study found that women who were higher in self-criticism reported both that their father was more dominant and their parents maintained strict control and were inconsistent in their expressions of affection.&lt;ref&gt;McCranie, E.W. &amp; Bass, J.D. (1984). Childhood family antecedents of dependency and self-criticism: Implications for depression. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 93(1), 3-8. DOI: 10.1037/0021-843X.93.1.3&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, these women also reported that their parents tended to seek out achievement and success from their children, as opposed to remaining passive. These studies show that certain experiences in childhood are associated with self-criticism, and the self-critical personality type then extends into later phases of development.

[[Child maltreatment]], which is associated with the development of depression, may also be a risk factor for future self-criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Cicchetti, D. &amp; Toth, S.L. (2005). Child maltreatment. Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 1, 409-438. DOI: 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144029&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Widom, C.S., DuMont, K., &amp; Czaja, S.J. (2007). A prospective investigation of major depressive disorder and comorbidity in abused and neglected children grown up. Archives of General Psychiatry, 64(1), 49-56. DOI:10.1001/archpsyc.64.1.49&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers who reported having experience maltreatment as children also perceived themselves as less efficacious mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Michl, L.C., Handley, E.D., Rogosch, F., Cicchetti, D., &amp; Toth, S.L. (2015). Self-criticism as a mechanism linking childhood maltreatment and maternal efficacy beliefs in low-income mothers with and without depression. Child Maltreatment, 20(4), 291-300. DOI: 10.1023/A:1005566112869&lt;/ref&gt; A factor analysis showed that the perception of being less efficacious was mediated by self-criticism, over and above the effects of depressive status. This research shows that self-criticism in particular plays an important role in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and maternal efficacy. In a study assessing child maltreatment and self-injury Glassman and et al (2007) found that self-criticism specifically was a mediator for the relationship between maltreatment and self-injury.&lt;ref&gt;Glassman, L.H., Weierich, M.R., Hooley, J.M., Deliberto, T.L., &amp; Nock, M.N. (2007). Child maltreatment, non-suicidal self-injury, and the meditating role of self-criticism. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 45(10), 2483-2490. DOI: 10.1016/j.brat.2007.04.002&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly important because it shows that self-criticism may play a role in leading to [[self-injury]]. Understanding the origins of self-criticism in maltreatment could help prevent such behaviors. Given this research, it seems that self-criticism plays a role in the lasting effects of childhood maltreatment. Assessing self-criticism in preventing maltreatment as well as treating those who have been maltreated could therefore support further research in the area.

==Implications for psychopathology==
Self-criticism is an important aspect of personality and development, but is also significant in terms of what this trait means for [[psychopathology]]. Most theorists described above account for self-criticism as a maladaptive characteristic, so unsurprisingly many researchers have found self-criticism to be connected to depression.

===Risk factor for depression===
Self-criticism is associated with several other negative variables.&lt;ref name="Mongrain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MZ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Santor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powers, T.A. &amp; Zuroff, D.C. (1992). A measure of overt self-criticism – Validation and correlates. Psychological Reports, 70(2), 562-562.&lt;/ref&gt; In one sample, differences in self-criticism as a personality trait were associated with differences in perceived support, negative affect, self-image goals, and overt self-criticism.&lt;ref name="Zuroff" /&gt; These are all characteristics that pertain to the experience of depression, revealing that self-criticism affects depression.  The persistence of self-criticism as a personality trait can leave some people vulnerable to developing depression. As stated above, Blatt theorized that people who were more self-critical and focused on achievement concerns were more likely to develop a specific type of depression, which he called introjective depression.&lt;ref name="Blatt" /&gt; Both Blatt and Beck have developed measures to assess self-criticism and the experience of depression. 
In addition to the fact that many personality theorists classified self-criticism as marking a certain "type" of depression,&lt;ref name="Blatt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beck" /&gt; it has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of depression.

There has been a great deal of research assessing whether certain personality characteristics can lead to depression, among them self-criticism. In one study self-criticism was a significant predictor of depression in medical students, who go through extreme stress during and after medical school.&lt;ref&gt;Brewin, C.R., Firth-Cozens, J., Furnham, A., &amp; McManus, C. (1992). Self-criticism in adulthood and recalled childhood experience. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 101(3), 561-566.&lt;/ref&gt; Controlling for initial symptoms, self-criticism was a stronger predictor than even previous depression status both 2 years and 10 years after the initial assessment. In a sample with a history of depression, Mongrain and Leather (2006) found that measures of self-criticism were associated with the number of past episodes of depression.&lt;ref&gt;Mongrain, M. &amp; Leather, F. (2006). Immature dependence and self-criticism predict the recurrence of major depression. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 62(6), 705-713. DOI: 10.1002/jclp.20263&lt;/ref&gt; The personality was indicative of depression history, but self-criticism in an interaction with immature dependence was able to predict future episodes of depression as well.

In a sample of people who either currently have depression or are in remission from a depressive episode, individuals reported both higher levels of self-criticism and lower levels of self-compassion.&lt;ref name="Ehret" /&gt; This same study found that self-critical individuals were also at an increased risk of experiencing depression chronically over the course of their lives. Self-criticism was also able to explain the variance in depression status for currently depressed, remitted depressed, and never depressed patients, over and above other variables. Carver and Ganellen (1983) assessed self-criticism by breaking it down into three distinct categories: Over-generalization of negative events, high standards, and self-criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C.S. &amp; Ganellen, R.J. (1983). Depression and components of self-punitiveness: High standards, self-criticism, and overgeneralization. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 92(3), 330-337. DOI: 10.1037/0021-843X.92.3.330&lt;/ref&gt; These three categories all deal with self-critical cognitions, and are measured by the Attitude Toward Self Scale, which Carver and Ganellen created.

===Treatment outcome===
In addition to acting as a risk factor for depression, self-criticism also affects the efficacy of [[depression treatment]]. Self-criticism as a trait characteristic therefore persists throughout a person's entire life. This means a person can display persistent, long term levels of self-criticism as a personality trait, but levels of self-criticism can vary from moment to moment depending on the person's current mental state.&lt;ref name="Zuroff" /&gt; Therefore, in terms of treatment for depression, it could be difficult for clinicians to accurately assess decreases in self-criticism. In a particular session, state levels of self-criticism may increase or decrease, but in the long term it is not as easy to see if trait levels of self-criticism have been reduced, and a reduction in trait self-criticism is more important in terms of effectively treating depression. In other words, it is likely easier to reduce state levels of self-criticism, so researchers who develop treatments for depression should have the goal of treating long-term, trait self-criticism.

It is possible that change in depression symptoms may not necessarily co-occur with change in personality factors, and given that self-criticism as a personality factor has been shown to lead to depression, this could be problematic. One study found that positive change in depression occurred before any change in self-critical perfectionism.&lt;ref&gt;Hawley, L.L., Ho, M.R., Zuroff, D.C., &amp; Blatt, S.J. (2006). The relationship of perfectionism, depression, and therapeutic alliance during treatment for depression: Latent difference score analysis. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 74(5), 930-942. DOI: 10.1037/0022-006X.74.5.930&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this study suggested that this has implications for deciding how long to provide treatment. If treatment ends as depression fades away, the underlying personality characteristics that affect depression may not have changed. In such a case extending treatment beyond the point when positive change is seen in depression symptoms may give the best results. This same study also found that levels of perfectionism (which is related to self-critical personality) predicted the rate of change in depression status.

Self-criticism is known as autonomy in Beck's personality model, and there has been research looking at his conception of [[sociotropy]] and autonomy. Sociotropy characterizes people who are socially dependent, and their main source of distress is interpersonal relationships. Autonomy, however refers to self-critical individuals who are more concerned with independence and achievement. In a study examining treatment differences between these groups, Zettle, Haflich &amp; Reynolds (1992) found that autonomous, self-critical individuals had better results in individual therapy than in group therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Zettle, R.D., Haflich, J.L., &amp; Reynolds, R.A. (1992). Responsivity to cognitive therapy as a function of treatment format and client personality dimensions. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 48(6), 787-797. DOI: 10.1002/1097-4679(199211)48:6&lt;787::AID-JCLP2270480613&gt;3.0.CO;2-D&lt;/ref&gt; This research shows that personality characteristics can influence what kind of treatment is best for an individual, and that clinicians should be aware of these differences. Therefore self-criticism is both a warning sign for the development of depression and affects how it is treated. It is an important facet of depression research, as it is important for how we might prevent and treat this debilitating disorder.

==Neuroscience==
[[fMRI]] finds that engaging in self-criticism activates areas in the [[lateral prefrontal cortex]] and dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]] which are brain areas responsible for processing [[error detection and correction]]. In contrast, engaging in self-reassurance activates the left [[temporal pole]] and [[Insular cortex|insula]] areas previously found to be activated in [[compassion]] and [[empathy]]. Those that as a psychological [[trait theory|trait]] engage in self-criticism tend to show an activated dorsolateral prefrontal activity, while ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity was found in those with the trait of self-reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;Longe O, Maratos FA, Gilbert P, Evans G, Volker F, Rockliff H, Rippon G. (2010). Having a word with yourself: Neural correlates of self-criticism and self-reassurance. Neuroimage. 49: 1849–1856 {{Doi|10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.09.019}} {{PMID|19770047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Some [[Religion]] cultures consider self-criticism to be a positive and indispensable practice for lifetime satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} See [[Confession (Judaism)]], [[Confession (Lutheran Church)]], and [[Sacrament of Penance]].

==Communist states== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Maoism sidebar |expanded=Basic}}
In some  [[communist states]], party members who had fallen out of favor with the [[nomenklatura]] were sometimes forced to undergo "self-criticism" sessions, producing either written or verbal statements detailing their ideological errors and affirming their renewed belief in the [[Party line (politics)|Party line]]. Self-criticism, however, did not guarantee [[political rehabilitation]], and often offenders were still expelled from the Party, or in some cases even executed.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006041 028 Wandzeitung der Wertpapierdruckerei Leipzig.jpg|thumb|left|305x305px|East German factory [[wall newspaper]] "Criticism and Self-Criticism in [[Five-year plan (disambiguation)|Five-Year Plans]]".]]

In the [[Soviet Union]], "criticism and self-criticism" were known as ''kritika i samokritika'' ({{lang-ru | критика и самокритика}}).

In the [[People's Republic of China]], self-criticism—called ''ziwo pipan'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|自我|批判}}}}) or ''jiǎntǎo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|检讨}}}})—is an important part of [[Maoist]] practice. Mandatory self-criticism as a part of [[political rehabilitation]] or prior to [[Execution in China|execution]]—common under [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], ended by [[Deng Xiaoping]], and partially revived by [[Xi Jinping]]—is known as a [[struggle session]], in reference to [[class struggle]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Under the [[Khmer Rouge]], self-criticism sessions were known as ''rien sot'', meaning "religious education". In his memoir ''The Gate'', [[François Bizot]] recalls observing the Khmer Rouge engaging in frequent self-criticism to reinforce [[group cohesion]] during his imprisonment in rural [[Cambodia]] in 1971:&lt;ref&gt;Bizot, Francois (Vintage,2004). ''The Gate'', pp. 52-54.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|
"Several evenings a week—every evening it didn't rain—the guards gathered for a collective confession.  Douch ([[Kang Kek Iew]]) did not take part.  I was a privileged witness to these circles, where they would sit on the ground under the direction of an elder.  Military homilies alternated with simple, repetitive songs.  "Comrades," began the eldest, "let us appraise the day that has passed, in order to correct our faults.  We must cleanse ourselves of the repeated sins that accumulate and slow down our beloved revolution.  Do not be surprised at this!"&lt;br&gt;
"I," said the first one, "should have replaced the rattan rod today, the one north of the first shelter, which we use to dry clothes.  I have done nothing about it... on account of my laziness."  The man presiding over the session nodded with a frown, though not severely, only meaning to show that he knew how hard it was to combat inertia, so natural in man when he is not sustained by revolutionary convictions.  He passed wordlessly onto the next man, indicating who this should be by pursing his lips in his direction.
}}
French Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] wrote "Essays in Self-Criticism" focused on the issue of ideologically correcting ideas expressed in his prior works, most prominently [[For Marx]] and [[Reading Capitol]].

A '''self-tiling tile set''', or ''setiset'', of order ''n'' is a set of ''n'' shapes or pieces, usually planar, each of which can be tiled with smaller replicas of the complete set of ''n'' shapes. That is, the ''n'' shapes can be assembled in ''n'' different ways so as to create larger copies of themselves, where the increase in scale is the same in each case. Figure 1 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 using distinctly shaped [[decominoes]]. The concept can be extended to include pieces of higher dimension. The name setisets was coined by [[Lee Sallows]] in 2012,&lt;ref name=mathmag&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallows |first1=Lee |title=On Self-Tiling Tile Sets |journal=[[Mathematics Magazine]] |date=December 2012 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=323–333 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.85.5.323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erickson&gt;[http://alejandroerickson.com/home/blog/blog.php?entry=15 Alejandro Erickson on Self-tiling tile sets]&lt;/ref&gt; but the problem of finding such sets for ''n'' = 4 was asked decades previously by C. Dudley Langford, and examples for [[polyabolo]]es (discovered by [[Martin Gardner]], Wade E. Philpott and others) and [[polyomino]]es (discovered by Maurice J. Povah) were previously published by Gardner.&lt;ref name=gardner&gt;''Polyhexes and Polyaboloes'' in ''Mathematical Magic Show'', by Martin Gardner, Knopf, 1977, pp 146-159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and definitions==
[[File:A setiset with duplicated piece.png|thumb|300px|Figure 2:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset with duplicated piece.]]
From the above definition it follows that a setiset composed of ''n'' identical pieces is the same thing as a 'self-replicating tile' or [[rep-tile]], of which setisets are therefore a generalization.&lt;ref name=mathmag2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallows |first1=Lee |title=More On Self-Tiling Tile Sets |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=April 2014 |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=100–112 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.87.2.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setisets using ''n'' distinct shapes, such as Figure 1, are called ''perfect''. Figure 2 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 which is ''imperfect'' because two of the component shapes are the same.
{{clear}}

The shapes employed in a setiset need not be ''connected'' regions. Disjoint pieces composed of two or more separated islands are also permitted. Such pieces are described as ''disconnected'', or ''weakly-connected'' (when islands join only at a point), as seen in the setiset shown in Figure 3.

The fewest number of pieces in a setiset is two. Figure 4 encapsulates an infinite family of order 2 setisets each composed of two triangles, ''P'' and ''Q''. As shown, the latter can be hinged together to produce a compound triangle that has the same shape as ''P'' or ''Q'', depending upon whether the hinge is fully open or fully closed. This unusual specimen thus provides an example of a [[hinged dissection]].

==Inflation and Deflation==
[[File:A setiset of order 4 showing two stages of inflation.png|thumb|left|300px|Figure 5:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset of order 4 using octominoes. Two stages of inflation are shown.]]

The properties of setisets mean that their pieces form [[substitution tiling]]s, or [[tessellations]] in which the [[prototile]]s can be dissected or combined so as to yield smaller or larger duplicates of themselves. Clearly, the twin actions of forming still larger and larger copies (known as inflation), or still smaller and smaller dissections (deflation), can be repeated indefinitely. In this way, setisets can produce non-periodic tilings. However, none of the non-periodic tilings thus far discovered qualify as [[Aperiodic tiling|aperiodic]], because the prototiles can always be rearranged so as to yield a periodic tiling. Figure 5 shows the first two stages of inflation of an order 4 set leading to a non-periodic tiling.

==Loops==
[[File:A loop of length 2 using decominoes.png|thumb|300px|Figure 6:  {{pad|.2em}}  A loop of length 2 using decominoes.]]
Besides self-tiling tile sets, which can be interpreted as loops of length 1, there exist longer loops, or closed chains of sets, in which every set tiles its successor.&lt;ref name=delahaye&gt;[http://www.scilogs.fr/complexites/pepites-geometriques-cachees/ ''Geometric Hidden Gems'' by Jean-Paul Delahaye in Scilogs], April 07, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 6 shows a pair of mutually tiling sets of [[decominoes]], in other words, a loop of length 2. Sallows and Schotel did an exhaustive search of order 4 sets that are composed of [[octominoes]]. In addition to seven ordinary setisets (i.e., loops of length 1) they found a bewildering variety of loops of every length up to a maximum of 14. The total number of loops identified was nearly one and a half million. More research in this area remains to be done, but it seems safe to suppose that other shapes may also entail loops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leesallows.com/index.php?page_menu=Self-Tiling%20Tile%20Sets Self-Tiling Tile Sets website]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Methods of construction==
To date, two methods have been used for producing setisets. In the case of sets composed of shapes such as [[polyomino]]es, which entail integral piece sizes, a brute force search by computer is possible, so long as ''n'', the number of pieces involved, is not prohibitive. It is easily shown that ''n'' must then be a [[Square number|perfect square]].&lt;ref name=mathmag2/&gt; Figures 1,2,3,5 and 6 are all examples found by this method.

Alternatively, there exists a method whereby multiple copies of a rep-tile can be dissected in certain ways so as to yield shapes that create setisets. Figures 7 and 8 show setisets produced by this means, in which each piece is the union of 2 and 3 rep-tiles, respectively. In Figure 8 can be seen how the 9 pieces above together tile the 3 rep-tile shapes below, while each of the 9 pieces is itself formed by the union of 3 such rep-tile shapes. Hence each shape can be tiled with smaller duplicates of the entire set of 9.&lt;ref name=mathmag2/&gt;

'''Social tuning''', the process whereby people adopt other people's attitudes, is cited by social psychologists to demonstrate an important lack of people's conscious control over their actions.

The process of social tuning is particularly powerful in situations where one person wants to be liked or accepted by another person or group. However, social tuning occurs both when people meet for the first time, as well as among people who know each other well.  Social tuning occurs both consciously and subconsciously. As research continues, the application of the theory of social tuning broadens.

[[Social psychology]] bases many of its concepts on the belief that a person's [[self concept]] is shaped by the people with whom he or she interacts. Social tuning allows people to learn about themselves and the social world through their interactions with others. People mold their own views to match those of the people surrounding them through social tuning in order to develop meaningful relationships. These relationships then play an integral role in developing one's self-esteem and self-concept.

==Theoretical approaches==

Social tuning theory describes the process whereby people adopt another person's attitudes or opinions regarding a particular subject. This phenomenon is also termed  "shared reality theory." The study of this occurrence began in 1902 when [[Charles Cooley]] coined the term "[[looking glass self]]", stating that people see themselves and their own social world through the eyes of others. Research further discovered that people create their self-images through their beliefs of how others perceive them. Many people adopt the views of those surrounding them in an effort to feel like they belong and feel liked. In 1934, Mead determined that not only do individuals shape their self-concepts according to the perspectives of others, but also that people's views of themselves are continually maintained according to these adopted ideas.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laar|first=edited by Shana Levin, Colette van|title=Stigma and group inequality : social psychological perspectives|year=2006|publisher=L. Erlbaum|location=Mahwah (NJ)|isbn=978-0-8058-4416-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later research showed that social tuning tends to be a particularly strong phenomenon when two people want to get along with each other. This is shown through social bonds which can be strengthened and reinforced through a perceived sense of shared beliefs.&lt;ref name="Hardin &amp; Conley, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardin|first=C. D.|author2=Conley, T.D. |title=A relational approach to cognition: Shared experience and relationship affirmation in social cognition.|journal=Cognitive social psychology: The Princeton Symposium on the Legacy and Future of Social Cognition.|year=2001|pages=3–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sinclair hardin lowery 2005 the role of affiliative motivation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Stacey|author2=Lowery, B.S. |author3=Hardin, C.D. |author4=Colangelo, A. |title=Social Tuning of Automatic Racial Attitudes: The Role of Affiliative Motivation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2005|volume=89|issue=4|pages=583–592|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.89.4.583 |pmid=16287420}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, these shared ideas create a person's comprehension of their environment and world as a whole.  Individuals believe that they have the same attitudes regarding certain ideas and experiences as the other.

One particular aspect of  social tuning, [[stereotyping]], has been a popular theme in this field's research over time. One specific method explores the idea that individuals of a certain group are influenced by the ideas of others from the out-group (Crocker, Major &amp; Steele, 1998).  These interactions yield the particular stereotyped group to internalize and believe the way others view them.  Therefore, self-stereotyping manifests in certain individuals.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;  However, in this case, the presence of self-stereotyping is immensely determined by the relationship with whom the stereotyped individual interacts with.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hardin &amp; Conley, 2001" /&gt;

In 2006, Sinclair and Huntsinger explored the idea of why other people will change their beliefs and attitudes in order to get along with others and feel accepted. Their research focuses on why individuals from targeted groups will act and behave according to "cultural stereotypes". They used two [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] originally coined  by Hardin &amp; Conley in 2001,  "Affiliative Social-Tuning" and "Domain Relevance Hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Hardin &amp; Conley, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006" /&gt; The first of these, "Affiliative Social-Tuning Hypothesis", pertains to the idea that certain concepts will be shared between individuals especially when affiliative [[motivation]] is high. For example, in a situation with a member from a targeted group and a member from a neutral group, the former will act accordingly to how the latter stereotypes his group. However, this is contingent on the fact that affiliative motivation is high, in other words, if there is a desire for the former to create a bond with the latter.&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=S.|author2=Huntsinger J |title=The Interpersonal Basis of Self Stereotyping|journal=Stigma and Group Inequality: Social Psychological Perspectives|year=2006|pages=Chapter 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second, "Domain Relevance Hypothesis", explains that "when confronted with multiple applicable views on which to construct a shared understanding with another person, an individual will choose to social tune toward only those views that will lead to the development of the most precise shared understanding with the person".&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006" /&gt; In other words, when many views are available to be socially tuned between individuals, only certain concepts will be shared. The concepts chosen are the ideas that yield the best common understanding between the two individuals.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;

==Empirical approaches==

One of the most famous experiments demonstrating the social tuning phenomenon was done by Stacy Sinclair.&lt;ref name="sinclair hardin lowery 2005 the role of affiliative motivation" /&gt;  Her research reveals the effect of likability on people's drive to social tune. Participants engaged with researchers who were either likable or non-likable and who were either wearing a shirt stating anti-racist thoughts, specifically a shirt with the word "Eracism", or a blank shirt. The participants were then asked to complete a subconscious [[prejudice]] test, and when the researcher was likable, participants demonstrated significantly less racist attitudes on the test, than if that researcher was unlikable. Since the participants seemed to shape their views to that of the experimenter only when he or she was "likable", this study can be shown to reveal that people are more prone to adopt the views of others through social tuning when they like that person. This aspect of social tuning could be explained by the psychological assumption that people want to be liked by those that they themselves like, and therefore people will shape their views to match those of a person from whom they seek social acceptance.&lt;ref name="sinclair hardin lowery 2005 the role of affiliative motivation" /&gt;

A similar study by Janetta Lun demonstrates another aspect of social tuning with respect to [[racism]], and suggests that people who do not already hold strong beliefs about social prejudice are more likely to socially tune their beliefs with others around them than those who do already hold strong opinions.&lt;ref name="Lun janetta 2007 why do I think what you think"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lun|first=Janetta|title=(Why) do I think what you think ? Epistemic Social Tuning and Implicit Prejudice|journal=Journal of Psychology and Social Psychology|year=2007|volume=93|pages=957–972|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.93.6.957}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, participants were given an [[implicit attitude]] test to determine their existing levels of implicit prejudice. Next they were taken into another room with either an experimenter who had the word "ERACISM"  on their shirt, or with an experimenter in a plain T-shirt for the control condition. In the first condition, participants were asked to read the word "ERACISM" off the experimenter's T-shirt, and then in the control they were asked to read a series of nonsense letters. They were then given another implicit attitudes test to determine their implicit prejudice.

Lun found that people who had less accessible attitudes (determined by the first implicit attitudes test) had lower implicit prejudice after interacting with the experimenter who held clear [[egalitarian]] views. Alternatively, those who already held strong beliefs about prejudice did not change their implicit prejudice after interacting with the egalitarian experimenter. 
This study demonstrates that when individuals do not hold already strong beliefs, they are more likely to seek knowledge from those around them, and therefore more likely to engage in social tuning.&lt;ref name="Lun janetta 2007 why do I think what you think" /&gt; Lun's experiment suggests the likelihood of social tuning when people seek knowledge on a particular subject. In this case, the participants who did not hold strong opinions on the subject of prejudice, and thus presumably had less knowledge on the subject, molded their opinions to match the information they were given by the experimenter in the form of the word "ERACISM" on her shirt, and therefore they demonstrated stronger egalitarian views than they had when initially arriving at the experiment. People who are uncomfortable in situations where they feel they do not have enough information will attempt to get information through their interactions with others. Lun's experiment reveals how social tuning is a part of such a process, in which people with less knowledge are more likely to mold their beliefs to that of others.

Further research by Aaron Root has been completed, examining opinions on homosexuality. During this experiment, the researcher, who always wore a pro-homosexuality shirt, followed a script that was designed to control the participant's desire to get along with the researcher. In the high-level condition, the experimenter was friendly and amiable; he offered candy at the beginning of the study and spoke enthusiastically about the experiment. In the low-level condition, the experimenter's dialogue was concise (to the point of rudeness) and he even made a point of putting away the candy basket without offering any. To emphasize this action, the experimenter made a comment about not knowing why the other experimenters insisted on giving candy out. In the trials with an amicable experimenter, the participants were more gay-friendly on the implicit attitudes tests. The opposite resulted from the interaction with a less-likable experimenter. The subject would adopt the views of the message printed on the experimenter's shirt if he was nicer.&lt;ref name="root aaron effects of affiliative motivation and perspective"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Root|first=Aaron|title=The Effects of Affiliative Motivation and Perspective Taking on Social Tuning|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis Hardin, co-author of "Shared Reality, System Justification, and the Relational Basis of Ideological Beliefs", has performed numerous experiments in social tuning across a wide variety of ideals.&lt;ref name="Hardin &amp; Conley, 2001" /&gt; His experiments explore how individual experience reflects a kind of tension among relationships. In one experiment, automatic homophobic attitudes manifest in the participant after an interaction with an evidently gay experimenter, but only for subjects who do not have gay friends. In another study by Hardin, unconscious threats to religious experience reduce commitment for participants who do not share the experience with their father or minister. For those who do perceive the religious experience to be shared, the unconscious threat causes increased religious commitment. In a third study, people become more anti-black when they are included (as opposed to excluded) in a game played with ostensible racists. The effect is reversed when the participants have are{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} extra motivated to engage with the racists. Similar studies have been performed with gender.&lt;ref name="Social Tuning and Ideology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sahlstrom|first=Al|title=Social Tuning and Ideology|url=http://thesituationist.wordpress.com/2009/01/25/social-tuning-and-ideology-part-i/|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experiment by Hardin and Higgins (1996), participants were given information about a "target" which they would inform a perceived audience about.&lt;ref name="Hardins &amp; higgins 1996 shared reality"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardins|first=C.D.|author2=Higgins, E.T. |title=Shared reality: How social verification makes the subjective objective|journal=Handbook of motivation and cognition: The interpersonal context|year=1996|volume=3|pages=28–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "communicators" changed the different summaries of information (sometimes to incorrect information) to best correspond with the attitudes of the audience which they were informed of by the researchers. The motivation of the communicator determined the extent to which they would alter their message to suit the audience. However, the communicator soon began believing their edited information about the target as a direct source of information. The memory and beliefs towards the target were then influenced. As time passed, communicators' belief that their message as a source of information about the target increased and their memory was altered. Thus the communicator adopted the believed beliefs of the audience which he was trying to inform.&lt;ref name="Hardins &amp; higgins 1996 shared reality" /&gt;

==Applications==

Social tuning has resounding influences on both the memory and cognition of those affected by this process. Though social tuning could potentially aid memory and cognition should the views of the other person be correct, this phenomenon could also impede memory and cause incorrect cognition. For example, if an individual seeks a relationship with another individual who holds negative opinions about homosexuality, the first individual could be at risk for mirroring those negative opinions in order to be liked by the second individual. Such phenomenon can be harmful, in that they can cause people to hold opinions on subjects that are not based on concrete information, but on the opinions of others.

==Controversies==

Social tuning can be particularly strong when in relation to controversial topics. Judgments based on sexual orientation, race, religion and even a politics can be substantially altered based on the opinions of those around a subject. The result being that it is not only highly unlikely that a subject would openly disagree with these feelings, but actually adopt them and proclaim them as genuinely their own.  In addition, social tuning is a large contributor to prejudice and racism. For example, many individuals adopt their views about race or about their out-groups according to the ideas of those surrounding them. Social tuning with respect to race often occurs through parental influence. A child without sufficient information about race, and who seeks the approval of his or her parent will likely shape their own beliefs about race based on the beliefs of their parents.

As noted earlier (see "Major Theoretical Approaches"), self tuning has been linked to many issues regarding [[stereotyping]].  For example,  individuals of commonly stereotyped groups are at risk of social tuning in certain situations. For example, [[Michael Inzlicht]] coined the term "threatening environments", which pertain to occasions when individuals perceive that they are being "devalued, stigmatized, or discriminated against" by a non-stereotyped group.&lt;ref name="Inzlicht Good"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inzlicht|first=Michael|author2=Aronson, J. |author3=Good, C. |author4=McKay, L. |title=A particular resiliency to threatening environments|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|pages=323–336|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt; In this environment, it is common that the individuals of a perceived "lower-status" will social tune to the ideas of the "higher-status".  This results in internalized racism of the former group.&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006" /&gt; However, it has been noted that under certain conditions interactions between heterogeneous groups can result more in a more positive manner.  For example, situations that are perceived as "safe and nonthreatening", by both the stigmatized and non-stigmatized group "are likely to lead to positive self-expansion and social tuning, reduced prejudice and discrimination, and positive group attitudes".&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;

On the other hand, research has showed that self tuning to ideas of one's ingroup, and not one's outgroup can often lead to more damaging results (7).&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;  Due to the fact that members of the same group are closer and trust one another, they are more likely to tune to the ideas of each other.  Therefore, a member that holds a negative self-stereotype of himself and his own group is more dangerous to his comrades than an individual on the outside who shares the same views.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt; Research has been conducted on how an individual from a stereotyped group can best avoid the dangers of self-tuning from an out-group. As Sinclair suggests, "members of stigmatized groups need to be careful with whom they develop relationships", and thus they "can reduce the likelihood of negative social tuning by remaining interpersonally distant from those with stereotypical views".&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006" /&gt;

==Conclusion==

Social tuning is an intriguing social phenomenon that affects our personal beliefs and views both on a long-term and short-term basis. It impacts many important aspects of an individual's life, and can even play a role in determining a person's beliefs on a variety of important subjects.  For example, it plays a large role in our self-concept and our views of others. There are certain situations which heighten the likelihood that a person will engage in social tuning, for example when an individual wants to be liked by another or when an individual does not already hold strong opinions on a subject.  Overall, social tuning is an important social psychological theory as it explains the many beliefs we hold about ourselves, others, and the world around us.

'''Sophic''' is a term used by Mormon apologist, scholar, and author [[Hugh Nibley]] to explain the shift from the tradition of [[oral-formulaic composition]] to that of the written word—sophic corresponding to the written word, the word "mantic" corresponding to the oral formulaic tradition. According to his theory, the mantic was a tradition relying entirely on God and prophets for knowledge. A person in that time period could go directly to the wise man, who simply asked God, the great spirit, or the universe and shared his directive. The mantic experience was a communal one—information was oral in mantic societies because everybody needed to be able to repeat and remember knowledge together. Sacred memories and information were encoded in a way that the community could take part in them together. 
The shift to the sophic tradition meant a more individually centered society, gleaning knowledge from more of the [[scientific method]]-type mindset. This individual crusade for knowledge necessitated a way to transmit knowledge to others who may have the same question, leading to a written tradition. This also led to more standardized and replicable acquisition of knowledge. For example, an experiment in a laboratory ideally must be replicated several times in different laboratories to be considered valid.

Nibley explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The Sophic, on the other hand, is the tradition which boasted its cool, critical, objective, naturalistic, and scientific attitude; its Jewish equivalent is what Goodenough calls the "horizontal" Judaism - scholarly, bookish, halachic, intellectual, rabbinical. All religions, as Goodenough observes, seem to make some such distinction. It is when one seeks to combine or reconcile the Sophic and the Mantic that trouble begins.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . Whoever accepts the Sophic attitude must abandon the Mantic, and vice versa. It is the famous doctrine of Two Ways found among the Orientals, Greeks and early Christians . . . On the other hand, the Sophic society unitedly rejects the Mantic proposition, and it too forms a single community . . . here was "a man who prized brain and insight, who preferred the voice of reasoned conviction to the braying of Balaam's ass." Better false teaching from a true intellectual than the truth from a prophet. So fiercely loyal and uncompromising are the Sophic and Mantic to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Nibley, Hugh. "The Ancient State". Deseret Book Company, 1993, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Sustainable engineering''' is the process of designing or operating systems such that they use energy and resources [[sustainability|sustainably]], in other words, at a rate that does not compromise the natural environment, or the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

==As an aspect of engineering disciplines==

Every engineering discipline is engaged in sustainable design, employing numerous initiatives, especially [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA), [[pollution prevention]], design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD), and  design for recycling (DfR).  These are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms. For example, concept of a "cap and trade" has been tested and works well for some pollutants. This is a system where companies are allowed to place a "bubble" over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a "stack-by-stack" and "pipe-by-pipe" approach, i.e. the so-called "command and control" approach. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) technologies for the more difficult to treat stacks and pipes. But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a life-cycle analysis, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), difficulty in treating, and feasibility. The most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat, i.e. less feasible. Of course, as with all paradigm shifts, expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sustainable_Design.html?id=vrj5DIQ-7m8C|&lt;/ref&gt;  
Historically, sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated. The hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these did not entirely do the job, limiting rates of production. [[Green engineering]] recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach.  Green engineering attempts to achieve four goals:&lt;ref name="C. Brasier 2008"&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Waste reduction;
# Materials management;
# Pollution prevention; and,
# Product enhancement.

Green engineering encompasses numerous ways to improve processes and products to make them more efficient from an environmental and sustainable standpoint. Every one of these approaches depends on viewing possible impacts in space and time. Architects consider the sense of place. Engineers view the site map as a set of fluxes across the boundary. The design must consider short and long-term impacts. Those impacts beyond the near-term are the province of sustainable design. 
The effects may not manifest themselves for decades. In the mid-twentieth century, designers specified the use of what are now known to be hazardous building materials, such as asbestos flooring, pipe wrap and shingles, lead paint and pipes, and even structural and mechanical systems that may have increased the exposure to molds and radon. Those decisions have led to risks to people inhabiting these buildings.  It is easy in retrospect to criticize these decisions, but many were made for noble reasons, such as fire prevention and durability of materials. However, it does illustrate that seemingly small impacts when viewed through the prism of time can be amplified exponentially in their effects.
Sustainable design requires a complete assessment of a design in place and time. Some impacts may not occur until centuries in the future. For example, the extent to which we decide to use nuclear power to generate electricity is a sustainable design decision. The radioactive wastes may have half-lives of hundreds of thousands of years. That is, it will take all these years for half of the radioactive isotopes to decay. Radioactive decay is the spontaneous transformation of one element into another. This occurs by irreversibly changing the number of protons in the nucleus. Thus, sustainable designs of such enterprises must consider highly uncertain futures. For example, even if we properly place warning signs about these hazardous wastes, we do not know if the English language will be understood.
All four goals of green engineering mentioned above are supported by a long-term, life cycle point of view. A life cycle analysis is a holistic approach to consider the entirety of a product, process or activity, encompassing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use, maintenance, recycling, and final disposal. In other words, assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the product.
The first step in a life cycle assessment is to gather data on the flow of a material through an identifiable society. Once the quantities of various components of such a flow are known, the important functions and impacts of each step in the production, manufacture, use, and recovery/disposal are estimated. Thus, in sustainable design, engineers must optimize for variables that give the best performance in temporal frames.&lt;ref name="C. Brasier 2008"/&gt;

==Accomplishments from 1992 to 2002==
*The World Engineering Partnership for [[Sustainable development|Sustainable Development]] (WEPSD) was formed and they are responsible for the following areas: redesign engineering responsibilities and ethic to sustainable development, analyze and develop a long term plan, find solution by exchanging information with partners and using new technologies, and solve the critical global environment problems, such as [[fresh water]] and climate change
*CASI Global was formed mainly as a platform for corporates and governments to share best practices; with a mission to promote the cause and knowledge of csr &amp; sustainability. Thousands of corporates and colleges across the world are now a part of CASI Global with a view to support this mission. CASI also offers Global Fellow programs on finance / operations / manufacturing / supply chain / etc. with a dual specialization in Sustainability. The idea is every professional has inculcate sustainability within their core function &amp; industry. http://www.casiglobal.us/

== Sustainable housing ==
In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatt hours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How much electricity does an American home use? - FAQ - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url = http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&amp;t=3|website = www.eia.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential sector itself uses 18%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How much energy is consumed in the world by each sector? - FAQ - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url = http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=447&amp;t=1|website = www.eia.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the total energy generated and therefore, incorporating sustainable construction practices there can be significant reduction in this number. Basic Sustainable construction practices include : 
# '''Sustainable Site and Location:''' One important element of green that is often overlooked happens to simply be where we choose to build. Avoiding inappropriate sites such as farmland and locating the site near existing infrastructure, like roads, sewers, stormwater systems and transit, allows builders to lessen negative impact on a home's surroundings.
# '''Water Conservation:''' Conserving water can be economically done by installing low-flow fixtures that often cost the same as less efficient models. Water can be saved in landscaping applications by simply choosing the proper plants.
# '''Materials:''' Green materials include many different options. Most often, people assume that "green" means recycled materials. Although that recycled materials represent one option, green materials also include reused materials, renewable materials like bamboo and cork, or materials local to your region. Remember, a green material does not have to cost more or be of lesser or higher quality. Most green products are comparable to their non-green counterparts.
# '''Energy Conservation:''' Probably the most important part of building green is energy conservation. By implementing passive design, structural insulated panels (SIPs), efficient lighting, and renewable energy like [[solar energy]] and [[geothermal energy]], a home can benefit from reduced energy consumption or qualify as a net-zero energy home.
# '''Indoor Environmental Quality:''' The quality of the indoor environment plays a pivotal role in a person's health. In many cases, a much healthier environment can be created through avoiding hazardous materials found in paint, carpet, and other finishes. It is also important to have proper ventilation and ample day lighting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Green Homes vs Traditional Homes - Buildipedia|url = http://buildipedia.com/at-home/design-remodeling/green-homes-vs-traditional-homes|website = buildipedia.com|accessdate = 2015-09-02|first = Michael Tolson MBA, LEED|last = AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Savings===
# '''Water Conservation:''' A newly constructed home can implement products with the WaterSense label at no additional costs and achieve a water savings of 20% when including the water heater savings and the water itself.
# '''Energy Conservation:''' Energy conservation is definitely the most intensive when it comes to cost premiums for implementation. However, it also has the largest potential for savings. Minimum savings can be achieved at no additional cost by pursuing passive design strategies. The next step up from passive design in the level of green (and ultimately the level of savings) would be implementing advanced building envelopematerials, like structural insulated panels (SIPs). SIPs can be installed for approximately $2 per linear foot of exterior wall. That equals a total premium of less than $500 for a typical one-story home, which will bring an energy savings of 50%. According to the DOE, the average annual energy expense for a single family home is $2,200. So SIPs can save up to $1,100 per year. To reach the savings associated with a net-zero energy home, renewable energy would have to be implemented on top of the other features. A geothermal energy system could achieve this goal with a cost premium of approximately $7 per square foot, while a photovoltaic system (solar) would require up to a $25,000 total premium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5572">Among the [[Anishinaabe]] people, the '''Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers''', also known simply as either the '''Seven Teachings''' or '''Seven Grandfathers''', is a set of teachings on human conduct towards others.  Originating from traditional Anishinaabe teachings from elders, Edward Benton-Banai describes an in-depth understanding of what each means, in his novel "The Mishomis Book".  Benton-Banai's book is an example of contemporary Anishinaabe teachings to be used in contemporary situations.

== Background ==

In Edward Benton-Banai's story "The Mishomis Book" it is stated that the ''[[aadizookaan]]'' (traditional story) or the teachings of the seven grandfathers were given to the Anishinaabeg early in their history.  Seven Grandfathers asked their messenger to take a survey of the human condition.  At that time the human condition was not very good.  Eventually in his quest, the messenger came across a child.  After receiving approval from the Seven Grandfathers, tutored the child in the [[Midewiwin|"Good way of Life"]].  Before departing from the Seven Grandfathers, each of the Grandfathers instructed the child with a principle.

A very thorough re-formulation of a variety of ancient Anishinaabe/Midewiwin teachings on the ethics of proper behaviour and conduct.  Benton-Banai manages to incorporate many traditional teachings into his story about the Seven Grandfather Teachings.  Benton-Banai succeeds in showing how an Anishinaabe Traditional Teacher can borrow from traditional teachings and recombine and change them to make them relevant to contemporary issues faced by Anishinaabe people.

== Teachings ==

* '''''Nibwaakaawin''—Wisdom''': To cherish knowledge is to know Wisdom.  Wisdom is given by the Creator to be used for the good of the people.  In the [[Ojibwe language|Anishinaabe language]], this word expresses not only "wisdom," but also means "prudence," or "intelligence."  In some communities, '''''Gikendaasowin''''' is used; in addition to "wisdom," this word can also mean "intelligence" or "knowledge."
* '''''Zaagi'idiwin''—Love''': To know peace is to know Love.  Love must be unconditional. When people are weak they need love the most.  In the Anishinaabe language, this word with the reciprocal theme /idi/ indicates that this form of love is mutual.  In some communities, '''''Gizhaawenidiwin''''' is used, which in most context means "jealousy" but in this context is translated as either "love" or "zeal".  Again, the reciprocal theme /idi/ indicates that this form of love is mutual.
* '''''Minaadendamowin''—Respect''': To honor all creation is to have Respect. All of creation should be treated with respect. You must give respect if you wish to be respected.  Some communities instead use '''''Ozhibwaadenindiwin''''' or '''''Manazoonidiwin'''''.
* '''''Aakode'ewin''—Bravery''': Bravery is to face the foe with integrity. In the Anishinaabe language, this word literally means "state of having a fearless heart."  To do what is right even when the consequences are unpleasant.  Some communities instead use either '''''Zoongadikiwin''''' ("state of having a strong casing")  or '''''Zoongide'ewin''''' ("state of having a strong heart").
* '''''Gwayakwaadiziwin''—Honesty''': Honesty in facing a situation is to be brave. Always be honest in word and action. Be honest first with yourself, and you will more easily be able to be honest with others. In the Anishinaabe language, this word can also mean "righteousness."
* '''''Dabaadendiziwin''—Humility''': Humility is to know yourself as a sacred part of Creation.  In the Anishinaabe language, this word can also mean "compassion." You are equal to others, but you are not better. Some communities instead express this with ''''' Bekaadiziwin''''', which in addition to "humility" can also be translated as "calmness," "meekness," "gentility" or "patience."
* '''''Debwewin''—Truth''': Truth is to know all of these things. Speak the truth. Do not deceive yourself or others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2346">'''Traditional engineering''', also known as '''sequential engineering''', is the process of [[marketing]], engineering [[design]], [[manufacturing]], testing and [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] where each stage of the development process is carried out separately, and the next stage cannot start until the previous stage is finished.  Therefore, the information flow is only in one direction, and it is not until the end of the chain that errors, changes and corrections can be relayed to the start of the sequence, causing estimated costs to be under predicted.

This can cause many problems; such as time consumption due to many modifications being made as each stage does not take into account the next.  This method is hardly used today{{citation needed|reason=Experience in a number of engineering sectors suggests that many firms have not yet transitioned to concurrent engineering.|date=July 2016}}, as the concept of [[concurrent engineering]] is more efficient.

Traditional engineering is also known as '''over the wall engineering''' as each stage blindly throws the development to the next stage '''over the wall'''.

==Lean manufacturing==
Traditional manufacturing has been driven by sales forecasts that companies need to produce and stockpile inventory to support. Lean manufacturing is based on the concept that production should be driven by the actual customer demands and requirements. Instead of pushing product to the marketplace, it is pulled through by the customers' actual needs.

==Sequential engineering stages==
# Research
# Design
# Manufacture
# Quality Control
# Distribution
# Sales

==Disadvantages of sequential engineering==
# This orderly step-by-step process will bring control to complex projects but is very slow.
# In today’s highly competitive market place this can lead to product failures and lost sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manufacturing-works.com/lean/lean_vs_traditional.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094157/http://manufacturing-works.com/lean/lean_vs_traditional.php |archivedate=2012-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''uniform access principle''' of [[computer programming]] was put forth by [[Bertrand Meyer]] (originally in ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]''). It states "All services offered by a [[modular programming|module]] should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation".&lt;ref name=c2&gt;{{cite web|title=The UniformAccessPrinciple|url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UniformAccessPrinciple|work=c2 wiki|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle applies generally to the [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of [[object-oriented]] [[programming languages]]. In simpler form, it states that there should be no syntactical difference between working with an [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]], pre-computed [[Property (programming)|property]], or [[Method (computer science)|method]]/[[Information retrieval|query]] of an object.

While most examples focus on the "read" aspect of the principle (i.e., retrieving a value), Meyer shows that the "write" implications (i.e., modifying a value) of the principle are harder to deal with in his monthly column on the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel programming language]] official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Bertrand|title=EiffelWorld Column: Business plus pleasure|url=http://www.eiffel.com/general/monthly_column/2005/Sept_October.html|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
The problem being addressed by Meyer involves the maintenance of large software projects or software libraries. Sometimes when developing or maintaining software it is necessary, after much code is in place, to change a class or object in a way that transforms what was simply an attribute access into a method call.  Programming languages often use different syntax for attribute access and invoking a method, (e.g., {{code|object.something}} versus {{code|object.something()}}). The syntax change would require, in popular programming languages of the day, changing the source code in all the places where the attribute was used.  This might require changing source code in many different locations throughout a very large volume of source code. Or worse, if the change is in an object library used by hundreds of customers, each of those customers would have to find and change all the places the attribute was used in their own code and recompile their programs.

Going the reverse way (from method to simple attribute) really was not a problem, as one can always just keep the function and have it simply return the attribute value.

Meyer recognized the need for software developers to write code in such a way as to minimize or eliminate cascading changes in code that result from changes which convert an object attribute to a method call or vice versa. For this he developed the Uniform Access Principle.

Many programming languages do not strictly support the UAP but do support forms of it.  Properties, which are provided in a number of programming languages, address the problem Meyer was addressing with his UAP in a different way. Instead of providing a single uniform notation, properties provide a way to invoke a method of an object while using the same notation as is used for attribute access.  The separate method invocation syntax is still available.

== UAP Example ==
If the language uses the method invocation syntax it may look something like this.
&lt;pre&gt;
//Assume print displays the variable passed to it, with or without parens
//Set Foo's attribute 'bar' to  value 5.
Foo.bar(5)
print Foo.bar()
&lt;/pre&gt;
When executed, should display :
&lt;pre&gt;
5
&lt;/pre&gt;
Whether or not Foo.bar(5) invokes a function or simply sets an attribute is hidden from the caller.
Likewise whether Foo.bar() simply retrieves the value of the attribute, or invokes a function
to compute the value returned, is an implementation detail hidden from the caller.

If the language uses the attribute syntax the syntax may look like this.
&lt;pre&gt;
Foo.bar = 5
print Foo.bar
&lt;/pre&gt;
Again, whether or not a method is invoked, or the value is simply assigned to an attribute is hidden
from the calling method.

== Problems ==

However, UAP itself can lead to problems, if used in places where the differences between access methods are ''not'' negligible, such as when the returned value is expensive to compute or will trigger cache operations.&lt;ref name=c2/&gt; It might not matter in principle to the client how the value of 42 was obtained, but if computing it [[Deep Thought (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|requires running a planet-sized computer for 7.5 million years]], the client ought to know what to expect.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Language Examples ==
=== Ruby ===

Consider the following
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
y = Egg.new( "Green")
y.color = "White" 
puts y.color
&lt;/source&gt;
Now the Egg class could be defined as follows
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
class Egg
  attr_accessor :color
  def initialize( color )
    @color = color
  end
end
&lt;/source&gt;
The above initial code segment would work fine with the Egg being defined as such. The Egg
class could also be defined as below, where color is instead a method. The calling code would
still work, unchanged if Egg were to be defined as follows.
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
class Egg
  
  def initialize(color)
    @rgb_color = to_rgb(color)
  end

  def color
     to_color_name(@rgb_color)
  end
 
  def color=(color) 
     @rgb_color = to_rgb(color)
  end

  private
  def to_rgb(color_name)
     .....
  end

  def to_color_name(color)
     ....
  end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

Note how even though &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; looks like an attribute in one case and a pair of methods
in the next, the interface to the class remains the same.  The person maintaining the Egg class can switch from one form to the other without fear of breaking any caller's code.
Ruby follows the revised UAP, the &lt;code&gt;attr_accessor :color&lt;/code&gt; only acts as [[syntactic sugar]] for generating accessor/setter methods for &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;. There is no way in Ruby to retrieve an instance variable from an object without calling a method on it.

Strictly speaking, Ruby does not follow Meyer's original UAP in that the syntax for accessing an attribute is different from the syntax for invoking a method.  But here, the access for an attribute will always actually be through a function which is often automatically generated. So in essence, either type of access invokes a function and the language does follow Meyer's revised Uniform Access Principle.

=== Python ===

[[Python (programming language)#Objects|Python properties]] may be used to allow a method
to be invoked with the same syntax as accessing an attribute.  Whereas Meyer's UAP would have
a single notation for both attribute access and method invocation (method invocation syntax), 
a language with support for properties still supports separate notations for attribute
and method access.  Properties allow the attribute notation to be used, but to hide the
fact that a method is being invoked instead of simply retrieving or setting a value. 

In the strict sense, Python does NOT follow the UAP because there is a syntax difference
between normal method invocations and attribute access.

In Python, we may have code that access an object as follows 
&lt;source lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; egg = Egg( 4, "White")
&gt;&gt;&gt; egg.color = "Green"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print egg.weight, egg.color, egg.quack()
4 Green quack
&lt;/source&gt;
A Egg object could be defined such that weight and color are simple attributes as in the following
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
class Egg(object):
    def __init__(self, weight, color):
        self.weight = weight
        self.color = color
    def quack(self):
        return "quack"
&lt;/source&gt;
Or the Egg object could use properties, and invoke methods instead
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
class Egg(object):
    def __init__(self, weight, color):
        self.__weight = toGrams(weight)
        self.__color = toRGB(color)

    def setColor(self, colorname):
        self.__color = toRGB(colorname)

    def getColor(self):
        return toColorName(self.__color)
    
    color = property(getColor, setColor, doc="Color of the Egg")

    def setWeight(self, weightOz);
        self.__weight = 29.3*weightOz

    def getWeight(self):
        return self.__weight/29.3;

    weight = property(setWeight, getWeight, doc="Weight in Ounces")

    def quack(self):
        return "quack"
&lt;/source&gt;
Regardless of which way Egg is defined, the calling code can remain the same.  The implementation of Egg can switch from one form to the other without affecting code that uses the Egg class. Languages which implement the UAP have this property as well.

=== C# ===

The [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] language supports class ''properties'', which provide a means to define {{code|get}} and {{code|set}} operations (''getters'' and ''setters'') for a member variable. The syntax to access or modify the property is the same as accessing any other class member variable, but the actual implementation for doing so can be defined as either a simple read/write access or as functional code.
&lt;source lang="C#"&gt;
class Foo
{
    // Property
    int Size
    {
        get;    // Getter
        set;    // Setter
    }

    // Property
    string Name
    {
        get { return name_; }     // Getter
        set { name_ = value; }    // Setter
    }

    private string  name_;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above, class {{code|Foo}} contains two properties, {{code|Size}} and {{code|Name}}. The {{code|Size}} property is an integer that can be read (get) and written (set). Similarly, the {{code|Name}} property is a string that can also be read and modified, but its value is stored in a separate (private) class variable {{code|name_}}.

Omitting the {{code|set}} operation in a property definition makes the property read-only, while omitting the {{code|get}} operation makes it write-only.

Use of the properties employs the UAP, as shown in the code below.
&lt;source lang="C#"&gt;
    Foo MakeFoo(int mySize, string myName)
    {
        Foo  myFoo = new Foo();
        myFoo.Size = mySize;       // Property setter
        myFoo.Name = myName;       // Property setter
        return myFoo;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== C++ ===
	 	
[[C++]] has neither the UAP nor properties, when an object is changed such that an attribute (color) becomes a pair of functions (getA, setA). Any place in that uses an instance of the object and either sets or gets the attribute value ( x = obj.color or obj.color= x) must be changed to invoke one of the functions. ( x = obj.getColor() or obj.setColor(x)). Using templates and operator overloading, it is possible to fake properties, but this is more complex than in languages which directly support properties. This complicates maintenance of C++ programs. Distributed libraries of C++ objects must be careful about how they provide access to member data.

It is the fourth element of true love and has as its seed the wisdom of equality that removes all boundaries, discrimination and prejudices while leading to the sublime unity where there is no self and no other; without ''Upeksha'', love becomes possessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teachings on Love|author=Thich Nhat Hanh|publisher=Readhowyouwant.com|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K6o6IitGogC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyELUaKpNIXZrQeS14GQBQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equanimity or ''Upeksha'' grows out of mindfulness, then one becomes master of every situation no matter what the situation is without it one cannot take anything in one’s stride; its significance is that one really lives unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen Therapy|author=David Brazier|publisher=Constable and Robinson Ltd.|page=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ6cR_3IyWMC&amp;pg=PT90&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyELUaKpNIXZrQeS14GQBQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The understanding that our happiness and that of others is inseparable moves us directly into the fourth ''[[Brahmavihara]]'', ''Upeksha''. Equanimity of ''Upeksha'' carries the ability to take a large view and to look over the whole situation not bound by one side or the other, its near-enemy is in-difference which is difficult to recognise because it masquerades on the surface as even-mindedness; indifference causes retreat to a form of denial like repression, don’t care-can’t be bothered attitude. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching, Learning and Loving|author=Daniel Patrick Liston|publisher=Routledge|page=175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_dJ6xrnGaQC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IyoLUbbULIfqkAWy3YDQCQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Yoga]], ''maîtri'', ''karuna'', ''mudita'' and ''upeksha'' are only different aspects of universal sympathy, which remove all perversities in our nature and unite us with our fellow-men. This is the positive aspect of the mind with reference to abstinence from injuring (''[[ahimsa]]'') which will cleanse the mind and make it fit for ''[[Śraddhā]]'' etc., prepare it to become steady with a view to attaining true discriminative knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga as Philosophy and Religion|author=Surendra Nath Dasgupta|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osW7uQU2E-IC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyELUaKpNIXZrQeS14GQBQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''karmasthana'' that holds a very high place in ''[[sadhana]]''. Like equality in [[Bhagavad Gita]], ''upeksha'' of the [[Buddhists]] operates on many levels, and ten kinds of upeksha are enumerated; it is the equality called the six-limbed upeksha which renounces all the creaturely reactions of the six senses when anything agreeable or disagreeable presents itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meditations:Yoga, Gods, Religions|author=Ram Swarup|publisher=Voice of India|page=19,60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqzWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IyoLUbbULIfqkAWy3YDQCQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samadhi]] may also involve the cultivation of the four states called [[Brahmavihara]]s which four states are - "goodwill" (''maîtri''), "compassion" (''karuna''), "sympathetic joy" (''mudita'') and "equanimity" (''upeksha'').

''Upeksha'' as a power includes freedom from all kinds of desires and birth because it has no preference for one thing more than the other. It is opposed to individuality. This power manifests as ten kinds which are  – ''Sadangopeksha'' (when there is neither pleasure nor displeasure), ''Brahma-wiharopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all beings), ''Bowdyangopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all thoughts), ''Wiryopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected by the same force of determination), ''Sankharopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all kinds of wisdom), ''Wedanopeksha'' (when the mind is sensible to neither pleasure nor pain), ''Widarsanopeksha'' (when the mind is not affected by what is seen), ''Tatramadyastopeksha'' (when all modes of upeksha are applied together), ''Dhyanopeksha'' (when the impermanency of sensible-objects is regarded with an even mind)and ''Parisudi-upeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all that is necessary to secure freedom from the cleaving to existence). All upekshas may be possessed by one and the same person but the second cannot be possessed without the first.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Manual of Buddhism, in its Modern Development|author=Robert Spence Hardy|page=505|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3cOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA505&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MzILUeiLMI_KrAfH94GQCg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Theosophists, ''maitri'', ''karuna'', ''mudita'' and ''upeksha'' are the four qualities of a ''[[Jivanmukta]]'' who favours ''Sishya'' ("disciple") who attains ''[[Moksha|mukti]]'', ''Bhakta'' ("devotee") who gains his noble ends, ''Udasina'' ("indifferent person") who begins to cherish love for virtuous deeds and ''Pathaka'' (a "sinner") whose sins are purged, and whose ''lakshanas'' are ''akkrodha'' ("absence of hatred"), ''arogya'' ("sound health"), ''jitendriyathawam'' ("conquest of passions"), ''daya'' (kindness), ''kshama'' (forbearance), ''janapriyathawa'' (popularity), ''alobha'' ("absence of avarice"), ''dathruthawa'' (generosity), ''abhaya'' (courage) and ''nairmalaya'' (cleanliness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theosophist October 1886 to April 1187|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcqKzRYREm8C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WmALUeGJHI2GrAf0l4C4Aw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23867">'''Virtue epistemology''' is a contemporary [[philosophy|philosophical]] approach to [[epistemology]] that stresses the importance of intellectual, and specifically [[epistemic virtues]]. A distinguishing factor of virtue theories is that they use for the evaluation of knowledge the properties of the persons who hold beliefs in addition to or instead of the properties of propositions and beliefs. Some{{Vague|date=September 2018}} advocates of virtue epistemology claim to more closely follow theories of [[virtue ethics]], while others see only a looser analogy between virtue in ethics and virtue in epistemology.

Intellectual virtue has been a subject of philosophy since the work of [[Aristotle]], but virtue epistemology is a development in the contemporary [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. It is characterized by efforts to solve problems of special concern to modern epistemology, such as [[theory of justification|justification]] and [[reliabilism]], by directing attention on the knower as agent in a manner similar to the way virtue ethics focuses on moral agents rather than moral acts.

== The Raft and the Pyramid ==
The development of virtue epistemology was partly inspired by a recent renewal of interest in virtue concepts among moral philosophers, and partly as a response to the intractability of competing analyses of knowledge in response to [[Edmund Gettier]]. [[Ernest Sosa]] introduced the notion of an intellectual virtue into contemporary epistemological discussion in a 1980 paper called "The Raft and the Pyramid".&lt;ref name="RandP"&gt;Sosa, Ernest. "The Raft and the Pyramid: Coherence versus Foundations in the Theory of Knowledge." ''Midwest Studies in Philosophy'' 5, (1980): 3–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Sosa argued that an appeal to intellectual virtue could resolve the conflict between foundationalists and coherentists over the structure of epistemic justification. Sosa sought to bridge the gap and create a unity between these two different epistemological theories.

[[Foundationalism]] holds that beliefs are founded or based on other beliefs in a hierarchy, similar to the bricks in the structure of a pyramid. [[Coherentism]], on the other hand, uses the metaphor of a raft in which all beliefs are not tied down by foundations but instead are interconnected due to the logical relationships between each belief. Sosa found a flaw in each of these schools of epistemology, in both cases having to do with the relationship between belief and perception.

Coherentism only allows for justification based on [[logic]]al relations between all the beliefs within a system of beliefs.  However, because perceptual beliefs may not have many logical ties with other beliefs in the system, the coherentist account of knowledge can be said to be inadequate to accommodate the importance normally attributed to perceptual information. On the other hand, Sosa also found problems in the foundationalist approach to epistemology. Foundationalism arguably encounters a problem when attempting to describe how foundational beliefs relate to the sensory experiences that support them.

Coherentism and foundationalism developed as a response to the problems with the "traditional" account of knowledge (as justified true belief) developed by [[Edmund Gettier]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Gettier"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Edmund|last=Gettier|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?|journal=Analysis|volume=23|year=1963|pages=121–23|doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Gettier's counterexamples, competing theories had been developed by a variety of philosophers, but the dispute between coherentists and foundationalists proved to be intractable. Sosa's paper suggested that virtue may help avoid the disputes between coherentist and foundationalist accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtue Epistemology: Essays on Epistemic Virtue and Responsibility|editor1=Linda Zagzebski|editor2=Abrol Fairweather|year=2001|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Virtue epistemology replaces formulaic expressions for apprehending knowledge, such as "S knows that p", by amending these formulas with virtue theory applied to intellect, where virtue then becomes the fulcrum for assessing potential candidates of "knowledge". This substitution raises problems of its own, however. If the same uncertainty about accuracy in creating a formula for testing knowledge equally applies to the authenticity of virtue, then one cannot know if the target virtue is credible. Some virtue epistemologists use reliabilism as a basis for belief justification, stressing reliable functioning of the intellect.&lt;ref name="RandP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AgentReliabilism"&gt;Greco, J. "Agent Reliabilism." J. Tomberlin (ed.) ''Philosophical Perspectives'' 13,(1999): 273–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skeptics" &gt;Greco, J. ''Putting Skeptics in their Place'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas put forth in the area of virtue epistemology are consistent with some of the ideas present in [[contextualism]]. Several areas of contextual epistemology attack the problem of knowledge from a very objective standpoint. Virtue epistemology attempts to simplify the analysis of knowledge by replacing certain abstractions involved in the pursuit of the highest level of knowledge with flexible and contextual instances. Specifically, it leaves room for [[cognitive relativism]]. This degree of reliability is not constant; it can change depending on the context. Under this view, a well-functioning intellectual faculty is a necessary condition for the formation of knowledge. This is quite different from other areas of epistemology because it takes the state of an individual's intellect into account. As a result of this, social context also has the ability to alter knowledge. Social contexts change over time, making it necessary for the beliefs and knowledge to change with it.

In addition, virtue epistemology, similar to virtue ethics, is based on the intellectual qualities in relation to the individual as opposed to the quality of the belief; virtue epistemology is person-based, rather than belief-based. Consequently, virtue epistemology can also stress "epistemic responsibility", that is, an individual is held responsible for the virtue of their knowledge-gathering faculties.

For example, [[Massimo Pigliucci]] applies virtue epistemology to critical thinking and suggests the virtuous individual will consider the following:

*Non-dismissive consideration of arguments
*Charitable interpretation of opposing arguments
*Awareness of one's own presuppositions and potential for being mistaken
*Consultation of expert knowledge
*Reliability of source material
*Knowledge of what one is talking about rather than merely repeating others' opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pigliucci |first1=Massimo |authorlink1=Massimo Pigliucci |title=The Virtuous Skeptic |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=54-57 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109200525/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_virtuous_skeptic |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
Virtue epistemologists differ in the role they believe virtue to play: eliminative virtue epistemology uses the concepts of intellectual virtue and intellectual vice to do away with epistemic concepts like knowledge and justification, while non-eliminative virtue epistemology gives a role for such traditional concepts and uses virtue to provide substantive explanation of those concepts.

Virtue epistemologists differ in what they believe epistemic virtues to be. Some accounts are Aristotelian, drawing a relationship between intellectual virtue and character in a similar way to the way moral virtue is related to character, while "weak" virtue epistemology have an account that doesn't require any particular commitment or cultivation of intellectual virtue. [[Abrol Fairweather]] argues that these "weak" virtue epistemologists "merely [use] virtue theory as a novel lexicon for expressing an independent epistemic theory".&lt;ref name="Fairweather"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Abrol|last=Fairweather|chapter=Epistemic Motivation|title=Virtue Epistemology: Essays on Virtue and Responsibility|year=2001|editor1=Abrol Fairweather|editor2=Linda Zagzebski|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of describing the differences in virtue epistemology is to say that there are two concurrent modes of thought in contemporary virtue epistemology, with one side favoring the "virtue reliabilist" account of virtues as reliably functioning cognitive faculties, and one favoring a "virtue responsibilist" account in which the responsible epistemic conduct of the agent plays a key role.

=== Virtue reliabilism ===
The virtue reliabilist takes the approach that the process whereby [[truth]] is garnered must be reliable. However, the stress of the reliability is not placed upon the mechanism of justification. Instead, the degree of reality-tracking ability determines how virtuous the individual's intellect is, and therefore how good one's knowledge is.

For Sosa, the more virtuous faculties are related to direct sensory perception and memory, and less virtuous capacities are ones related to beliefs derived from the primary memory or [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. Sosa has two criteria for having a belief to be warranted, or in his words, "fully apt". A belief must satisfy the first condition of being "meta-justified" in which the agent must have hit the truth as such. Furthermore, a belief must have been 'apt' in which the agent must have been displaying his virtuous capacities in claiming such a belief or hitting the truth as such. To argue by analogy, a hunter must not only be able to hit his target, say a moose, with precision and accuracy, but the shot must have been one that the hunter ''should have taken.''

For another figure in reliabilist virtue epistemology, [[John Greco (philosopher)|John Greco]], knowledge and justified belief "are grounded in stable and reliable cognitive character. Such character may include both a person's natural cognitive faculties as well as her acquired habits of thought.... So long as such habits are both stable and successful, they make up the kind of character that gives rise to knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greco|first=John|date=1999-01-01|title=Agent Reliabilism|jstor=2676106|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=273–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization of virtue reliabilism can be construed as more inclusive than Sosa's, eschewing the focus on memorial or sensory experience and instead locating virtue in an agent's stable and reliable dispositions to generate successful cognition. In doing so, Greco can be seen as making room for the inclusion of the intellectual virtues as typically construed by the responsibilist camp of virtue epistemology, since many of these virtues can be thought of as stable, reliable dispositions of character.

=== Virtue responsibilism ===
In virtue responsibilism, the emphasis is not on faculties such as perception and memory. Instead, certain intellectual character traits are valued as more virtuous than others. These can be creativity, inquisitiveness, rational rigor, honesty, or a number of other possibilities. Generally, these theories are normative in nature. A few different approaches are taken.

Some, such as [[Lorraine Code]], think that intellectual virtues involve having the correct cognitive character and epistemic relation to the world rooted in a social context. She sees the acquisition of correct knowledge about the world as the primary "good", and the end towards which our intellectual efforts should be oriented, with the desire for truth as the primary motivating factor for our epistemological virtues.&lt;ref name="code"&gt;Code, Lorraine. ''Epistemic Responsibility'', Hanover, NH: University Press of New England for Brown University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Montmarquet]]'s theory of intellectual virtue is similar to Code's, but specifically defines additional intellectual virtues in order to defuse the potential dogmatism or fanaticism that is compatible with Code's desire for truth. The primary virtue is conscientiousness, which focuses on the correct end of intellectual living. In order to obtain conscientiousness, it is important to maintain impartiality, sobriety, and courage.&lt;ref name="james"&gt;Montmarquet, J.A. ''Epistemic Virtue and Doxastic Responsibility'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski]] has proposed a neo-Aristotelian model of virtue epistemology, emphasizing the role of ''phronesis'' (practical wisdom) as an architectonic virtue unifying moral and intellectual virtues even more radically than Aristotle proposed.&lt;ref name="linda"&gt;Zagzebski, Linda. "Intellectual Motivation and the Good of Truth.", in ''Intellectual Virtue: Perspectives from Ethics and Epistemology''. eds. M. DePaul and L. Zagzebski, 135–54, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; As delineated in her model, the virtues are "a deep and enduring acquired excellence of a person, involving a characteristic motivation to produce a certain desired end and reliable success in bringing about that end."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtues of the Mind, Selections in Epistemology: An Anthology|last=Zagzebski|first=Linda|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4051-6967-7|location=|pages=443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she sees it, the "characteristic motivation" of an intellectual virtue is the desire for truth, understanding, and other species of cognitive contact with reality. The notion of "reliable success" is invoked in order to avoid issues of well-intentioned but unsuccessful agents who desire truth but use poorly suited methods to pursue it.

=== Plantinga's theory of warrant ===
[[Alvin Plantinga]] offers another theory of knowledge closely related to virtue epistemology. According to him, knowledge is warranted if one's intellectual faculties are operating as they are designed to. That is, knowledge is valid if it is obtained through the correct operation of the faculties of the intellect which are designed to have  an inherent ability, because they are designed that way, to capture and produce true beliefs.&lt;ref name="plantinga"&gt;Plantinga, Alvin. ''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jonathan Kvanvig's understanding and assertion ===
In Jonathan Kvanvig's essay, ''Why Inquiring Minds Want to Know?: Meno Problems and Epistemological Axiology'' he asserts that epistemology has no place in philosophical study. The value of knowledge originates from the Socratic dialogue written by Plato called [[Meno]]. In Meno, Socrates' distinction between "true belief" and "knowledge" forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as "[[justified true belief]]". Socrates explains the similarities and differences between "true belief" and "knowledge", arguing that justified true belief fails to "stay in their place" and must be "tethered". According to Kvanvig, true belief is what is necessary to maximize truth and to avoid error, thus dropping [[Theory of justification|justification]] from the equation of knowledge. He argues that once we recognize what the manipulated boundary notion of non-Gettierized account of knowledge is, then it becomes clear that there is nothing valuable about the anti-Gettier condition on knowledge. Kvanvig acknowledges that true belief falls short of knowledge, however to him, true belief is no less valuable than knowledge. Kvanvig believes that epistemology should be focused on [[understanding]], an epistemic standing that Kvanvig maintains is of more value than knowledge and justified true belief.

== Potential advantages ==
Some varieties of virtue epistemology that contain normative elements, such as virtue responsibilism, can provide a unified framework of normativity and value. Others, such as Sosa's account, can circumvent [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] skepticism with the necessity of externalism interacting with internalism. In this same vein, and because of the inherent flexibility and social nature of some of types of virtue epistemology, social conditioning and influence can be understood within an epistemological framework and explored.  This flexibility and connection between internal and external makes virtue epistemology more accessible.&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;Zagzebski, Linda (1998, 2005). Virtue epistemology. In E.

As discussed by a parallel criticism leveled at virtue ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doris|first=John M.|date=1998-12-01|title=Persons, Situations, and Virtue Ethics|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0029-4624.00136/abstract|journal=Noûs|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=504–530|doi=10.1111/0029-4624.00136|issn=1468-0068}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtue theories, whether moral or epistemic, typically consider character traits as stable across time, and efficacious as explanatory reasons for persons behaving and thinking as they do. However, this supposition has been challenged by the "situationist critique" in psychology, which argues that human epistemic character changes depending on context, even when that change is epistemically irrelevant. Thus, irrelevant differences in a situation can prompt a drastic change in cognitive behavior.

Reliabilists might characterize this as effecting a drop in reliable functioning, whereas responsibilists would see these variations as negating one's excellent cognitive character. It is therefore argued that virtue theorists should either amend their conception of human psychology to accommodate this or explain how the results of situationist psychological research do not contradict their theory.
