      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2663">'''Austal2000''' is an [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It was developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke&lt;ref name="Janicke"&gt;[http://www.janicke.de/htm/e_home.htm Web site of Ingenieurbüro Janicke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812134159/http://www.janicke.de/htm/e_home.htm |date=August 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Dunum, Germany under contract to the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.  

Although not named in the TA Luft, it is the reference dispersion model accepted as being in compliance with the requirements of Annex 3 of the TA Luft and the pertinent VDI Guidelines.

==Description==

It simulates the dispersion of air pollutants by utilizing a [[random walk]] process ([[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian simulation model]]) and it has capabilities for [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|building effects]], complex terrain, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|pollutant plume]] depletion by [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet or dry deposition]], and first order chemical reactions. It is available for download on the Internet free of cost.&lt;ref name="AustalDownload"&gt;[http://www.austal2000.de/ Austal2000 download web site (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austal2000G is a similar model for simulating the dispersion of odours and it was also developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke. The development of Austal 2000G was financed by three German states: Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen and Baden-Württemberg.

'''''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels''''', full title: ''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels: With a View to Prove Their Common Origin, and to Restore the Text of Their Archetype''. The book was published in 1877 by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott on behalf of his deceased colleague William Hugh Ferrar.

[[William Hugh Ferrar]] (1826–1871) before his death collated four [[Minuscule Greek|minuscules]] (Greek handwritten [[Lower case|cursive]] texts) to demonstrate that they shared a common provenance. The four collated minuscules are: [[Minuscule 13|13]], [[Minuscule 69|69]], [[Minuscule 124|124]], [[Minuscule 346|346]] (known as [[Family 13]] or ''Ferrar Family''). Ferrar intended to establish that these four codices are derived from a common archetype, and to exhibit as nearly as possible the actual text of this [[archetype]] of these four minuscules, a text, therefore, more ancient and authoritative than of any of these manuscripts separately.

The book was published in 1877 by [[Thomas Kingsmill Abbott|T. K. Abbott]] on behalf of William Hugh Ferrar, who had died six years previous.

'''Agile architecture''' means how enterprise / system / [[Software architect|software architects]] apply architectural practice in [[agile software development]]. A number of commentators have identified a tension between traditional software architecture and agile methods along the axis of adaptation (leaving architectural decisions until the last possible moment) versus anticipation (planning in advance). (Kruchten, 2010 )&lt;ref&gt;Kruchten, P. (2010). Software Architecture and Agile Software
Development — A Clash of Two Cultures? Proceedings of the 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterman, Nobel and Allan (2015) &lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Nobel and Allan. (2015). How Much Up-Front? A Grounded Theory of Agile Architecture. In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt; explored the tensions between spending too little time designing an up-front architecture, increasing risk, and spending too much time, negatively impacting of the delivery of value to the customer. They identify six forces that can affect agile architecture: Requirements instability, technical risk, early value, team culture, customer agility and experience. These forces may be addressed by six strategies: Respond to change, address risk, emergent architecture, big design up front and use [[Enterprise architecture framework|framework]]s and template architectures.

Several attempts have been made to specify what makes up an agile approach to architecture. According to the [[Scaled Agile Framework|SAFe]] framework, the principles of agile [[architecture]] are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scalingsoftwareagility.wordpress.com/2008/07/10/agile-architecture-%e2%80%93-the-whitepaper-now-on-line/|title=Agile Architecture – The Whitepaper Now On Line|last=Leffingwell|first=Dean|date=2008-07-10|website=Scaling Software Agility|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Design emerges. [[Architecture]] is a collaboration. (intentional architecture)
# The bigger the system, the longer the runway (architectural runway)
# Build the simplest architecture that can possibly work (established design principles)
# When in doubt, code or model it out (spikes, prototype, domain and use case models)
# They build it, they test it (design for testability)
# There is no monopoly on innovation (teams, hackathons) - Facebook's Like button was conceived as part of a hackathon
# Implement architectural flow (architectural epics and the portfolio kanban) - the portfolio Kanban goes through [[funnel]], review, analysis, portfolio backlog and implementing

* Evolutionary collaboration over [[blueprint|blueprinting]]
* Communication over perfection
* Active stakeholder participation
* Enterprise architects are active participants on development teams
* Enablement over inspection (exemplars)
* High level models (the more complex, the more abstract)
* Capture details with working code
* Lean guidance and rules, not bureaucratic procedures

[[Image:Anal beads.jpg|thumb|Rigid beads]]

'''Anal beads''' are a [[sex toy]] consisting of multiple spheres or balls attached together in series which are continuously inserted through the [[anus]] into the [[rectum]] and then removed with varying speeds depending on the desired effect (commonly at [[orgasm]] to enhance climax). Anal bead users enjoy the pleasurable feeling of the ball passing through the narrow [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|sphincter]] of the anus.

== Design ==
Anal beads are available in many sizes, with individual beads measuring from 25 mm in diameter to 125 mm diameter or larger. Most users enjoy beads of approximately 45 mm, but most will become more adventurous with experience, and try larger sizes.  Anal beads are commonly made of [[silicone]], [[plastic]], [[rubber]], [[latex]], [[glass]] or [[metal]] and end with a ring or similar handle designed for pulling. The purpose of this ring is to prevent the beads from becoming fully lodged in the rectum, and to ease removal. The beads may either be joined flexibly, requiring individual insertion, or by a semi-rigid thin shaft, allowing anal insertion in a single motion. Both arrangements are forms of the sexual art of "beading off".

The many nerve endings of the sphincter provide arousal both during insertion and removal, and larger beads may create feelings of pressure while in the rectum.

Some anal beads are enhanced with vibration technology to enhance pleasure.

== Use ==
[[File:Illustration of anal bead use.svg|thumb|Illustration of anal bead use]]
Anal beads can be incorporated into many fetishes that involve [[anal sex]], [[Body worship|ass worship]], [[Erotic spanking|spanking]], [[enema]]s or anything involving the buttocks, anus, or the anal area.

As with all anal sexual activity, the anal beads and the rectum should be well-lubricated with a [[sexual lubricant]] intended for  anal sex.  It is important to do this as the rectum can be easily ripped, torn or injured. Anal sex toys should be well washed with warm soapy water and left to dry naturally after use.  Alternatively, they can be placed inside a [[condom]], which is recommended if they are shared with a partner.

Care must also be taken to count the beads before and after use to ensure they are all removed from the anus. String have reportedly broken during intense rectal movements.  If a bead gets stuck in the rectum and cannot be expelled naturally, medical intervention may be necessary.

== Safety ==
If the beads are threaded onto a string, which is a porous material, they cannot be fully disinfected. They should not be shared between partners without using a physical barrier such as a latex or neoprene condom to prevent the transfer of [[faeces]]. Sharing unsterilized anal toys can expose users to various [[sexually transmitted diseases]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23320">{{Anti-consumerism}}

'''Anti-consumerism''' is a [[sociopolitical]] [[ideology]] that is opposed to [[consumerism]], the continual buying and consuming of material possessions.  Anti-consumerism is concerned with the private actions of business corporations in pursuit of financial and economic goals at the expense of the public welfare, especially in matters of [[environmental protection]], [[social stratification]], and [[ethics]] in the governing of a society. In politics, anti-consumerism overlaps with [[environmental activism]], [[anti-globalization]], and [[animal-rights]] activism; moreover, a conceptual variation of anti-consumerism is ''[[post-consumerism]]'', living in a material way that transcends consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postconsumers.com |title=Postconsumers |publisher=Postconsumers |date=2018-06-13 |accessdate=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-consumerism arose in response to the problems caused by the long-term mistreatment of human consumers and of the animals consumed, and from the incorporation of [[consumer education]] to school [[curriculum|curricula]]; examples of anti-consumerism are the book ''[[No Logo]]'' (2000) by [[Naomi Klein]], and documentary films such as ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' (2003), by [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Jennifer Abbott]], and ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus: Terrorized into Being Consumers]]'' (2003), by [[Erik Gandini]]; each made [[anti-corporate activism]] popular as an ideologically accessible form of civil and political action.

The criticism of [[economic materialism]] as a dehumanizing behaviour that is destructive of the Earth, as [[biosphere|human habitat]], comes from [[religion]] and [[social activism]]. The religious criticism asserts that materialist consumerism interferes with the connection between the individual and God, and so is an inherently [[immoral]] style of life; thus the German historian [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936) said that "Life in America is exclusively economic in structure, and lacks depth."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stearns, Peter. ''Consumerism in World History''. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; From the Roman Catholic perspective, [[Thomas Aquinas]] said that "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things"; in that vein, [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] said that spiritual inspiration guided them towards [[simple living]].

From the secular perspective, social activism indicates that from consumerist materialism derive [[crime]] (which originates from the [[poverty]] of [[economic inequality]]), industrial [[pollution]] and the consequent [[environmental degradation]], and [[war]] as a business. About the societal discontent born of [[malaise]] and [[hedonism]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said that the philosophy of materialism offers no ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' for human existence;&lt;ref&gt;Web log. 17 July 2008. http://babs22.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/australia-pope-attacks-consumerism/&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the writer [[Georges Duhamel]] said that "American materialism [is] a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Background==
Anti-consumerism originated from criticism of consumption, starting with [[Thorstein Veblen]], who, in the book ''[[Theory of the Leisure Class|The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions]]'' (1899), indicated that [[consumerism]] dates from the [[cradle of civilization]]. The term ''consumerism'' also denotes economic policies associated with [[Keynesian economics]], and the belief that the free choice of consumers should dictate the economic structure of a society (cf. [[producerism]]).

==Politics and society==
[[File:Anticonsumismo.JPG|thumb|250px|An anti-consumerist [[stencil graffiti]] saying "Consuming consumes you"]]
Many [[anti-corporate activist]]s believe the rise of large-business corporations poses a threat to the legitimate authority of [[nation states]] and the public sphere.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} They feel corporations are invading people's [[privacy]], manipulating politics and governments, and creating false needs in consumers.  They state evidence such as invasive advertising [[adware]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], [[telemarketing]], child-targeted advertising, aggressive [[guerrilla marketing]], massive corporate campaign contributions in political elections, interference in the policies of sovereign nation states ([[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]), and news stories about [[corporate corruption]] ([[Enron]], for example).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Anti-consumerism protesters point out that the main responsibility of a corporation is to answer only to [[shareholders]], giving [[human rights]] and other issues almost no consideration.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The management does have a primary responsibility to their shareholders, since any [[philanthropic]] activities that do not directly serve the business could be deemed to be a [[Position of trust|breach of trust]].  This sort of financial responsibility means that multi-national corporations will pursue strategies to intensify labor and reduce costs. For example, they will attempt to find low wage economies with laws which are conveniently lenient on human rights, the [[natural environment]], [[trade union]] organization and so on (see, for example, [[Nike, Inc.#Human rights concerns|Nike]]).

An important contribution to the critique of consumerism has been made by French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]], arguing modern capitalism is governed by consumption rather than production, and the advertising techniques used to create [[consumer behaviour]] amount to the destruction of psychic and collective [[individuation]].  The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle of consumption, leading to hyper consumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery.

In art, [[Banksy]], influential British graffiti master, painter, activist, filmmaker and all-purpose provocateur&lt;ref name="Kakutani"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/books/banksy-the-man-behind-the-wall-by-will-ellsworth-jones.html|title=‘Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall,’ by Will Ellsworth-Jones|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=2013-02-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; has made statements in public works about the consumerist society. Working undercover, the secretive street artist challenges social ideas and goads viewers into rethinking their surroundings, to acknowledge the absurdities of closely held preconceptions.&lt;ref name="Kakutani"/&gt; Quote from Banksy: “You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.” After 2003, Banksy wrote the ''New Yorker'' by e-mail: “I give away thousands of paintings for free. I don’t think it’s possible to make art about world poverty and trouser all the cash.” Banksy believes that there is a consumerist shift in art, and for the first time, the bourgeois world of art belongs to the people. On his [http://www.banksy.co.uk/menu.asp website], he provides high-resolution images of his work for free downloading.

In many critical contexts,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} the term describes the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially with commercial [[brand]] names and obvious [[status symbol|status-enhancing]] appeal, such as a brand of expensive automobiles or [[jewelry]]. It is a pejorative term which most people deny, having some more specific excuse or [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for consumption other than the idea that they are "compelled to consume". A culture that has a high amount of consumerism is referred to as a [[consumer culture]].

To those who embrace the idea of consumerism, these products are not seen as valuable in themselves, but rather as social signals that allow them to identify like-minded people through consumption and display of similar products. Few would yet go so far, though, as to admit that their relationships with a product or brand name could be substitutes for healthy human relationships that sometimes lack in a dysfunctional modern [[society]].

The older term ''conspicuous consumption'' described the [[United States]] in the 1960s, but was soon linked to larger debates about [[media influence]], [[culture jamming]], and its corollary [[productivism]]. 
[[File:BarsStencil.jpg|thumb|Anti-consumerist [[stencil]] art]]
The term and concept of ''conspicuous consumption'' originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writing of economist [[Thorstein Veblen]]. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen's scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following:
{{quote |It is true of dress in even a higher degree than of most other items of consumption, that people will undergo a very considerable degree of privation in the comforts or the necessaries of life in order to afford what is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption; so that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence, in an inclement climate, for people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]], 1899&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, economist [[Victor Lebow]] stated (as quoted by [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]], 2009):
{{quote |Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.}}

According to archaeologists, evidence of conspicuous consumption up to several millennia ago has been found, suggesting that such behavior is inherent to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Consumerism and advertising===
Anti-consumerists believe [[advertising]] plays a huge role in human life by informing values and assumptions of the cultural system, deeming what is acceptable and determining social standards.&lt;ref name="World. Dir 1997"&gt;[ Advertising and the End of the World. Dir. Sut Jhally. Perf. [[Sut Jhally]]. DVD. Media Education Foundation, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;  They declare that ads create a hyper-real world where commodities appear as the key to securing happiness.  Anti-consumerists cite studies that find that individuals believe their quality of life improves in relation to social values that lie outside the capability of the market place.  Therefore, advertising attempts to equate the social with the material by utilizing images and slogans to link commodities with the real sources of human happiness, such as meaningful relationships.  Ads are then a detriment to society because they tell consumers that accumulating more and more possessions will bring them closer to self-actualization, or the concept of a complete and secure being.  "The underlying message is that owning these products will enhance our image and ensure our popularity with others".&lt;ref&gt;[Tim Kasser, "The High Price of Materialism", 2002, p.9, Achorn Graphic Services]&lt;/ref&gt; And while advertising promises that a product will make the consumer happy, advertising simultaneously depends upon the consumer never being ''truly'' happy, as then the consumer would no longer feel the need to consume needless products.

Anti-consumerists claim that in a consumerist society, advertisement images disempower and objectify the consumer.&lt;ref name="Rumbo"&gt;Joseph D. Rumbo, "Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters", Psychology and Marketing, Vol.19(2), February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  By stressing individual power, choice and desire, advertising falsely implies the control lies with the consumer.  Because anti-consumerists believe commodities only supply short-term gratification, they detract from a sustainably happy society.  Further, advertisers have resorted to new techniques of capturing attention, such as the increased speed of ads and [[product placement]]s.&lt;ref name="World. Dir 1997"/&gt;  In this way, commercials infiltrate the consumerist society and become an inextricable part of culture.  Anti-consumerists condemn advertising because it constructs a simulated world that offers fantastical [[escapism]] to consumers, rather than reflecting actual reality.  They further argue that ads depict the interests and lifestyles of the elite as natural; cultivating a deep sense of inadequacy among viewers.&lt;ref name="Rumbo" /&gt;  They denounce use of beautiful models because they glamorize the commodity beyond reach of the average individual.

In an opinion segment of ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] of the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Warren Hern]] of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are "subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world's existing inequalities." According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the [[Ecological Society of America]], human society is in a "global overshoot", consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world's resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic "bio-capacities", and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries.

===Alternatives to mainstream economic concepts===
{{confusing|section|date=August 2013}}
Throughout the ages, various movements have tried to model alternatives to consumerism while remaining in the capitalist society. [[Intentional community|Intentional communities]] provide an example of this, as do monastic orders, barter movements and technology-driving sharing or exchange mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/|title=Bruderhof - Fellowship for Intentional Community|work=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an intentional community called the Bruderhof has a system of sharing within the community, and no money is used by the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bruderhof runs a successful manufacturing business that allows it to trade in the capitalistic society, but without the members indulging in consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityplaythings.com/about-us/history|title=communityplaythings.com - Our History|website=www.communityplaythings.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such anti-consumerist, anti-capitalist notions are not without their detractors. New thought and theory has spurred movements to alter world economic climate. Green movements and some other thinkers are opposed to the focus put on economics. The need for terminology has created familiar ideas such as [[carrying-capacity]], and [[ecological footprint]].

[[David Ricardo]], an early economist, had ideas that state the finitude of growth, rather than the opposite; his ideas were similar to those of [[Mark Twain]], when he said "Buy land, they don't make it anymore." To Ricardian logic, land was a limiting factor.

==Austrian economics==

Some{{who|date=December 2017}} adherents to the Austrian economic philosophy advocate against consumerism due to its effect of contributing to "debt slavery." Austrian economic advocates focus on the entrepreneur, promoting a productive lifestyle rather than a materialistic one wherein the individual is defined by things and not himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/consumerism-defense|title=Consumerism: A Defense - Tibor R. Machan|first=|last=kanopiadmin|date=27 October 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many{{who|date=October 2015}} have accused anti-consumerists of opposing [[modernity]] or [[utilitarianism]]. Right-wing critics see anti-consumerism as rooted in socialism. In 1999, the [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] magazine [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']] attacked anti-consumerism, claiming [[marxism|Marxist]] academics are repackaging themselves as anti-consumerists. [[James B. Twitchell]], a professor at the [[University of Florida]] and popular writer, referred to anti-consumerist arguments as "Marxism Lite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Twitchell |first1=James B. |title=In Praise of Consumerism |date=August 2000 |website=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/27795.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been socialist critics of anti-consumerism who see it as a form of anti-modern "reactionary socialism", and state that anti-consumerism has also been adopted by ultra-conservatives and [[fascism|fascists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varul |first1=Matthias Zick |title=Towards a consumerist critique of capitalism: A socialist defence of consumer culture |journal=Ephemera: Theory &amp; Politics in Organization |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=293–315 |date=May 2013 |url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/towards-consumerist-critique-capitalism-socialist-defence-consumer-culture |issn=1473-2866 |isbn=9781906948177 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular media==
In [[Fight Club]], the protagonist, finds himself participating in terroristic acts against corporate society and consumer culture.

In [[Mr. Robot]], Elliot Anderson, a young cybersecurity engineer, joins a hacker group known as fsociety, which aims to crash the U.S. economy, eliminating all debt.

In the novel [[American Psycho]] by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], the protagonist Patrick Bateman criticizes the consumerist society of America in the 1980s of which he is a personification. Later on he goes on a killing spree  without any consequences, suggesting that the people around him are so self-absorbed and focused on consuming that they either don't see or don't care about his acts.

A '''biosand filter''' (BSF) is a point-of-use water treatment system adapted from traditional [[slow sand filter]]s. Biosand filters remove pathogens and suspended solids from water using biological and physical processes that take place in a sand column covered with a [[biofilm]]. BSFs have been shown to remove heavy metals, turbidity, bacteria, viruses and protozoa.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;Elliott, M., Stauber, C., Koksal, F., DiGiano, F., and M. Sobsey (2008). Reduction of E. coli, echovirus type 12 and bacteriophages in an intermittently operated 2 household-scale slow sand filter.Water Research, Volume 42, Issues 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2008|url=http://itacanet.org/eng/water/Section%206%20Water%20treatment/Biosand_filter_CAWST.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSFs also reduce discoloration, odor and unpleasant taste. Studies have shown a correlation between use of BSFs and a decrease in the occurrence of [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and lack of recurring costs, biosand filters are often considered [[appropriate technology]] in developing countries. It is estimated that over 200,000 BSFs are in use worldwide.&lt;ref name="Elliot" /&gt;

==History==

The household biosand filter was proposed by Dr. David Manz in the late 1980s at the [[University of Calgary]], Canada.&lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST History|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/about-us/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was developed from the [[slow sand filter]], a technology that has been used for drinking water purification since the 1800s.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; Initial lab and field tests were conducted in 1991; the system was patented in 1993 &lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"/&gt; and was implemented in the field in [[Nicaragua]]. The Canadian non-profit company [[Center for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology]] ([[CAWST]]) was co-founded in 2001 by David Manz and [[Camille Dow Baker]] to promote education and training in water purification and sanitation including using this technology, and to continue developing it.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; A privately owned company, Hydraid Biosand Water Filter  produces and distributes plans for filters.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydraid Biosand Technology|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosand filter components==

[[File:Ohorizons Concrete BioSand Filter.png|thumb|Basic Diagram of a Concrete BioSand Filter]]

Biosand filters are typically constructed from concrete or plastic.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; At the top of the filter, a tightly fitted lid prevents contamination and unwanted pests from entering the filter. Below this, the diffuser plate prevents disturbance of the [[biofilm]] when water is poured into the filter. Water then travels through the sand column, which removes pathogens and suspended solids. Below the sand column, a layer of gravel prevents sand from entering the drainage layer and clogging the outlet tube. Below the separating layer is the drainage layer consisting of coarser gravel that prevents clogging near the base of the outlet tube.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt;

== Filtration process ==
Pathogens and suspended solids are removed by biological and physical processes that take place in the biolayer and the sand layer. These processes include:
*'''Mechanical trapping:''' Suspended solids and pathogens are trapped in the spaces between the sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Predation:''' Pathogens are consumed by microorganisms in the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Adsorption:''' Pathogens are absorbed into each other and to suspended solids in the water and sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Natural death:''' Pathogens finish their life cycles or die because there is not enough food or oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===During the run===
The high water level (hydraulic head) in the inlet reservoir zone pushes the water through the diffuser and filter, then decreases as water flows evenly through the sand. The flow rate slows because there is less pressure to force the water through the filter. The inlet water contains dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and contaminants. It provides the oxygen required by the microorganisms in the biofilm. Large suspended particles and pathogens are trapped in the top of the sand and partially plug the pore spaces between the sand grains. This causes the flow rate to decrease.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Pause period (idle time)===

Idle time typically comprises greater than 80% of the daily cycle; during this time, microbial attenuation processes are likely to be significant. Most removal occurs where water is in contact with the biofilm. The processes that occur in the biofilm have not been identified.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; When the standing water layer reaches the level of the outlet tube, the flow stops.  Ideally, this should be high enough to keep the biofilm in the sand layer wet and allow oxygen to diffuse through the standing water to the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; The pause period allows microorganisms in the biolayer to consume the pathogens and nutrients in the water. The rate of flow through the filter is restored as they are consumed. If the pause period is too long, the biolayer will consume all of the pathogens and nutrients and will die, reducing the efficiency of the filter when it is used again. The pause period should be between 1 and 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Pathogens in the non-biological zone die from a lack of nutrients and oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

==Maintenance==
Over time, particles accumulate between the filter's sand grains. As more water is poured, a biofilm forms along the top of the diffuser plate. Both of these occurrences cause a decrease in flow rate (clogging and [[bioclogging]]). Although slower flow rates generally improve water filtration due to idle time [APS1], it may become too slow for the users’ convenience. If flow rates fall below 0.1 litres/minute, it is recommended by CAWST to perform maintenance.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; The "swirl and dump", or wet harrowing cleaning technique, is used to restore flow rate. About {{Convert|1|USgal|l}} is poured into the filter before cleaning (assuming the filter is empty). The upper layer of sand is then swirled in a circular motion. Dirty water from the swirling is dumped out and the sand is smoothed out at the top. This process is repeated until flow rate is restored.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Cleaning the diffuser plate, outlet tube, lid, and outside surfaces of the filters regularly is also recommended.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Long-term sustainability and efficacy of biosand filters depends on education and support from knowledgeable support personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sisson|first=Andrew J.|author2=Wampler, PJ |author3=Rediske RR |author4= Molla AR |title=An assessment of long-term biosand filter use and sustainability in the Artibonite Valley near Deschapelles, Haiti|journal=Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|date=January 2013|volume=3|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.2166/washdev.2013.092|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/washdev/003/washdev0030051.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit in Haiti implements an education and follow-up program post-installation of the biosand filter. The program includes visits to the beneficiary homes after one, three and twelve months and another at 5 years from installation date. During each visit, beneficiaries receive repeated instruction about safe water practices and how to take care of the filter. Based on data collected since 2010, between 94% and 99% of filters are still being used regularly 12 months after installation. &lt;ref&gt;cleanwaterforhaiti.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal of contaminants==

===Turbidity===
Results for turbidity reductions vary depending on the turbidity of the influent water. Turbid water contains sand, silt and clay.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt;  Feed turbidity in one study ranged from 1.86 to 3.9 NTU.  In a study water was obtained from sample taps of water treatment plants from three local reservoirs. It poured through a slow sand filter and results showed that turbidity decreased to a mean of 1.45 NTU.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; In another study using surface water a 93% reduction in turbidity was observed.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; As the biofilm above the sand ripens, turbidity removal increases.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Although biosand filters remove much turbidity, slow sand filters, which have a slower filtration rate, remove more.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Heavy metals===
There is limited research on the removal of heavy metals by biosand filters.  In a study conducted in South Africa, the filter removed about 64% of iron and 5% of magnesium.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"&gt;Mwabi, J.K., F.E. Adeyemo and T.O. Mamba. "Household Water Treatment Systems: A Solution to the Production of Safe Drinking." SAO/NASA ADS: ADS Home Page. Web. 22 Dec. 2011. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PCE....36.1120M&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
In laboratory studies, the biosand filter has been found to remove about 98-99% of bacteria.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; In removal of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' it was found that the biosand filter may increase due to biofilm formation over about two months. The removal after this time ranged from 97-99.99% depending on the daily water volume and percent primary effluent added. The addition of primary effluent or waste water facilitates growth of the biofilm which aids bacterial die-off.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Research shows that biosand filters in use in the field remove fewer bacteria than ones in a controlled environment.  In research conducted in 55 households of [[Bonao]], Dominican Republic, the average E. coli reduction was about 93 percent.&lt;ref name="Stauber"/&gt;

===Viruses===
Lab tests have shown that while the filters reduce significant quantities of  E. coli, they remove significantly fewer viruses because viruses are smaller.  In a study using bacteriophages, virus removal ranged between 85% and 95% after 45 days of usage.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; A recent study has suggested that virus removal increases significantly over time, reaching 99.99% after approximately 150 days.&lt;ref name="Virus Removal"&gt;Bradley, I., Straub, A., Maraccini, P., Markazi, Nguyen, T., (2011).  Iron Oxide Amended Biosand Filters for Virus Removal.  Water Research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protozoa===
In one lab test the biosand filter removed more than 99.9% of [[protozoa]].  In tests for one type of protozoa, ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', the filter removed 100% over 29 days of use. It removed 99.98% of the oocysts of another protozoa, ''Cryptosporidium sp.'', possibly due to their smaller size.  This removal was comparable with that of the slow sand filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/point-use-water-treatment/bio-sand-filtrat|title=Biosand Filter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health benefits ==

Studies in the Dominican Republic and Cambodia conducted by the [[University of North Carolina]] and the University of Nevada show that BSF use the reduced occurrence of diarrheal diseases by 47% in all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stauber|first=Christine|author2=Gloria M. Ortiz |author3=Dana P. Loomis |author4=Mark D. Sobsey |title=A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Concrete Biosand Filter and Its Impact on Diarrheal Disease in Bonai, Dominican Republic|journal=The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2009|volume=80|issue=2|pages=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by CAWST in Haiti, 95% of 187 households believed their water quality had improved since using biosand filters to clean it. 80% of users stated that their families’ health had improved since implementation. Such health perceptions on the use of biosand filter has shown to be more positive in long-term users.&lt;ref name="Stauber"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobsey|first=Mark|author2=Christine Stauber |author3=Lisa Casanova |author4=Joseph Brown |author5=Mark Elliott |title=Point of Use Household Drinking Water Filtration: A Practical, Effective Solution for Providing Sustained Access to Safe Drinking Water in the Developing World|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|year=2008|doi=10.1021/es8026133 |volume=43 |pages=970–971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of biosand filters==

===Concrete===

[[Concrete]] filters, of concrete, are the most widespread type of biosand filter.  Concrete is generally preferable to other materials because of the low cost, wide availability and the ability to be constructed on-site. The plans for the concrete filter are distributed openly by CAWST. Several versions have been developed. The CAWST Version 9 biosand filter is constructed with a higher maximum loading rate. Although the filtered water passes EPA water quality standards, it is not optimal.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2010|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/pubs/file/43-pi-for-bsf-manual-complete-english}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research establishes that contact time between the water and the granular material is the leading determinant in purifying water. The CAWST Version 10 biosand filter takes this into account; the volume of the water reservoir is equal to the pore space volume of the sand layer. The maximum loading rate was decreased by 33% to ensure stagnant water is in constant contact with granular material.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"/&gt;

Concrete BioSand filters are typically manufactured using steel molds. The plans for a steel mold are openly distributed by CAWST.

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit organization based in Camp Marie, Haiti manufactures the biosand filters using an adaptation of the steel mold.  &lt;ref&gt;http://cleanwaterforhaiti.org/programs/how-does-the-filter-work/&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-profit organization OHorizons has designed a Wood Mold, based on CAWST’s Version 10 filter, which can function as low-cost alternative. The plans for a Wood Mold are openly available on the OHorizons website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohorizons.org/resources/ OHorizons Wood Mold Construction Manual and Appendix]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic===

Plastic filters are constructed from plastic barrels, usually formed offsite. Hydraid biosand filters are constructed from medical grade plastic with [[ultraviolet]] resistance.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; TivaWater is the newest version of the plastic biosand filter and has several important improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tivawater.com tivawater.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stainless steel===

A stainless steel biosand filter developed by engineers at [[S M Sehgal Foundation]], an NGO based in Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon), India, has been found to perform better than its concrete counterparts and with a wider opportunity for application and adoption in different geographical conditions. The high cost of plastic prevents its use in rural India. The stainless steel filter, called JalKalp, offers increased filtration rate and better portability (than concrete models) and better production quality control. Concrete filters are prone to breakage and can be difficult to transport due to weight (65&amp;nbsp;kg), make it unsuitable especially in remote rural or hilly locations. Common quality issues are variations in construction material and manufacturing flaws. Further, the efflorescence due to salts in water reduces the life of the concrete filter. The newly developed lightweight (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg) stainless steel biosand filter has an edge over concrete filters, overcoming each of those shortcomings and providing better quality control. Besides improving its appearance, stainless steel adds to the strength, reliability, durability, and portability of the filter. Water quality tests demonstrate JalKalp's effectiveness against E coli, total coliforms, turbidity, and iron contamination. This filter integrates the germicidal properties of copper with the conventional filtration. Introduction of copper foil in the drainage zone of JalKalp filter has increased the removal of total coliform and E coli to 100% from contaminated water. S M Sehgal Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the model, which required no electricity, across India through partnerships with like-minded organizations to benefit as many rural families as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Lalit Mohan Sharma and Saurabh Sood, "Reinventing the Biosand Filter: An Easy Solution for Safe Drinking Water," ''IOSR Journals'', International Organization of Scientific Research, Vol 10. Issue 1, pp43-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Reinventing-the-biosand-filter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/jalkalp-water-sands-impurities /|title=JalKalp: Water sands impurities|last=Bhaduri|first=Amita|publisher= “India Water Portal” 13, November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are challenges to creating biosand water filters in developing countries.  Many lack the professional capability of constructing the metal forms to pour the concrete into. Finding proper mesh sizes to sift the sand layers may also be absent.  In Nicaragua you may find metal workers capable of welding rebar for home construction, however, you will not find sheet metal bending equipment to create the metal molds.  Sand is not sold in hardware stores like in the United States. It is most likely purchased by the pickup load from streambeds or pits and the only mesh available is 1/4 inch which is too large. When traveling to a third world country it might be best to take with you the proper mesh screens.

Another problem facing the use of the filters is adoption. Many projects may provide assistance in building the water filters and some may even distribute them but getting the host country nationals to use the filters requires much more dedication.  People need to be connected to water filter owners to insist they use the devices and get them into the habit of using them.  Otherwise several of the filters are abandoned and left unattended in the roads. Simply handing the filters out is insufficient for adoption.

'''CLAGS: The Center for LGBTQ Studies''' (formerly known as ''Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies'' or ''CLAGS'')&lt;ref name="Duberman"&gt;{{cite web | last=Duberman | first= Martin | title= The First Ten Years| url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/632172|website=Muse.jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QM"&gt;{{cite web | last=Nadal| first=Kevin| title=The Intersection of Queer Theory and Empirical Methods: Visions for CLAGS, the Center for LGBTQ Studies|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/632171|website=Muse.jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1991 by professor [[Martin Duberman]] as the first university-based research center in the United States dedicated to the study of historical, cultural, and political issues of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) individuals and communities. Housed at the [[Graduate Center, CUNY]], CLAGS sponsors public programs and conferences, offers fellowships to individual scholars, and functions as a conduit of information.&lt;ref name="QM"/&gt; It also serves as a national center for the promotion of scholarship that fosters social change.&lt;ref name="Duberman"/&gt;

The center is located at the Graduate Center of the [[City University of New York]], 365 Fifth Avenue, in [[New York City]]. Past executive directors include [[Martin Duberman]], Alissa Solomon, Jill Dolan, [[Paisley Currah]], Sarah Chinn, James Wilson, and [[Kevin Nadal]]. Nadal was the first person of color to hold the Executive Director role. The current Executive Director is Justin Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clags.org/event/clags-25th-anniversary-conference/|title=CLAGS 25th Anniversary Conference – CLAGS: Center for LGBTQ Studies|website=Clags.org|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1108128940800&amp;ca=d82c4cd8-a4fd-4363-840e-f5fd76c899b8|title=Letter from CLAGS Outgoing Director|website=Campaign.r20.constantcontact.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CLAGS Board.jpg|thumb|CLAGS board and staff at 25th Anniversary Conference]]

CLAGS also provides scholarships and fellowships to members of the LGBTQ community. Some awards include the [[Robert Giard]] fellowship for visual arts (photography and videography), the [[Sylvia Rivera]] award for best paper in Transgender Studies, the Kessler Award for lifetime contributions to LGBTQ Studies, and the [[José Esteban Muñoz]] Award for activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= CLAGS' Fellowships and Awards| url=http://www.clags.org/fellowships-awards/#r_judith-butler|website=Clags.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the center commemorated its 25th anniversary with a conference that reunited its Founders and past executive directors, as well as a celebration at New York City's [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nadal| first=Kevin| title= Why Queer and Trans Studies are Important | url =http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/9350064|website=M.huffpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CLAGS was founded by [[Martin Duberman]] - a professor of History at the [[Graduate Center, CUNY]]. Many of CLAGS founders claim that initial conversations about a research institute on lesbian and gay people began in Duberman's living room in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Dolan| first =Jill | title= Geographies of Learning: Theory and Practice, Activism and Performance | url =

[[File:Duberman CLAGS.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Duberman]], CLAGS Founder, speaking at CLAGS 25th Anniversary Conference on March 4, 2016]]

In 1986, Duberman described how there was an increase in literature and research on lesbian and gay people. "My aim was political as well as intellectual: I felt that lesbian and gay scholars had much to tell the mainstream world about gender and sexuality and that their findings needed to be widely disseminated, not least as a way to contest right-wing propaganda about homosexuality as degenerate and criminal."&lt;ref name="Duberman"/&gt; Duberman also described the intentionality of gender parity, in that they attempted to ensure that both lesbian women and gay men were included in the leadership and membership of the center.&lt;ref name="Duberman"/&gt;

In 2004, [[Jonathan Ned Katz]] founded [[OutHistory]], a website dedicated to documenting and preserving [[LGBTQ]] [[History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/police-records-document-the-stonewall-uprising/|title=Police Records Document Start of Stonewall Uprising|first=Sewell|last=Chan|website=Cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding was received by the [[Arcus Foundation]], which enabled CLAGS to develop and host the site. Eventually, [[John D'Emilio]] redesigned the site and housed it at [[University of Illinois, Chicago]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/about-outhistory|title=About OutHistory |website=Outhistory.org|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, CLAGS was renamed CLAGS: The Center for LGBTQ Studies, in an effort to be inclusive of all sexualities and genders - in addition to just lesbians and gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Announcing the Renaming of CLAGS | url = https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw-xLnaJBgkocDdVR3NGaWpjTFk/view|website=Drive.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NadalMock.jpg|thumb|[[Kevin Nadal]] &amp; [[Janet Mock]] at CLAGS 2015 Munoz Award]]

That same year, CLAGS founded the LGBTQ Scholars of Color network, which aims to connect and advance LGBTQ people of color in academia, scholarship, and research.&lt;ref name="QM"/&gt; The inaugural LGBTQ Scholars of Color Conference gathered 200 attendees at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].&lt;ref name="CLAGS 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= CLAGS Annual Report 2014-2015 | url = http://www.clags.org/downloads/Annual_Report/CLAGS_Annual_Report_14_15_web2.pdf|format=PDF|website=Clags.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, CLAGS celebrated their 25th anniversary at the CUNY Graduate Center. A special issue in [[Women's Studies Quarterly]] highlighted the history of CLAGS in their issue on [[Queer]] Methods, featuring reflections by founder [[Martin Duberman]],&lt;ref name="Duberman"/&gt; former Executive Director Jill Dolan,&lt;ref name="Dolan"/&gt; and then Executive Director [[Kevin Nadal]].&lt;ref name="QM"/&gt;

==Kessler Award==
CLAGS' most prestigious award is the annual {{Wikidata entity link|Q57076666}}, which is given to an individual who has contributed significantly to LGBTQ Studies.&lt;ref name="Kessler"&gt;{{cite web | title= Description of CLAGS Annual Kessler Award| url=http://www.clags.org/event-categories/annual-kessler-lecture|website=Clags.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past winners of the Kessler Award include: [[Joan Nestle]], [[Martin Duberman]], [[Susan Stryker]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Jonathan Ned Katz]], [[Cathy J. Cohen]], [[Edmund White]], [[Barbara Smith]], [[Cheryl Clarke]], [[Richard Fung]], [[Sarah Schulman]], [[Gayle Rubin]], [[John D'Emilio]], [[Urvashi Vaid]], [[Monique Wittig]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Isaac Julien]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Douglas Crimp]], Carole Vance, and John Nestle.&lt;ref name="Kessler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Complete List of CLAGS Kessler Winners" | url=http://www.clags.org/fellowships-awards/#r_judith-butler|website=Clags.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Kessler winner was [[Dean Spade]], whose talk was titled "When We Win We Lose: Mainstreaming and the Redistribution of Respectability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title="2016 Kessler Award Winner: Dean Spade | url=http://www.clags.org/event/kessler-award-2016/|website=Clags.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Munoz Award==
[[José Esteban Muñoz]] was a Professor of [[Cultural Studies]] and [[Queer Studies]] at [[New York University]]. He was also a board member of CLAGS in the early 2000s. When Munoz passed away unexpectedly in 2013, CLAGS created the Munoz Award in honor of an LGBTQ activist who has promoted LGBTQ Studies in their own work. The recipient of the award engages in a public conversation with the CLAGS executive director on topics related to LGBTQ communities.

[[File:Nadal-Vargas.jpg|thumb|The 2016 CLAGS Munoz Award featuring a conversation with [[Kevin Nadal]] and [[Jose Antonio Vargas]]]]

In 2015, CLAGS presented its inaugural Munoz Award to [[Janet Mock]]. In this conversation, Mock discussed her new book ''[[Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love &amp; So Much More]]'', the increase of murders of transgender women of color, and intersectional identities.&lt;ref name="CLAGS 2015"/&gt;

In 2016, the award was given to [[Jose Antonio Vargas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/All-GC-Events/Calendar/Detail?id=34639|title=LGBTQ Pride Month: A Conversation with Jose Antonio Vargas|website=Gc.cuny.edu|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event took place just 9 days after the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]] at [[Pulse (nightclub)]]. In addition to the tragedy, Nadal and Vargas discussed issues related to immigration, race, and social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= "LGBTQ Pride Month: A Conversation with Jose Antonio Vargas" | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Phi5MC_9X9o}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 Munoz Award winners were [[Wilson Cruz]], [[Frenchie Davis]], and [[Nathan Lee Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://americanstudiescp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2017/05/02/june-20-jose-munoz-award-wilson-cruz-frenchie-davis-nathan-lee-graham/|title=June 20 - José Muñoz Award: Wilson Cruz, Frenchie Davis, Nathan Lee Graham – American Studies Certificate Program|website=Americanstudiescp.commons.gc.cuny.edu|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==
CLAGS hosts at least one conference a year- focusing on a range of topics like "Lesbians in the 1970s" to "Gay American History". In 2015, CLAGS hosted the first Queers and Comics conference. The keynote speaker were [[Alison Bechdel]] and [[Howard Cruse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clags.org/queers-comics|title=Queers &amp; Comics Conference – CLAGS: Center for LGBTQ Studies|website=Clags.org|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CLAGS panel.jpg|thumb|Panel at CLAGS 25th Anniversary Conference, with Matt Brim, Yana Calou, [[Darnell L. Moore]], and Jessie Daniels]]

One of the CLAGS early conferences was held in 1995. It was titled "Lesbian and Gay History," and [[Susan Stryker]] discussed her experience the conference as a reference point of the climate of the LGBT community during the early transgender movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stryker |first=Susan |chapter=(De)Subjugated Knowledges: An Introduction to Transgender Studies |editor1-last=Stryker |editor1-first=Susan |editor2-last=Whittle |editor2-first=Stephen |title=The Transgender Studies Reader |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-415-94708-4 |location=New York, New York |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first LGBTQ Scholars of Color National Conference was in 2015. Keynote speakers of the inaugural conference include [[Geena Rocero]], Tania Israel, and [[David Malebranche]]. The conference was coordinated by [[Kevin Nadal]] and Debra Joy Perez.

In 2016, CLAGS hosted the "After Marriage" conference - a gathering of hundreds to discuss the state of LGBTQ communities after [[Obergefell v. Hodges]], the 2015 [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision which legalized [[same-sex marriage in the United States]].

The "Seminars in the City" series was created in the late 1990s, as a way of offering [[Queer Studies]] to the general public. Historically, these seminars have been taught by professors affiliated with CLAGS, and these were initially held at [[A Different Light (bookstore)|A Different Light]] bookstore in Chelsea.&lt;ref name="Dolan"&gt;{{cite web| last=Dolan| first=Jill| title = "Transitions, Tensions, Trade-Offs: CLAGS from 1996–1999" | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/632169|website=Muse.jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Topics have included "Lesbian Lives, Theories, and Herstories"; "Queer Sex Work in the City"; and "Bringing Queer to the K-12 Classroom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clags.org/event-categories/seminars-in-the-city/|title=Seminars in the City – CLAGS: Center for LGBTQ Studies|website=Clags.org|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT)''' in Singapore is a Research Centre of Excellence&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrf.gov.sg/programmes/research-centres-of-excellence Singapore National Research Foundation, CQT]&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by the [[National University of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nus.edu.sg/dpr/researchNUS/research-capabilities.html NUS Research Capabilities] &lt;/ref&gt; The Centre brings together physicists, computer scientists and engineers to do basic research on quantum physics and to build devices based on quantum phenomena. Experts in [[Quantum technology|quantum technologies]] are applying their discoveries in computing, communications and sensing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quantumlah.org/main/aboutus.php About CQT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
The mission of CQT is to conduct interdisciplinary theoretical and experimental research in quantum theory and its application to [[information processing]]. The discovery that [[quantum physics]] allows fundamentally new modes of information processing has required that classical theories of computation, information and cryptography be superseded by their quantum generalizations. These hold out the promise of faster computation and more secure communication than is possible classically. A key focus of CQT is the development of quantum technologies for the coherent control of individual photons and atoms, exploring both the theory and the practical possibilities of constructing quantum-mechanical devices for [[cryptography]] and [[computation]].

==History==
Research in [[quantum information science]] in Singapore began in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quantumlah.org/main/aboutus.php About CQT]&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated by Kwek Leong Chuan, [[Lai Choy Heng]], Oh Choo Hiap and Kuldip Singh as a series of informal seminars at the National University of Singapore. The seminars attracted local researchers and as a result, the Quantum Information Technology Group (informally referred to in [[Singlish]] as "quantum [[Singlish#Lah|lah]]") was formed.

In February 2002, with support from Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research ([[A*STAR]]), research efforts in the field were consolidated. This led to a number of faculty appointments. In 2007 the Quantum Information Technology Group was selected as the core of Singapore's first Research Centre of Excellence. The Centre for Quantum Technologies was founded in December 2007 with $158 million to spend over ten years. 

The Centre for Quantum Technologies is funded by the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)#National Research Foundation|Singapore National Research Foundation]] and the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]]. It is hosted by the National University of Singapore, but has significant autonomy both in pursuing its research goals and in governance. The Centre has its own Governing Board, a Scientific Advisory Board and is headed by Director [[Artur Ekert]].

'''Chromosomal instability''' (CIN) is a type of [[genome instability|genomic instability]] in which [[chromosomes]] are unstable, such that either whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes are duplicated or deleted. The unequal distribution of DNA to daughter cells upon [[mitosis]] results in a failure to maintain euploidy (the correct number of [[chromosomes]]) leading to [[aneuploidy]] (incorrect number of chromosomes).  In other words, the daughter cells do not have the same number of chromosomes as the cell they originated from.

These changes have been studied in solid tumors, which may or may not be cancerous. CIN is a common occurrence in [[solid tumour|solid]] and [[leukaemia|haematological cancers]], especially [[colorectal cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lengauer C, Kinzler KW, Vogelstein B | title = Genetic instability in colorectal cancers | journal = Nature | volume = 386 | issue = 6625 | pages = 623–7 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9121588 | doi = 10.1038/386623a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many tumours show chromosomal abnormalities, CIN is characterised by an increased rate of these errors.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geigl JB, Obenauf AC, Schwarzbraun T, Speicher MR | title = Defining 'chromosomal instability' | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 64–9 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18192061 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2007.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria for CIN definition==
*As chromosome instability refers to the rate that chromosomes or large portions of chromosomes are changed, there should be comparisons between cells, or cell populations rather than looking at cells individually in order to determine chromosome instability. These differences should be examined statistically as well.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;
*The rates in the cell population being tested should be compared to a reference cell population. This is especially true in low phenotype chromosomal instability,&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; where the changes are subtle.  
*The number of cell divisions undergone by a cell population should be related to the rate of chromosomal change.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;
*A chromosomal instability assay should measure not only whole chromosome change rates, but also the partial chromosomal changes such as deletions, insertions, inversion and amplifications to also take into account segmental aneuploidies.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; This provides a more accurate determination of the presence of chromosome instability. 
*The results from [[polyploid]] and [[diploid]] cells should be identified and separately recorded from one another. This is because the fitness cost (survival to next generation) of chromosomal instability is lower in polyploid cells, as the cell has a greater number of chromosomes to make up for the chromosomal instability it experiences.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;
*Polyploid cells are more prone to chromosomal changes, something that should be taken into account when determining the presence and degree of chromosomal instability &lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;

==Classification==
Numerical CIN is a high rate of either gain or loss of whole chromosomes; causing [[aneuploidy]]. Normal cells make errors in chromosome segregation in 1% of cell divisions, whereas cells with CIN make these errors approximately 20% of cell divisions. Because aneuploidy is a common feature in tumour cells, the presence of aneuploidy in cells does not necessarily mean CIN is present; a high rate of errors is definitive of CIN.&lt;ref name="pmid22595889"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGranahan N, Burrell RA, Endesfelder D, Novelli MR, Swanton C | title = Cancer chromosomal instability: therapeutic and diagnostic challenges | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 528–38 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22595889 | pmc = 3367245 | doi = 10.1038/embor.2012.61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way of differentiating aneuploidy without CIN and CIN-induced aneuploidy is that CIN causes widely variable (heterogeneous) chromosomal aberrations; whereas when CIN is not the causal factor, chromosomal alterations are often more clonal.&lt;ref name="pmid22466654"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakhoum SF, Compton DA | title = Chromosomal instability and cancer: a complex relationship with therapeutic potential | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 122 | issue = 4 | pages = 1138–43 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22466654 | pmc = 3314464 | doi = 10.1172/JCI59954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural CIN is different in that rather than whole chromosomes, fragments of chromosomes may be duplicated or deleted. The rearrangement of parts of chromosomes ([[translocations]]) and amplifications or deletions within a chromosome may also occur in structural CIN.&lt;ref name="pmid22595889"/&gt;

==Effects==
CIN often results in [[aneuploidy]]. There are three ways that aneuploidy can occur. It can occur due to loss of a whole chromosome, gain of a whole chromosome or rearrangement of partial chromosomes known as gross [[chromosomal rearrangement]]s (GCR). All of these are hallmarks of some [[cancers]].&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuen|first=Karen|author2=Wing Yee|title=Chromosome Instability (CIN), Aneuploidy and Cancer|journal=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Segmental aneuploidy can occur due to deletions, amplifications or translocations, which arise from breaks in DNA,&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; while loss and gain of whole chromosomes is often due to errors during mitosis.

==Genome integrity==
Chromosomes consist of the DNA sequence, and the proteins (such as [[histones]]) that are responsible for its packaging into chromosomes. Therefore, when referring to chromosome instability, [[epigenetic]] changes can also come into play. Genes on the other hand, refer only to the DNA sequence (hereditary unit) and it is not necessary that they will be expressed once epigenetic factors are taken into account. Disorders such as chromosome instability can be inherited via genes, or acquired later in life due to environmental exposure. One way that Chromosome Instability can be acquired is by exposure to ionizing radiation.&lt;ref name=five&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Eric G.|title=Inherited and inducible chromosomal instability: a fragile bridge between genome integrity mechanisms and tumourigenesis|journal=The Journal of Pathology|date=1 January 1999|volume=187|issue=1|pages=19–27|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199901)187:1&lt;19::AID-PATH233&gt;3.0.CO;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Radiation is known to cause DNA damage, which can cause errors in cell replication, which may result in chromosomal instability. Chromosomal instability can in turn cause cancer. 
However, chromosomal instability syndromes such as [[Bloom syndrome]], [[ataxia telangiectasia]] and [[Fanconi anaemia]] are inherited &lt;ref name=five /&gt; and are considered to be genetic diseases. These disorders are associated with tumor genesis, but often have a phenotype on the individuals as well. The genes that control chromosome instability are known as chromosome instability genes and they control pathways such as mitosis, DNA replication, repair and modification.&lt;ref name=three&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stirling PC, Bloom MS, Solanki-Patil T, Smith S, Sipahimalani P, Li Z, Kofoed M, Ben-Aroya S, Myung K, Hieter P | title = The complete spectrum of yeast chromosome instability genes identifies candidate CIN cancer genes and functional roles for ASTRA complex components | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e1002057 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21552543 | pmc = 3084213 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also control transcription, and process nuclear transport.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

==Chromosome instability and cancer==
The research associated with chromosomal instability is associated with solid tumors, which are tumors that refer to a solid mass of cancer cells that grow in organ systems and can occur anywhere in the body. These tumors are opposed to liquid tumors, which occur in the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Cancer Institute|title=Definition of Solid Tumors|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=45301|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although chromosome instability has long been proposed to promote tumor progression, recent studies suggest that chromosome instability can either promote or suppress tumor progression.&lt;ref name=one/&gt; The difference between the two are related to the amount of chromosomal instability taking place, as a small rate of chromosomal instability leads to tumor progression, or in other words cancer, while a large rate of chromosomal instability is often lethal to cancer.&lt;ref name=six&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dabas N, Byrnes DM, Rosa AM, Eller MS, Grichnik JM | title = Diagnostic role of chromosomal instability in melanoma | journal = Journal of Skin Cancer | volume = 2012 | pages = 914267 | date = 1 January 2012 | pmid = 23125934 | doi = 10.1155/2012/914267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that a large rate of chromosomal instability is detrimental to the survival mechanisms of the cell,&lt;ref name=six /&gt; and the cancer cell cannot replicate and dies (apoptosis).  Therefore, the relationship between chromosomal instability and cancer can also be used to assist with diagnosis of malignant vs. benign tumors.&lt;ref name=six /&gt;

A majority of human solid malignant tumors is characterized by chromosomal instability, and have gain or loss of whole chromosomes or fractions of chromosomes.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; For example, the majority of colorectal and other solid cancers have chromosomal instability (CIN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michor F, Iwasa Y, Vogelstein B, Lengauer C, Nowak MA | title = Can chromosomal instability initiate tumorigenesis? | journal = Seminars in Cancer Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–9 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15613287 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcancer.2004.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This shows that chromosomal instability can be responsible for the development of solid cancers. However, genetic alterations in a tumor do not necessarily indicate that the tumor is genetically unstable, as ‘genomic instability’ refers to various instability phenotypes, including the chromosome instability phenotype &lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;

The role of CIN in carcinogenesis has been heavily debated.&lt;ref name=Gibbs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibbs|first1=W. Wayt|title=Untangling the Roots of Cancer|journal=Scientific American|date=July 2008|volume=18|pages=30–39|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0708-30sp}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While some argue the canonical theory of [[oncogene]] activation and [[tumor suppressor gene]] inactivation, such as [[Robert Weinberg]], some have argued that CIN may play a major role in the origin of cancer cells, since CIN confers a mutator phenotype&lt;ref name=mutatorphenotype&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loeb|first1=Lawrence A.|title=A Mutator Phenotype in Cancer|journal=Cancer Research|date=2001|volume=61|pages=3230–3239|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/61/8/3230|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that enables a cell to accumulate large number of mutations at the same time. Scientists active in this debate include Christoph Lengauer, Kenneth W. Kinzler, Keith R. Loeb, Lawrence A. Loeb, [[Bert Vogelstein]] and [[Peter Duesberg]].

== Chromosome instability and metastasis ==
Recent work has identified chromosomal instability (CIN) as a genomic driver of metastasis.&lt;ref name="Bakhoum_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakhoum SF, Ngo B, Laughney AM, Cavallo JA, Murphy CJ, Ly P, Shah P, Sriram RK, Watkins TB, Taunk NK, Duran M, Pauli C, Shaw C, Chadalavada K, Rajasekhar VK, Genovese G, Venkatesan S, Birkbak NJ, McGranahan N, Lundquist M, LaPlant Q, Healey JH, Elemento O, Chung CH, Lee NY, Imielenski M, Nanjangud G, Pe'er D, Cleveland DW, Powell SN, Lammerding J, Swanton C, Cantley LC | display-authors = 6 | title = Chromosomal instability drives metastasis through a cytosolic DNA response | journal = Nature | volume = 553 | issue = 7689 | pages = 467–472 | date = January 2018 | pmc = 5785464 | doi = 10.1038/nature25432 | pmid = 29342134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromosome segregation errors during mitosis lead to the formation of structures called micronuclei. These micronuclei, which reside outside of the main nucleus have defective envelopes and often rupture exposing their genomic DNA content to the cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatch EM, Fischer AH, Deerinck TJ, Hetzer MW | title = Catastrophic nuclear envelope collapse in cancer cell micronuclei | journal = Cell | volume = 154 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–60 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23827674 | pmc = 3749778 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure of double-stranded DNA to the cytosol activates anti-viral pathways, such as the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. This pathway is normally involved in cellular immune defenses against viral infections. Tumor cells hijack chronic activation of innate immune pathways to spread to distant organs, suggesting that CIN drives metastasis through chronic inflammation stemming in a cancer cell-intrinsic manner.&lt;ref name="Bakhoum_2018" /&gt;

==Diagnostic methods==
Chromosomal instability can be diagnosed using analytical techniques at the cellular level. Often used to diagnose CIN is cytogenetics [[flow cytometry]], [[Comparative genomic hybridization]] and [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]].&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; [[Karyotyping]], and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) are other techniques that can be used.&lt;ref name="Sakamoto_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sakamoto Hojo ET, van Diemen PC, Darroudi F, Natarajan AT | title = Spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in Fanconi anaemia, ataxia telangiectasia fibroblast and Bloom's syndrome lymphoblastoid cell lines as detected by conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) technique | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 334 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–69 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7799980 | doi = 10.1016/0165-1161(95)90031-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Comparative genomic hybridization, since the DNA is extracted from large cell populations it is likely that several gains and losses will be identified.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; 
Karyotyping is used for Fanconi Anemia, based on 73-hour whole-blood cultures, which are then stained with Giemsa. Following staining they are observed for microscopically visible chromatid-type aberrations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oostra AB, Nieuwint AW, Joenje H, de Winter JP | title = Diagnosis of fanconi anemia: chromosomal breakage analysis | journal = Anemia | volume = 2012 | pages = 238731 | date = 1 January 2012 | pmid = 22693659 | doi = 10.1155/2012/238731 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational creativity''' (also known as '''artificial creativity''', '''mechanical creativity''', '''creative computing''' or '''creative computation''') is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[the arts]].

The goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* To construct a [[computer program|program]] or [[computer]] capable of human-level [[creativity]].
* To better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans.
* To design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves.

The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity. Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity, with one strand of work informing the other.

==Theoretical issues==
As measured by the amount of activity in the field (e.g., publications, conferences and workshops), computational creativity is a growing area of research.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} But the field is still hampered by a number of fundamental problems. Creativity is very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to define in objective terms.  Is it a state of mind, a talent or ability, or a process?   Creativity takes many forms in human activity, some ''eminent'' (sometimes referred to as "Creativity" with a capital C) and some ''mundane''.

These are problems that complicate the study of creativity in general, but certain problems attach themselves specifically to ''computational'' creativity:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* Can creativity be hard-wired? In existing systems to which creativity is attributed, is the creativity that of the system or that of the system's programmer or designer?
* How do we evaluate computational creativity? What counts as creativity in a computational system? Are [[natural language generation]] systems creative? Are [[machine translation]] systems creative? What distinguishes research in computational creativity from research in [[artificial intelligence]] generally?
* If eminent creativity is about rule-breaking or the disavowal of convention, how is it possible for an algorithmic system to be creative? In essence, this is a variant of [[Ada Lovelace]]'s objection to machine intelligence, as recapitulated by modern theorists such as Teresa Amabile.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The social psychology of creativity|first = Teresa|last = Amabile|year = 1983|publisher = New York, NY: Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a machine can do only what it was programmed to do, how can its behavior ever be called ''creative''?

Indeed, not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Why programming is a good medium for expressing poorly understood and sloppily formulated ideas|first=Marvin|last=Minsky|booktitle=Design and Planning II-Computers in Design and Communication|year=1967|pages=120–125|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7511/307c10790f077e66844efd1e37e4f084dd1b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a key point in favor of computational creativity.

==Defining creativity in computational terms==

Because no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity, the AI researchers Newell, Shaw and Simon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The process of creative thinking  | first = Shaw, J. G., and Simon, Herbert A.  |last =  Newell, Allen | year = 1963 | publisher =  H. E. Gruber, G. Terrell and M. Wertheimer (Eds.), Contemporary Approaches to Creative Thinking, pp 63 – 119. New York: Atherton }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multi-pronged view of creativity, one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative:

# The answer is novel and useful (either for the individual or for society)
# The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted
# The answer results from intense motivation and persistence
# The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague

Whereas the above reflects a "top-down" approach to computational creativity, an alternative thread has developed among "bottom-up" computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, such generative neural systems were driven by [[genetic algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, P. M. (1991) [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/140338/ NEUROGEN, musical composition using genetic algorithms and cooperating neural networks], Second International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks: 309-313.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments involving recurrent nets&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = A connectionist approach to algorithmic composition | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 27–43 | doi=10.2307/3679551}}&lt;/ref&gt; were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations.

Concurrent with such research, a number of computational psychologists took the perspective, popularized by [[Stephen Wolfram]], that system behaviors perceived as complex, including the mind's creative output, could arise from what would be considered simple algorithms. As neuro-philosophical thinking matured, it also became evident that language actually presented an obstacle to producing a scientific model of cognition, creative or not, since it carried with it so many unscientific aggrandizements that were more uplifting than accurate. Thus questions naturally arose as to how "rich," "complex," and "wonderful" creative cognition actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaler | first1 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging intelligence and its critical look at us | url = http://newdualism.org/nde-papers/Thaler/Thaler-Journal%20of%20Near-Death%20Studies_1998-17-21-29.pdf | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 21–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial neural networks==

Before 1989, [[artificial neural network]]s have been used to model certain aspects of creativity. Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces. Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network's input parameters.  The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bharucha | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Todd | first2 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 44–53 | doi=10.2307/3679552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M., and Loy, D.G. (Eds.) (1991). Music and connectionism. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, Todd&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M. (1992). A connectionist system for exploring melody space.

extended this work, using the so-called distal teacher approach that had been developed by
Paul Munro,&lt;ref&gt;A dual backpropagation scheme for scalar-reward learning.

PJ Werbos - Decision and Control, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  D. Nguyen and [[Bernard Widrow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee373b/truckbackerupper.pdf The truck backer-upper: An example of self-learning in neural networks].

MI Jordan, DE Rumelhart - Cognitive Science, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In the new approach there are two neural networks, one of which is supplying training patterns to another. 
In later efforts by Todd, a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space, position them on a 2-d plane with a mouse-based graphic interface, and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies, and listen to the new "interpolated" melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the 2-d plane.

More recently a neurodynamical model of [[semantic network]]s has been developed to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. It was demonstrated that [[semantic neural network]]s  that have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind – its capacity for creative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Marupaka, Nagendra, and Ali A. Minai. "Connectivity and creativity in semantic neural networks." Neural Networks (IJCNN), The 2011 International Joint Conference on. IEEE, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key concepts from the literature==
Some high-level and philosophical themes recur throughout the field of computational creativity.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}

===Important categories of creativity===
Margaret Boden&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Creative Mind: Myths and Mechanisms  | first = Margaret  |last =  Boden | year = 1990 | publisher = London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Computational models of creativity. | first = Margaret |last = Boden | year = 1999 | publisher = Handbook of Creativity, pp 351&amp;ndash;373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  refers to creativity that is novel ''merely to the agent that produces it'' as "P-creativity" (or "psychological creativity"), and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel ''by society at large'' as "H-creativity" (or "historical creativity"). Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls "V-" or "Visceral creativity" wherein significance is invented to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture, with the "gateway" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations, and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context. An important variety of such V-creativity is consciousness itself, wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activation turnover within the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative computing|url=http://www.apaonline.org/404.asp?aspxerrorpath=/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx#Thaler|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=16 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115232433/http://www.apaonline.org/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx|archivedate=15 November 2012|location=Wayback machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploratory and transformational creativity===
Boden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space, and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space. She labels the former as ''exploratory creativity'' and the latter as ''transformational creativity'', seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former. Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above, we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1), but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well-understood space (criterion 3) -- while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4).  Boden's insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level, providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance. However, Boden's insights are more recently also the subject of formalization, most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Preliminary Framework for Description, Analysis and Comparison of Creative Systems | first = Geraint   |last =  Wiggins | year = 2006 | publisher = Journal of Knowledge Based Systems 19(7), pp. 449-458  |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.581.5208&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generation and evaluation===
The criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative)  constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs are then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creative cognition: Theory, research and applications | first =  Ward, T., and Smith, S. |last = Finke, R.  | year = 1992 | publisher = Cambridge: MIT press.|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/oldmodelling/hi/theses/paulness/appendixd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity.

===Combinatorial creativity===
A great deal, perhaps all, of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre-existing ideas or objects {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include:
*Placing a familiar object in an unfamiliar setting (e.g., [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') or an unfamiliar object in a familiar setting (e.g., a fish-out-of-water story such as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'')
*Blending two superficially different objects or genres (e.g., a sci-fi story set in the Wild West, with robot cowboys, as in ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'', or the reverse, as in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''; Japanese [[haiku]] poems, etc.)
*Comparing a familiar object to a superficially unrelated and semantically distant concept (e.g., "Makeup is the Western [[Burqa|burka]]"; "A [[zoo]] is a gallery with living exhibits")
*Adding a new and unexpected feature to an existing concept (e.g., adding a [[scalpel]] to a [[Swiss Army knife]]; adding a [[camera phone|camera]] to a [[mobile phone]])
*Compressing two incongruous scenarios into the same narrative to get a joke (e.g., the [[Emo Philips]] joke "Women are always using me to advance their careers. Damned anthropologists!")
*Using an iconic image from one domain in a domain for an unrelated or incongruous idea or product (e.g., using the [[Marlboro Man]] image to sell cars, or to advertise the dangers of smoking-related impotence).
The combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations. The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations, or through a rule-based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations. [[Genetic algorithm]]s and [[neural network]]s can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs.

====Conceptual blending====
{{Main article|Conceptual blending}}
Mark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Way We Think|first =  Turner, Mark|last =  Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Conceptual Integration Networks|first =Turner, Mark|last =Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Cognitive Science, 22(2) pp 133–187  }}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ideas about [[The Act of Creation|creativity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title={The act of creation}|last=Koestler|first=Arthur|year=1964|publisher=London: Hutchinson, and New York: Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more recent work by Lakoff and Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|title=Metaphors we live by
|last=Lakoff
|first=George

|year=2008
|publisher=University of Chicago press
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into [[mental space]]s and [[conceptual metaphors]]. Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces:

*A first input space (contains one conceptual structure or mental space)
*A second input space (to be blended with the first input)
*A ''generic space'' of stock conventions and image-schemas that allow the input spaces to be understood from an integrated perspective
*A ''blend space'' in which a selected projection of elements from both input spaces are combined; inferences arising from this combination also reside here, sometimes leading to emergent structures that conflict with the inputs.

Fauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a well-formed integration network. In essence, they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure. This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations.  For example, a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend.

Some computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending pre-existing computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures.&lt;ref name="Veale2007"&gt;{{citation|title = Computation and Blending  | first = O'Donoghue, Diarmuid  |last = Veale, Tony  | year = 2007 | publisher =  Cognitive Linguistics, 11(3-4), special issue on Conceptual Blending }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Francisco Câmara Pereira&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creativity and Artificial Intelligence: A Conceptual Blending Approach | first = Francisco Câmara  |last = Pereira  | year = 2006 | url=http://eden.dei.uc.pt/~camara/AICreativity | publisher =  Applications of Cognitive Linguistics. Amsterdam: Mouton de Gruyter }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from [[GOFAI]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form; his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual, and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining 3-D graphical models.

==Linguistic creativity==
Language provides continuous opportunity for creativity, evident in the generation of novel sentences, phrasings, [[pun]]s, [[neologism]]s, [[rhyme]]s, [[allusion]]s, [[sarcasm]], [[irony]], [[simile]]s, [[metaphor]]s, [[analogy|analogies]], [[witticism]]s, and [[joke]]s. Native speakers of morphologically rich languages  frequently create new [[Word form|word-forms]] that are easily understood, although they will never find their way to the dictionary. The area of [[natural language generation]] has been well studied, but these creative aspects of everyday language have yet to be incorporated with any robustness or scale.

===Story generation===
Substantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the 1970s, with the development of James Meehan's TALE-SPIN
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=TALE-SPIN|first=James|last=Meehan|year=1981|publisher=Shank, R. C. and Riesbeck, C. K., (eds.), ''Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs plus Miniatures''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system. TALE-SPIN viewed stories as narrative descriptions of a problem-solving effort, and created stories by first establishing a goal for the story's characters so that their search for a solution could be tracked and recorded. The MINSTREL&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Creative Process: A Computer Model of Storytelling|first = S.R.|last=Turner|year=1994|publisher =Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system represents a complex elaboration of this basis approach, distinguishing a range of character-level goals in the story from a range of author-level goals for the story. Systems like Bringsjord's BRUTUS&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity. Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine.   | first = Ferrucci, D. A.  |last =  Bringsjord, S. | year = 2000 | publisher = Hillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates }}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborate these ideas further to create stories with complex inter-personal themes like betrayal. Nonetheless, MINSTREL explicitly models the creative process with a set of Transform Recall Adapt Methods (TRAMs) to create novel scenes from old. The MEXICA&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = MEXICA: A computer model of a cognitive account of creative writing  | first = Sharples, Mike  |last = Pérez y Pérez, Rafael  | year = 2001 | publisher =  Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 13, pp 119-139 |url=http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~dan/673/papers/perezyperez.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of Rafael Pérez y Pérez and Mike Sharples is more explicitly interested in the creative process of storytelling, and implements a version of the engagement-reflection cognitive model of creative writing.

The company [[Narrative Science]] makes computer generated news and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game.  It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103192105/http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphor and simile===
Example of a metaphor: ''"She was an ape."''

Example of a simile: ''"Felt like a tiger-fur blanket.''"
The computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledge-based process. Computationalists such as [[Yorick Wilks]], James Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Computational Model of Metaphor Interpretation | first =  James |last =  Martin | year = 1990 | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Fass, John Barnden,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Belief in Metaphor: Taking Commonsense Psychology Seriously  | first =  John  |last = Barnden  | year = 1992 | publisher =   Computational Intelligence 8, pp 520-552}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Lee have developed knowledge-based approaches to the processing of metaphors, either at a linguistic level or a logical level. Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system, called Sardonicus, that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web; these similes are then tagged as bona-fide (e.g., "as hard as steel") or ironic (e.g., "as hairy as a [[bowling ball]]", "as pleasant as a [[endodontic therapy|root canal]]"); similes of either type can be retrieved on demand for any given adjective. They use these similes as the basis of an on-line metaphor generation system called Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Comprehending and Generating Apt Metaphors: A Web-driven, Case-based Approach to Figurative Language|first=Hao, Yanfen|last=Veale, Tony|year=2007|publisher=Proceedings of AAAI 2007, the 22nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vancouver, Canada|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-233.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal (e.g., to describe a supermodel as skinny, the source terms "pencil", "whip", "[[whippet]]", "rope", "[[Phasmatodea|stick-insect]]" and "snake" are suggested).

===Analogy===
The process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective, the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies. The dominant school of research, as advanced by [[Dedre Gentner]], views analogy as a structure-preserving process; this view has been implemented in the [[structure mapping engine]] or SME,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The structure-mapping engine: Algorithm and examples | first = Forbus, Ken and Gentner, Dedre  |last =  Falkenhainer, Brian | year = 1989 | url = http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/papers/Files/smeff2(searchable).pdf| publisher =   Artificial Intelligence, 20(41) pp 1–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MAC/FAC retrieval engine (Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen), ACME ([[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]]) and ARCS ([[Analogical Retrieval Constraint System]]). Other mapping-based approaches include Sapper,&lt;ref name="Veale2007" /&gt; which situates the mapping process in a semantic-network model of memory. Analogy is a very active sub-area of creative computation and creative cognition; active figures in this sub-area include [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Paul Thagard]], and [[Keith Holyoak]]. Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littman's [[machine learning]] approach to the solving of [[SAT]]-style analogy problems; their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests.

===Joke generation===
{{main article|Computational humor}}

Humour is an especially knowledge-hungry process, and the most successful joke-generation systems to date have focussed on pun-generation, as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Children's evaluation of computer-generated punning riddles|first=Pain, H., and Ritchie, G.|last=Binsted, K.|year=1997|publisher=''Pragmatics and Cognition'', 5(2), pp 309&amp;ndash;358|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helen_Pain/publication/2337083_Children%27s_Evaluation_of_Computer--Generated_Punning_Riddles/links/0fcfd5100419c21c7c000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work includes the [[JAPE (software)|JAPE]] system, which can generate a wide range of puns that are consistently evaluated as novel and humorous by young children. An improved version of JAPE has been developed in the guise of the STANDUP system, which has been experimentally deployed as a means of enhancing linguistic interaction with children with communication disabilities. Some limited progress has been made in generating humour that involves other aspects of natural language, such as the deliberate misunderstanding of pronominal reference (in the work of Hans Wim Tinholt and Anton Nijholt), as well as in the generation of humorous acronyms in the HAHAcronym system&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=HAHAcronym: Humorous agents for humorous acronyms|first=Strapparava, Carlo|last=Stock, Oliviero|year=2003|publisher=Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 16(3) pp 297–314|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/5127042/twlt20.pdf#page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava.

===Neologism===
The blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language; these new words are commonly called "blends" or "[[portmanteau word]]s" (after [[Lewis Carroll]]). Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Tracking the Lexical Zeitgeist with Wikipedia and WordNet | first = Tony  |last = Veale  | year = 2006 | publisher =Proceedings of ECAI'2006, the 17th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; that harvests neological [[headword]]s from [[Wikipedia]] and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in [[WordNet]]. ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own; the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet, and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words (e.g., "food traveller" for "gastronaut" and "time traveller" for "[[wikt:chrononaut|chrononaut]]"). It then uses [[Web search]] to determine which glosses are meaningful and which neologisms have not been used before; this search identifies the subset of generated words that are both novel ("H-creative") and useful. [[Neurolinguistics|Neurolinguistic]] inspirations have been used to analyze the process of novel word creation in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Creativity and the Brain, In: A Handbook of Creativity for Teachers.

Ai-Girl Tan|first=Wlodzislaw|last=Duch|year=2007|publisher=World Scientific Publishing, Singapore, pp 507–530|url=http://cogprints.org/5356/1/06-Creativity-Brain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; understand neurocognitive processes responsible for intuition, insight, imagination and creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Intuition, Insight, Imagination and Creativity|first=Wlodzislaw|last=Duch|year=2007|publisher=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2(3) pp 40–52|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duch_Wlodzislaw/publication/3455552_Intuition_Insight_Imagination_and_Creativity/links/0046352b15de1ce647000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to create a server that invents novel names for products, based on their description.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Experiments with computational creativity|first=Duch Wlodzislaw|last=Pilichowski Maciej|year=2007|publisher=Neural Information Processing – Letters and Reviews, 11(4-6) pp 123-133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the system Nehovah&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Nehovah: A Neologism Creator Nomen Ipsum|first=Hintze, R. S., and Ventura, D.|last=Smith, M. R.|year=2014|publisher=Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC 2014), pp 173-181 | url = http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/06//10.1_Smith.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; blends two source words into a neologism that blends the meanings of the two source words. Nehovah searches WordNet for synonyms and TheTopTens.com for pop culture hyponyms. The synonyms and hyponyms are blended together to create a set of candidate neologisms. The neologisms are then scored based on their word structure, how unique the word is, how apparent the concepts are conveyed, and if the neologism has a pop culture reference. Nehovah loosely follows conceptual blending.

Like jokes, poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints, and no general-purpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning, phrasing, structure and rhyme aspects of poetry. Nonetheless, Pablo Gervás&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = An expert system for the composition of formal Spanish poetry|first=Pablo|last=Gervás|year=2001|publisher=Journal of Knowledge-Based Systems 14(3-4) pp 181&amp;ndash;188|url=http://nil.fdi.ucm.es/sites/default/files/gervasjkbs2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a [[case-based reasoning]] (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. [[Meter (poetry)|Metrical]] rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure. [[Racter]] is an example of such a software project.

==Musical creativity==
Computational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians, and on the generation of music for performance by computers. The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of [[Mozart]] and [[Bach]]) and [[jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference, San Francisco: Computer Music Assn.&lt;/ref&gt;  that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ Triumph of the Cyborg Composer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226121804/http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ |date=February 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of contemporary classical music, [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] is the first computer that composes from scratch, and produces final scores that professional interpreters can play. The [[London Symphony Orchestra]] played a piece for full orchestra, included in [[Iamus (album)|Iamus' debut CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Iamus' debut CD|year = 2012|publisher = Melomics Records}}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv4y_BRJokM&amp;feature=relmfu]&lt;/ref&gt; which ''[[New Scientist]]'' described as "The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= New Scientist| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melomics]], the technology behind Iamus, is able to generate pieces in different styles of music with a similar level of quality.

Creativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and planning ahead for what might be played next.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The robot Shimon, developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech, has demonstrated jazz improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121763193|title=A Robot Named Shimon Wants To Jam With You|date=22 December 2009|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual improvisation software based on machine learning models of musical style include OMax, SoMax and PyOracle, are used to create improvisations in real-time by re-injecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from live performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1 = Shlomo | last1 = Dubnov | first2 = Greg | last2 = Surges | title = Delegating Creativity: Use of Musical Algorithms in Machine Listening and Composition | publisher = Newton Lee (Ed.), Digital Da Vinci, Springer | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a Creativity Machine architecture (see above) was able to generate 11,000 musical hooks by training a synaptically perturbed neural net on 100 melodies that had appeared on the top ten list over the last 30 years. In 1996, a self-bootstrapping Creativity Machine observed audience facial expressions through an advanced machine vision system and perfected its musical talents to generate an album entitled "Song of the Neurons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagination-engines.com/iei_son.php|title=Song of the Neurons|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of musical composition, the patented works&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Article de presse : [http://www.realcomposer.com/Medal%20-%20RevuePresse.htm « Génération automatique d'œuvres numériques », article sur l'invention Medal de Béatrice Perret du Cray] », ''[[Science et Vie Micro]]''&lt;/ref&gt; by [[René-Louis Baron]] allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies so-called "coherent" in any musical style. All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters, can influence and develop each of these songs (in real time while listening to the song). The patented invention ''[[René-Louis Baron#Inventor.27s path|Medal-Composer]]'' raises problems of copyright.

==Visual and artistic creativity==
Computational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art. The most famous program in this domain is [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Aaron's Code.|first = Pamela|last=McCorduck|author-link=Pamela McCorduck|year=1991|publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been continuously developed and augmented since 1973. Though formulaic, Aaron exhibits a range of outputs, generating black-and-white drawings or colour paintings that incorporate human figures (such as dancers), potted plants, rocks, and other elements of background imagery. These images are of a sufficiently high quality to be displayed in reputable galleries.

Other software artists of note include the NEvAr system (for "[[neuroevolution|Neuro-Evolutionary]] Art") of Penousal Machado.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Art of Artificial Evolution: A Handbook on Evolutionary Art and Music|first= Machado, Penousal (eds.)|last=Romero, Juan|year = 2008|publisher =  Natural Computing Series. Berlin: Springer Verlag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypdCBD6JrAsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEvAr uses a genetic algorithm to derive a mathematical function that is then used to generate a coloured three-dimensional surface. A human user is allowed to select the best pictures after each phase of the genetic algorithm, and these preferences are used to guide successive phases, thereby pushing NEvAr's search into pockets of the search space that are considered most appealing to the user.

[[The Painting Fool]], developed by [[Simon Colton]] originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles, colour palettes and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as [[AARON]] does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter.

The artist Krasimira Dimtchevska and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rule-based generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;"Methods, systems and software for generating sentences, and visual and audio compositions representing said sentences" Canadian Patent 2704163&lt;/ref&gt; The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color, shape and size palettes. The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or/and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder.

An emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games. ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook. One important aspect is Mechanic Miner, a system which can generate short segments of code which act as simple game mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/introducing-mechanic-miner/|title=Introducing Mechanic Miner|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANGELINA can evaluate these mechanics for usefulness by playing simple unsolvable game levels and testing to see if the new mechanic makes the level solvable. Sometimes Mechanic Miner discovers bugs in the code and exploits these to make new mechanics for the player to solve problems with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/why-i-think-mechanic-miner-is-exciting/|title=Why I Think Mechanic Miner Is Cool|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 [[Google]] released ''[[DeepDream]]'' – an [[Open-source software|open source]]&lt;ref name=github&gt;{{Github|google/deepdream}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer vision program, created to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images, which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic [[pareidolia]], thus creating a dreamlike [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Szegedy  |first2=Wei |last2=Liu |first3=Yangqing |last3=Jia|first4=Pierre |last4=Sermanet|first5=Scott |last5=Reed|first6=Dragomir |last6=Anguelov|first7=Dumitru |last7=Erhan|first8=Vincent |last8=Vanhoucke|first9=Andrew |last9=Rabinovich|title = Going Deeper with Convolutions|journal= Computing Research Repository|year=2014 |arxiv= 1409.4842|bibcode=2014arXiv1409.4842S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codexample&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233542/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|archivedate=2015-07-08|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|title=DeepDream - a code example for visualizing Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 researchers from [[Tübingen, Germany]] created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a [[Picasso]] or [[Van Gogh]] in about an hour. Their algorithm is put into use in the website [[DeepArt]] that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFarland|first1=Matt|title=This algorithm can create a new Van Gogh or Picasso in just an hour|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/08/31/this-algorithm-can-create-a-new-van-gogh-or-picasso-in-just-an-hour/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Culpan|first1=Daniel|title=This algorithm can create an imitation Van Gogh in 60 minutes|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/01/art-algorithm-recreates-paintings|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GitXiv - A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|url=http://gitxiv.com/posts/jG46ukGod8R7Rdtud/a-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style|website=gitxiv.com|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Gatys|first1=Leon A.|last2=Ecker|first2=Alexander S.|last3=Bethge|first3=Matthias|title=A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|arxiv=1508.06576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iqbal |first1=Azlan |last2=Guid  |first2=Matej |last3=Colton |first3=Simon |last4=Krivec |first4=Jana |last5=Azman |first5=Shazril |last6=Haghighi |first6=Boshra |series=SpringerBriefs in Cognitive Computation |title=The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity |publisher=Springer |location=Switzerland |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-28078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects (e.g. chess problems, paintings, music) using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains. The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvub4ug2bM9nlx7VbF5nWhw Chesthetica's YouTube Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity in problem solving==
Creativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in [[problem solving]]. In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], this research area is called [[creative problem solving]]. The Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity has recently been implemented using a [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]]-based computational model that allows for the simulation of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]] in problem solving.&lt;ref name ="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helie | first1 = S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se (as in [[artificial intelligence]] projects) but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments. So far, this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments, insight in problem solving, and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving.

==Debate about "general" theories of creativity==

Some researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it. We can describe not just the agent of creativity as "creative" but also the product and the method. Consequently, it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a ''general theory of creativity''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Nonetheless, some generative principles are more general than others, leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are "general theories". Stephen Thaler, for instance, proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough, and general enough, to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities. Likewise, the Formal Theory of Creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990-2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a simple computational principle published by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J. 1991"&gt;Schmidhuber, J. (1991), [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/170605/ Curious model-building control systems]. In Proc. ICANN, Singapore, volume 2, pp 1458-1463. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory postulates that creativity and [[curiosity]] and [[selective attention]] in general are by-products of a simple [[algorithm]]ic principle for measuring and [[optimizing]] learning progress.

==Criticism of Computational Creativity==
{{Weasel|reason=Broad claims are made which contradict much of the rest of this article, without specific attribution|date=December 2018}}

Traditional computers, as mainly used in the computational creativity application, do not support creativity, as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete, limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete, limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions  {{Citation needed|reason=This does not seem to line up with current approaches in generative AI. What does "limited set of computational functions" mean?|date=November 2018}}. As such, a computer cannot be creative, as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms {{Citation needed|reason=This seems like an opinion, one that uses a very specific definition of creativity, a very narrow definition of "traditional computer", and a fairly fundamental misunderstanding of how generative models actually work|date=November 2018}}. For some related discussions and references to related work are captured in some recent work on philosophical foundations of simulation&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2013). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31140-6_1 Truth, Trust, and Turing–Implications for Modeling and Simulation]. In: Ontology, Epistemology, and Teleology for Modeling and Simulation, pp. 1-26. Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mathematically, the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, G. J. (1987). Algorithmic information theory. Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective. All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity, but it is not real creativity, as nothing new is created, just transformed in well defined algorithms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">'''Constant air volume''' ('''CAV''') is a type of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning ([[HVAC]]) system.  In a simple CAV system, the supply air flow rate is constant, but the supply air temperature is varied to meet the thermal loads of a space.&lt;ref&gt;Systems and Equipment volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2004{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most CAV systems are small, and serve a single thermal zone.  However, variations such as CAV with reheat, CAV multizone, and CAV primary-secondary systems can serve multiple zones and larger buildings.

In mid- to large-size buildings, new central CAV systems are somewhat rare.  Due to fan energy savings potential, [[variable air volume]] (VAV) systems are more common.  However, in small buildings and residences, CAV systems are often the system of choice due to their simplicity, low cost, and reliability.  Such small CAV systems often have ''on/off control'', rather than supply air temperature modulation, to vary their heating or cooling capacities.

There are two types of CAV systems that are commonly in use to modify the supply air temperature: the terminal reheat system and the mixed air system.

The terminal reheat system cools the air in the air handling unit down to the lowest possible needed temperature within its zone of spaces.  This supplies a comfortable quality to the space, but wastes energy.

The mixed air system has two air streams, typically one for the coldest and one for the hottest needed air temperature in the zone.  The two air streams are strategically combined to offset the space's load.  The mixed air system option is not as proficient at controlling the humidity, yet it does do well at controlling the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning, December 1993 p.53-57{{full|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies''' ('''CIMSS''') is a [[research institute]] where scientists study the use of data from [[geostationary]] and [[polar orbit]] [[weather satellite]]s to improve forecasts of [[weather]] (including [[tropical cyclones]] and [[Severe weather|severe storms]]. CIMSS was formed through a Memorandum of Understanding between the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). CIMSS parent organization, the [[Space Science and Engineering Center]] (SSEC) is a primary developer and operator of [[environmental satellite]] technologies.

It is one of 16 NOAA Cooperative Institutes (CIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cooperative Institutes |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/ |accessdate = 2014-04-26 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
CIMSS develops and successfully implements techniques and products for using geostationary and polar-orbiting weather satellite visible and thermal radiation observations to improve [[Weather forecasting|forecasts]] of severe storms, including [[tornado]]es and [[tropical cyclone]]s. CIMSS plays a major role in the transfer of new technology into operational practice. CIMSS scientists conduct research using passive remote sensing systems for meteorological and surface-based applications.

CIMSS also plays a major role in instrument design and testing, and related software development for improved space-based measurements of the Earth's atmosphere. CIMSS is very active in national and international field programs, testing new instrumentation, data processing systems, and assessing the geophysical utility of measurements.

== Current research ==
Current research also focuses on the development and testing of computer-based analysis and forecast techniques that use observations from existing and planned spacecraft and ground-based weather observing systems as part of a national program to greatly improve weather forecast capabilities for the next decade. The optimal use of satellite data in climate and global change studies has become another essential part of the CIMSS mission.

CIMSS serves as an international center for research on the interpretation and uses of operational and experimental satellite observations and remote sensing data acquired from aircraft and the ground. These data are applied to a wide variety of atmospheric and oceanographic studies and evaluated for their potential operational utility. The CIMSS international role is further strengthened through its visiting scientist program that hosts sabbaticals for several foreign scholars each year.

== Staff ==
The CIMSS staff consists of over 100 associates, including administrative staff, principal investigators, federal employees stationed at CIMSS, scientific and programming staff, visiting scientists, and student hourly support. The federal employees consist of the 7 members of the NOAA Advanced Satellite Products Branch, 1 NOAA Office of Research and Applications employee, 1 NOAA Severe Storms Lab employee, and 1 NASA Langley Research Center employee.

A '''crackme''' (often abbreviated by '''cm'''{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}) is a small program designed to test a programmer's [[reverse engineering]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crackmes.de/faq/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714121844/http://www.crackmes.de/faq/ |archivedate=2006-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are programmed by other reversers as a legal way to [[Software cracking|crack]] software, since no [[intellectual property]] is being infringed upon.

Crackmes, '''reversemes''' and '''keygenmes''' generally have similar protection schemes and algorithms to those found in proprietary software. However, due to the wide use of packers/protectors in commercial software,{{Explanation needed|date=December 2016}} many crackmes are actually more difficult as the algorithm is harder to find and track than in commercial software.{{Explanation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Keygenme==
[[File:Kgme.png|right|thumb|An example of a keygenme.]]
A '''keygenme''' is specifically designed for the reverser to not only find the protection algorithm used in the application, but also write a small [[keygen]] for it in the programming language of their choice.

Most keygenmes, when properly manipulated, can be self-keygenning. For example, when checking, they might generate the corresponding key and simply compare the expected and entered keys. This makes it easy to copy the key generation algorithm.

Often anti-debugging and anti-disassemble routines are used to confuse debuggers or make the disassembly useless.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1893&lt;/ref&gt; [[Obfuscation (software)|Code-obfuscation]] is also used to make the reversing even harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palisade.plynt.com/issues/2005Aug/code-obfuscation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021074010/http://palisade.plynt.com/issues/2005Aug/code-obfuscation/ |archivedate=2008-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13098">[[File:Giorgi Latsabidze, University of Southern California, Doctor of Musical Arts.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A graduate student from the [[University of Southern California]] receiving his Doctor of Musical Arts degree in 2011.]]

The '''Doctor of Musical Arts''' ('''D.M.A.''') is a [[doctorates|doctoral]] [[academic degree]] in music. The D.M.A. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually [[Performance|music performance]], [[music composition]], or [[conducting]]) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as [[music history]], [[music theory]], or [[Music education|music pedagogy]]. The D.M.A. degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the master's and bachelor's degrees), preparing students to be professional [[performance|performers]], [[conducting|conductors]], and [[musical composition|composers]]. As a [[terminal degree]], the D.M.A. qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in [[musicology]] or [[music theory]] typically enter a [[Ph.D.]] program, rather than a D.M.A. program.

==Terminology==
The degree is also abbreviated as '''DMA''' (without periods), '''D.Mus.A.''' or '''A.Mus.D.'''. For the related degree [[Doctor of Music]], the abbreviation is '''D.M.''' or '''D.Mus.''' For the related degree [[Doctor of Arts]], the abbreviation '''D.A.''' is used.

==Types==
===Concentrations===
The D.M.A. is widely available in the concentrations of performance (sometimes with a specialization in instrumental or voice pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. Some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title [[Doctor of Music]] (D.M. or D.Mus.) or [[Doctor of Arts]] (D.A.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/music/degree_programs/grad_degrees.html The University of Mississippi – Department of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; or Doctor in Musical Studies (Ph.D.) instead of D.M.A. The D.M.A. degree was pioneered by Howard Hanson and the [[National Association of Schools of Music]], who approved the first D.M.A. programs in 1952. Northwestern University, the University of Michigan, and the Eastman School of Music became the first to offer the D.M.A.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Latimer, "The Nation's First D.M.A. in Choral Music," ''Journal of Historical Research in Music Education'', 32.1 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Boston University]] offered its first D.M.A. program in 1955. In 2005, Boston University also expanded into [[online music education]] by launching the first online doctoral degree in music, a D.M.A. program (along with a [[Master of Music]] program) in [[music education]].&lt;ref&gt;As of November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of U.S. institutions offer the D.M.A. degree in the 2010s. The Ph.D. is generally considered to be more research oriented, while other doctorates may  place more emphasis on practical applications and/or include a performance component. Such distinctions among degree types are not always so clear-cut, however. For instance, most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written [[dissertation]], regardless of degree designation. The music education degree can be a D.M.A. or Ph.D.  Also, music education Ph.D. programs may include performance-oriented tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida State University – Conducting Degrees|url=http://www.music.fsu.edu/Areas-of-Study/Conducting/Degree-Programs|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In composition, one may study for either the D.M.A. or the Ph.D., depending on the institution. The Ph.D. is the standard doctorate in [[music theory]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], and [[ethnomusicology]].
===Sacred music===
A related program is the Doctor of Sacred Music (D.S.M.), also ''Sacrae Musica Doctor'' (S.M.D.), which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music, choral conducting and organ performance.  In the past, some seminaries titled the degree Doctor of Church Music (D.C.M.).  Only one U.S. institution, [[Claremont Graduate University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claremont Graduate University – Doctor of Church Music|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/8740.asp|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; still offers the D.C.M. degree, in addition to the more typical D.M.A.  The vast majority of U.S. seminaries have closed their music doctorate programs, but some still offer a Master of Arts or Master of Sacred Music degree. A new program offered at [[Perkins School of Theology]] is the Doctor of Pastoral Music (D.P.M.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smu.edu/Perkins/FacultyAcademics/degrees/dpm/Apply Perkins School of Theology – Doctor of Ministry Program]&lt;/ref&gt;  While more theology-based and housed within the [[Doctor of Ministry]] (D.Min.) program, admission to the degree requires applicants to hold a Master of Music (M.Mus.), Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.), Master of Church Music (M.C.M.), M.A. in Church Music or equivalent 48 semester hour degree recognized by the National Association of Schools of Music.

==Components==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
D.M.A. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons or mentoring with a professor or instructor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many D.M.A. programs, all of the different D.M.A. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses. Many D.M.A. programs require students to pass a [[comprehensive exam]] on their area of specialization and on subjects such as music history and music theory. The last stage of the D.M.A. degree is usually the completion of a [[thesis]], [[dissertation]], or research project and the performance of [[recital]]s, usually including at least one lecture-recital.

Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area within music, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing a D.M.A. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history or Baroque-era dance.

Some institutions permit D.M.A. students to do a sub-specialization in a field ''outside'' music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a D.M.A. in [[piano pedagogy]] may be able to do a sub-specialization in the university's department of psychology (e.g., on the psychology of learning and memory); a student completing a D.M.A. in electronic composition may be permitted to do a sub-specialization in the department of [[computer engineering]] (e.g., in computer programming).

While teaching experience is not an official part of most D.M.A. programs, most D.M.A. candidates will have the opportunity to work as a [[teaching assistant]] or lecturer for undergraduate students during their degree, either as a requirement of their scholarship/assistantship package or as a part-time employee of the university. D.M.A. students can teach in an area related to their D.M.A. program, or, if they have multiple skill areas (e.g., a person with an M.Mus. in piano performance who is doing a D.M.A. in composition), they may teach in another area.

==Admission requirements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
To be admitted to a D.M.A. degree program, most institutions require a master's degree, such as a M.Mus. degree or an M.A. degree in music or an equivalent course of study, usually with a grade average of "B+" or higher. D.M.A. programs in performance usually require applicants to prepare solo literature that is the equivalent of a graduate recital—i.e. several advanced pieces from a wide range of styles—in addition to orchestral excerpts. Admission to doctoral programs in conducting often require a video recording of live rehearsals and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings of live performances. Programs in music education generally require two or more years of public school (or similar) teaching experience, and may further require an example of scholarly writing.

Newly admitted D.M.A. students are usually required to pass a series of diagnostic tests in music history, theory, and sometimes ear-training to confirm thorough command of essential musical principles gained in prior study. Advanced courses in these areas are not permitted until the tests are passed and/or remedial coursework in deficient area(s) is completed. Often, the knowledge of a second language – one of languages of major influence in music history (such as German, French, Italian, Spanish, or Russian) – is required to complete the degree. The graduate admissions branch of many US universities require applicants to complete the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE), a standardized test of abstract thinking skills in the areas of math, vocabulary, and analytical writing. While the outcome of the GRE test may affect an applicant's eligibility for some university-wide scholarships, it does not always affect admission to the music program of the university.

== Brief history ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
After World War II, there had been a sharp rise in music education at the university level. As was the case with many occupations, the music world was experiencing an unprecedented number of discharged musicians from the U.S. Armed Forces. The G.I. Bill was an impetus for many opting for college, causing a spike in demand for college professors, across all disciplines, and a spike in enrollment. In music education, universities had an opportunity to employ formidable musicians, but many, including those of international rank, lacked a terminal academic degree that would put them on equal footing with professors. Post World War II also a period of rise the quality of comprehensive music education at universities. The Nation's renowned conservatories, such as [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] and [[Curtis Institute of Music|Curtis]], at the time, saw no need for the degree – yet many [[alumni]] of those institutions, and many top musicians with no degree were the very people being sought by universities offering degrees in music and music education.

In 1952, after six years of deliberation, the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] (NASM) approved thirty-two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work "in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided." The NASM was, and still is, the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the [[American Council on Education]]. In 1952, 143 music schools had already established standards for undergraduate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;"NTSTC One of 32 Colleges for Graduate Study in Music", ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', December 31, 1942, Sec I, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The national launch of DMA by institutions meeting criteria was 1953.

The Dean of the [[University of Rochester]] [[Eastman School of Music]], Howard Harold Hanson (1896–1981), who had been awarded an honorary doctorate in 1925, was one of several high-profile advocates of creating a performance oriented doctors degree.

In 1953, he published a proposal for a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, which was roundly criticized by Paul Henry Lang, PhD, professor of musicology at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Degrees to Musicians – Dissenters Claim Title Not Necessary", ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'', November 15, 1953, p. 9F&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kink porn shoot 09.jpg|thumb|280px|Public humiliation of a woman]]

'''Erotic humiliation''' is [[consent (BDSM)|consensual]] psychological [[humiliation]] performed in order to produce erotic excitement or [[sexual arousal]]. This can be for either the person(s) being humiliated and demeaned or the person(s) humiliating, or both. It is sometimes performed before spectators, including pornography and [[webcam]] viewers. It may be part of [[Bondage (BDSM)|BDSM]] and other [[sexual roleplay]], or accompanied by the sexual stimulation of the genitals (or other erotic region) of one or both parties in the activity.

Humiliation is a subjective issue, and is dependent on context. It does not need to be sexual in nature; as with many other sexual activities, it is the feelings that are obtained from the experience that are desired, regardless of the nature of the actual activity. Usually there is a feeling of [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|submission]] for the person being humiliated, and [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|dominance]], for the person implementing the humiliation. Erotic humiliation can be done verbally and/or physically, and can take place privately or publicly. Some individuals assume an acting role and others prefer to be spoken to in a degrading way. A classic technique that can be used to put the submissive into a [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]] mind space is to humiliate them while also providing them with sexual stimulation. Select individuals who desire this form of humiliation also use it to acquire emotional release. Humiliation can become [[ritual]]ized, and unlike some sexual variations, it can also be easily carried out over a long distance (such as [[online]]).

While fantasy and fascination with erotic humiliation is a prevalent part of BDSM and other sexual roleplay, relatively little has been written on it.&lt;ref name="Wild Side Sex"&gt;{{cite book|author=Midori (美登里) |title=''Wild Side Sex: The Book of Kink. Educational, Sensual, And Entertaining Essays''|year=2005|publisher=Daedalus Publishing|isbn=978-1-881943-22-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO0BbX_oBiUC&amp;dq=erotic+humiliation|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humiliation play can, however, be taken to a point where it becomes emotionally or psychologically distressing to one or the other partner, especially if it is [[public humiliation]]. Erotic humiliation can become extreme enough to be considered a form of [[edgeplay]], which some consider may best be approached with advance [[Negotiation (BDSM)|negotiation]] and use of a [[safeword]].

==Terminology and overview==
The most common name for the individual being humiliated is the ''[[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]]'', and the opposite individual who humiliates the bottom is often called the ''[[Top (BDSM)|top]]''. However, these terms are standard ones that are used in general [[Domination &amp; submission (BDSM)|dominant/submissive]] roleplay and are not specific to humiliation interests.

* If the top is regarded as a female, they are sometimes called the ''humiliatrix''. Other common names include [[Master (BDSM)|''Master''/''Dom'']] (male top), and ''Mistress''/[[Sexual domination|''Domme'']] (female top). 
* For the bottom (irrespective of gender), other common names are  ''[[Slave (BDSM)|slave]]'' and [[Sexual submission|''sub''/''submissive'']].

While elements of erotic humiliation may be part of a number of [[domination and submission]]-based activities, humiliation is not the same as [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|submission]]. The recipient does not necessarily seek to be ordered about. Humiliation comes into its own as a sexual force when the recipient seeks the humiliation over and above means. For example, being spanked is primarily valued because of the belittlement involved. Humiliation therefore encompasses a range of [[paraphilia]], including [[foot fetish]], [[breast fetish]], [[shoe fetish]], [[body worship]], [[spanking]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], and most [[BDSM]] styles. It can be as basic as the desire to kiss and massage feet as a precursor to sex; and it can be complex, involving roleplay and public displays of subservience. It can also be for a set period of time (a "[[Scene (BDSM)|scene]]") or an ongoing facet of a relationship. The ''humiliation'' is not intrinsic to the act or the object. Rather, it is [[semiotics|semiotically]] charged by the shared attitude of the partners engaged in the act. They invest specific acts, objects, or body parts with a humiliating aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giannini | first1 = AJ | last2 = Colapietro | first2 = G | last3 = Slaby | first3 = AE | last4 = Melemis | first4 = SM | last5 = Bowman | first5 = RK | title = Sexualization of the female foot as a response to sexually transmitted epidemics: a preliminary study | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 491–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9819924 | doi=10.2466/pr0.83.6.491-498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scenarios may give rise to sexual humiliation. Some scenarios may be based on [[verbal abuse]] and others on physical aspects.

===Verbal humiliation===
* [[Animal roleplay|Animal play]], referring to the recipient as a pet (dog, bitch...); making the humiliated one eat and drink from pet food and water bowls.&lt;ref name="Different loving1"&gt;Different loving, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;
* Verbal belittlement, with such words as  ''boy'', ''girl'', ''missy'', and ''pet''.
* [[Insults]] and [[verbal abuse]], such as ''fat'', ''ugly'', ''stupid'', ''sick'', ''disgusting'', and ''worthless''.
* Degrading names, such as ''slut'', ''shit'', ''bitch'', ''cunt'', and ''whore''.
* Disparaging or cruel references about breasts, facial appearance, genitalia (including small penis size, [[Erectile dysfunction|erection difficulties]], or [[circumcision]] status), buttocks, or about behaviors such as walking, responsiveness, and hygiene.
* Requirement to ask permission for everyday activities, such as going to the toilet, spending money, and eating.
* In [[Feederism]] the dominant partner may humiliate the other by pointing out their weight or calling them names like ''piggy'' or ''fatty''. They also might make fun of the other and their self-control, or poke and grope their flesh.
* Forced repetition, such as the humiliated one being obliged to repeat commands that he or she has been given and to confirm them.
* Forced [[flattery]], such as agreeing that every decision that the dominant makes is wise, correct, and justifiable, while additionally praising the dominant's physical and personality traits.
* [[Derision|Mockery]], [[derision]], and [[Ridiculous|ridicule]].
* Scolding of the type commonly reserved for children.&lt;ref name="Different loving2"&gt;Different loving, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical humiliation===
*[[Facial (sexuality)|Ejaculating]], spitting, and urinating on the submissive's body, especially the face.
* "Forced" anal penetration, with dildos, [[Butt plug|anal plugs]], and similar objects.
* [[Servitude (BDSM)|Servitude]]
* "Forced" sexual degradation, including such acts as [[cunnilingus]], [[analingus]], and [[fellatio]].
* Detailed accountability and control ([[micro-management]]) as to time spent and activities done, including lists of jobs to do, precise directions as to how the job is to be performed, and exactly how to act and behave.
* Real Humiliation is the act of making a person carry out specific tasks which involve other real people who are not aware that there is a task or dominant relation issuing the task in the background.
* Specific rituals and affectations to be adopted. This includes displays of subservience, such as lighting cigarettes, walking a pace behind the dominant, speaking only when spoken to, eye contact rules, kneeling or [[Prostration|prostrating]] oneself in front of the dominant when expecting orders, eating only after others or on the floor, and low-status place to sleep.
** [[Body worship]], including such activities as kissing or licking the dominant's feet, boots, [[buttocks]], [[anus]], [[vulva]], etc. to express acknowledgment, subservience, [[shame]], and even positive emotions (such as happiness and excitement).
* Deprivation of privacy, which may include the submissive's never being able to leave the room in which the dominant is present without permission.
** The dominant watches while the submissive uses the toilet.
** The submissive's being forbidden to leave the house or 'dungeon' in general for the duration of slavery or servitude, etc.
* [[Discipline (BDSM)]], including [[erotic spanking]], slapping, whipping, restraint, and other BDSM activities (such as [[cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|cock-and-ball torture]] (CBT)).
* [[Dresscode (BDSM)]]: prescriptions and proscriptions of clothing, even in public.
** For women, a common example is being mandated to wear only [[bikinis]] or lingerie.
** For men, forced [[Feminization (activity)|feminizing]] and [[cross-dressing]].
** Both men and women may be expected to go completely [[Nudity|naked]], with decorative objects such as collars, diapers, bands, tiaras, and cuffs as the only exceptions.
* [[Erotic sexual denial]], including the use of a [[Chastity belt (BDSM)|chastity device]].
* Wearing of external signs of "ownership", such as collars.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Different loving" /&gt; now ambiguous, add 1, 2 or 3 to name or 4 for new page number? --&gt;
* [[Public humiliation]], in which the submissive's friends or family, or strangers, are aware of or even witness the treatment.
* [[Erotic objectification]], in which the submissive is used as [[human furniture]], such as a footstool.
* [[Embarrassment]].
* [[Cuckold#Cuckoldry as a fetish|Cuckolding]], a mostly heterosexual fetish in which the dominant woman has sex with a man outside of the relationship while the submissive man may or may not be present.&lt;ref name="Ley"&gt;{{cite book|pages=173, 222|title=Insatiable Wives: Women Who Stray and the Men Who Love Them|author=David J. Ley|year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781442200319}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the man is not present, he might help her choose what clothes to wear when she meets the other man, or they might get together afterward so she can tell him about it, either while having sex or in addition to withholding sex.  If the man is present during the cuckolding, he may or may not be allowed to pleasure himself while watching.  The cuckolding may or may not be followed by sex between the couple. In recent years, the gender reversed form of cuckoldry (where the man has sex with a woman outside the relationship) has become more commonly referred to as "cuckqueenery" or "cuckqueening" (sometimes also spelled "cuckquean").&lt;ref name="Ley"/&gt; Another variant of the cuckolding fetish is that a heterosexual couple fantasizes that another man has already impregnated the woman.&lt;ref name="Cuckolding"&gt;{{cite book

If the man is present during the cuckolding, he may or may not be allowed to pleasure himself while watching his partner have sex with another man.  Also, the cuckolding may or may not immediately be followed by sex between the couple.  '''Impregnation and Pregnancy Fetish''' ... you and your partner fantasizing during sex ... that you both just found out she is pregnant... it can involve cuckolding ... When it is a part of the cuckolding fetish, the fantasy involves the "other man" having impregnated her, and his sperm being stronger than yours, and several other kinds of (agreed-to) humilation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The submissive's having to ask permission to [[orgasm]] during [[sex]] or [[masturbation]].
* The submissive's being forced to wear a gag or restraints on the body.
* Forced [[masturbation]] in a humiliating manner.&lt;ref name="Wild Side Sex2"&gt;Wild Side Sex, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Enema]]s cause feelings of humiliation which are key to many of those engaged in [[klismaphilia]],&lt;ref name="Different loving3"&gt;Different loving, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; and watching the consequent defecation can amplify that humiliation.
* [[Candaulism]].

Some sexual humiliation involves physical inflicting pain, but much of it is far more concerned with ridicule, mocking, [[Defamation|degradation]], and [[embarrassment]].

[[Sexual roleplaying]] can involve humiliation. For example, one person might [[Animal roleplay|play the part of a dog]] because they enjoy being mock-forced into it, and the top might emphasize the lowness of the bottom's status as an animal, whereas another person might play the role of the dog without any element of humiliation, simply as an expression of an inner animal or playful spirit.

==Psychology of humiliation==
[[File:Piss drinking.png|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Dominance over a slave may involve not just dominating physically but also mentally, such as through erotic humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michelle|last=Fegatofi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrsGBgAAQBAJ|title=UNVEILED The Secret Submissive Within|publisher=Lulu|year=2013|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the practice of [[golden showers]]. Image shows a female urinating into the mouth of a male.]]

Humiliation in general stimulates the same brain regions that are associated with physical pain, the inference being that humans evolved to remember social rewards and punishments as strongly as they recall physical reward or pain in response to their environment. As with any form of pain experimentation in a sexual context, [[Consent (BDSM)|consent]] and (paradoxically) a high degree of awareness and communication are needed to ensure that the result is desirable, rather than abusive. For example, a submissive may enjoy being insulted in some ways but would be genuinely crushed and devastated if humiliated or insulted in other ways.

Humiliation play is also connected to [[sexual fetish]]ism, in that non-sexual activities may become sexualised by association with arousal, and also may be associated with [[exhibitionism]] in the sense of wanting others to witness (or being aroused by others witnessing) one's sexual degradation.

For some people, activities such as name-calling are a way of achieving [[ego reduction]] or getting over [[sexual inhibition]]s. For example, between gay people, terms usually associated with [[homophobia]] may be used, such as ''[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]'' and ''[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]''.

As with all sexual activities, some people have [[Sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]] about humiliation, and others actually undertake it as a lifestyle or in a [[Scene (BDSM)|scene]]. Sexual fantasies relating to mild humiliation are common. Some humiliation [[roleplay]] ([[Animal roleplay|pup-play]] and [[age play]] in particular) is combined with loyalty and care-giving to the extent that these fetishes can be seen as exercises in trust rather than primarily a humiliation fetish. The desire to be beneath the other partner during intercourse, the idea of "getting caught" (as in having sex in the garden or woods), and simulated rape are emotional games that emphasise status, vulnerability, and control. However, for most people such ideas remain fantasies; the people would have strong reservations about the fantasies' being made public, or engaged in with a partner in real life, however erotic the idea may be.  When someone reveals a fetish to a partner, this usually is a result of great trust. However, the desire to be humiliated may be a motivating cause for confession, in that the act of confessing can itself be humiliating. Many people worry about being ridiculed for their fetishes, and such ridicule from their partners could be psychologically catastrophic. Therefore, many people use online humiliation (in which the [[humiliator]] and others are involved via the [[Internet]], using chat, email, websites, etc.) as a compromise between exhibitionism and reality on the one hand, and safety and anonymity on the other.

==Online humiliation==
Online humiliation is the desire to be seen in a sexually embarrassing context on the Internet. This practice allows the submissive to seek fetish partners from across the world. As the Internet has grown and continues to grow, so does online humiliation. Anecdotal reports indicate that the proportion of men being dominated by women on the Internet, through some type of personal service provided for a fee by the woman, vastly exceeds the instances of a woman being dominated online by a man, or another woman.

Common methods of online humiliation:

* Public [[pillory]].
* Embarrassing photographic or video assignments for submissives, who must publicly post pictures or videos of their humiliation. The dominant may require public acts or exposure. Sometimes humiliating words are written on the submissive's body before photographing.
* Requiring the submissive to post publicly their name, address, phone number, employer, or other personal information.
* The requirement for submissives to keep online journals detailing personal information, such as masturbation frequency, thoughts or fantasies, technique or aid(s) used, and disposal of semen (if the submissive is allowed to masturbate).
* The requirement for the submissive to place themself in [[chastity]], and to publicly post a picture showing their status.
* Verbal abuse.
* Publicly bidding for items that reveal their fetishes.
* Money slavery, in which the submissive must buy the dominant gifts and pay the dominant's bills and taxes, or give the dominant direct access to their bank accounts and credit cards.
* Homework slavery, in which the submissive must do the dominant's homework or occupational work.
* Repetitive assignments, such as copying the phone book.
* Humiliating the submissive by changing information on social sites.
* Controlling the submissive's computer remotely, through [[remote desktop software]] the submissive is required to install.

These practices can be conducted through chat, [[webcam]], e-mail, BDSM contact websites, and proprietary virtual spaces such as ''[[Second Life]]'' or [[FetLife]].

The name and philosophy for the school was inspired by the work of the fifteenth-century Italian educator [[Vittorino da Feltre]].  The Feltre School teaches the high educational ideals of the classical [[Trivium (education)|Trivium]].&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt;

The Feltre School resides in one of the few remaining turn-of-the-century brick buildings in Chicago’s River North neighborhood.  The building was originally built in 1905 as the Chicago Deaconesses' Home&lt;ref name="perform"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.performink.com/Archives/curtain/2006/5-12Curtain.htm |title=Behind The Curtain: News from the North |work=PerformInk Online |date=5 December 2006 |last=Abarbanel |first=Jonathan |accessdate=August 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716065006/http://www.performink.com/Archives/curtain/2006/5-12Curtain.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had become commercial property by the time The Feltre School purchased it in 1998.

'''Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion ''' refers to the [[combustion]]-product gas resulting from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most fossil fuels are combusted with ambient air (as differentiated from combustion with pure [[oxygen]]). Since ambient air contains about 79 volume percent gaseous [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W. (Editors)|title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1997|isbn=0-07-049841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is essentially non-combustible, the largest part of the [[flue gas]] from most fossil-fuel combustion is uncombusted nitrogen. [[Carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}), the next largest part of flue gas, can be as much as 10−25 volume percent or more of the flue gas.  This is closely followed in volume by water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) created by the combustion of the hydrogen in the fuel with atmospheric oxygen.  Much of the 'smoke' seen pouring from [[flue gas stack]]s is this water vapor forming a cloud as it contacts cool air.

A typical flue gas from the combustion of fossil fuels contains very small amounts of [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NOx), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]].&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt; The nitrogen oxides are derived from the nitrogen in the ambient air as well as from any nitrogen-containing compounds in the fossil fuel. The sulfur dioxide is derived from any [[sulfur]]-containing compounds in the fuels. The particulate matter is composed of very small particles of solid materials and very small liquid droplets which give flue gases their smoky appearance.

The steam generators in large [[power plant]]s and the process [[furnace]]s in large [[oil refinery|refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s, and [[incinerator]]s burn considerable amounts of fossil fuels and therefore emit large amounts of flue gas to the ambient atmosphere. The table below presents the total amounts of flue gas typically generated by the burning of fossil fuels such as [[natural gas]], [[fuel oil]] and [[coal]]. The data were obtained by [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zumdahl, Steven S.|title=Chemical Principles|edition=5th|publisher=Houghton Mifflin College Division|year=2005|isbn=0-618-37206-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calculations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.air-dispersion.com/formulas.html#combustion Air Dispersion Modeling Conversions and Formulas]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is of interest to note that the total amount of wet flue gas generated by coal combustion is only 10 percent higher than the flue gas generated by natural-gas combustion (the ratio for dry flue gas is higher).

'''''Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages''''' is a 2007 book written by [[Alex Wright (author)|Alex Wright]], a writer and information architect for [[The New York Times]]. Wright's intention is to provide a broad historical overview of the development of information transmission and organization systems.

==Chapters==
*'''Chapter 1: Networks and hierarchies'''
Wright asserts the idea that while networks are currently an ''en vogue'' topic of discussion, frequently framed as being in opposition to hierarchical systems, that each co-exists and has always done so. He posits that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
     "The fundamental tension between networks and hierarchies has been percolating for eons. Today, we are simply witnessing the latest installment in a long evolutionary drama."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Alex (2007) ''Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages'', page 7&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wright goes on to discuss various aspects of evolutionary learning in numerous contexts. This ultimately leads to the question of whether man's information systems are still evolving, or did they simply stop when we reached our current evolutionary state. Wright looks for a possible answer in the work of sociobiologist [[E.O. Wilson]] and his theory of gene-culture co-evolution and 'epigenetic rules':&lt;blockquote&gt;
     "Epigenetic rules come in two flavors: primary epigenetic rules govern our immediate sense perceptions, such as our universal tendency to perceive the color spectrum in four basic color groups...; secondary epigenetic rules operate at a higher level of abstraction such as the tendency for all human beings to classify objects into opposing pairs like black and white, life and death, heaven and earth—notions that have no physical component in the human brain, yet seem to recur across human cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Alex (2007) ''Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages'', page 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is to say, we are predisposed toward classification.

*'''Chapter 2: Family trees and the tree of life'''
*'''Chapter 3: The ice age information explosion'''
Wright discusses the evolution of symbolic communication and the use of external symbolic objects as a unit of cultural exchange. Wright contend that primitive symbolism in all its forms drove the development of larger, more complex social networks and eventually make way for the evolution of writing &lt;ref&gt;Wright, Alex (2007) ''Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages'', page 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chapter 4: The age of alphabets''' 
*'''Chapter 5: Illuminating the dark age''' 
*'''Chapter 6: A steam engine of the mind''' 
Traces the development of print technology and the subsequent spread of written literacy. The chapter also addresses the role of religious texts and their impact on Western thought. Wright quotes author John Lothrop Motley:&lt;blockquote&gt;
     "The eerie conjunction of the printing press, steeply rising literacy rates, religious wars and the witch craze seem significant&lt;ref&gt;Motley, John L. "The Rise of the Dutch Republic" in [http://literaturemania.com/jm00v10/page86.asplink The History of the Netherlands, Complete, 1885 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Alex (2007) ''Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages'', page 119&lt;/ref&gt;"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''Chapter 7: The astral power station'''
*'''Chapter 8: The encyclopedic revolution''' 
*'''Chapter 9: The moose that roared''' 
Discusses the evolution of classification systems including the [[Systema Naturae]] of [[Carl Linnaeus]], which was hierarchical in nature and standing in opposition to the work of French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], who contended a more holistic approach would be better, taking into account that despite environmental similarities, different regions have distinct plants and animals. He made the suggestion that species may have both "improved" and "degenerated" after dispersing from a center of creation. The chapter title makes reference to the 7 foot moose Thomas Jefferson had shipped to Buffon after Buffon contended that no American animal could be compared to those of the old world.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Alex (2007) ''Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages'', page 159&lt;/ref&gt; Wright contends that Jefferson to a large degree is an unsung hero of information science, due to his support of the Linnaean hierarchy and his adaptation of  table of science originated by [[Francis Bacon]] for classification of his personal library.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Alex (2007) ''Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages'', page 161-163&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Chapter 10: The industrial library''' 
Brief historical record of the development of the modern library and classification systems by [[Charles Ammi Cutter]] ([[Cutter Expansive Classification]] system, which was the basis for the top categories of the [[Library of Congress classification]]) as well  [[Colon classification]] developed by [[S. R. Ranganathan]], an example of a [[Faceted classification|faceted]]  [[Taxonomic classification|classification]] system and perhaps the most prominent classification system in the Western world, the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] created by [[Melvil Dewey]]
*'''Chapter 11: The Web that wasn't''' 
Traces the evolution of the modern day web. Notable discussions include:
**[[Paul Otlet]] and his [[Mundaneum]]
**The prescient writings of [[Vannevar Bush]] (most notably the essay "[[As We May Think]]" which introduced the idea of the [[Memex]])
**"[[The Mother of All Demos]]", during which [[Douglas Engelbart]] featured the first computer mouse to be seen by the public, as well as the introduction  interactive text, video conferencing, teleconferencing, email and hypertext
**[[Ted Nelson]] and his development of [[hypertext]] with partner [[Douglas Engelbart]] as well as his Xanadu project. Wright notes that Nelson's vision of the a networked information structure is prescient not only in terms of network architecture, but issues of security,privacy, and copyright.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Alex (2007) ''Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages'', page 214&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[DARPA|ARPA]] and the development of the web as we know it today, on which Ted Nelson opines:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Web isn't hypertext, it's DECORATED DIRECTORIES! What we have instead is the vacuous victory of typesetters over authors, and the most trivial form of hypertext that could have been imagined"&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Ted "[http://ted.hyperland.com/buyin.txt I Don't Buy In]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Alex (2007) ''Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages'', page 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''High comedy''' or '''pure comedy''' is a type of [[comedy]] characterized by [[wit]]ty dialogue, [[satire]], biting humor, or criticism of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trumbull |first=Eric W.|url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/spd130et/typecomd.htm |title=Types of Drama / Plays: Comedy |publisher=Northern Virginia Community College |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, high comedy can be seen among [[sitcom]]s and [[talk shows]] targeted at cultured and articulate audiences. Examples of high comedy include [[Arrested Development (TV series)]], [[The Simpsons]], [[The Marx Brothers]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Seinfeld]], [[The Larry Sanders Show]] and [[The Office (UK TV series)]].

'''The Hockerton Housing Project''' is a small community of five [[earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] homes on the outskirts of [[Hockerton]], Nottinghamshire, UK.

The houses were designed by ‘green’ [[architects]] [[Brenda and Robert Vale|Professor Brenda Vale and Dr Robert Vale]].&lt;ref&gt;Energy Saving Trust, The Hockerton Housing Project: a case study&lt;/ref&gt; Low carbon living is facilitated through the use of renewable energy, the water system, food grown on site, and the community's approach to work and transport.&lt;ref&gt;East Midlands Regional Assembly, "UK’s first earth-sheltered, self-sufficient ecological housing development", www.emra.gov.uk, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The homes were completed in September 1998 after three years of planning and 18 months of construction, at a cost of about £65,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ecology Building Society, Hockerton housing: low impact living, http://www.ecology.co.uk/html/aboutus/casestudies/hockerton.htm, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Two homes have since changed ownership on the open property market.

==Layout==
The development consists of a terrace of five single story dwellings which are earth-sheltered at the rear (North), so that the ground surface slopes and blends smoothly into the field at the back. The houses have [[passive solar]] heating (a combination of high [[thermal mass]] and the south-facing conservatory) removing the need for a space heating system and the greatest factor in lowering energy use.

Each house is 6 metres deep with a 19 metre conservatory to the south. This runs the full width of each dwelling. A repeated modular bay system of 3.2m in width was used for ease and cost of construction. Most of the internal rooms have 3 metre high French windows linking them to the conservatory. Those rooms that are not so dependent on natural light, such as utility and bathing areas are located towards the rear of the homes.

The surrounding 40,000 square metre site allows for crop cultivation, the rearing of sheep and chickens, and self-sufficiency in water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;EST,ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy generation and use==
Two [[wind turbines]] and a [[solar photovoltaic]] system provide most of the energy required to run the homes. All systems are grid linked, which allows for both import of energy during periods of supply shortfall, and export for periods of excess energy production. The excess exported offsets the imported energy from the grid.

•	6&amp;nbsp;kW proven [[wind turbine]] installed early 2002 year (upgraded in 2008) &lt;br /&gt;
•	7.65&amp;nbsp;kW peak array of [[photovoltaics]] (solar electric) installed August 2002 complimenting wind power.&lt;br /&gt;
•	5&amp;nbsp;kW Iskra [[wind turbine]] installed in 2005 – installed as part of construction of a community building

The typical energy use for the house is about 10kWhrs/day (all electric). This is about 10% of a typical UK home. The majority of the electricity use is generated by the on-site renewables which has reduced energy bills to about £100/annum. This is offset by income from [[Renewables Obligation]] certificates, and may in future benefit from [[feed-in tariff]]s.

==Water capture, use and processing&lt;ref&gt;NARYANAN, Narvi, WHITE, Trudi, KRAUSS, Terry, JONES-Lofting, Chris, "Water Supply and Irrigation Systems", Geographical, Mar2000, Vol. 72 Issue 3, p90, 2p&lt;/ref&gt;==
There are two water capture and treatment systems.

'''Non-drinking water:'''Rainfall on the fields is channeled to a sump from where it is pumped to a reservoir to the north of the buildings. This reservoir holds enough water for 250 days. The water is sand filtered and treated with chlorine before entering the homes.

'''Drinking or potable water:'''Drinking water is captured from the conservatory roofs in copper pipes, which are slightly antiseptic, and stored in a tank that holds at least 100 days worth of drinking water. The water is passed through 3 filters before it enters the homes: a five-micrometre string filter, a carbon filter and then a UV-light filter which kills bacteria and viruses.

'''Water use''' is reduced through low-flush toilets and flow-restrictors on shower heads. Detergent free laundry balls keep the water unpolluted.

'''Processing waste water:'''A [[reed bed]] sewage system is in place to process waste water. Solid waste is captured in a septic tank. This is emptied each quarter and waste is composted on-site. Liquid waste then takes 100 days to pass through the reed-bed, with the reeds roots breaking down the liquid effluent.

==Co-operation and community==
All residents own their homes but are also members of a co-operative.&lt;ref&gt;Ecology Building Society, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; Each home, as part of the lease, undertakes to spend 300 unpaid hours per year on managing and maintaining the site, from the infrastructure of the energy and water systems through to lambing and growing food; and 300 paid hours per year supporting the joint business which runs tours and educational events, hosts away-days and consulting on both new and retrofit energy efficient building.&lt;ref&gt;Hockerton Housing Project, FAQ, http://www.hockertonhousingproject.org.uk/SEFS/ID.780/SEFE/ViewItem.asp, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7327">[[Urban sociology]] is the sociological study of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a normative discipline of sociology seeking to study the structures, processes, changes and problems of an urban area and by doing so providing inputs for planning and policy making.

ILRI works with partners worldwide to help poor people keep their farm animals alive and productive, increase and sustain their livestock and farm productivity and find profitable markets for their animal products.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.ilri.org International Livestock Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

ILRI works to secure the assets and market participation of the poor and to improve smallholder and pastoral productivity. The institute works with partners to enhance development of new knowledge and technological and policy information to help farmers improve their livelihoods by exploiting the potential of their animals. ILRI carries out its research in East, Southern, and West Africa, in South and Southeast Asia, and in China.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

==Research areas==
ILRI's research addresses seven global livestock development challenges including vaccine and diagnostic technologies for orphan animal diseases, animal genetic resources, climate change – adaptation and mitigation, emerging diseases, SPS and market access within broader market opportunities for the poor, sustainable intensification in smallholder crop-livestock systems and vulnerability of marginal systems and peoples.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">'''Intratracheal instillation''' is the introduction of a substance directly into the [[trachea]].  It is widely used to test the [[Inhalation exposure|respiratory toxicity]] of a substance as an alternative to [[inhalation]] in [[animal testing]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Intratracheal instillation was reported as early as 1923 in studies of the [[carcinogen]]icity of [[coal tar]].  Modern methodology was developed by several research groups in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  By contrast, tracheal administration of pharmaceutical drugs in humans is called [[endotracheal administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://calsprogram.org/manual/volume3/section12/CV/05-CV4EndotrachDrugDeliv13.html|title=CALS Manual: Endotracheal Drug Delivery|last=|first=|date=2011-10-13|website=Comprehensive Advanced Life Support Rural Emergency Medical Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As compared to inhalation, intratracheal instillation allows greater control over the dose and location of the substance, is cheaper and less technically demanding, allows lower amounts of scarce or expensive substances to be used, allows substances to be tested that can be inhaled by humans but not small mammals, and minimizes exposure to laboratory workers and to the skin of laboratory animals.  Disadvantages include its nonphysiological and invasive nature, the [[confounding]] effects of the delivery vehicle and anesthesia, and the fact that it bypasses the [[upper respiratory tract]].  Instillation results in a less uniform distribution of the substance than inhalation, and the substance is cleared from the respiratory tract more slowly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Driscoll|first=Kevin E.

== Methodology ==
Intratracheal instillation is often performed with [[Laboratory mouse|mice]], [[Laboratory rat|rats]], or [[Laboratory hamster|hamsters]], with hamsters often preferred because their mouth can be opened widely to aid viewing the procedure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxvqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163|title=Toxicology of Nanomaterials|last=Zhao|first=Yuliang|date=2016-12-12|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9783527337972|location=|pages=163|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because they are more resistant to lung diseases than rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KhvqCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|title=Free Radicals and Inhalation Pathology|last=Schiller|first=Erich|date=2013-06-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9783642186196|location=|pages=63|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instillation is performed either through inserting a needle or [[catheter]] down the mouth and throat, or through surgically exposing the trachea and penetrating it with a needle.  Generally, short-acting inhaled [[anesthetic]] drugs such as [[halothane]], [[metaphane]], or [[enflurane]] are used during the instillation procedure.  [[Saline (medicine)|Saline solution]] is usually used as a delivery vehicle in a typical volume of 1–2 mL/kg body weight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A wide range of substances can be tested, including both soluble materials and insoluble particles or fibers, including [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8948">A '''Kelvin bridge''', also called a '''Kelvin double bridge''' and in some countries a '''Thomson bridge''', is a measuring instrument used to measure unknown [[Resistor|electrical resistors]] below 1&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]. It is specifically designed to measure resistors that are constructed as four terminal resistors.

==Background==
Resistors above about 1 ohm in value can be measured using a variety of techniques, such as an [[ohmmeter]] or by using a [[Wheatstone bridge]]. In such resistors, the resistance of the connecting wires or terminals is negligible compared to the resistance value. For resistors of less than an ohm, the resistance of the connecting wires or terminals becomes significant, and conventional measurement techniques will include them in the result.

[[File:Four terminal resistor symbol.tif|right|thumb|200px|Symbol for four terminal resistor]] To overcome the problems of these undesirable resistances (known as '[[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic resistance]]'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current [[ammeter]] shunts are constructed as four terminal resistors. These resistances have a pair of current terminals and a pair of potential or voltage terminals. In use, a current is passed between the current terminals, but the volt drop across the resistor is measured at the potential terminals. The volt drop measured will be entirely due to the resistor itself as the parasitic resistance of the leads carrying the current to and from the resistor are not included in the potential circuit. To measure such resistances requires a [[bridge circuit]] designed to work with four terminal resistances. That bridge is the Kelvin bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Northrup |first=Edwin F. |title=Methods of Measuring Electrical Resistance |year=1912 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3lKAAAAMAAJ |pages=100–131 |ref=none |chapter=VI: The Measurement of Low Resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==
[[File:Kelvin bridge diagram.tif|right|thumb|300px|Circuit diagram of Kelvin bridge]]
[[File:Kelvin bridge by RFT.png|right|thumb|300px|A commercial Kelvin Bridge]]
{{See also|Four-terminal sensing}}
The operation of the Kelvin bridge is very similar to the Wheatstone bridge, but uses two additional resistors. Resistors ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are connected to the outside potential terminals of the four terminal known or standard resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and the unknown resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (identified as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in the diagram). The resistors ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are essentially a Wheatstone bridge. In this arrangement, the parasitic resistance of the upper part of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and the lower part of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is outside of the potential measuring part of the bridge and therefore are not included in the measurement.  However, the link between ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt;) ''is'' included in the potential measurement part of the circuit and therefore can affect the accuracy of the result. To overcome this, a second pair of resistors ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; form a second pair of arms of the bridge (hence 'double bridge') and are connected to the inner potential terminals of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (identified as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the diagram). The detector D is connected between the junction of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the junction of ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_8/10.html All About Circuits]&lt;/ref&gt;

The balance equation of this bridge is given by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_x}{R_s}=\frac{R_2}{R_1}+\frac{R_\text{par}}{R_s} \cdot \frac{R'_1}{R'_1+R'_2+R_\text{par}} \cdot \left( \frac{R_2}{R_1}-\frac{R'_2}{R'_1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

In a practical bridge circuit, the ratio of ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is arranged to be the same as the ratio of R1 to R2 (and in most designs, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). As a result, the last term of the above equation becomes zero and the balance equation becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{R_x}{R_s}=\frac{R_2}{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging to make ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; the subject

: &lt;math&gt; R_x=R_2 \cdot \frac{R_s}{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;

The parasitic resistance ''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt; has been eliminated from the balance equation and its presence does not affect the measurement result. This equation is the same as for the functionally equivalent Wheatstone bridge.

In practical use the magnitude of the supply B, can be arranged to provide current through Rs and Rx at or close to the rated operating currents of the smaller rated resistor. This contributes to smaller errors in measurement. This current does not flow through the measuring bridge itself. This bridge can also be used to measure resistors of the more conventional two terminal design.  The bridge potential connections are merely connected as close to the resistor terminals as possible. Any measurement will then exclude all circuit resistance not within the two potential connections.

==Accuracy==
The accuracy of measurements made using this bridge are dependent on a number of factors. The accuracy of the standard resistor (''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) is of prime importance. Also of importance is how close the ratio of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is to the ratio of ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As shown above, if the ratio is exactly the same, the error caused by the parasitic resistance (''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt;) is completely eliminated. In a practical bridge, the aim is to make this ratio as close as possible, but it is not possible to make it ''exactly'' the same. If the difference in ratio is small enough, then the last term of the balance equation above becomes small enough that it is negligible. Measurement accuracy is also increased by setting the current flowing through ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; to be as large as the rating of those resistors allows. This gives the greatest potential difference between the innermost potential connections (''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to those resistors and consequently sufficient voltage for the change in ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to have its greatest effect.

There are some commercial bridges reaching accuracies of better than 2% for resistance ranges from 1 microohm to 25 ohms. One such type is illustrated above.

Laboratory bridges are usually constructed with high accuracy variable resistors in the two potential arms of the bridge and achieve accuracies suitable for calibrating standard resistors. In such an application, the 'standard' resistor (''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) will in reality be a sub-standard type (that is a resistor having an accuracy some 10 times better than the required accuracy of the standard resistor being calibrated). For such use, the error introduced by the mis-match of the ratio in the two potential arms would mean that the presence of the parasitic resistance ''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt; could have a significant impact on the very high accuracy required. To minimise this problem, the current connections to the standard resistor (''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;); the sub-standard resistor (''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) and the connection between them (''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt;) are designed to have as low a resistance as possible, and the connections both in the resistors and the bridge more resemble [[bus bar]]s rather than wire.

Some ohmmeters include Kelvin bridges in order to obtain large measurement ranges. Instruments for measuring sub-ohm values are often referred to as low-resistance ohmmeters, milli-ohmmeters, micro-ohmmeters, etc.

'''Macroinvertebrate Community Index''' (MCI) is an [[Index (statistics)|index]] used in [[New Zealand]] to measure the [[water quality]] of fresh water streams.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Index|url=https://www.lawa.org.nz/learn/glossary/m/macroinvertebrate-community-index-(mci)|website=www.lawa.org.nz|publisher=Land Air Water Aoteraroa|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence or lack of [[invertebrate|macroinvertebrates]] such as insects, worms and snails in a river or stream can give a [[Bioindicator|biological indicator]] on the health of that waterway.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Composition (MCI)|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/environmental-reporting/reporting-act/fresh-water/river-condition-indicator/macroinvertebrates|website=Ministry for the Environment|publisher=Government of New Zealand|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCI assigns a number to each [[species]] of macroinvertebrate based on the sensitivity of that species to [[pollution]]. The index then calculates an average score.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"/&gt; A higher score on the MCI generally indicates a more healthy stream.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"/&gt;

The '''MCI (Macro invertebrate Community Index)''' relies on an allocation of scores to freshwater macroinvertebrates based on their pollution tolerances. Freshwater macroinvertebrates found in pristine conditions would score higher than those found in polluted areas.&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1993) Performance of the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Effects of sampling method, sample replication, water depth, current velocity, and substratum on index values. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 27:4, 463-478.&lt;/ref&gt; MCI values can be calculated using macroinvertebrate presence-absence data using this equation:&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"/&gt;

'''MCI = [(site score)/(# of scoring taxa)]*20'''

Previous [[water quality]] assessments have relied on both chemical and habitat analysis, however, these methods have been proven to be insufficient due to pollution from nonpoint sources.&lt;ref name="BENNETT"&gt;Bennett, H. H., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, J. A. Sawyer, and E. C. W. (2004) Development of an Invertebrate Community Index for an Alabama Coastal Plain Watershed. Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 40:1, 43-51&lt;/ref&gt; Species living in an aquatic environment may be the best natural indicator of environmental quality and reveal the effects of any habitat alteration or pollution,&lt;ref name="BENNETT"/&gt; and have proved to respond to a wide range of stressors such as [[sedimentation]], [[urbanization]], [[agricultural]] practices and forest harvesting effects.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"&gt;Collier, KJ. (2014) Wood decay rates and macroinvertebrate community structure along contrasting human pressure gradients (Waikato, New Zealand), New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 48:1, 97-111&lt;/ref&gt; Any changes that may occur in macroinvertebrate communities that lead to a reduction in diversity increase the dominance of pollution-tolerant invertebrates, such as [[oligochaetes]] and [[chironomids]].&lt;ref name="HALL"&gt;Hall, M. J., G. P. Closs and R. H. Riley. (2001) Relationships between land use and stream invertebrate community structure in a South Island, New Zealand, coastal stream catchment. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 35:3, 591-603&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a lack of species diversity and low [[biotic index]] scores of inhabitant macroinvertebrates may be an indicator of poor water quality.&lt;ref name="COLLINS"&gt;Collins, C. L., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, and E. C. Webber. (2008) Validation of an Invertebrate Community Index for Urban Streams for an Alabama Coastal Plains Watershed. Journal of The American Water Resources Association, 44(3), 663-669&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of water quality degradation is the greatest in low-elevation areas, where high intensity agriculture and urban development are the dominant land uses.&lt;ref name="LARNED"&gt;Larned, S. T., T. Snelder, M. J. Unwin, and G.B. McBride. (2016) Water quality in New Zealand rivers: current state and trends. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 50:3, 389-417&lt;/ref&gt;

Macro invertebrate communities are the preferred indicators of aquatic ecosystem health because they are very easy to both collect and identify, and have short life spans, thus responding very quickly to changes in their environment.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"/&gt; The MCI methods of utilizing macroinvertebrate communities to assess the overall health of an aquatic environment continues to be the most reliable, applicable, and widely acclaimed method around the world.&lt;ref name="OLOMUKORO"&gt;Olomukoro, J. O. and A. Dirisu. (2014) Macroinvertebrate Community and Pollution Tolerance Index in Edion and Omodo Rivers in Derived Savannah Wetlands in Southern Nigeria. Jordan Journal of Biological Sciences, 7:1, 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Variations on the MCI'''

In addition to the MCI indexed defined above, there are also two other variations of the MCI. The QMCI (Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index) and the SQMCI (Semi-Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index). Both MCI and QMCI are widely used in countries like New Zealand. The combination of widespread use and good performance of the MCI and the QMCI in detecting water quality in aquatic ecosystems has sparked interest in further refinement of the methods in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1998) SQMCI: A biotic index for freshwater macroinvertebrate coded‐abundance data. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 32:1, 55-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The QMCI, just like the MCI, was initially designed to evaluate the organic enrichment in aquatic ecosystems. The third index, the SQMCI, was created to reduce sampling and processing efforts required for the QMCI.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"&gt;Wright‐Stow, A. E. and Winterbourn, M. J. (2003) How well do New Zealand's stream‐monitoring indicators, the macroinvertebrate community index and its quantitative variant, correspond? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 37:2, 461-470.&lt;/ref&gt; The SQMCI will respond in a similar matter to the QMCI in community dominance, however, will require fewer samples to achieve the same precision. The SQMCI gives a comparative appraisal to the QMCI with under 40% of the [[exertion]], in circumstances that macroinvertebrate densities are not required. This diminishes expenses and also enhances the logical solidness of biomonitoring projects.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; Both the QMCI and SQMCI are similar to the MCI in the way that they are graded on a 1 (extremely tolerant) to 10 (highly intolerant) scale. However, they differ in the way that MCI is calculated using presence-absence data whereas QMCI uses quantitative or percentage data.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Having a qualitative, quantitative, and semi-quantitative version of the same index has raised some questions as to if this is a good thing or not. All three indexes have the same purpose, which is to measure the quality of an aquatic ecosystem, however, there are no clear recommendations about when each one is most appropriate to be used. In a study conducted on 88 rivers, Searsbrook et al. (2000) concluded MCI is more useful than the QMCI for recognizing changes in stream water quality over time. Having three forms of a similar index may prompt to various conclusions and also opens the route for specific utilization of either file to give bias to a specific position or position taken by a specialist.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Consistency on the different versions of MCI have not yet been formally measured despite the communication that has been made to the public, managers and politicians.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt;
	

'''QMCI values can be calculated using:
QMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

SQMCI values can be calculated similar to QMCI except that coded abundances are substituted for actual counts. Example:

'''SQMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

'''Factors Influencing MCI'''
There are several factors which can affect the data acquisition of MCI when assessing the water quality of an aquatic ecosystem. Hard-bottom and Soft-bottom channels can often yield different results and many researchers will use two different versions of the MCI. For example, in a study by Stark &amp; Mallard (2007) they discuss that hard and soft bottom channels have separate versions of the MCI and the two versions can not be combined into one data set because of the differences in [[taxa]] and tolerance values.&lt;ref name="LARNED"/&gt;
	

[[Spatial variability]] is also of interest in terms of affecting the data acquired through MCI. Sites which are progressively down stream often tend to yield a lower MCI value. There may also be confounding influences between riffles, runs, or pools with a single stream reach.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"&gt;Stark, J. D. and N. Phillips. (2009) Seasonal variability in the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Are seasonal correction factors required? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 43:4, 867-882&lt;/ref&gt;
	

Depth and velocity have also been raised as a concern with regards to effecting results, however Stark (1993) investigated the influences of the sampling method, water depth, current velocity and [[substratum]] on the results and found that both MCI and QMCI are independent of depth, velocity, and substratum from macroinvertebrate samples collected from stony riffles.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; This finding is an advantage for the assessment of water pollution.
	

There have been several studies conducted on seasonal variability, which has been considered the main influential factor on the assessment of water quality. It has been concluded that all models should test data that has been collected in the season as the reference data, which is being used.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt;
	

There have been several other factors such as water temperature, invertebrate life histories and dissolved oxygen levels that have all been explained as causes of seasonal variability. Warmer seasons have biotic indices that are indicative of poorer stream health.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt; Warmer seasons such as summer, would have increased temperatures therefore increasing water temperature and decreasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water making the environment less ideal to aquatic macroinvertebrates. In return, this effects the density of macroinvertebrate population and changes the results of the indices.

[[File:Faculty of Music, University of Toronto - from Philosopher's Walk - DSC09874.JPG|alt=EJB@UofT|thumb|203x203px|The [[University of Toronto, Faculty of Music|Faculty of Music]] at the [[University of Toronto]] offers a Master of Music in Composition, Music Technology and Digital Media, Instrumental (solo piano, woodwinds, brass, percussion, strings), Collaborative Piano, Conducting, Jazz Performance, Opera, Piano Pedagogy, Voice, and Vocal Pedagogy. The first program for the degree was introduced in 1954.]]
The '''Master of Music''' ('''M.M.''' or '''M.Mus.''') is, as an academic title, the first graduate [[academic degree|degree]] in [[Music]] awarded by universities and [[Conservatory of music|conservatories]]. The M.M. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually performance in singing or instrument playing, composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as [[music history]], [[music theory]], or music [[pedagogy]]. The degree, which takes one or two years of full-time study to complete, prepares students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers, according to their area of specialization. The M.M. is often required as the minimum teaching credential for university, college, and conservatory instrumental or vocal teaching positions. 

==Types==
The M.M. is widely available in performance (sometimes with a specialization in music teaching/pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and, less commonly, [[music education]]. In 2005, Boston University launched an online Master of Music program in [[music education]], the only fully online program at this level as of November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;As of November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The music education degree may also be awarded as a more specifically titled Master of Music Education (M.M.Ed.). The master's in music theory, musicology (commonly called "music history"), and ethnomusicology is typically the [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.). Nevertheless, some universities in the UK (e.g. [[Sheffield University]]) utilize the M.M. as a special research degree, in which the student undertakes original research and prepares a written thesis or similar document. Programs focusing on preparing musicians for careers in sacred music for churches and houses of worship may alternatively be called Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.).

==Components of degree==

===Applied studies and courses===
One of the major differences between a typical M.A. degree and the M.M. is that whereas M.A. degree students often undertake original research and prepare and submit a [[thesis]] or similar research document, M.M. students focus on practical, applied areas, as set out in their M.M. area of specialization, which are typically instrumental or vocal performance, composition of new music, or [[conducting]] (the latter may focus on orchestral conducting, choral conducting, or a combination of both. 

In M.M. programs, the student spends intensive lesson time with a professor. For singers and instrumentalists, this is with a voice and instrument professor, respectively. For composition students, they take coaching sessions with composer-professors. For conducting students, they get conducting coaching from a conductor-professor at the university. M.M. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons with a professor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many M.M. programs, all of the different M.M. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses, as these core courses are a necessary background for all three careers. The different streams may also have different required courses for each stream. For example, vocal performance students may be required to take an opera or art song class; orchestral instrumentalists may be required to take an orchestral excerpts or orchestral audition preparation class; composition students may be required to take composition courses; and conducting students may be required to take conducting, score-reading, or piano classes.

Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing an M.M. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history (e.g., on [[historically authentic performance]]). Some institutions permit M.M. students to do a sub-specialization in a field outside music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a M.M. in piano [[pedagogy]] may be able to do a sub-specialization in the psychology of learning in the university's department of [[psychology]] or take a sub-specialization in educational methods in the university's department of education. Doing sub-specializations outside the faculty of music typically requires the approval of both the faculty of music and the other faculty (e.g., psychology, education, etc.).

===Recitals and comprehensive exams===
The last stage of the M.M. is usually the performance of one or two recitals and completion of comprehensive exams. Most programs require that the recitals include advanced-grade pieces that are drawn from the different eras of music history, such as Baroque-era solo suites (late 17th to mid 18th century), a Classical-era (mid to late 18th century) sonata or concerto; a Romantic-era (19th century) concerto or solo; and a Contemporary era (20th and 21st century) piece. The specific components of the recital vary between schools. Some programs allow students to include chamber pieces, in which the student plays a major role as part of a chamber group, for some of the pieces.

In some schools, students are required to give a lecture for one or both of the recitals, in which they explain the historical context or music theory or compositional issues involved in the pieces. This approach, called a lecture-recital, is designed to give students experience explaining and contextualizing the pieces or songs they perform. This skill is important for performers because many also teach or coach students, and some will go on to become professors, where they may be required to give lectures on music history, theory, or composition. 

Some M.M. programs require students to pass [[comprehensive exams]] on their area of specialization and subjects such as music history and music theory. The goal of this exam is to ensure that the student has obtained a well-rounded knowledge and understanding that extends beyond their specialization. Since the M.M. is the standard minimum credential to teach applied subjects (performance or composition) at universities and conservatories, it is important that M.M. graduates have this broader understanding of music history and theory.

==Admission requirements==
To be admitted to a M.M. program, most institutions require an undergraduate degree or diploma in music, such as a B.M. or B.A. with a major in music, usually with a grade average of B+ or higher. M.M. programs in performance usually require a live [[audition]] that includes advanced pieces (or for singers, songs) from a wide range of styles, typically ranging from the Baroque era (1600-1750), the Classical music period (1750-1800), the [[Romantic music era]] (1800-1910) to the 20th and/or 21st century. Singers typically perform arias from operas and [[art song]]s, which are typically accompanied by a pianist. Instrumental musicians typically perform solo [[J.S. Bach]] or other unaccompanied repertoire, a movement from a sonata, and a movement from a virtuoso concerto. Instrumentalists who play [[orchestra|orchestral]] instruments (violin family, woodwinds, brass, etc.) may be asked to perform excerpts from the standard orchestral repertoire. Auditionees are typically told which pieces and movements to prepare; some schools even give the bar numbers or rehearsal letters (e.g., Beethoven Symphony no. 5, movement 1, bar 100 to 120).

Some institutions use videotaped recitals or performances as a pre-screening method. This approach helps to eliminate candidates who do not meet the school's minimum performance standards, and as such, it saves those candidates the time and cost of traveling to the institution for an in-person audition, and it also saves the school the cost of having a panel of professors hear the candidate on location. Some universities have multiple audition locations to reduce the traveling expenses faced by candidates. For example, a school located on the west coast of the United States might offer the option of auditioning at a central and eastern US location. The school's professors who form the audition panel travel to these other locations to hear auditionees. Some schools which normally require in-person auditions waive this requirement for students who play the larger instruments (e.g., double bass and tuba), and allow a videotape to be sent instead.

Applicants are typically asked for official transcripts from all post-secondary programs and letters of recommendation from music professors and teachers. For most graduate programs, transcripts of every program or degree are required, whether or not the degree was completed. For students who have started out, but then withdrawn from a number of programs, they may have to request transcripts from many institutions. To protect against applicants changing marks on the transcripts using forgery, most schools require that the transcripts be sent directly from the previous institution's registrar to the music school, or that the transcripts be in sealed envelopes with the other school's registrar's seal (stamp) over the closure. Some programs may also request a statement of intent/statement of purpose or another type of essay, in which the candidate explains why she wishes to be admitted, and sets out her professional, performance or career goals. Some programs may request copies of recital programs from previous performances or a list of performance experience, which may include, for orchestral instrumentalists, orchestra experience. 

In some universities, candidates must also be admitted to the university's [[graduate school]]; as such, applicants may have to achieve a certain mark on [[standardized test]]s, such as the [[GRE]]. Similarly, students from countries where the official language is not that of the university may be required to achieve a certain mark on standardized language tests. For example, students applying to a US M.M. program who come from a country where English is not an official language, may be required to pass the [[Test of English as a Foreign Language]] (TOEFL). Admission to M.M. programs in conducting often requires a video recording of a live rehearsal and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings (audio or video) of live performances.

==Careers==
The M.Mus degree is usually undertaken to prepare students to be professional performers (typically either singers or instrumental musicians), conductors, and composers. As such many recipients of the M.Mus. degree do not seek further formal education after they complete the M.Mus. The M.Mus. is typically the minimum credential that allows them to teach instrumental or vocal performance at universities, colleges, and conservatories (some institutions will also hire teachers who do not have the M.Mus. who hold an Artist's Diploma or similar diploma, and/or who have had a significant performing career as either a solo recitalist, chamber musician or orchestral musician). Some graduates do additional graduate or professional study in other areas, such as a law degree or medical degree. The combination of an M.Mus. and a professional degree could enable the degree holder to work in fields where music and law (or medicine) overlap. Recipients of the M.Mus. may also make use of the general education provided in the degree (e.g., in writing and researching) to get a job in government, university administration, or in the non-profit or [[arts administration]] sector.

Other recipients of the M.Mus. may go on to further graduate studies in music by continuing their M.Mus. specialization in performance or conducting at the doctoral level, by completing a [[Doctor of Musical Arts|DMA]] (Doctor of Musical Arts) degree in those areas. Some students branch out to another area of music at the PhD level, such as musicology or music theory. While PhD programs in musicology and music theory normally require an MA in music, in some cases, students with a M.Mus. in performance or composition who show strong promise may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in musicology or music theory.

As well, some recipients of the M.Mus. degree may go on to do graduate work in another area in which music is a supporting field, such as an Ed.D. in music education (e.g., specializing in music instruction) or a master's degree in Library Science, in order to become a music reference librarian. M.Mus. graduates who wish to pursue graduate studies in an area that is not directly connected with music may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in areas such as [[women's studies]] or [[sociology]], subject to the condition that they complete a list of qualifying courses.

'''''Meow the Jewels''''' is a [[remix album]] by American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo [[Run the Jewels]]. It was released on September 25, 2015, by [[Mass Appeal Records]]. The album, a remix of the duo's original album ''[[Run the Jewels 2]]'', has all instrumentals replaced with sounds of cats.

==Release and promotion==
Run the Jewels, as part of the original album release, offered a series of absurd "deluxe releases" for large sums of money, parodying indulgent "stretch goals" offered on [[crowdfunding]] campaigns on [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name="Check Out The Ridiculous Run The Jewels 2 Deluxe Packages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1705327/check-out-the-ridiculous-run-the-jewels-2-deluxe-packages/news/|title=Check Out The Ridiculous Run The Jewels 2 Deluxe Packages|work=Stereogum|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2016|last=Breihan|first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the less expensive of these was the group creating a remix album using cat sounds; a group of fans launched an online campaign to raise the money to pay the group the requested $40,000 to do this.&lt;ref name="Run The Jewels Might Make A Version Of Their Album With Nothing But Cat Noises"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1705760/run-the-jewels-might-make-a-version-of-their-album-with-nothing-but-cat-noises/news/|title=Run The Jewels Might Make A Version of Their Album With Nothing But Cat Noises|work=Stereogum|date=September 16, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2016|last=Breihan|first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meow the Jewels"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1957344648/meow-the-jewels|title=Meow the Jewels|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign in fact raised over $60,000, which Run the Jewels announced that the duo would be donating to charity.&lt;ref name="Meow the Jewels"/&gt; Several other record producers announced that they would be contributing to the remixes, including [[Just Blaze]], [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]], [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], [[Geoff Barrow]], [[Dan the Automator]] and [[Boots (musician)|Boots]], among others.&lt;ref name="Meow The Jewels Is Happening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1711919/meow-the-jewels-is-happening/news/|title=Meow The Jewels Is Happening|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=October 15, 2014|work=Stereogum|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was released for free on September 25, 2015, while the pre-order for the limited-edition [[Phonograph record|2xLP]] was made available on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/58210-run-the-jewels-drop-meow-the-jewels/|title=Run the Jewels Drop Meow the Jewels|work=Pitchfork|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 26, 2015|last=Camp|first=Zoe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Meow the Jewels'' received generally positive reviews from critics.

Michelle Mohabeer was born in [[Guyana]], [[South America]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Romance of Transgression in Canada: Queering Sexualities,|last=Waugh|first=Thomas|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780773530690|location=Montreal, QU|pages=127, 155, 172, 472|via=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada in 1974 at the age of 13.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Film Fatales: Independent Women Directors|last=Redding|first=Judith M.|last2=Brownworth|first2=Victoria A.|publisher=Seal Press|year=1997|isbn=1-878067-97-4|location=Seattle, WA|pages=104–108|via=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, she successfully received her [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] in [[Film studies|Film Studies]] from [[Carleton University]]. Her second degree was earned in 1998, it was a [[Master of Fine Arts|Master's of Fine Arts]] in [[Film production|Film Production]] from [[York University]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 2005, at the University of Toronto she received a PhD in Culture and Communication with a focus on Film Studies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfmdc.org/user/8430|title=Michelle Mohabeer|last=|first=|date=|website=CFMDC - Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Michelle Mohabeer started her film-making career working for the National Film Board in Studio D,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; she created her first short film ''Exposure'' (1990) for the series ''Five Feminist Minutes''. This film was a huge success, not only for its content, but for the fact that this was "the first up-front [[lesbian]] film from the NFB" and the fact that the film was made by, in the words of Film Critic Thomas Waugh, "lesbian artist of colour in the Canadian canon."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Following the release of her film she had a brief employment with  [[CKLN-FM|CKLN]] [[radio]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Four years later she released her second film ''Coconut/Cane &amp; Cutlass'' (1994); due to the great success of her first film the budget for her second feature was almost nine times larger allowing her to shoot in Canada and Guyana. In 1996, she created two more films ''Two/Doh'' and ''Child-play'' (1997); ''Two/Doh'' was noted for being produced at very low cost, while ''Child-play'' was Mohabeer's first attempt at a drama film.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During the nineteen-nineties she was active on several arts community boards in Toronto, frequently serving as [[Arts administrator|administrator]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the new millennium, Michelle Mohabeer directed several more films, in 2001 she created the film ''Tracing Soul''; in 2003 she wrote and directed the film ''Echoes''. Finally, in 2008, she made the film ''Blu In You.'' &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bab3f1bec|title=Michelle Mohabeer|newspaper=BFI|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her career as a filmmaker Professor Mohabeer has also taught the next generation of filmmakers, she has appeared as a [[guest lecturer]] or hosted workshops at several post-secondary institutions. She has also taught entire classes, namely Film Studies at [[Innis College, Toronto|Innis College]], [[Cinema Studies]] at the University of Toronto, and York University and Film Production at Ryerson University.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Currently, Professor Mohabeer teaches in the [[Communication studies|Communication Studies]] and [[Humanities]] departments at [[York University]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yorku.academia.edu/MichelleMohabeer|title=Michelle Mohabeer {{!}} York University - Academia.edu|last=|first=|date=|website=yorku.academia.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinematic style and influence ==
Many critics have noted that Mohabeer's films frequently explore the themes of "the diversity of cultural identity and the [[politics]] of [[gender]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[colonialism]]."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Film Scholar Tara Atluri, has argued that Mohabeer's films also feature several links to the [[Indo-Caribbean]] film [[tradition]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atluri|first=Tara|year=2009|title=Putting the ‘Cool’ in Coolie: Disidentification, Desire and Dissent in the Work of Filmmaker Michelle Mohabeer.|url=http://www.uwispace.sta.uwi.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2139/15939/T.%20Atluri-%20Putting%20the%20Cool%20in%20Coolie.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=Caribbean Review of Gender Studies|volume=|issue=3|pages=1–25|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension of biogeography to smaller scales—known as "microbial biogeography"—is enabled by ongoing advances in genetic technologies.

The aim of microbial biogeography is to reveal where microorganisms live, at what abundance, and why. Microbial biogeography can therefore provide insight into the underlying mechanisms that generate and hinder [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name = "martiny"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martiny|first1=Jennifer B.

==History==
[[Schewiakoff]] (1893) theorized about the cosmopolitan habitat of free-living protozoans.&lt;ref&gt;Schewiakoff, W.T. 1893. Über die geographische Verbreitung der Süßwasser-protozoen. ''Mem. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Petersb. Ser. VII'' 41, n. 8, 1-201, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/176385#page/771/mode/1up BHL].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, [[Lourens Baas Becking]], based on his own research in California's salt lakes, as well as work by others on salt lakes worldwide,&lt;ref name="Bass1934"&gt;Baas-Becking, L.G.M.

English translation, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hx-dCgAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that "everything is everywhere, but the environment selects".&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the original Dutch: ''"Alles is overal: maar het milieu selecteert"''&lt;/ref&gt; Baas Becking attributed the first half of this hypothesis to his colleague [[Martinus Beijerinck]] (1913).&lt;ref name=staley193&gt;Staley, J.

== Microbial vs macro-organism biogeography ==

The biogeography of macro-organisms (i.e., plants and animals that can be seen with the naked eye) has been studied since the eighteenth century. For macro-organisms, biogeographical patterns (i.e., which organism assemblages appear in specific places and times) appear to arise from both past and current environments. For example, [[polar bears]] live in the [[Arctic]] but not the [[Antarctic]], while the reverse is true for [[penguins]]; although both polar bears and penguins have adapted to cold climates over many generations (the result of past environments), the distance and warmer climates between the north and south poles prevent these species from spreading to the opposite hemisphere (the result of current environments). This demonstrates the biogeographical pattern known as "isolation with geographic distance" by which the limited ability of a species to physically disperse across space (rather than any [[Selection (biology)|selective]] genetic reasons) restricts the geographical range over which it can be found.

The biogeography of [[microorganism]]s (i.e., organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye, such as fungi and bacteria) is an emerging field enabled by ongoing advancements in genetic technologies, in particular cheaper [[DNA sequencing]] with higher throughput that now allows analysis of global datasets on microbial biology at the molecular level. When scientists began studying microbial biogeography, they anticipated a lack of biogeographic patterns due to the high dispersibility and large population sizes of microbes, which were expected to ultimately render geographical distance irrelevant. Indeed, in microbial ecology the oft-repeated saying by [[Lourens Baas Becking]] that “everything is everywhere, but the environment selects” has come to mean that as long as the environment is [[ecologically]] appropriate, [[geological]] barriers are irrelevant.&lt;ref name = "omalley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Malley|first1=Maureen A.|title=The nineteenth century roots of 'everything is everywhere'|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=August 2007|volume=5|issue=8|pages=647–651|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1711|pmid=17603517}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent studies show clear evidence for biogeographical patterns in microbial life, which challenge this common interpretation: the existence of microbial biogeographic patterns disputes the idea that “everything is everywhere” while also supporting the idea that environmental selection includes geography as well as historical events that can leave lasting signatures on microbial communities.&lt;ref name = "martiny" /&gt;

Microbial biogeographic patterns are often similar to those of macro-organisms. Microbes generally follow well-known patterns such as the [[distance decay]] relationship, the [[Occupancy–abundance relationship|abundance-range]] relationship, and [[Rapoport's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=China A.|last2=Fuhrman|first2=Jed A.|last3=Horner-Devine|first3=M. Claire|last4=Martiny|first4=Jennifer B. H.|title=Beyond biogeographic patterns: processes shaping the microbial landscape|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=14 May 2012|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2795|pmid=22580365|volume=10|pages=497–506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "indoor" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amend|first1=A. S.|last2=Seifert|first2=K. A.|last3=Samson|first3=R.|last4=Bruns|first4=T. D.|title=Indoor fungal composition is geographically patterned and more diverse in temperate zones than in the tropics|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=28 June 2010|volume=107|issue=31|pages=13748–13753|doi=10.1073/pnas.1000454107|pmid=20616017|pmc=2922287}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is surprising given the many disparities between microorganisms and macro-organisms, in particular their size ([[micrometers]] vs. meters), time between generations (minutes vs. years), and dispersibility (global vs. local). However, important differences between the biogeographical patterns of microorganism and macro-organism do exist, and likely result from differences in their underlying biogeographic processes (e.g., drift, [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], selection, and [[mutation]]). For example, dispersal is an important biogeographical process for both microbes and larger organisms, but small microbes can disperse across much greater ranges and at much greater speeds by traveling through the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] (for larger animals dispersal is much more constrained due to their size).&lt;ref name = "martiny" /&gt; As a result, many microbial species can be found in both northern and southern hemispheres, while larger animals are typically found only at one pole rather than both.&lt;ref name = "marine" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amend|first1=Anthony S.|last2=Oliver|first2=Tom A.|last3=Amaral-Zettler|first3=Linda A.|last4=Boetius|first4=Antje|last5=Fuhrman|first5=Jed A.|last6=Horner-Devine|first6=M.

== Distinct patterns ==

=== Reversed latitudinal diversity gradient ===
Larger organisms tend to exhibit [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]], with larger biodiversity existing in the tropics and decreasing toward more temperate polar regions. In contrast, a study on indoor fungal communities&lt;ref name = "indoor" /&gt; found microbial biodiversity to be significantly higher in temperate zones than in the tropics. The same study found that drastically different buildings exhibited the same indoor fungal composition in any given location, where similarity increased with proximity. Thus despite human efforts to control indoor climates, outside environments appear to be the strongest determinant of indoor fungal composition.

=== Bipolar latitude distributions ===
Certain microbial populations exist in opposite hemispheres and at complementary latitudes. These ‘bipolar’ (or ‘antitropical’) distributions are much rarer in macro-organisms; although macro-organisms exhibit latitude gradients, ‘isolation by geographic distance’ prevents bipolar distributions (e.g., polar bears are not found at both poles). In contrast, a study on marine surface bacteria&lt;ref name = "marine" /&gt; showed not only a latitude gradient, but also complementarity distributions with similar populations at both poles, suggesting no "isolation by geographic distance". This is likely due to differences in the underlying biogeographic process, dispersal, as microbes tend to disperse at high rates and far distances by traveling through the atmosphere.

=== Seasonal variations ===
Microbial diversity can exhibit striking seasonal patterns at a single geographical location. This is largely due to dormancy, a microbial feature not seen in larger animals that allows microbial community composition to fluctuate in relative abundance of persistent species (rather than actual species present). This is known as the "seed-bank hypothesis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lennon|first1=Jay T.|last2=Jones|first2=Stuart E.|title=Microbial seed banks: the ecological and evolutionary implications of dormancy|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=February 2011|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–130|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2504|pmid=21233850}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has implications for our understanding of ecological resilience and thresholds to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caporaso|first1=J Gregory|last2=Paszkiewicz|first2=Konrad|last3=Field|first3=Dawn|last4=Knight|first4=Rob|last5=Gilbert|first5=Jack A|title=The Western English Channel contains a persistent microbial seed bank|journal=The ISME Journal|date=10 November 2011|volume=6|issue=6|pages=1089–1093|doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.162|pmc=3358019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Directed panspermia ===
[[Panspermia]] suggests that life can be distributed throughout [[outer space]] via [[comets]], [[asteroids]], and [[meteoroids]].  Panspermia assumes that life can survive the harsh space environment, which features vacuum conditions, intense radiation, extreme temperatures, and a dearth of available nutrients. Many microorganisms are able to evade such stressors by forming [[spores]] or entering a state of low-metabolic dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roszak|first1=DB|last2=Colwell|first2=RR|title=Survival strategies of bacteria in the natural environment.|journal=Microbiological Reviews|date=September 1987|volume=51|issue=3|pages=365–79|pmid=3312987|pmc=373117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in microbial biogeography have even shown that the ability of microbes to enter and successfully emerge from dormancy when their respective environmental conditions are favorable contributes to the high levels of microbial biodiversity observed in almost all [[ecosystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=S. E.|last2=Lennon|first2=J. T.|title=Dormancy contributes to the maintenance of microbial diversity|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=15 March 2010|volume=107|issue=13|pages=5881–5886|doi=10.1073/pnas.0912765107|pmid=20231463|pmc=2851880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus microbial biogeography can be applied to panspermia as it predicts that microbes are able to protect themselves from the harsh space environment, know to emerge when conditions are safe, and also take advantage of their dormancy capability to enhance biodiversity wherever they may land.

[[Directed panspermia]] is the deliberate transport of microorganisms to colonize another [[planet]]. If aiming to colonize an Earth-like environment, microbial biogeography can inform decisions on the biological payload of such a mission. In particular, microbes exhibit latitudinal ranges according to [[Rapoport's rule]], which states that organisms living at lower [[latitudes]] (near the [[equator]]) are found within smaller latitude ranges than those living at higher [[latitudes]] (near the poles). Thus the ideal biological payload would include widespread, higher-latitude microorganisms that can tolerate of a wider range of climates. This is not necessarily the obvious choice, as these widespread organisms are also rare in microbial communities and tend to be weaker competitors when faced with [[endemic]] organisms. Still, they can survive in a range of climates and thus would be ideal for inhabiting otherwise lifeless Earth-like planets with uncertain environmental conditions. [[Extremophiles]], although tough enough to withstand the space environment, may not be ideal for directed panspermia as any given extremophile species requires a very specific climate to survive. However, if the target was closer to Earth, such as a planet or moon in our [[Solar System]], it may be possible to select a specific extremophile species for the well-defined target environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6493">'''Microsociology''' is one of the main points (or focuses) of [[sociology]], concerning the nature of everyday human [[social interaction]]s and [[agency (sociology)|agency]] on a small scale: face to face.&lt;ref&gt;Neil J. Smelser, ''Problematics of Sociology'' (1997) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Microsociology is based on interpretative analysis rather than statistical or empirical observation,&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (1972) p. 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; and shares close association with the philosophy of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Methods include [[symbolic interactionism]] and [[ethnomethodology]]; ethnomethodology in particular has led to many academic sub-divisions and studies such as micro[[linguistics|linguistic]]al research and other related aspects of human social behaviour. [[Macrosociology]], by contrast, concerns the [[social structure]] and broader systems.

== Theory ==

Microsociology exists both as an umbrella term for perspectives which focus on agency, such as [[Max Weber]]'s theory of [[social action]], and as a body of distinct techniques, particularly in American sociology. The term was conceived by [[Georges Gurvitch]] in 1939, borrowing the term from the micro-physics and referring to the irreducible and unstable nature of everyday forms of sociality. It also provided an extra dimension between the studies of [[social psychology]], sociology, and [[social anthropology]]—focusing more on individual interaction and thinking within groups, rather than just large social group/societal behaviour. At the micro level, [[social status]] and [[social role]]s are the most important components of social structure. Microsociology forms an important perspective in many fields of study, including modern [[psychosocial]] studies, conversational analysis and human-computer interaction. Microsociology continues to have a profound influence on research in all human fields, often under other names.

==Competing frames of reference==

Some have considered that [[face-to-face interaction]] can be studied in at least three distinct (if overlapping) ways: [[psychology]]; [[intersubjectivity]]; and microsociology.&lt;ref&gt;Smelzer, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] however saw a central tension between [[Durkheim]]ian approaches, and those drawn from [[ethology]], especially in respect of interpersonal ritual;&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, p. 84 and p. 88-9&lt;/ref&gt; while followers of him have seen in a Durkheimian microsociology the key to the understanding of large-scale social conflict as well.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''Interaction Ritual Chains'' (2004) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erving Goffman]]'s Theories of Social Interaction challenged other sociologists to redirect their focus to the questionable aspects of social behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducrion to Sociology|last=Giddens|first=Anthony|publisher=W.W. NORTON|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-92223-3|location=|pages=18,10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to [[Erving Goffman]]'s theory, [[David Émile Durkheim]] believed that advanced methodological principles should guide sociologists and that they should research [[Social fact]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Influences==

[[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], in his work on the phenomenology of social dynamics, ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', written in the late 1950s, called microsociology the only valid theory of human relations.&lt;ref&gt;George J. Stack, ''Satre's Philosophy of Social Existence'' (1977) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]] are two more recent theorists who have put microsociological concepts to good use in their works.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Calhoun et al, ''Contemporary Sociological Theory'' (2012) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==(Humanistic) social work==

Key issues, categories and principles of the microsociology, such as human relations, face-to-face interaction, interpretive/[[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]], [[attachment theory|attachment]] and [[empathy]], micro-level analysis, [[human behavior]], micro-community, everyday human life, human context, [[microculture]],  focus on agency, have influenced and still influences today the [[social work]] theory and practice, having a crucial role in the emergence of [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]] (Petru Stefaroi),&lt;ref name="Stefaroi"&gt;Petru Stefaroi, Humanistic Paradigm of Social Work or Brief Introduction in Humanistic Social Work, ''Social Work Review'' (2012) 10(1) pp. 161-174.&lt;/ref&gt; as response to the [[structural]] and [[system]]ic social work, which theoretically originates from [[macrosociology]] or [[mesosociology]]. This is why [[Humanistic psychology|Malcolm Payne]] considers microsociology a fundamental theoretical-methodological source of this [[postmodern]] and innovative orientation from the contemporary social work, especially of the humanistic social work practice.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;Malcolm Payne, ''Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice'', Chicago: Lyceum, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan (2011) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Research begins by evaluating the social life of the individuals with the goal of showing the reciprocal relationship between events/actions and the nature of the societal context in which they occur.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J.

Empirical evidence from recorded conversations and the microsociology of emotion has proved of particular interest to students of interaction ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

{{continuum mechanics|cTopic=[[Solid mechanics]]}}
'''Mohr–Coulomb theory''' is a [[mathematical model]] (see [[yield surface]]) describing the response of brittle materials such as [[concrete]], or rubble piles, to shear [[Stress (physics)|stress]] as well as normal stress. Most of the classical engineering materials somehow follow this rule in at least a portion of their shear failure envelope.  Generally the theory applies to materials for which the compressive strength far exceeds the tensile strength.&lt;ref&gt;Juvinal, Robert C. &amp; Marshek, Kurt .; Fundamentals of machine component design. – 2nd ed., 1991, pp. 217, {{ISBN|0-471-62281-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geotechnical engineering]] it is used to define  [[Shear strength (soil)|shear strength of soils]] and rocks at different [[effective stress]]es.

In [[structural engineering]] it is used to determine failure load as well as the angle of [[fracture]] of a displacement fracture in concrete and similar materials.  [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]]'s [[friction]] hypothesis is used to determine the combination of shear and normal stress that will cause a fracture of the material. [[Mohr's circle]] is used to determine which principal stresses that will produce this combination of shear and normal stress, and the angle of the plane in which this will occur. According to the [[principle of normality]] the stress introduced at failure will be perpendicular to the line describing the fracture condition.

It can be shown that a material failing according to Coulomb's friction hypothesis will show the displacement introduced at failure forming an angle to the line of fracture equal to the [[angle of friction]]. This makes the strength of the material determinable by comparing the external [[mechanical work]] introduced by the displacement and the external load with the internal mechanical work introduced by the  [[Deformation (mechanics)#strain|strain]] and stress at the line of failure. By [[conservation of energy]] the sum of these must be zero and this will make it possible to calculate the failure load of the construction.

A common improvement of this model is to combine Coulomb's friction hypothesis with [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine's]] principal stress hypothesis to describe a separation fracture.

== History of the development ==
The Mohr–Coulomb theory is named in honour of [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] and [[Christian Otto Mohr]].  Coulomb's contribution was a 1773 essay entitled "''Essai sur une application des règles des maximis et minimis à quelques problèmes de statique relatifs à l'architecture''"
&lt;!--C.A. Coulomb, Essai sur une application des regles des maximis et minimis a quelquels problemesde statique relatifs, a la architecture, Mem. Acad. Roy. Div. Sav., 7, 343–387, 1776.--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;AMIR R. KHOEI;  &lt;u&gt;Computational Plasticity in Powder Forming Processes&lt;/u&gt;;  Elsevier, Amsterdam;  2005;  449 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mohr developed a generalised form of the theory around the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;MAO-HONG YU;  "''Advances in strength theories for materials under complex stress state in the 20th Century''";  &lt;u&gt;Applied Mechanics Reviews&lt;/u&gt;;  American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New York, U.S.A.;  May 2002;  '''55''' (3): pp. 169–218.&lt;/ref&gt;
As the generalised form affected the interpretation of the criterion, but not the substance of it, some texts continue to refer to the criterion as simply the ''''Coulomb criterion''''.&lt;ref&gt;NIELS SAABYE OTTOSEN and MATTI RISTINMAA;  &lt;u&gt;The Mechanics of Constitutive Modeling&lt;/u&gt;;  Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;  2005;  pp. 165ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion ==
[[Image:Mohr Coulomb Yield Surface 3Da.png|300px|right|thumb|Figure 1: View of Mohr–Coulomb failure surface in 3D space of principal stresses for &lt;math&gt;c=2, \phi=-20^\circ&lt;/math&gt;]]
The Mohr–Coulomb&lt;ref&gt;Coulomb, C. A. (1776). ''Essai sur une application des regles des maximis et minimis a quelquels problemesde statique relatifs, a la architecture.'' Mem. Acad. Roy. Div. Sav., vol. 7, pp. 343–387.&lt;/ref&gt; failure criterion represents the linear envelope that is obtained from a plot of the shear strength of a material versus the applied normal stress. This relation is expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tau = \sigma~\tan(\phi) + c
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the shear strength, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the normal stress, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the intercept of the failure envelope with the &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; axis, and &lt;math&gt;tan(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the failure envelope. The quantity &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is often called the '''cohesion''' and the angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''' angle of internal friction '''. Compression is assumed to be positive in the following discussion. If compression is assumed to be negative then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; should be replaced with &lt;math&gt;-\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the Mohr–Coulomb criterion reduces to the [[Yield surface#Tresca yield surface|Tresca criterion]]. On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;\phi = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; the Mohr–Coulomb model is equivalent to the Rankine model. Higher values of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; are not allowed.

From [[Mohr's circle]] we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma = \sigma_m - \tau_m \sin\phi ~;~~ \tau = \tau_m \cos\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau_m = \cfrac{\sigma_1-\sigma_3}{2} ~;~~  \sigma_m = \cfrac{\sigma_1+\sigma_3}{2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum principal stress and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum principal stress.

Therefore, the Mohr–Coulomb criterion may also be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tau_m = \sigma_m \sin\phi + c \cos\phi ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

This form of the Mohr–Coulomb criterion is applicable to failure on a plane that is parallel to the &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; direction.

=== Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion in three dimensions ===
The Mohr–Coulomb criterion in three dimensions is often expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{\begin{align}
  \pm\cfrac{\sigma_1 - \sigma_2}{2} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}{2}\right]\sin(\phi) + c\cos(\phi) \\
  \pm\cfrac{\sigma_2 - \sigma_3}{2} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\sigma_2 + \sigma_3}{2}\right]\sin(\phi) + c\cos(\phi)\\
  \pm\cfrac{\sigma_3 - \sigma_1}{2} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\sigma_3 + \sigma_1}{2}\right]\sin(\phi) + c\cos(\phi).
\end{align}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Yield surface#Mohr – Coulomb yield surface|Mohr–Coulomb failure surface]] is a cone with a hexagonal cross section in deviatoric stress space.

The expressions for &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be generalized to three dimensions by developing expressions for the normal stress and the resolved shear stress on a plane of arbitrary orientation with respect to the coordinate axes (basis vectors). If the unit normal to the plane of interest is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{n} = n_1~\mathbf{e}_1 + n_2~\mathbf{e}_2 + n_3~\mathbf{e}_3
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i,~~ i=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt; are three orthonormal unit basis vectors, and if the principal stresses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; are aligned with the basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt;, then the expressions for &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\tau&lt;/math&gt; are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
    \sigma &amp; = n_1^2 \sigma_{1} + n_2^2 \sigma_{2} + n_3^2 \sigma_{3} \\
    \tau &amp; = \sqrt{(n_1\sigma_{1})^2 + (n_2\sigma_{2})^2 + (n_3\sigma_{3})^2 - \sigma^2} \\
         &amp; = \sqrt{n_1^2 n_2^2 (\sigma_1-\sigma_2)^2 + n_2^2 n_3^2 (\sigma_2-\sigma_3)^2 +
                   n_3^2 n_1^2 (\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)^2}.
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion can then be evaluated using the usual expression
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau = \sigma~\tan(\phi) + c
 &lt;/math&gt;
for the six planes of maximum shear stress.

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i,~~ i=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt; are three orthonormal unit basis vectors.   Then the traction vector on the plane is given by

== Mohr–Coulomb failure surface in Haigh–Westergaard space ==
The Mohr–Coulomb failure (yield) surface is often expressed in [[Yield surface#Invariants used in yield functions|Haigh–Westergaad coordinates]]. For example, the function
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\sigma_1-\sigma_3}{2} = \cfrac{\sigma_1+\sigma_3}{2}~\sin\phi + c\cos\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \left[\sqrt{3}~\sin\left(\theta+\cfrac{\pi}{3}\right) - \sin\phi\cos\left(\theta+\cfrac{\pi}{3}\right)\right]\rho - \sqrt{2}\sin(\phi)\xi = \sqrt{6} c \cos\phi.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, in terms of the [[Yield surface#Invariants used in yield functions|invariants]] &lt;math&gt;p, q, r&lt;/math&gt; we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left[\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}~\cos\phi}~\sin\left(\theta+\cfrac{\pi}{3}\right) - \cfrac{1}{3}\tan\phi~\cos\left(\theta+\cfrac{\pi}{3}\right)\right]q - p~\tan\phi = c
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
  \theta = \cfrac{1}{3}\arccos\left[\left(\cfrac{r}{q}\right)^3\right] ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of alternative forms of Mohr–Coulomb yield function
|-
|We can express the yield function
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\sigma_1-\sigma_3}{2} = \cfrac{\sigma_1+\sigma_3}{2}~\sin\phi + c\cos\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_1~\cfrac{(1-\sin\phi)}{2~c~\cos\phi} - \sigma_3~\cfrac{(1+\sin\phi)}{2~c~\cos\phi} = 1 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The [[Yield surface#Invariants used in yield functions|Haigh–Westergaard invariants]] are related to the principal stresses by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_1 = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}~\xi + \sqrt{\cfrac{2}{3}}~\rho~\cos\theta ~;~~
  \sigma_3 = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}~\xi + \sqrt{\cfrac{2}{3}}~\rho~\cos\left(\theta+\cfrac{2\pi}{3}\right) ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Plugging into the expression for the Mohr–Coulomb yield function gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
  -\sqrt{2}~\xi~\sin\phi + \rho[\cos\theta - \cos(\theta+2\pi/3)] - \rho\sin\phi[\cos\theta+\cos(\theta+2\pi/3)] = \sqrt{6}~c~\cos\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
Using trigonometric identities for the sum and difference of cosines and rearrangement gives us the expression of the Mohr–Coulomb yield function in terms of &lt;math&gt;\xi, \rho, \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

We can express the yield function in terms of &lt;math&gt;p,q&lt;/math&gt; by using the relations
:&lt;math&gt;
   \xi = \sqrt{3}~p ~;~~ \rho = \sqrt{\cfrac{2}{3}}~q
 &lt;/math&gt;
and straightforward substitution.

For a charge distribution an integral over the region containing the charge is equivalent to an infinite summation, treating each infinitesimal element of space as a point charge dq.

For a linear charge distribution (a good approximation for charge in a wire) where &lt;math&gt;\lambda(\mathbf{r^\prime})&lt;/math&gt; gives the charge per unit length at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;dl^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal element of length,

&lt;math&gt; dq = \lambda(\mathbf{r^\prime})dl^\prime&lt;/math&gt; [10]

For a surface charge distribution (a good approximation for charge on a plate in a parallel plate capacitor) where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{r^\prime})&lt;/math&gt; gives the charge per unit area at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, and dA^\prime is an infinitesimal element of area,

&lt;math&gt;dq = \sigma(\mathbf{r^\prime})\,dA^\prime\,&lt;/math&gt;

For a volume charge distribution (such as charge within a bulk metal) where &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;) gives the charge per unit volume at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;dV^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal element of volume,

&lt;math&gt;dq = \rho(\mathbf{r^\prime})\,dV^\prime&lt;/math&gt;[9]

The force on a small test charge &lt;math&gt;q^\prime&lt;/math&gt; at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q^\prime\int dq {\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r^\prime} \over |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r^\prime}|^3}&lt;/math&gt;

== Mohr–Coulomb yield and plasticity ==
The Mohr–Coulomb yield surface is often used to model the plastic flow of geomaterials (and other cohesive-frictional materials). Many such materials show dilatational behavior under triaxial states of stress which the Mohr–Coulomb model does not include. Also, since the yield surface has corners, it may be inconvenient to use the original Mohr–Coulomb model to determine the direction of plastic flow (in the [[plasticity theory|flow theory of plasticity]]).

A common approach is to use a '''non-associated''' plastic flow potential that is smooth. An example of such a potential is the function{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

:&lt;math&gt;
   g:= \sqrt{(\alpha c_\mathrm{y} \tan\psi)^2 + G^2(\phi, \theta)~ q^2} - p \tan\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter, &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm{y}&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; when the plastic strain is zero (also called the '''initial cohesion yield stress'''), &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the angle made by the yield surface in the '''Rendulic plane''' at high values of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (this angle is also called the '''dilation angle'''), and &lt;math&gt;G(\phi,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate function that is also smooth in the deviatoric stress plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2602">'''Movement Concept''' is a modern system of learning and teaching with traditional roots which imparts inner and outer movement in the broadest sense.

==Background==
Movement Concept was created by [[Ingo Taleb Rashid]] and derives its fundamental principles from dance and theatre methods from East and West  (e.g. [[Butoh]], [[Noh]], [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislawski Method]]), martial arts (e.g. Ninpo, [[Capoeira]]) and the ancient
tradition of [[Sufism]], the spiritual principles of which are transferred into modern body work.
The idea behind Movement Concept is to tap a person’s full potential, to use exhaustively the
diversity of the body’s capacity for movement and expression, to make these accessible and use them for stage work and, at the same time, increases our awareness of it.
An essential part of the system is “play”, in which two people apply the acquired technique and abilities in free improvisation inside a protective circle of participants.

==Three-year Ongoing Curricular Training==
Movement Concept is intended as a practical educational training system combining bodywork, performing arts and spirituality. It is meant for all people who want to deal more deeply with these topics – regardless of age, experience or previous
knowledge. It is also suitable as advanced training for performers in the areas of dance, directing and choreography.
The Movement Concept curriculum spans three years (approx. 30 days of training each year).
Before entering into training, a personal conversation with the educational director is required.
The training concludes with a written assignment and a demonstration lesson.
After successful completion of the curriculum, participants receive a diploma that certifies the qualification
to teach Movement Concept under supervision of El Haddawi.

==Some Topics==
*Magic of the Body
*Dance, Improvisation and Choreography
*The Triangle of Intention
*The Dancing Warrior
*Living Anatomy, Health and Prevention of Injuries
*A Practical Introduction to the History of Dance
*Spirituality in Dance
*Stage-fright and Presence
*The Art of Flying and Falling
*Beyond the Masks – the Versatile Actor

In [[civil engineering]] and [[construction]], the '''neat volume''' is a theoretical amount of material.

For [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], it can refer to the volume either before native material is disturbed by [[Excavator|excavation]], or after placement and compaction is complete. A percentage is typically added to neat volume to estimate loose (i.e. uncompacted) volumes for [[procurement]] purposes.

With [[concrete]] work, neat volume is calculated assuming there is no bowing in the [[formwork]], or, for cast-in-place concrete, that the surfaces in contact with the concrete have no voids or imperfections that would require a greater volume of concrete to fill.

[[File:Nesting Rect.png|thumb|Image 1: Simple rectangular nesting]][[File:Nesting Rot.png|thumb|Image 2: Improved Nesting with rotated parts]]
[[File:Nesting Opt.png|thumb|Image 3: Minimizing waste by mixing different parts]]

In manufacturing industry, '''Nesting''' refers to the process of laying out cutting patterns to minimize the [[raw material]] waste. Examples include manufacturing parts from flat raw material such as [[sheet metal]].

Such efforts can also be applied to additive manufacturing, such as [[3D printing]]. Here the advantages sought can include minimizing tool movement that is not producing product, or maximizing how many pieces can be fabricated in one build season. One difference from nesting of cut pieces is that 3D parts often have a cross section that changes with height, which can cause interference between adjacent parts as they are built up.

==Process==
To minimize the amount of [[scrap]] raw material produced during cutting, companies use proprietary nesting [[software]]. The software analyses the parts (shapes) to be produced at a particular time. Using  [[algorithm]]s, it then determines how to lay these parts out in such a way as to produce the required quantities of parts, while minimizing the amount of raw material wasted. Off-the-shelf nesting software packages address the optimization needs. While some cater only to rectangular nesting, others offer profile or shape nesting where the parts required can be any odd shape. These irregular parts can be created using popular [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) tools. Most of the profile nesting software can read IGES or DXF profile files automatically, a few of them work with built-in converters. An important consideration in shape nesting is to verify that the software in question actually performs true profile nesting and not just block nesting. In block nesting an imaginary rectangle is drawn around the shape and then the rectangles are laid side-by side which actually is not profile nesting. There remains scope for waste reduction.

Nesting software must take into account the limitations and features of the [[machining]] technology in use, such as: &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sigmanest.com/2017/02/choosing-the-right-nesting-engine/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Machining cannot take place where the raw material is clamped into place;
* Some machines can access only half of the material at a particular time; the machine automatically flips the sheet over to allow the remaining half to be accessed;
* When punching, the width of the punch tool must be considered;
* Shearing may be permitted only in certain areas of the sheet due to limitations of the machinery;


Nesting software may also have to take into account material characteristics, such as: &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sigmanest.com/images/pdfs/AutoNEST_NoSh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://files.jetcam.net/pdf/expert_new.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* Defects on material that must be discarded;
* Different quality areas that must match corresponding quality levels required for different parts;
* Direction constraints, that may come from a printed pattern or from fiber direction;

Many machine manufacturers offer their own custom nesting software designed to offer ease of use and take full advantage of the features of their specific machines.

If a fabricator operates machines from more than one vendor, they may prefer to use an [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] nesting package from a third-party vendor. They then have the potential to run jobs on any available machine, and their staff should not have to learn several different software packages.

The '''Oregon Forest Resources Institute'''  (OFRI) is an educational organization based in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] dedicated to [[forestry]] issues, including improving public understanding of the state's forest resources and encouraging environmentally sound [[forest management]]. It provides education, training and publications for forest landowners, students and teachers, and the general public. It also produces research on forest science and current issues.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= About OFRI |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; OFRI's seven-member staff is located in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].&lt;ref name=Contact&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/ContactInformation.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= Contact OFRI |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
OFRI was created by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] in 1991 and is funded by a dedicated [[Forest product|forest-products]] harvest tax.&lt;ref name=About/&gt; It is governed by a 13-member board of directors who represent small, medium and large forest producers, small woodland owners, forest sector employees, academia and the general public. The [[Oregon Department of Forestry|Oregon State Forester]] appoints 11 members. The others are ex officio: the dean of [[Oregon State University]] College of Forestry and a public representative appointed by the president of the [[Oregon State Senate]] and speaker of the [[Oregon House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=Board&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/BoardofDirectors.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= Board of Directors |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of Directors&lt;ref name="Board"/&gt;==
The Board of Directors consists entirely of representatives from the timber industry.

The state forester appoints 11 dedicated individuals to a board of directors that governs the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The state forester is charged by statute with soliciting nominations and appointing the following board members: nine representatives of producer classes, with three each from small (Class 1), medium (Class 2) and large (Class 3) producers; one member representing small woodland owners; and one representative for forest industry employees.

Ex officio members required by statute include the dean of the Oregon State University College of Forestry and a public member appointed jointly by the president of the Oregon Senate and the speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives.

Board members appointed by the state forester serve three-year terms. 
Current OFRI board members (as of January 2016) are as follows:

Class 1:  producers are defined by rule as those paying the harvest tax on 20 million board feet per year or less. 
Class 2: producers are those paying tax on more than 20 million per year but less than 100 million board feet. 
Class 3: producers pay tax on 100 million board feet per year or more.
Small woodland owners: are defined as those who own between 100 and 2,000 acres of forestland and who have no direct financial interest in any forest products processing activity.

Current members include:

Matt Hegerberg - WyEast Timber Services, LLC

Jennifer Phillipi - Perpetua Forests Company

Quincy Powers - Powers Ranch Company

Tyler Freres - Freres Lumber Company, Inc.

David Fartwangler - Cascade Timber Consulting, Inc.

David Hampton - Hampton Lumber

Jim Hunt - Campbell Global, LLC

Steve McNulty - [[Weyerhaeuser]]

Audrey Barnes - Nickel Mountain, LLC

Mike Sullivan - [[Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers]]

Ex Officio Member - Thomas Maness - Dean, [[Oregon State University]] School of Forestry

Ex Officio Member - Randy Schild - Tillamook School District no. 9

==Advertising Campaigns==
OFRI has purchased several prominent advertising campaigns in the state of Oregon. These campaigns are paid for with taxpayer dollars. In 2015 OFRI spent $1.05 million in taxpayer funds.&lt;ref name="TAX-DOLLAR TIMBER INDUSTRY ADVERTISING FACES SCRUTINY IN OREGON"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://invw.org/2015/09/09/tax-dollar-timber-industry-advertising-faces-scrutiny-in-oregon |title= TAX-DOLLAR TIMBER INDUSTRY ADVERTISING FACES SCRUTINY IN OREGON |publisher= Investigate West}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016-2017 the advertising campaigns have focused on promoting a [[corporate website]] created by OFRI, http://oregonforestlaws.org/

==Landowner education==
OFRI provides workshops, publications and conferences focused on recent science and advances in forest management practices. Its programs are available to both large and small forestland owners.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/assets/media/pdf/0910_annualrpt.pdf.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= 2009-2010 Annual Report |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student and teacher education==
OFRI's K-12 forestry education programs reach more than 100,000 students and more than 1,000 educators annually.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt; Its Oregon Forest Literacy Program includes a forest education conceptual framework correlated with state education standards that offer educators guidance for developing classroom lessons related to forests. Student programs include classroom presentations, career events, publications, field tours and activities. Teacher training also includes support for workshops and conferences.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

OFRI manages the Rediscovery Forest, a forested area used for educational purposes and to demonstrate diverse Oregon wildlife habitat and [[forest ecology|forest ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=Disc&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/rediscovery |title= Rediscovery Forest |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rediscovery Forest is located in the [[Oregon Garden]], in [[Silverton, Oregon|Silverton]].

==Public education==
To increase public understanding about Oregon forests and their management, OFRI produces educational spots aired on broadcast and cable television; print, radio and Internet advertising; and online newsletters.&lt;ref name=Facts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/FactsAndResources/Videos.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= FactsAndResources/Videos |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a [[speakers bureau]], and co-sponsors and supports conferences and forest field trips.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

==Publications==
OFRI maintains a library of approximately 70 titles that includes special reports, fact sheets, research reports, pocket reference guides and career information, all available at OFRI's website.&lt;ref name=Facts/&gt;  It publishes an annual report each year in the fall.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

[[Image:Lilium regale1UME.jpg|thumb|150px|''Lilium regale'']] 
[[Image:Crocus Bonte Krokus.jpg|thumb|150px|A group of crocuses (''Crocus'') in flower]]
'''Ornamental bulbous plants''', often called '''ornamental bulbs''' or just '''bulbs''' in [[gardening]] and [[horticulture]], are [[herbaceous]] [[Perennial plant|perennials]] grown for ornamental purposes, which have underground or near ground [[storage organs]]. Botanists distinguish between true [[bulb]]s, [[corms]], [[rhizome]]s, [[tuber|tubers and tuberous roots]], any of which may be termed "bulbs" in horticulture. Bulb species usually lose their upper parts during adverse conditions such as summer drought and heat or winter cold. The bulb's storage organs contain moisture and nutrients that are used to survive these adverse conditions in a dormant state. When conditions become favourable the reserves sustain a new growth cycle. In addition, bulbs permit vegetative or asexual multiplication in these species.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}} Ornamental bulbs are used in [[park]]s and [[gardens]] and as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]].{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}}

==Terminology==

The word "bulb" has a somewhat different meaning to [[botany|botanists]] than it does to gardeners and [[horticulture|horticulturalists]]. In the context of gardening, a "bulb" is a plant's underground or ground-level storage organ that can be dried, stored and sold in this state, and then planted to grow again. Many bulbs in this sense are produced by "[[storage organ|geophyte]]s", i.e. plants whose growing point is below ground level. However, not all bulbs in the gardening sense are produced by geophytes. For example, [[rhizome|rhizomatous]] [[Iris (plant)|irises]] are included in books on ornamental bulbs, but their growing points are above ground. Many bulbs are produced by [[lilioid monocots]], but not all lilioid monocots have bulbs. [[Brian Mathew]] says that "we just have to accept that there is no accurate term which we can use for this group of plants and we are left with 'bulbs' as the snappiest and most convenient."{{sfn|Mathew|1997|p=1}}

Botanically, gardeners' "bulbs" may be true bulbs, corms, rhizomes or tubers,{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}} or combinations of these.

==Types==

===True bulbs===
[[File:Red onion cut labelled.svg|thumb|Bulb of a red onion, cut vertically]]
{{main|Bulb}}
A true [[bulb]] (i.e. a bulb in the botanical sense) is an underground vertical [[shoot]] that has modified [[leaf|leaves]] (or thickened leaf bases) that are used as [[food]] storage organs by the plant. The bottom of the bulb is made up of a short section of stem forming the basal plate. Storage leaves are produced from the top of the basal plate, roots from the underside.&lt;ref name=Ster06/&gt; Other examples of species with true bulbs, apart from those already mentioned, are ''[[Muscari]], [[Tulipa]] and [[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]''.{{sfn|Schauenberg|1965|p=2}}

===Corms===
[[File:CormAnatomy5686.jpg|thumb|''[[Crocosmia]]'' corm, showing solid construction with outer tunic and shoots emerging from the top ]]
{{main|Corm}}
A [[corm]] is a short, vertical, swollen underground [[plant]] [[Plant stem|stem]] consisting of one or more [[internodes]] with at least one growing point, with protective leaves modified into skins or tunics.  The thin tunic leaves are dry papery, dead sheaths, formed from the leaves produced the year before. They act as a covering that protects the corm from insects and water loss. Internally a corm is mostly made of starch-containing [[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] cells above a more-or-less circular basal node that grows roots. Corms are sometimes confused with true bulbs; they are often similar in appearance to bulbs externally, but corms are internally structured with solid tissues, which distinguishes them from bulbs, which are mostly made up of layered fleshy scales.&lt;ref name=Ster06/&gt;

===Rhizomes===
[[File:Gingembre.jpg|thumb|Dried ginger rhizome]]
{{main|Rhizome}}
A rhizome is a horizontal [[plant stem|stem]] that often grows underground, usually sending out [[root]]s and [[shoot]]s from its nodes. Some plants have rhizomes that grow above ground or that lie at the soil surface, including some ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' species. Usually, rhizomes have short internodes; they send out roots from the bottom of the nodes and new upward-growing shoots from the top of the nodes. Examples of plants that grow in this way include [[iris (plant)|iris]]es, [[lily of the valley]] (''Convallaria majalis'') and [[Canna (plant)|cannas]].&lt;ref name=Ster06/&gt;

===Tubers===
[[File:Root tubers of Dahlia variabilis.png|thumb|Root tubers of ''Dahlia'']]
{{main|Tuber}}

A [[stem tuber]] may form from thickened [[rhizome]]s or [[stolon]]s. The tops or sides of the tuber produce shoots that grow into typical stems and leaves, and the undersides produce [[root]]s. Such tubers tend to form at the sides of the parent plant and are most often located near the soil surface. A below ground stem tuber is normally a short-lived storage and regenerative organ developing from a shoot that branches off a mature plant. The new tubers are attached to a parent tuber or form at the end of an underground rhizome. In the autumn the plant dies except for the new offspring stem tubers, which in spring regrow one or more new shoots producing stems and leaves. Some plants also form smaller tubers and/or tubercules, which act like [[seed]]s, producing small plants that resemble (in morphology and size) seedlings. Some stem tubers, such as those of tuberous [[begonia]]s, are long lived, but many tuberous plants have tubers that survive only until the plants are in full leaf, at which point the tuber is reduced to a shrivelled up husk.&lt;ref name=Ster06/&gt;

Roots can also form tuberous structures (tuberous roots) that are in some ways similar to stem tubers, but of a different anatomical origin. Ornamental plants with tuberous roots include the Persian buttercup, ''[[Ranunculus asiaticus]]'',{{sfn|Mathew|1997|pp=133–134}} and [[dahlia]]s.{{sfn|Mathew|1997|p=84}} When sold in the dry form, dahlia "bulbs" consist of a cluster of tuberous roots attached to one or more stems. Only the stems produce buds, from around the "collar" close to where the roots are attached. A tuber without any attached stem will not grow.&lt;ref name=Scha65/&gt;

Tubers may form from the [[hypocotyl]] of the young seedling, as in ''[[Cyclamen]]''.&lt;ref name=Grey88/&gt; Since the hypocotyl is a region between the stem and the roots, such tubers are variable in their anatomy and growth habits. Thus the roots of ''[[Cyclamen graecum]]'' grow from the base of the tuber, suggesting it is a stem tuber, whereas those of ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' mostly grow from the upper surface of the tuber, suggesting it is a root tuber.{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=12}}

==Environmental adaptations and distribution==

Annual species complete their life cycle during favourable seasons and pass unfavourable ones as seeds. Bulbous plants, on the other hand, have developed storage organs as a reserve to allow them to survive unfavourable conditions in a resting condition in order to begin growth again when environmental conditions become more favourable.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} The dormant or resting period may be in summer or winter, or may depend on rainfall, as in the tropics.{{sfn|Mathew|1997|pp=6–7}} The different strategies enable bulbous plants to survive adverse conditions such as extremely hot and dry summers, very cold winters, or periods of drought.

===Summer dormancy===

[[File:Crocus cartwrightianus Sounion 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'' flowering on 15 November in Greece]]

Most bulbous plants are adapted to hot, dry summers and cooler, wetter winters. They are dormant through the summer and grow during the autumn, winter and spring.{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=43}} Within this group, there are variations, largely determined by how cold the winter is. Many [[tulip]]s (''Tulipa'' species) of Asian origins, for example, have adapted to an extreme continental climate, with dry, very hot summers, very cold winters and springs with short showers. They grow mainly during the spring.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} In cultivation such tulips may be planted in late autumn (e.g. November in the northern hemisphere).{{sfn|Schauenberg|1965|p=267}} In regions where winters are milder, some species, such as ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'', flower in the autumn, either at the same time as the leaves appear or before.{{sfn|Mathew|1987|p=56}} Others, such as ''[[Arum creticum]]'', produce leaves in the autumn which last through the winter until the plant flowers in the spring.{{sfn|Mathew|1987|p=13}}

Summer drought occurs particularly, but not exclusively, in those regions of the world with a [[Mediterranean climate]], which are rich in bulbous plants. Such regions include the [[Mediterranean]] itself through to [[Central Asia]], the south west of [[South Africa]], the south west of [[Australia]], parts of the western United States, such as [[California]], and parts of western South America, particularly [[Chile]].{{sfn|Mathew|1997|pp=6–7}}

[[Image:Little Chittenden Wood - geograph.org.uk - 1861070.jpg|thumb|A [[bluebell wood]] in [[Kent]], England]]
Many species that grow in the [[understory]] of deciduous woods or forests are also summer dormant. They use their stored reserves in order to grow rapidly and complete their annual growth-cycle at the beginning of spring before the developing tree canopy blocks out the sun's light.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} North America is home to many such woodland bulbs, including ''[[Erythronium]]'', ''[[Trillium]]'' and some lilies, such as ''[[Lilium pardalinum]]''.{{sfn|Rix|1983|pp=128–130}} The common bluebell, ''[[Hyacinthoides non-scripta]]'', is native to western parts of Europe, but particularly the British Isles,&lt;ref name=NHM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/biodiversity/endangered-species/hyacinthoides-non-scripta/distribution-ecology/index.html |title=''Hyacinthoides non-scripta'' (British bluebell) &gt; Distribution and ecology |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |author=Fred Rumsey |work=Species of the day |accessdate=2013-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it carpets the floor of some woods. The woodlands of Asia, including [[China]] and [[Japan]], are home to bulbous plants such as [[arisaema]]s and the giant [[cardiocrinum]]s.{{sfn|Rix|1983|pp=128–130}}

Some bulbous plants grow in [[Community (ecology)|communities]] that are adapted to recurrent fires during the dry season (for example, many [[Iridaceae]] species). During these periods the plants are dormant and in this way can survive the heat of the fire. The fires clean the surface vegetation, eliminating competition and also supplying nutrients to the ground from the ashes of the burnt plants. When the first rains fall, the bulbs, corms and rhizomes rapidly start to shoot, starting a new period of growth and development sustained by the reserves accumulated in their storage tissues during the previous season.  Various South African species from the genus ''[[Cyrtanthus]]'', for example, are well known for their ability to flower rapidly after natural grassland wildfires, and for this reason several of these species are known as "fire lilies". In fact, some species, such as ''[[Cyrtanthus contractus]]'', only flower after a wildfire.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt;

===Winter dormancy===

[[File:Eucomis bicolor 2191.JPG|thumb|''[[Eucomis comosa]]'', a winter dormant bulbous plant]]
A second category of bulbous plants are those adapted to dry, generally cool winters and warmer, wetter summers. They are dormant through the winter and grow in spring, summer and autumn. Regions of South Africa and [[Lesotho]] with this type of climate include the East Cape, and the [[Drakensberg]] mountains in the north east of [[Western Cape]] province, which are particularly rich in bulbous species,{{sfn|Phillips|Rix|1989}} including plants such as [[Gladiolus|gladioli]], ''[[Eucomis]]'' and ''[[Rhodohypoxis]]''. Other areas with similar winter drought include parts of Central America, such as [[Mexico]] where the tiger flower (''[[Tigridia pavonia]]'') is found.{{sfn|Mathew|1997|p=11–12}}

===Seasonal dormancy===

In some areas of the tropics, rainfall is interspersed with periods of dryness; more than one wet/dry cycle may occur in a year. Bulbous plants in these areas are adapted to warm, wet periods followed by warm, dry periods. They typically flower near the beginning of the rainy season. Such a climate occurs in Kenya, which has wet conditions in October to December and then again in February to May. Glory-lilies (''[[Gloriosa (plant)|Gloriosa]]'') and ''[[Crinum]]'' species are examples of bulbous plants adapted to these conditions. Tropical Asia has similarly adapted bulbous plants, such as species of ''[[Hedychium]]'' (gingers).{{sfn|Rix|1983|pp=89–92}}

== History of use ==

Plants with fleshy underground parts were probably first used as food. [[Onion]]s (''Allium cepa'') were cultivated in [[Ancient Egypt]]. In [[South America]], the [[potato]] (''Solanum tuberosum''), [[Oxalis tuberosa|oca]] (''Oxalis tuberosa'') and the [[sweet potato]] (''Ipomoea batatas'') were cultivated for thousands of years.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} Other parts of bulbous plants were also used in cooking. The [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s of [[Crete]] grew and traded [[saffron]] (either the wild species ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'' or the cultivated ''Crocus sativus''). The plant is depicted in paintings from around 1550 BC.{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=93}} Saffron consists of the dried [[stigma (botany)|stigmas]] of the flowers, and is used as a spice and also as a dye.{{sfn|Mathew|1987|p=56}} Some bulbous plants were used in medicine in [[Classical antiquity|classical times]]; one example is the [[Drimia maritima|sea squill]] (''Drimia maritima'') which grows from a true bulb.{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=93}}

[[Image:Fresque_du_printemps,_Akrotiri,_Grèce.jpg|thumb|Lilies on a Bronze Age fresco from excavations at Akrotriri, [[Santorini]], Greece]]
Wall paintings dated to around 1700–1600 BC from [[Santorini#Minoan Akrotiri|Minoan Akrotiri]] provide some of the earliest evidence for the apparently ornamental use of bulbous plants. Some of the plants in the frescos are clearly lilies, which have usually been identified as ''[[Lilium candidum]]''. However, this species has white flowers, and those in the frescos are red, which suggests they may be ''[[Lilium chalcedonicum]]''.&lt;ref name=Nuge08/&gt; ''L.&amp;nbsp;candidum'', the Madonna lily, was later used as a symbol in Christianity, where the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] was represented with lilies in her hands.{{sfn|Schauenberg|1965|p=204}} The symbol of the Fleur de Lys was originally based on the flower of a species of [[Iris (plant)|Iris]] ''([[Iris pseudacorus]]'') that appeared in Egyptian and Indian religious paintings long before it was adopted as the emblem of the kings of France in the 5th Century.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Many ornamental bulbs were introduced into Europe via [[Turkey]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent]] (who reigned 1520–1566) was noted for his love of gardens, where tulips and other bulbs were grown. [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], the ambassador to the sultan from [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand I]] in Vienna, observed ornamental bulbous plants such as narcissi, hyacinths and "those which the Turks call tulipam".{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=93}} The botanist [[Carolus Clusius]], who was based in Vienna from 1573 to around 1580, devoted one volume of his 1576 botanical work ''Rariorum Plantarum Historia'' to bulbs, some of which he knew from introductions via Turkey, such as tulips, ''[[Iris susiana]]'', ''[[Galanthus elwesii]]'' and ''[[Fritillaria persica]]''. Clusius had a major impact on bulb growing in Europe. Through his later position as the Director of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Leiden Botanic Garden]], he established the Netherlands as the centre of commercial ornamental bulb growing.{{sfn|Rix|1983|pp=94–95}}

It is therefore apparent that bulbous plants have served as food and symbols of religion and royal power for thousands of years. They have also been admired and used for the beauty of their flowers since time immemorial and by many civilizations. The list of the countries that have used bulbous plants as ornaments since the Christian era is long and includes [[Greece]], [[Egypt]], [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[India]] among others. The list of genera cultivated in these countries as ornamental plants is even longer: ''[[Lycoris (plant)|Lycoris]],'' ''[[Lilium]], [[Crocus]], [[Cyclamen]], [[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]], [[Scilla]], [[Gladiolus]], [[Muscari]], [[Ranunculus]], [[Allium]], [[Iris (plant)|Iris]] and [[Hyacinth (plant)|Hyacinthus]]''.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}}

==Bulbous plants in the garden==
Some varieties of bulbous plants thrive under adverse conditions such as poor soil or shade, and are therefore well suited to use in a garden. Varieties can be chosen that bloom at various times of year. They can be intermingled with other plants, used in pots, or even placed in the lawn or underneath fruit trees.{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}}{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}

Regarding their size, it is possible to find species that only grow a few centimetres such as ''[[Crocus minimus]]'' up to examples of 3.6m such as ''[[Cardiocrinum giganteum]]''.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Taylor|1996}}

While some bulbs are poisonous or at least inedible to humans,{{examples|date=February 2017}} many bulbs – especially those of the [[onion]] family ([[leeks]], [[garlic]], [[chives]], [[shallots]]) – are grown both privately and commercially as food crops. The onion especially provides the basis for a huge variety of dishes.

=== Flowerbeds and borders ===

Bulb species are traditionally planted in flowerbeds ([[parterre]]s) and [[herbaceous border]]s in parks and gardens. The selection of species to plant depends on various factors, such as the soil type, the position (sunny or shady location), the colour or effect that is required and the season of the year when the plants are required to flower.
[[Image:Tulips 09148.jpg|thumb|Border of tulips planted among [[pansy|pansies]]]]
Some examples of bulbous plant genera and their flowering season are given below:
* Spring flowering bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International bulb center spring blooming bulbs|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/spring-blooming-bulbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spring Flowering Bulbs Picture Book|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/photos/Spring-flowering-Picture-Book.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring is the most typical season for bulbs to flower. Some examples are: ''[[Allium]], [[Arum]], [[Asphodelus]], [[Camassia]], [[Convallaria]], [[Crocus]], [[Cyclamen]], [[Eranthis]], [[Freesia]], [[Fritillaria]], [[Galanthus]], [[Hyacinth (plant)|Hyacinth]]us, [[Hippeastrum]], [[Iris (plant)|Iris]], [[Ixia]], [[Leucojum]], [[Muscari]], [[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]], [[Ornithogalum]], [[Ranunculus]], [[Scilla]], [[Trillium]] and [[Tulipa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tulip Picture Book|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/photos/Tulip-book.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Zephyranthes]]''.
* Summer flowering bulbs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International bulb center summer blooming bulbs|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/summer-blooming-bulbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer Flowering Bulbs Picture Book|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/photos/Summer-flowering-bulbs-Picture-Book.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Achimenes]], [[Agapanthus]], [[Allium]], [[Alstroemeria]], [[Amaryllis]], [[Anemone]], [[Begonia]], [[Calochortus]], [[Canna (plant)|Canna]], [[Crinum]], [[Crocosmia]], [[Dahlia]], [[Dierama]], [[Eucomis]], [[Galtonia]], [[Gladiolus]], [[Gloriosa (plant)|Gloriosa]], [[Haemanthus]], [[Hymenocallis]], [[Lilium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lily Picture Book|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/photos/Lily-book.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxalis]], [[Pancratium (plant)|Pancratium]], [[Paradisea]], [[Polianthes]], [[Sprekelia]], [[Tritonia (plant)|Tritonia]], [[Watsonia (plant)|Watsonia]], [[Zantedeschia]].''
* Autumn (fall) flowering bulbs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International bulb center autumn blooming bulbs|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/autumn-blooming-bulbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crocus]], [[Colchicum]], [[Cyclamen]], [[Nerine]], [[Sternbergia]].''
* Winter flowering bulbs: some species from the following genera: ''[[Galanthus]], [[Crocus]], [[Cyclamen]]'' and ''[[Eranthis]].''

Some species of bulbous plants grow naturally in shady or woodland areas, and thus are well suited to areas in a garden that have similar conditions. Some species for shade are ''[[Allium ursinum]], [[Anemone blanda]], [[Anemone nemorosa]], [[Arum italicum]], [[Convallaria majalis]], [[Corydalis flexuosa]],  [[Cyclamen purpurascens]], Disporum flavescens, [[Erythronium]], [[Fritillaria pallidiflora]], [[Galanthus]], [[Hyacinthoides non-scripta]], [[Iris douglasiana]], Leucojum vernum, [[Lilium martagon]], [[Ranunculus ficaria]], [[Sanguinaria canadensis]], [[Smilacina racemosa]], [[Trillium]]'' and ''[[Uvularia grandiflora]]''.

=== Naturalization   ===

In large parks it is possible to plant some species so that they multiply spontaneously and grow amongst the grass or under trees. This practice, the naturalization of a species, is widely used in northern Europe and requires that the species' ecological requirements be satisfied. The most obvious advantage of this cultivation method is that it minimizes the attention the plants require once they have been naturalized.  The plants that are suitable for naturalization are those that are sufficiently small but able to compete with the surrounding grass, they must be robust and able to withstand year after year of inclement weather and they must be prolific in order to spread rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscaping brochure, International bulb centre|url=http://video.bulbsonline.org/emag/HOVUK/flash.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flower Bulb Research Program, Dept. of Horticulture, Cornell University|url=http://www.flowerbulbs.cornell.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Victoria Park, crocuses.jpg|thumb|Naturalized crocuses in Victoria Park, London]]
Some of the bulbs that are suitable for naturalization in parks include: ''[[Allium]],'' ''[[Anemone]],'' ''[[Arum]],'' ''[[Colchicum]]'', ''[[Crocus]],'' ''[[Cyclamen]],'' '' [[Hyacinthoides|Endymion]],'' ''[[Fritillaria]], [[Galanthus]], [[Ipheion]], [[Leucojum]], [[Lilium]], [[Muscari]], [[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]], [[Ornithogalum]], [[Scilla]], [[Sternbergia]]'' and ''[[Tulipa]].''

===  Rock gardens ===

A [[rock garden]] is a garden that uses a combination of rocks and small plants. The plants are often chosen for their suitability to rocky terrain. Some of the bulb genera that are most suitable for rock gardens include:{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} ''[[Allium]]'', ''[[Anemone]]'', ''[[Anthericum]]'', ''[[Bulbocodium]]'', ''[[Chionodoxa]]'', ''[[Cyclamen]]'', ''[[Eranthis]]'', ''[[Erythronium]]'', ''[[Galanthus]]'', ''[[Ipheion]]'', ''[[Muscari]]'', ''[[Ornithogalum]]'', ''[[Oxalis]]'', ''[[Romulea]]'', ''Rhodohypoxis'' and ''[[Scilla]]''.

== Multiplication ==

Bulbs can reproduce [[Plant reproduction#Sexual reproduction|sexually]], through seeds, or even [[Plant reproduction#Asexual reproduction|vegetatively]]. Reproduction through seeds is generally used to rapidly increase the number of individuals of a given species and to improve genetic diversity. Many of the bulb species are [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]], so pollination can only occur between [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] of different plants in order to obtain seeds. The majority of seeds from bulbous plants germinate well if they are sown as soon as they reach maturity. Some species need a cold period in order to germinate.
The biggest problem in reproducing through seeds is that the resulting plants have a greater variability in a wide range of characteristics, such as flower colour and height and flowering period. This means that asexual or vegetative reproduction is normally used commercially to propagate this type of plant. This means that the characteristics of a determined cultivar remain unaltered.&lt;ref name=Skel78/&gt;

Bulbs can reproduce vegetatively in a number of ways depending of the type of storage organ the plant has.&lt;ref name=Skel78 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HartKest87/&gt;&lt;ref name=infojardin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keen04/&gt;

== Commercial production ==
[[Image:Bollenveld Hillegom.JPG|thumb|Commercial tulip field in Hillegom, the Netherlands]]

Bulbs can be [[evergreen]], such as ''[[Clivia]],'' ''[[Agapanthus]]'' and some species and varieties of ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' and ''[[Hemerocallis]]''. However, the majority are [[deciduous]], dying down to the storage organ for part of the year. This characteristic has been taken advantage of in the commercialization of these plants. At the beginning of the rest period the bulbs can be dug out of the ground and prepared for sale as if they remain dry they do not need any nutrition for weeks or months.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}}

Bulbous plants are produced on an industrial scale for two main markets, cut flowers and dried bulbs. The bulbs are produced to satisfy the demand for bulbs for parks, gardens and as house plants, in addition to providing the bulbs necessary for the production of cut flowers. The international trade in cut flowers has a worldwide value of approximately 11,000 million Euros, which gives an idea of the economic importance of this activity.

The Netherlands has been the leader in commercial production since the start of the 16th Century, both for the dried bulb market and for cut flowers.  In fact, with approximately 30,000 [[hectare]]s dedicated to this activity the production of bulbs in the Netherlands represents 65% of global production. The Netherlands also produces 95% of the international market in bulbs dedicated to the production of cut flowers. The [[United States]] is the second largest producer followed by [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Brazil]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=Clap01/&gt;

== International societies dedicated to bulbous plants ==

* [[International Bulb Society]]. http://www.bulbsociety.org/
:Established in 1933, this society is an international educational and scientific organization, it is a charity dedicated to the dissemination of information regarding the cultivation, conservation and botany of all types of bulbous plants. Their website contains an excellent gallery of high quality photographs of bulbous plants.

* The [[Pacific Bulb Society]]. http://www.pacificbulbsociety.org/
:Organized in 2002, this society disseminates information and shares experiences regarding the cultivation of ornamental bulbous plants. Their website contains an exceptional educational resource, "Pacific Bulb Society Wiki", with images and information regarding numerous species of bulbous plants.

* Australian Bulb Association. https://web.archive.org/web/20090518011847/http://www.ausbulbs.org/index.htm
:Organized in 2001 it possessed an excellent collection of photographs of bulbous plants on its website.

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''posterior compartment of the thigh''' is one of the [[fascial compartments of thigh|fascial compartments]] that contains the [[knee]] [[anatomical terms of motion#flexion|flexors]] and [[hip]] [[anatomical terms of motion#extension|extensors]] known as the [[hamstring muscles]], as well as vascular and nervous elements, particularly the [[sciatic nerve]].

==Structure==

The posterior compartment is a [[fascial compartment]] bounded by [[fascia]]. It is separated from the [[anterior compartment of thigh|anterior compartment]] by two folds of [[fascia lata|deep fascia]], known as the [[Medial intermuscular septum of thigh|medial intermuscular septum]] and the [[Lateral intermuscular septum of thigh|lateral intermuscular septum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://anatomy.uams.edu/topogr_lowerlimb.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh are the:&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-5484-4"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sauerland, Eberhardt K. |author2=Patrick W. Tank |author3=Tank, Patrick W. |title=Grant's dissector |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2005 |pages=133 |isbn=0-7817-5484-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="titleSummary of Lower Limb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/WNOR/summarylistll.htm |title=Summary of Lower Limb |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123061508/http://mywebpages.comcast.net/WNOR/summarylistll.htm |archivedate=2008-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[biceps femoris muscle]], which consists of a short head and a long head.
* [[semitendinosus muscle]]
* [[semimembranosus muscle]]

These muscles (or their tendons) apart from the short head of the biceps femoris, are commonly known as the [[hamstring]]s. The depression at the back of the knee, or ''kneepit'' is the [[popliteal fossa]], colloquially called the ''ham''. The tendons of the above muscles can be felt as prominent cords on both sides of the fossa—the biceps femoris tendon on the lateral side and the semimembranosus and semitendinosus tendons on the medial side. The hamstrings flex the knee, and aided by the gluteus maximus, they extend the hip during walking and running. The semitendinosus is named for its unusually long tendon.  The semimembranosus is named for the flat shape of its superior attachment.&lt;ref name="isbn978-0077351144"&gt;{{cite book |author=Saladin, Kenneth S. |title=Anatomy and Physiology the Unity of Form and Function. |publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education |location=Boston, MA |year=2012 |pages=133 |isbn=978-0077351144 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innervation===
The hamstrings are innervated by the sciatic nerve, specifically by a main branch of it: the [[tibial nerve]]. (The short head of the biceps femoris is innervated by the [[common fibular nerve]]). The sciatic nerve runs along the longitudinal axis of the compartment, giving the cited terminal branches close to the superior angle of the popliteal fossa.

===Blood supply===
The arteries that supply the posterior compartment of the thigh arise from the [[inferior gluteal artery|inferior gluteal]] and the perforating branches of the [[profunda femoris artery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.comcast.net/~wnor/postthigh.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906031147/http://home.comcast.net/~wnor/postthigh.htm |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a major collateral branch of the femoral artery and part of the [[anterior compartment of thigh]]. The femoral artery itself crosses the [[adductor hiatus]] to enter the posterior compartment at the level of the popliteal fossa, giving branches that supply the knee. This crossing marks the point in which the vessel changes its name to [[popliteal artery]].

==Clinical significance==

As with any other fascial compartment, the posterior compartment of thigh can develop [[compartment syndrome]] when pressure builds up inside it, reducing the ability of arteries to transport blood to muscles and nerves. In acute cases, this is most frequently a consequence of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ojike NI, Roberts CS, Giannoudis PV |date=2010 |title=Compartment syndrome of the thigh: a systematic review |url=http://www.injuryjournal.com/article/S0020-1383%2809%2900213-7/fulltext |journal=Injury |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=133–136  |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2009.03.016 |pmid=19555950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has some relation to the [[problem play]]. The viewer of the picture is invited to speculate about several different possible explanations of the scene.  The genre has much in common with that of [[book illustration]], then at its most popular, but with the text belonging to the illustration omitted.&lt;ref&gt;See David Skilton,“The Centrality of Literary Illustration in Victorian Visual Culture: the example of Millais and Trollope from 1860 to 1864.” Journal of Illustration Studies (December 2007). 14 May 2014. &lt;http://jois.uia.no/articles.php?article=30&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

The genre began to emerge in the second half of the nineteenth century, along with the development of book illustrations that depicted "pregnant" moments in a narrative. One of the earliest problem pictures is [[John Everett Millais]]' ''Trust Me'', which depicts an older man demanding that a young woman hand him a letter she has received. Either character might be uttering the words. The significance and content of the letter is left to the imagination.  Their relationship is also unclear; in view of their ages, they might be a married couple, or a father and daughter. 

Other artists who worked in the genre included [[William Frederick Yeames]], whose ''"[[And When Did You Last See Your Father? (picture)|And when did you last see your father?]]"'' became the most famous example of the genre. It depicts a young boy of the [[English civil war]] period being gently interrogated by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] troops who are looking for his Royalist father. It is implied that they are asking a trick question designed to discover his location. The painting is poised at the moment the child is about to answer. Yeames painted many other works of this type, including ''Amy Robsart'' and ''Defendant and Counsel''. When the latter was exhibited a newspaper ran a competition for readers to guess what crime the woman was accused of.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/biog/yeames.htm Obituary of Yeames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822202258/http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/biog/yeames.htm |date=2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sickert.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Walter Sickert, ''The Camden Town Murder'', originally titled, ''What Shall We Do for the Rent?'' or ''What Shall We Do to Pay the Rent'' 1908]]
Some [[avant garde]] artists also experimented with the genre, notably [[Edgar Degas]] and his follower [[Walter Sickert]]. Degas's [[Interior (Degas)|''Interior'']] (1869) depicts an ambiguous scene suggestive of sexual transgression and violence (hence the alternative title of "the Rape"). Similar ambiguity is found in Sickert's ''[[The Camden Town Murder]]'' (1908), in which the two figures can be interpreted as a couple, or a killer and his victim.

The genre continued to be popular into the early twentieth century, but was by this time increasingly seen as old fashioned and as over-literary, against the emphasis on pictorial style and form characteristic of [[impressionism]] and [[post-impressionism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6114">The '''R* rule''' (also called the '''resource-ratio hypothesis''') is a hypothesis in [[community ecology]] that attempts to predict which species will become dominant as the result of [[competitive exclusion|competition for resources]].&lt;ref name=tilman1982&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tilman|first1=David|title=Resource competition and community structure|date=1982|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691083025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It predicts that if multiple species are competing for a single limiting resource, then whichever species can survive at the lowest equilibrium resource level (i.e., the R*) can outcompete all other species.&lt;ref name="tilman1982" /&gt;  If two species are competing for two resources, then coexistence is only possible if each species has a lower R* on one of the resources.&lt;ref name="tilman1982" /&gt;  For example, two [[phytoplankton]] species may be able to coexist if one is more limited by nitrogen, and the other is more limited by phosphorus.

A large number of experimental studies have attempted to verify the predictions of the R* rule.  Many studies have shown that when multiple plankton are grown together, the species with the lowest R* will dominate, or coexist if they are limited by multiple resources.&lt;ref name="grover1997" /&gt;  There are fewer tests of the R* rule in communities of larger organisms, in part because of the difficulty of creating a situation in which only a single resource is limiting.&lt;ref name="grover1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=miller_etal2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Burns|first2=Jean H.|last3=Munguia|first3=Pablo|last4=Walters|first4=Eric L.|last5=Kneitel|first5=Jamie M.|last6=Richards|first6=Paul M.|last7=Mouquet|first7=Nicolas|last8=Buckley|first8=Hannah L.|title=A Critical Review of Twenty Years’ Use of the Resource‐Ratio Theory|journal=The American Naturalist|date=April 2005|volume=165|issue=4|pages=439–448|doi=10.1086/428681|pmid=15791536}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some studies have used the R* rule with multiple resources to predict which groups of plants will be able to coexist.&lt;ref name=dybzinski2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dybzinski|first1=Ray|last2=Tilman|first2=David|title=Resource Use Patterns Predict Long‐Term Outcomes of Plant Competition for Nutrients and Light|journal=The American Naturalist|date=September 2007|volume=170|issue=3|pages=305–318|doi=10.1086/519857|pmid=17879183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical Derivation==
Consider a community with multiple species.  We will assume that each species competes for a single resource, and ignore the effects of interference or apparent competition.  Each population increases by consuming resources, and declines when resources are too scarce.  For example, we could model their population dynamics as

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN_j}{dt} = N_j(a_j R - d) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = r - R\sum_j a_jN_j &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the density of species ''j'', ''R'' is the density of the resource, ''a'' is the rate at which species ''j'' eats the resource, ''d'' is species ''j''s death rate, and ''r'' is the rate at which resources grow when not consumed.  It is easy to show that when species ''j'' is at equilibrium by itself (i.e., ''dN&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt'' = 0), that the equilibrium resource density, ''R*&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', is

&lt;math&gt;R^*_j = d/a_j.&lt;/math&gt;

When ''R'' &gt; ''R*&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', species j's population will increase; when ''R'' is less than ''R*&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', species ''j''s population will decline.  Because of this, the species with the lowest ''R*'' will eventually dominate.  Consider the two species case, where ''R*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''R*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.  When species 2 is at equilibrium, ''R'' = ''R*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and species 1's population will be increasing.  When species 1 is at equilibrium, ''R'' = ''R*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and species 2's population will be decreasing.&lt;ref name="tilman1982" /&gt;

This method has been extended to analyze more complex models, such as species with a [[functional response|Type II functional response]].  Under many additional circumstances, the above result still holds: the species who can survive at the lowest resource levels will be the competitive dominant.&lt;ref name=grover1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grover|first1=James P.|title=Resource competition|date=1997|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|location=London|isbn=0412749300|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the CSR triangle theory==
Understanding the differences between the R* theory and its major alternative the [[Universal adaptive strategy theory|CSR triangle theory]] is a major goal in [[community ecology]] for many years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craine|first1=Joseph|title=Reconciling plant strategy theories of Grime and Tilman|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01043.x|volume=93|journal=Journal of Ecology|pages=1041–1052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jabot|title=general modelling framework for resource-ratio and CSR theories of plant community dynamics|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.02024.x | volume=100|journal=Journal of Ecology|pages=1296–1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unlike the R* theory, the CSR theory predicts that competitive ability is determined by [[relative growth rate]] and other size related traits. While some experiments supported the R* predictions, other supported the CSR predictions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
The different predictions stem from different assumptions on the [[size-asymmetric competition|size asymmetry of the competition]]. The R* theory assumes that competition is size symmetric (i.e. resource exploitation is proportional to individual biomass), the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric (i.e. large individuals exploit disproportional higher amounts of resources compared with smaller individuals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeMalach|title=Size asymmetry of resource competition and the structure of plant communities|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12557 | volume=104|journal=Journal of Ecology|pages=899–910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RV ''Rachel Carson''''' is a research vessel owned and operated by the [[University of Maryland]]'s Center for Environmental Science, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]].

The 81-foot aluminum-hulled vessel is an extended and modified Challenger class fast research vessel, designed by marine architect Roger Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |title=Research Vessel Design |work=JMS Naval Architects &amp; Salvage Engineers |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107205725/http://jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |archivedate=7 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is equipped with twin 1,200 horsepower diesel engines and water jet drives which give a maximum speed of 24 knots. A [[Dynamic positioning|dynamic positioning system]] automatically maintains the vessel's position.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

The ship was built by [[Hike Metal Products]] of [[Wheatley, Ontario]],&lt;ref name="umces"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.umces.edu/research-discovery/rv-rachel-carson |title=The R/V Rachel Carson |work=University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of $4.6 million, and christened by [[Katie O'Malley]] on November 16, 2008, at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/CQ/V07N4/side3/ |title=New R/V Rachel Carson Commissioned |work=Chesapeake Quarterly |year=2008 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rachel Carson'' has operated in [[Chesapeake Bay]] since early 2009, teaching estuarine sampling techniques, carrying out water quality surveys, [[plankton]] collection, [[Box corer|box coring]] operations, and deploying instrument packages.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

His most significant work is ''Modern Typography.'' He is a proprietor of [[Hyphen Press]], which publishes books on design and typography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/authors/robin_kinross Robin Kinross | Authors | Hyphen Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinross did undergraduate and graduate studies at the Department of Typography &amp; Graphic Communication at the [[University of Reading]]. He moved to London in 1982. In the 1980s he contributed content to publications such as ''[[Blueprint (architecture magazine)|Blueprint]]'', ''[[Baseline (magazine)|Baseline]]'' and ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]''.

Kinross started Hyphen Press in 1980. ''Modern Typography'' was published in 1992. Since the 1990s, Hyphen produces about "two to four publications a year".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Important publications by Hyphen include Christopher Burke's ''[[Paul Renner]]'' and Fred Smeijers' ''Counterpunch''.

==''Modern Typography''==
''Modern Typography: An Essay in Critical History'' is a critical history of printing and typography. Kinross asserts that modernism in typography emerged with the self-awareness of printing and the development of the rationality of its processes and tools.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, Robin, Modern Typography: An Essay in Critical History, Hyphen Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinross dates these emerging attitudes to around 1700 and then traces the evolution of modernist typography. According to [[Matthew Carter]], "Most histories of typography, particularly British ones, have been histories of traditional typography that treat Modernism as an aberration. Studies of Modernism, for their part, have tended to isolate it from contemporary traditional typography. This book aims to break down that separation by considering issues other than visual appearance, and by avoiding the ‘bibliophilic nostalgia’ so prevalent in typographic culture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemagazine.com/review.php?id=36&amp;rid=309&amp;set=370 Eye Magazine | Review | Reflections of a typographer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The book takes some inspiration in title and treatment from [[Kenneth Frampton]]'s ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/journal/2000/08/21/kinross_interview An interview with Robin Kinross | Journal | Hyphen Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[control system]] theory, and various branches of engineering, a '''transfer function matrix''', or just '''transfer matrix''' is a generalisation of the [[transfer function]]s of [[single-input single-output system|single-input single-output]] (SISO) systems to [[MIMO|multiple-input and multiple-output]] (MIMO) systems.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, p. 1038&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] relates the outputs of the system to its inputs.  It is a particularly useful construction for [[linear time-invariant]] (LTI) systems because it can be expressed in terms of the [[s-plane]].

In some systems, especially ones consisting entirely of [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] components, it can be ambiguous which variables are inputs and which are outputs.  In electrical engineering, a common scheme is to gather all the voltage variables on one side and all the current variables on the other regardless of which are inputs or outputs.  This results in all the elements of the transfer matrix being in units of [[electrical impedance|impedance]].  The concept of impedance (and hence impedance matrices) has been borrowed into other energy domains by analogy, especially mechanics and acoustics.

Many control systems span several different energy domains.  This requires transfer matrices with elements in mixed units.  This is needed both to describe [[transducer]]s that make connections between domains and to describe the system as a whole.  If the matrix is to properly model energy flows in the system, compatible variables must be chosen to allow this.

== General ==
{{see also|Rosenbrock system matrix}}

A MIMO system with {{mvar|m}} outputs and {{mvar|n}} inputs is represented by a {{math|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix.  Each entry in the matrix is in the form of a transfer function relating an output to an input.  For example, for a three-input, two-output system, one might write,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
g_{11} &amp; g_{12} &amp; g_{13} \\
g_{21} &amp; g_{22} &amp; g_{23}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the inputs, the {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the outputs, and the {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the transfer functions.  This may be written more succinctly in matrix operator notation as,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf Y = \mathbf G \mathbf U &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''Y'''}} is a [[column vector]] of the outputs, {{math|'''G'''}} is a matrix of the transfer functions, and {{math|'''U'''}} is a column vector of the inputs.

In many cases, the system under consideration is a [[Linear time-invariant theory|linear time-invariant]] (LTI) system.  In such cases, it is convenient to express the transfer matrix in terms of the [[Laplace transform]] (in the case of [[continuous time]] variables) or the [[z-transform]] (in the case of [[discrete time]] variables) of the variables.  This may be indicated by writing, for instance,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf Y (s) = \mathbf G (s) \mathbf U (s) &lt;/math&gt;

which indicates that the variables and matrix are in terms of {{mvar|s}}, the [[complex frequency]] variable of the [[s-plane]] arising from Laplace transforms, rather than time.  The examples in this article are all assumed to be in this form, although that is not explicitly indicated for brevity.  For discrete time systems {{mvar|s}} is replaced by {{mvar|z}} from the z-transform, but this makes no difference to subsequent analysis.  The matrix is particular useful when it is a '''proper rational matrix''', that is, all its elements are [[proper rational function]]s.  In this case the [[state-space representation]] can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levine, p. 481|Chen, pp. 1037–1038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In systems engineering, the overall system transfer matrix {{math|'''G''' (''s'')}} is decomposed into two parts: {{math|'''H''' (''s'')}} representing the system being controlled, and {{math|'''C'''(''s'')}} representing the control system.  {{math|'''C''' (''s'')}} takes as its inputs the inputs of {{math|'''G''' (''s'')}} and the outputs of {{math|'''H''' (''s'')}}.  The outputs of {{math|'''C''' (''s'')}} form the inputs for {{math|'''H''' (''s'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electrical systems ==
In electrical systems it is often the case that the distinction between input and output variables is ambiguous.  They can be either, depending on circumstance and point of view.  In such cases the concept of [[Port (circuit theory)|port]] (a place where energy is transferred from one system to another) can be more useful than input and output.  It is customary to define two variables for each port ({{mvar|p}}): the [[voltage]] across it ({{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and the [[electric current|current]] entering it ({{mvar|I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}).  For instance, the transfer matrix of a [[two-port network]] can be defined as follows,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
z_{11} &amp; z_{12} \\
z_{21} &amp; z_{22} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} I_1 \\ I_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|z&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;}} are called the [[impedance parameters]], or ''z''-parameters.  They are so called because they are in units of [[electrical impedance|impedance]] and relate port currents to a port voltage.  The z-parameters are not the only way that transfer matrices are defined for two-port networks.  There are six basic matrices that relate voltages and currents each with advantages for particular system network topologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Chen, pp. 54–55|Iyer, p. 240|Bakshi &amp; Bakshi, p. 420}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, only two of these can be extended beyond two ports to an arbitrary number of ports.  These two are the ''z''-parameters and their inverse, the [[admittance parameters]] or ''y''-parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Choma, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;
[[file:Resistive divider2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Voltage divider circuit]]
To understand the relationship between port voltages and currents and inputs and outputs, consider the simple voltage divider circuit.  If we only wish to consider the output voltage ({{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}) resulting from applying the input voltage ({{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}) then the transfer function can be expressed as,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} V_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\dfrac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be considered the trivial case of a 1×1 transfer matrix.  The expression correctly predicts the output voltage if there is no current leaving port 2, but is increasingly inaccurate as the load increases.  If, however, we attempt to use the circuit in reverse, driving it with a voltage at port 2 and calculate the resulting voltage at port 1 the expression gives completely the wrong result even with no load on port 1.  It predicts a greater voltage at port 1 than was applied at port 2, an impossibility with a purely resistive circuit like this one.  To correctly predict the behaviour of the circuit, the currents entering or leaving the ports must also be taken into account, which is what the transfer matrix does.&lt;ref&gt;Yang &amp; Lee, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;  The impedance matrix for the voltage divider circuit is,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
R_1 + R_2 &amp; R_2 \\
R_2 &amp; R_2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} I_1 \\ I_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

which fully describes its behaviour under all input and output conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bessai, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[microwave]] frequencies, none of the transfer matrices based on port voltages and currents are convenient to use in practice.  Voltage is difficult to measure directly, current next to impossible, and the open circuits and short circuits required by the measurement technique cannot be achieved with any accuracy.  For [[waveguide]] implementations, circuit voltage and current are entirely meaningless.  Transfer matrices using different sorts of variables are used instead.  These are the [[power (physics)|powers]] transmitted into, and reflected from a port which are readily measured in the [[transmission line]] technology used in [[distributed-element circuit]]s in the microwave band.  The most well known and widely used of these sorts of parameters is the [[scattering parameters]], or s-parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Nguyen, p. 271|Bessai, p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical and other systems==
[[File:VIEW TO SOUTHWEST. DETAIL, GEAR TRAIN SYSTEM, CONTROL CABIN INTERIOR. - Gianella Bridge, Spanning Sacramento River at State Highway 32, Hamilton City, Glenn County, CA HAER CAL,11-HAMCI.V,1-22.tif|thumb|A gear train in the control cabin of the former [[Gianella Bridge]] which operated this [[swing bridge]].  Gear trains are two-ports.]]
The concept of [[mechanical impedance|impedance]] can be extended into the mechanical, and other domains through a [[mechanical-electrical analogy]], hence the impedance parameters, and other forms of 2-port network parameters, can be extended to the mechanical domain also.  To do this an [[effort variable]] and a [[flow variable (control systems)|flow variable]] are made analogues of voltage and current respectively.  For mechanical systems under [[translation (physics)|translation]] these variables are [[force]] and [[velocity]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressing the behaviour of a mechanical component as a two-port or multi-port with a transfer matrix is a useful thing to do because, like electrical circuits, the component can often be operated in reverse and its behaviour is dependent on the loads at the inputs and outputs.  For instance, a [[gear train]] is often characterised simply by its gear ratio, a SISO transfer function.  However, the gearbox output [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]] can be driven round to turn the input shaft requiring a MIMO analysis.  In this example the effort and flow variables are [[torque]] {{mvar|T}} and [[angular velocity]] {{mvar|ω}} respectively.  The transfer matrix in terms of z-parameters will look like,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ T_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
z_{11} &amp; z_{12} \\
z_{21} &amp; z_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1 \\ \omega_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

However, the z-parameters are not necessarily the most convenient for characterising gear trains.  A gear train is the analogue of an electrical [[transformer]] and the [[h-parameters]] (''hybrid'' parameters) better describe transformers because they directly include the turns ratios (the analogue of gear ratios).&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt;  The gearbox transfer matrix in h-parameter format is,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ \omega_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
h_{11} &amp; h_{12} \\
h_{21} &amp; h_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1 \\ T_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:where
:{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the velocity ratio of the gear train with no load on the output,
:{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the reverse direction torque ratio of the gear train with input shaft clamped, equal to the forward velocity ratio for an ideal gearbox,
:{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the input rotational mechanical impedance with no load on the output shaft, zero for an ideal gearbox, and,
:{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the output rotational mechanical [[admittance]] with the input shaft clamped.

For an ideal gear train with no losses (friction, distortion etc), this simplifies to,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ \omega_2 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 
0 &amp; N \\
N &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1 \\ T_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|N}} is the gear ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, p. 20|Koenig &amp; Blackwell, p. 170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transducers and actuators ==
[[File:Filterbaustein MF200 1 800 293.jpg|thumb|A mechanical filter opened to show the mechanical-electrical transducers at either end]]
In a system that consists of multiple energy domains, transfer matrices are required that can handle components with ports in different domains.  In [[robotics]] and [[mechatronics]], [[actuator]]s are required.  These usually consist of a [[transducer]] converting, for instance, signals from the control system in the electrical domain into motion in the mechanical domain.  The control system also requires [[sensor]]s that detect the motion and convert it back into the electrical domain through another transducer so that the motion can be properly controlled through a feedback loop. Other sensors in the system may be transducers converting yet other energy domains into electrical signals, such as optical, audio, thermal, fluid flow and chemical.  Another application is the field of [[mechanical filter]]s which require transducers between the electrical and mechanical domains in both directions.

A simple example is an electromagnetic [[electromechanical]] actuator driven by an electronic controller.  This requires a transducer with an input port in the electrical domain and an output port in the mechanical domain.  This might be represented simplistically by a SISO transfer function, but for similar reasons to those already stated, a more accurate representation is achieved with a two-input, two-output MIMO transfer matrix.  In the z-parameters, this takes the form,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} V \\ F \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
z_{11} &amp; z_{12} \\
z_{21} &amp; z_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} I \\ v \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|F}} is the force applied to the actuator and {{mvar|v}} is the resulting velocity of the actuator.  The impedance parameters here are a mixture of units; {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an electrical impedance, {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a mechanical impedance and the other two are [[transimpedance]]s in a hybrid mix of units.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acoustic systems ==
[[Acoustics|Acoustic systems]] are a subset of [[fluid dynamics]], and in both fields the primary input and output variables are [[pressure]], {{mvar|P}}, and [[volumetric flow rate]], {{mvar|Q}}, except in the case of sound travelling through solid components.  In the latter case, the primary variables of mechanics, force and velocity, are more appropriate.  An example of a two-port acoustic component is a [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] such as a [[muffler]] on an [[exhaust system]].  A transfer matrix representation of it may look like,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} P_2 \\ Q_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
T_{11} &amp; T_{12} \\
T_{21} &amp; T_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} P_1 \\ Q_1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the transmission parameters, also known as [[ABCD-parameters]].  The component can be just as easily described by the z-parameters, but transmission parameters have a mathematical advantage when dealing with a system of two-ports that are connected in a cascade of the output of one into the input port of another.  In such cases the overall transmission parameters are found simply by the matrix multiplication of the transmission parameter matrices of the constituent components.&lt;ref&gt;Munjal, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compatible variables ==
[[File:Pneumatic Rack and Pinion Actuators.JPG|thumb|A pneumatic rack and pinion actuator controlling a valve in a water pipe.  The actuator is a two-port device that converts from the pneumatic domain to the mechanical domain.  Together with the valve itself it comprises a three-port system; the pneumatic control port and the fluid flow input and output water pipe ports of the valve.]]  
When working with mixed variables from different energy domains consideration needs to be given on which variables to consider analogous.  The choice depends on what the analysis is intended to achieve.  If it is desired to correctly model energy flows throughout the entire system then a pair of variables whose product is power (power conjugate variables) in one energy domain must map to power conjugate variables in other domains.  Power conjugate variables are not unique so care needs to be taken to use the same mapping of variables throughout the system.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

A common mapping (used in some of the examples in this article) maps the effort variables (ones that initiate an action) from each domain together and maps the flow variables (ones that are a property of an action) from each domain together.  Each pair of effort and flow variables is power conjugate.  This system is known as the [[impedance analogy]] because a ratio of the effort to the flow variable in each domain is analogous to electrical impedance.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two other power conjugate systems on the same variables that are in use.  The [[mobility analogy]] maps mechanical force to electric current instead of voltage.  This analogy is widely used by mechanical filter designers and frequently in audio electronics also.  The mapping has the advantage of preserving network topologies across domains but does not maintain the mapping of impedances.  The Trent analogy classes the power conjugate variables as either ''across'' variables, or ''through'' variables depending on whether they act across an element of a system or through it.  This largely ends up the same as the mobility analogy except in the case of the fluid flow domain (including the acoustics domain).  Here pressure is made analogous to voltage (as in the impedance analogy) instead of current (as in the mobility analogy).  However, force in the mechanical domain ''is'' analogous to current because force acts ''through'' an object.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some commonly used analogies that do not use power conjugate pairs.  For sensors, correctly modelling energy flows may not be so important.  Sensors often extract only tiny amounts of energy into the system.  Choosing variables that are convenient to measure, particularly ones that the sensor is sensing, may be more useful.  For instance, in the [[thermal resistance]] analogy, thernal resistance is considered analogous to electrical resistance, resulting in temperature difference and thermal power mapping to voltage and current respectively.  The power conjugate of temperature difference is not thermal power, but rather [[entropy]] flow rate, something that cannot be directly measured.  Another analogy of the same sort occurs in the magnetic domain.  This maps [[magnetic reluctance]] to electrical resistance, resulting in [[magnetic flux]] mapping to current instead of magnetic flux rate of change as required for compatible variables.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The matrix representation of [[linear algebra]]ic equations has been known for some time.  [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] in 1907 was the first to describe a transducer as a pair of such equations relating electrical variables (voltage and current) to mechanical variables (force and velocity).  Wegel, in 1921, was the first to express these equations in terms of mechanical impedance as well as electrical impedance.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of transfer matrices to represent a MIMO control system was by Boksenbom and Hood in 1950, but only for the particular case of the gas turbine engines they were studying for the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kavanagh, p. 350|Bokenham &amp; Hood, p. 581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cruickshank provided a firmer basis in 1955 but without complete generality.  Kavanagh in 1956 gave the first completely general treatment, establishing the matrix relationship between system and control and providing criteria for realisability of a control system that could deliver a prescribed behaviour of the system under control.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, pp. 349–350&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Henry Paine Hatch''' (August 2, 1875 &amp;ndash; November 11, 1972) was an [[United States|American]] theologian and [[New Testament]] scholar, born at [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden, N. J.]] He attended [[Harvard University|Harvard]], graduating in 1898 (Ph.D., 1904). Afterward, he graduated the [[Episcopal Divinity School|Episcopal Theological School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and the [[General Theological Seminary]] in [[City of New York|New York City]]. He was ordained to the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] priesthood in 1902. Hatch was awarded a [[Doctor of Divinity]] from [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] in New York and a D.Théol. from the [[University of Strasbourg]]. He was Professor of the Literature and Interpretation of the New Testament at the [[Episcopal Divinity School|Episcopal Theological School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Hatch published many articles and reviews and was the author of ''The Pauline Idea of Faith'' (1917), and, with C. C. Edmunds, ''The Gospel Manuscripts of the General Theological Seminary'' (1918).
