'''Anagnorisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ɡ|ˈ|n|ɒr|ᵻ|s|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἀναγνώρισις}}) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the [[hero]]'s sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often [[antagonist]]ic [[fictional character|character]] in [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], "Myth, Fiction, And Displacement" p 25 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tragedy==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', as part of his discussion of [[peripeteia]], Aristotle defined anagnorisis as "a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune" (1452a). It is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[catharsis]].

[[File:Lear and Cordelia.jpg|right|thumb|"Lear and Cordelia" by [[Ford Madox Brown]]:  Lear, driven out by his older daughters and rescued by his youngest, realizes their true characters.]]
In the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] definition of tragedy, it was the discovery of one's own identity or true character (e.g. Cordelia, Edgar, Edmund, etc. in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'') or of someone else's identity or true nature (e.g. Lear's children, Gloucester's children) by the tragic hero.  

Aristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis, with peripeteia caused by it. He considered it the mark of a superior tragedy, as when [[Oedipus]] killed his father and married his mother in ignorance, and later learned the truth, or when [[Iphigeneia in Tauris]] realizes in time that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, and refrains from sacrificing them.  Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when [[Medea]] resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so.

Another prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in [[Aeschylus]]'s "The Choephoroi" ("[[Libation Bearers]]") when [[Electra]] recognizes her brother, [[Orestes]], after he has returned to [[Argos]] from his exile, at the grave of their father, [[Agamemnon]], who had been murdered at the hands of [[Clytemnestra]], their mother. [[Electra]] convinces herself that Orestes is her brother with three pieces of evidence: a lock of Orestes's hair on the grave, his footprints next to the grave, and a piece of weaving which she embroidered herself.  The footprints and the hair are identical to her own. Electra's awareness is of her brother's presence, who is the one person who can help her by avenging the death of their father.&lt;ref&gt;
Aeschylus, and Robert Lowell. The Oresteia of Aeschylus. New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
[[File:Robson Crane Comedy of Errors.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for a performance of ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'':  When the twins, confused with each other throughout the play, recognize each other's existence, the play reaches its happy ending.]]
The section of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' dealing with comedy did not survive, but many critics also discuss recognition in comedies.  A standard plot of the [[New Comedy]] was the final revelation, by birth tokens, that the heroine was of respectable birth and so suitable for the hero to marry. This was often brought about by the machinations of the [[tricky slave]].  This plot appears in Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', where a recognition scene in the final act reveals that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, "Recognition in ''The Winter's Tale''" p 108-9 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and modern usage==
===Mystery===
The earliest use of anagnorisis in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a classical ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its [[twist ending]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Tale of the Three Apples]]&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist of the story, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
Anagnorisis, however, is not limited to classical or Elizabethan sources. Author and lecturer Ivan Pintor Iranzo points out that contemporary ''auteur'' [[M. Night Shyamalan]] uses similar revelations in ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', in which child psychologist Malcolm Crowe successfully treats a child who is having visions of dead people, only to realize at the close of the film that Crowe himself is dead, as well as in ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', in which the character of David realizes that he survived a train crash that killed the other passengers, due to a supernatural power.&lt;ref name="formats"&gt;Ivan Pintor Iranzo. [http://www.upf.edu/materials/depeca/formats/arti6_ing.htm The naked and the dead. The Representation of the dead and the construction of the other in contemporary cinema: The case of M. Night Shyamalan], No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another well known example of anagnorisis from popular culture is the revelation that [[Darth Vader]] is the father of [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. An extensive account of the history and application of anagnorisis is provided by Terence Cave in his book ''Recognitions''.&lt;ref&gt;''Recognitions: A Study in Poetics''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

A humorous definition is included in 'The Banner: mock-heroic verse epic, Part 1: Sid' by Robin Gordon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any moment of such crisis / 
one thinks, of course, of those devices / 
which Aristotle said were needed / 
in any poem.  We have heeded / 
Aristotle, and our plot, / 
(beginning, middle, end), has got / 
complications too, and error / 
fit to rouse cathartic terror, / 
protagonists, antagonists, / 
peripiteia, turns and twists. / 
The poet's comments form the choruses, / 
but now it's time for anagnorisis. / 
When Oedipus sees the bird he's bedded / 
is his own father's lawful wedded / 
wife, in fact she is his mother, / 
or Iphigenia finds her brother, / 
Discovery or Recognition / 
brings the plot to its fruition.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2014}}
'''Assemblage''' refers to a text "built primarily and explicitly from existing texts to solve a writing or communication problem in a new context".&lt;ref&gt;Selber and Johnson-Eilola, Plagiarism, Originality, Assemblage, Computers and Composition, Vol. 24, No. 4. (2007), pp. 375–403&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was first proposed by Johndan Johnson-Eilola (author of ''[[Datacloud]]'') and Stuart Selber in the [[Academic journal|journal]] ''Computers &amp; Composition'' in 2007.  The notion of assemblages builds on [[remix]] and remix practices, which blur distinctions between invented and borrowed [[Literature|work]].

==In composition==
Johnson-Eilola and Selber write that assemblage is influenced by [[intertextuality]] and [[postmodernism]].  The authors discuss the intertextual nature of writing and assert that participation in existing [[discourse]] necessarily means that [[composition (language)|composition]] cannot occur separate from that discourse.  They state that "productive participation involves appropriation and re-appropriation of the familiar" in a manner that conforms to existing discourse and audience expectations.  In reference to intertextuality, Johnson-Eilola and Selber cite ''[[The Social Life of Information]]'' by [[John Seely Brown]] and [[Paul Duguid]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, John Seely, &amp; Duguid, Paul. (2000). The social life of information. Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this book Brown and Duguid state that the meaning of and use for a text is directly influenced both by its source texts and the broader textual context in which it participates.  Building upon this notion, Johnson-Eilola and Selber position assemblage as a style of composition situated within postmodernism.  They state that "in a general sense, postmodern theories, and following them, [[cultural studies]], offer a useful way of understanding assemblages (and the related process of remixing) as simultaneously social and textual structures."  Johnson-Eilola and Selber suggest that texts should always be treated as assemblages since composition is often highly intertextual.

Johnson-Eilola and Selber believe that composition should be undertaken as a problem solving activity rather than a demonstration of original ideas. They write that "writing situations are, at base, problem-solving situations in one way or another," and offer assemblage as a form of problem solving that can be used alongside the creation of original text.  Michael J. Michaud writes that "assemblages are ubiquitous in contemporary workplaces" where problem solving is paramount because assemblage allows authors to "meet discursive needs and to get work done."&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, Michael J, The 'Reverse Commute: Adult Students and the Transition from Professional to Academic Literacy, Teaching English in the Two Year College, Vol. 38, No. 4. (2011), pp. 244–257.&lt;/ref&gt; He further argues that students with workplace experience often transfer assemblage writing into the composition classroom.  Assemblage allows such authors to alter existing texts and combine them with original work in order to meet the demands of a writing situation or problem.

==Assemblage and remix==
The idea of assemblages is closely tied to the practice of remix.  Remix, originally referring to a reworked song, has been extended to describe any significant alteration of media, most commonly film and literature.  Johnson-Eilola and Selber claim that remix "can aid invention, leverage intellectual and physical resources, and dramatize the social dimensions of composing."  However, they also recognize that "remixing as a form of composition inhabits a contested terrain of creativity, intellectual property, authorship, corporate ownership, and power."  While the practice of remixing is often marked by [[copyright|legal]] issues, the authors acknowledge that remix is nevertheless becoming an increasingly common creative form.

While assemblage is closely tied to remix, there are distinctions between the two.  In discussing models of writing, Liane Robertson, Kara Taczak, and Kathleen Blake Yancey describe remix models of writing as "prior knowledge revised synthetically to ''incorporate'' new concepts and practices into the prior model of writing."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Liane, Kara Taczak, and Kathleen Blake Yancey, Notes Towards a Theory of Prior Knowledge and Its Role in College Composers' Transfer of Knowledge and Practice, Composition Forum, Vol. 26. (2012), np. http://compositionforum.com/issue/26/prior-knowledge-transfer.php&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, they define assemblage models as “grafting...isolated ‘bits’ of learning onto [a] prior structure without either recognition of differences between prior and current writing conceptions and tasks or synthesis of them."  While a remix is a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] or incorporation of elements, an assemblage is a combination in which there are recognizable boundaries between elements.

Assemblage and remix are also related to [[articulation (sociology)|articulation]].  The sociological practice of articulation, as described by [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], among others, refers to the [[appropriation (sociology)|appropriation]] of elements of culture by various social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Stuart. (1986). On postmodernism and articulation: An interview with Stuart Hall (Lawrence Grossberg, Ed.) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 5, 35–60. Rpt. in Stuart Hall: Critical dialogues in cultural studies. (1996). David Morley &amp; Kuan-Hsing Chen (Eds.). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson-Eilola and Selber connect assemblage, remix, and articulation as examples of meaning being situated in a specific material and social context.

==Assemblage and plagiarism==
A central characteristic of assemblages is the challenge to established notions of [[originality]]. Johnson-Eilola and Selber claim that the traditional distinction between original and [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] work is that original work is superior in terms of creative effort and is not [[derivative work|derivative.]] They further assert that such a distinction is based upon outdated notions of "the lone genius" and is no longer practical in an academic setting. While they concede that "teachers no longer evaluate writing completely as an isolated, decontextualized artifact," Johnson-Eilola and Selber maintain "at least one set of social forces suggests to students that using citations and quotations from source materials will be valued less than their own original text, a situation that may encourage them to conceal their sources."  While the current system of academic evaluation allows, and actually calls, for citation of source materials, Johnson-Eilola and Selber find that the placement of value on original work encourages students to hide sources in an attempt to demonstrate original thought. The emphasis on original work, according to Johnson-Eilola and Selber, may actually contribute to plagiarism. The authors believe that the emphasis on original work is unnecessary because "rhetorical purposes can be addressed in context by either original or borrowed/quoted texts without a hierarchy of distinction between the two."

Johnson-Eilola and Selber assert that despite shifting attitudes in academia, work produced by students at the scholastic and collegiate level is still evaluated in terms of its originality. They find fault with the current evaluative process for two reasons. First, the authors find that evaluating students for their originality is "increasingly unrealistic in our postmodern age" as this method is based on antiquated ideas of creativity. Second, they treat the idea of isolating a student's unique composition from the inspiring source materials as unrealistic and futile.  For Johnson-Eilola and Selber, the ability to effectively contribute to academic or social discourse is what makes an assemblage valuable, not its "originality." Rather than claiming originality is not to be valued, the authors see it as fundamentally problematic and misleading as an evaluative concept. They suggest that academic evaluation be reconsidered with a new emphasis on affect: "What if the 'final' product a student produces—a text—is not concerned with original words or images on a page or screen but concerned primarily with assemblages of parts? Importantly, in this reconception, the assemblages do not distinguish primarily between which parts are supposed to be original and which have been found and gathered from someplace else; assemblages are interested in what works, what has social effects." In this model, the role of intertextuality is recognized as central to the composition of "new" material.

In support for their argument against the traditional view of plagiarism, Johnson-Eilola and Selber cite current critiques from other scholars. They refer to Price, who argued that plagiarism cannot be defined as a single concept, but is dependent upon the cultural practice and conventions in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Margaret. (2002). Beyond ‘gotcha!’: Situating plagiarism in policy and pedagogy. College Composition and Communication, 54, 88–115.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also acknowledge a presentation given by James Porter in 2006 at [[Conference on College Composition and Communication|CCCC]]. In his presentation Porter described how plagiarism is sometimes encouraged in the academic community, offering examples of "ways teachers plagiarize all the time—among them, sharing syllabi (with plagiarized plagiarism statements!), using [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] text for administrative documents, and failing to acknowledge the [[bibliography|bibliographic]] work of others."&lt;ref&gt;Porter, James E. (2006). Forget plagiarism, teach filesharing and fair use. Paper presented at the convention of the Conference on College Composition and Communication, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson-Eilola and Selber also refer to a 1993 article by Rebecca Moore Howard on "patchwriting," which describes a technique used by new authors. Patchwriting "involves copying from a source text then deleting some words, altering grammatical structures, or plugging in one-to-one synonym-substitutes."&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Rebecca Moore. (2000). Sexuality, textuality: The cultural work of plagiarism. College English, 62, 37–55&lt;/ref&gt; This technique can traditionally be viewed as a form of plagiarism, but it is also considered useful for learning how to communicate within expert discourse. Johson-Eilola and Selber reference patchwriting in an attempt to demonstrate the practical uses of otherwise "plagiaristic" practices, not to establish a connection between patchwriting and assemblage. While patchwriting can be a useful learning tool, it is completely distinct from assemblage. Assemblage is more than the systematic replacement of like terms and is closer to the artistic style of [[collage]].

==Examples==
[[Paradox (assemblage)|Paradox]], a cut up collage assembled from words and phrases cut from magazines and glued together to form a picture of Abraham Lincoln being assassinated at Ford's Theater.

'''Blažej Baláž''' (born 29 October 1958 in [[Nevoľné]], [[Slovakia]], former Czechoslovakia) is a contemporary Slovak artist. His practise as an artist is usually associated with political art, environmental, activist, mail-art and neo-conceptualism. After 1988 he began working with text as art, neo-conceptual and [[post-conceptual]] texts (intext, outtext).

==Life and work==
Baláž studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Bratislava and his Magister of Fine Arts degree received in 1983. Baláž has been the Head of Department of Fine Arts Education at the [[University of Trnava]] since 1999. He was a founder member of the artists group East of Eden (1998). Since 1979, he has been married to the artist [[Maria Balazova]].
He lives and works in [[Trnava]].

He has worked in the areas of political, environmental, activist and neo-conceptual art. His practice also comprises media painting, works on paper, performances, drawing, object, mail art and printmaking.

He has shown work internationally in exhibitions including the Drawing 1990, Provo, USA (1990), Vth International Drawing Triennale, [[Wrocław]] (1992), 12th International Biennale of Small Sculpture, [[Murska Sobota]] (1995), International Biennale of Graphic Arts, [[Ljubljana]] (1989, 1995, 1999), Object / Object.

==Cycle Treptomachia==
Baláž's works brings the new possibilities at the field of post-conceptual and neo-conceptual text. The exhibition is divided in three segments, all of them are connected by the specific and authentic search of the possibilities in the conceptual Macaronic language.
The first is created from the neo-conceptual horizontal/vertical texts, a part of Treptomachia, (WARTEZEIT, 2006, WARTERAUM, 2006 and How to domesticate the English language, 2006). The internal orientation of artworks, the search of art itself, the search of language and text brings the cracking of syntactic/semantic wholeness of graphems. The metatexts of initial prototext are distinguished by the colors (oil on canvas, 300 x 200&amp;nbsp;cm).
In this regard Baláž's eff ort culminates by the diptych TREPTOMACHIA.EN-A / How to domesticate the English language and TREPTOMACHIA.DE-B / How to domesticate the German language (2006). Both are depicted on big-size canvas, within which the only dominating word with partial messages is replaced with newly defined optical language with tens of words. The colour decomposition of the grapheme creates a symptomatic background for language overlapping and the contamination, which creates the supreme moment of the author's Babylonian crossroads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blazej.bbalaz.sk/p/user_exhibitions/list/S&amp;View=9]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another, the second segment, black and white acryl-paintings enriches the former one, the artworks are created on principle of the structuralist analysis of text. It is a variant, which is called and named by author and curator the intext. By the segmentation of text the author discovers several lexis. These have a different lexical origin, five West-European, five East-European, and „dead“ language of Medieval Esperanto – Latin. Despite the cold artificiality of works, this segment has also the hidden sociocritical context, which is oscillated between phenomenons West and East, art and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blazej.bbalaz.sk/p/user_exhibitions/list/S&amp;View=9]&lt;/ref&gt;
The third segment is the most open and subjective. These horizontal texts are named by its author as the simultaneous texts. It is a different alternative in the post-conceptual Makaronian text, the melange is created by harmony of the initial and derivative text. Its ironic and attacking character replaces a cold aspect of the first two segments. Vajanský's Suchá ratolesť (an ironic parallel of failing elits) is floundered by streams, the subject is named by the author as east rat in the age of 20-years of wandering a la democrazy, with a more complicated ambivalent reading. The fragility of ground – paper [four artworks, width 10 m] raises the openness of statement, ODRBMADEMOKRATICKY, 2008 [screw me over democratically], is predominative.

'''Bruno Latour''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|t|ʊər}}; {{IPA-fr|latuʁ|lang}}; born 22 June 1947) is a French  [[philosopher of science|philosopher]], [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 189"&gt;Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour:  Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is especially known for his work in the field of [[Science and Technology Studies|science and technology studies]] (STS).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]], "Science and Technology Studies", in ''The Knowledge book. Key concepts in philosophy, science and culture'', Acumen (UK) and McGill-Queens University Press (NA), 2007, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching at the [[École des Mines de Paris]] ([[Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation]]) from 1982 to 2006, he became Professor at [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris|Sciences Po Paris]] (2006–2017), where he was the scientific director of the Sciences Po Medialab. He retired from several university activities in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;See Latour's "Biography" [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/biography Bruno Latour's official website]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a Centennial Professor at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/instructor/brunolatour|title=Bruno Latour, Instructor - Coursera|website=Coursera|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.nd.edu/events/2016/11/03/bruno-latour/|title=Bruno Latour // Events // Department of English // University of Notre Dame|first=ENR/PAZ // Marketing Communications: Web // University of Notre|last=Dame|website=english.nd.edu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latour is best known for his books ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]'' (1991; English translation, 1993), ''[[Laboratory Life]]'' (with [[Steve Woolgar]], 1979) and ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action]]'' (1987).&lt;ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"&gt;Heather Vidmar-McEwen,[http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Latour.htm "Anthropologists biographies: Bruno Latour"], "Anthropologists biographies: Bruno Latour", Indiana University Anthropology Department&lt;/ref&gt; Although his studies of scientific practice were at one time associated with [[social constructionist]]&lt;ref name="Anthropolists-Bio"/&gt; approaches to the philosophy of science, Latour has diverged significantly from such approaches. He is best known for withdrawing from the subjective/objective division and re-developing the approach to work in practice.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 189"/&gt; Latour said in 2017 that he is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title='Science Wars' Veteran Latour Now Wants to Help Rebuild Trust in Science |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with [[Michel Callon]] and [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], Latour is one of the primary developers of [[actor–network theory]] (ANT), a constructionist approach influenced by the [[ethnomethodology]] of [[Harold Garfinkel]], the generative [[semiotics]] of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], and (more recently) the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]]'s rival [[Gabriel Tarde]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

Latour's [[monograph]]s earned him a 10th place among most-cited book authors in the humanities and social sciences for the year 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Latour is related to a well-known family of winemakers from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], but is not associated with the similarly named estate in [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Blok, A. &amp; Elgaard Jensen, T. ''Bruno Latour: hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world''. London: Routledge, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a student, Latour originally focused on philosophy and was deeply influenced by [[Michel Serres]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Latour received his Ph.D. in [[theology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skirbekk|first1=Gunnar|title=Bruno Latour’s anthropology of the moderns|url=http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/bruno-latours-anthropology-of-the-moderns|website=Radicalphilosophy.com|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[François Rabelais University|Université de Tours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Latour.htm|title="Bruno Latour" by Heather Vidmar-McEwen|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly developed an interest in [[anthropology]], and undertook fieldwork in [[Ivory Coast]] which resulted in a brief monograph on decolonization, race, and industrial relations.&lt;ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"/&gt;

After spending more than twenty years at the [[Centre de sociologie de l'innovation]] at the [[École des Mines]] in [[Paris]], Latour moved in 2006 to [[Sciences Po]], where he was the first occupant of a chair named for [[Gabriel Tarde]].  In recent years he also served as one of the curators of successful art exhibitions at the [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie]] in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]], including "Iconoclash" (2002) and "Making Things Public" (2005). In 2005 he also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html|title=The Spinoza Chair - Philosophy - University of Amsterdam|first=Universiteit van|last=Amsterdam|website=www.uva.nl|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
On 22 May 2008, Latour was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Université de Montréal]] on the occasion of an [[organizational communication]] conference held in honor of the work of [[James R. Taylor]], on whom Latour has had an important influence. He holds several other honorary doctorates, as well as France's [[Légion d'Honneur]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/biography|title=Biography - bruno-latour.fr|website=www.bruno-latour.fr|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holberg Prize===
On 13 March 2013, he was announced as the winner of the 2013 [[Holberg Prize]].&lt;ref name="holberg1"&gt;[http://www.holbergprisen.no/en/holberg-prize-2013.html Bruno Latour wins the 2013 Holberg Prize], ''Holberg Prize''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/03/13/l-anthropologue-francais-bruno-latour-distingue-en-norvege_1847284_3224.html|title=L'anthropologue français Bruno Latour reçoit le prix Holberg en Norvège|website=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Holbergprisen-til-Bruno-Latour-7146138.html|title=Holbergprisen til Bruno Latour|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize committee stated that "Bruno Latour has undertaken an ambitious analysis and reinterpretation of modernity, and has challenged fundamental concepts such as the distinction between modern and pre-modern, nature and society, human and non-human." The committee states that "the impact of Latour's work is evident internationally and far beyond studies of the history of science, art history, history, philosophy, anthropology, geography, theology, literature and law."&lt;ref name="holberg1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://holbergprisen.no/en/bruno-latour Holberg International Memorial Prize 2013: Bruno Latour.

A 2013 article in [[Aftenposten]] by [[Jon Elster]] criticised the conferment to Latour, by saying "The question is, does he deserve the prize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Den uforståelige Latour|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/Den-uforstaelige-Latour-7183458.html#.UXsG0Uqg1t0|newspaper=[[Aftenposten]]|date=24 April 2013|page=7 Debatt|quote=Spørsmålet er om han fortjener prisen.}}&lt;/ref&gt; …"If the statutes [of the award] had used new knowledge as a main criteria, instead of one of several, then he would be completely unqualified in my opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Den uforståelige Latour|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/Den-uforstaelige-Latour-7183458.html#.UXsG0Uqg1t0|newspaper=[[Aftenposten]]|date=24 April 2013|page=7 Debatt|quote=Hvis statuttene hadde brukt ny kunnskap som hovedkriterium, i stedet for ett av flere kriterier, ville han etter min mening ha vært fullstendig ukvalifisert.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main works ==

===''Laboratory Life''===
After his early career efforts, Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists.  Latour rose in importance{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} following the 1979 publication of ''Laboratory Life:  the Social Construction of Scientific Facts'' with co-author [[Steve Woolgar]]. In the book, the authors undertake an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] study of a [[neuroendocrinology]] research laboratory at the [[Salk Institute]].&lt;ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"/&gt; This early work argued that naïve descriptions of the [[scientific method]], in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment, are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice.

In the laboratory, Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method, and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that, for untrained observers, the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy.

Latour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences.  Drawing on the work of [[Gaston Bachelard]], they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are ''socially constructed'' within the laboratory—that they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them.  They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs, oral traditions and culturally specific practices— in short, science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latour's 1987 book ''Science in Action:  How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society'' is one of the key texts of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows: "Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives, they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor."

Some of Latour's position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latour's position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts: e.g., if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil, Latour's hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Paul R. and Levitt, Norman (1997). ''[[Higher Superstition]]: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science.'' Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, philosopher [[John Searle]]&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (2009) "Why Should You Believe It?" ''The New York Review of Books'', 24 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Latour's "extreme social constructivist" position is seriously flawed on several points, and furthermore has inadvertently "comical results."

===''The Pasteurization of France''===
After a research project examining the sociology of [[primatology|primatologists]], Latour followed up the themes in ''Laboratory Life'' with ''Les Microbes: guerre et paix'' (published in English as ''The Pasteurization of France'' in 1988).  In it, he reviews the life and career of one of France's most famous scientists [[Louis Pasteur]] and his discovery of microbes, in the fashion of a political biography.  Latour highlights the social forces at work in and around Pasteur's career and the uneven manner in which his theories were accepted.  By providing more explicitly ideological explanations for the acceptance of Pasteur's work more easily in some quarters than in others, he seeks to undermine the notion that the acceptance and rejection of scientific theories is primarily, or even usually, a matter of experiment, evidence or reason.  Another work, [[Aramis, or the Love of Technology|''Aramis, or, The Love of Technology'']] focuses on the history of an unsuccessful mass-transit project.

===''We Have Never Been Modern''===
Latour's work ''Nous n’avons jamais été modernes : Essais d’anthropologie symétrique'' was first published in French in 1991, and then in English in 1993 as ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]''.

Latour encouraged the reader of this anthropology of science to re-think and re-evaluate our mental landscape.  He evaluated the work of scientists and contemplated the contribution of the [[scientific method]] to knowledge and work, blurring the distinction across various fields and disciplines.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 190"&gt;Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour:  Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;	

Latour argued that society has never really been modern and promoted nonmodernism (or amodernism) over [[postmodernism]], [[modernism]], or antimodernism.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47, 134}} His stance was that we have never been modern and minor divisions alone separate Westerners now from other collectives.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47, 114}} Latour viewed modernism as an era that believed it had annulled the entire past in its wake.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=69}} He presented the antimodern reaction as defending such entities as spirit, rationality, liberty, society, God, or even the past.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47}} Postmoderns, according to Latour, also accepted the modernistic abstractions as if they were real.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}} In contrast, the nonmodern approach reestablished symmetry between science and technology on the one hand and society on the other.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=138}} Latour also referred to the impossibility of returning to premodernism because it precluded the large scale experimentation which was a benefit of modernism.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=140}}

Latour attempted to prove through case studies the fallacy in the old object/subject and Nature/Society compacts of modernity, which can be traced back to Plato.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 190"/&gt;{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=79}} He refused the concept of "out there" versus "in here".&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 192"&gt;Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour:  Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; He rendered the object/subject distinction as simply unusable and charted a new approach towards knowledge, work, and circulating reference.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 192"/&gt; Latour considered nonmoderns to be playing on a different field, one vastly different than that of post-moderns.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}} He referred to it as much broader and much less polemical, a creation of an unknown territory, which he playfully referred to as the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}}

In 1998, historian of science Margaret C. Jacob argued that Latour's politicized account of the development of modernism in the 17th century is "a fanciful escape from modern Western history".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Margaret C (1998). "Latour's Version of the Seventeenth Century," pp. 240-254 in ''A House Built on Sand: Exposing Postmodernist Myths About Science'', [[Noretta Koertge]] (editor), NY: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0195117255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pandora's Hope''===

''Pandora's Hope'' (1999) marks a return to the themes Latour explored in ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action]]'' and ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]''. It uses independent but thematically linked essays and case studies to question the authority and reliability of scientific knowledge. Latour uses a narrative, anecdotal approach in a number of the essays, describing his work with [[pedology (soil study)|pedologists]] in the Amazon rainforest, the development of the pasteurization process, and the research of French atomic scientists at the outbreak of the Second World War. Latour states that this specific, anecdotal approach to science studies is essential to gaining a full understanding of the discipline: "The only way to understand the reality of science studies is to follow what science studies do best, that is, paying close attention to the details of scientific practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;24). Some authors have criticized Latour's methodology, including Katherine Pandora, a history of science professor at the University of Oklahoma. In her review of ''Pandora's Hope'', Katherine Pandora states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[Latour's] writing can be stimulating, fresh and at times genuinely moving, but it can also display a distractingly mannered style in which a rococo zeal for compounding metaphors, examples, definitions and abstractions can frustrate even readers who approach his work with the best of intentions (notwithstanding the inclusion of a nine-page glossary of terms and liberal use of diagrams in an attempt to achieve the utmost clarity)".&lt;ref name="Pandora"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/science-studies-study |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515142825/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/science-studies-study |archive-date=15 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition to his epistemological concerns, Latour also explores the political dimension of science studies in ''Pandora's Hope''. Two of the chapters draw on Plato's ''Gorgias'' as a means of investigating and highlighting the distinction between content and context. As Katherine Pandora states in her review:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is hard not to be caught up in the author's obvious delight in deploying a classic work from antiquity to bring current concerns into sharper focus, following along as he manages to leave the reader with the impression that the protagonists Socrates and Callicles are not only in dialogue with each other but with Latour as well."&lt;ref name="Pandora" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although Latour frames his discussion with a classical model, his examples of fraught political issues are all current and of continuing relevance: global warming, the spread of mad cow disease, and the carcinogenic effects of smoking are all mentioned at various points in ''Pandora's Hope''. In Felix Stalder's article "Beyond constructivism: towards a realistic realism", he summarizes Latour's position on the political dimension of science studies as follows: "These scientific debates have been artificially kept open in order to render impossible any political action against these problems and those who profit from them".&lt;ref name="Stalder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://felix.openflows.com/html/pandora.html|title=Felix Stalder: Latour's Pandora's Hope (Review)|website=felix.openflows.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam?"===
In a 2004 article,&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. (2004) [http://winteranthology.com/?vol=5&amp;author=latour&amp;title=critique "Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern"]. ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 30, No. 2, Winter 2004, pp. 225-248&lt;/ref&gt; Latour questioned the fundamental premises on which he had based most of his career, asking, "Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies?" He undertakes a trenchant critique of his own field of study and, more generally, of social criticism in contemporary academia. He suggests that critique, as currently practiced, is bordering on irrelevancy. To maintain any vitality, Latour argues that social critiques require a drastic reappraisal: "our critical equipment deserves as much critical scrutiny as the Pentagon budget." (p.&amp;nbsp;231) To regain focus and credibility, Latour argues that social critiques must embrace [[empiricism]], to insist on the "cultivation of a stubbornly realist attitude -- to speak like [[William James]]". (p.&amp;nbsp;233)

Latour suggests that about 90% of contemporary social criticism displays one of two approaches which he terms "the fact position and the fairy position." (p.&amp;nbsp;237) The fairy position is [[fetishism|anti-fetishist]], arguing that "objects of belief" (e.g., religion, arts) are merely concepts created by the projected wishes and desires of the "naive believer"; the "fact position" argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender). (p.&amp;nbsp;238) "Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?” asks Latour: no matter which position you take, "You’re always right!” (p.&amp;nbsp;238-239) Social critics tend to use anti-fetishism against ideas they personally reject; to use "an unrepentant positivist" approach for fields of study they consider valuable; all the while thinking as "a perfectly healthy sturdy realist for what you really cherish." (p.&amp;nbsp;241) These inconsistencies and [[double standards]] go largely unrecognized in social critique because "there is never any crossover between the two lists of objects in the fact position and the fairy position." (p.&amp;nbsp;241)

The practical result of these approaches being taught to millions of students in elite universities for several decades is a widespread and influential "critical barbarity" that has—like a malign virus created by a "[[mad scientist]]"—thus far proven impossible to control. Most troubling, Latour notes that critical ideas have been appropriated by those he describes as [[conspiracy theorists]], including [[global warming skepticism|global warming skeptics]] and the [[9/11 Truth movement]]: "Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique." (p.&amp;nbsp;230)

The conclusion of the article is to argue for a positive framing of critique, to help understand how matters of concern can be supported rather than undermined: "The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naïve believers, but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to gather. The critic is not the one who alternates haphazardly between antifetishism and positivism like the drunk iconoclast drawn by Goya, but the one for whom, if something is constructed, then it means it is fragile and thus in great need of care and caution."

===''Reassembling the Social''&lt;!--linked from 'Actor–network theory'--&gt;===
In ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005),&lt;ref name = "Primary"&gt;Latour, Bruno. '''Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network Theory''.  Oxford, UK: Oxford UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Latour continues a reappraisal of his work, developing what he calls a "practical [[metaphysics]]", which calls "real" anything that an actor (one whom we are studying) claims as a source of motivation for action.  So if someone says, "I was inspired by God to be charitable to my neighbors" we are obliged to recognize the "[[ontological]] weight" of their claim, rather than attempting to replace their belief in God's presence with "social stuff", like class, gender, [[imperialism]], etc. Latour’s nuanced metaphysics demands the existence of a plurality of worlds, and the willingness of the researcher to chart ever more. He argues that researchers must give up the hope of fitting their actors into a structure or framework, but Latour believes the benefits of this sacrifice far outweigh the downsides: "Their complex metaphysics would at least be respected, their recalcitrance recognized, their objections deployed, their multiplicity accepted."&lt;ref name="Primary" /&gt;

For Latour, to talk about [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]]–what really is–means paying close empirical attention to the various, contradictory institutions and ideas that bring people together and inspire them to act. Here is Latour's description of metaphysics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we call metaphysics the discipline . . . that purports to define the basic structure of the world, then empirical metaphysics is what the controversies over agencies lead to since they ceaselessly populate the world with new drives and, as ceaselessly, contest the existence of others.  The question then becomes how to explore the actors' own metaphysics.&lt;ref name="Primary" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A more traditional metaphysicist might object, arguing that this means there are multiple, contradictory realities, since there are "controversies over agencies" – since there is a plurality of contradictory ideas that people claim as a basis for action (God, nature, the state, sexual drives, personal ambition, and so on). This objection manifests the most important difference between traditional philosophical metaphysics and Latour's nuance: for Latour, there is no "basic structure of reality" or a single, self-consistent world. An unknowably large multiplicity of realities, or "worlds" in his terms, exists–one for each actor’s sources of [[agency (sociology)|agency]], inspirations for action. Actors bring "the real" (metaphysics) into being. The task of the researcher is not to find one "basic structure" that explains agency, but to recognize "the metaphysical innovations proposed by ordinary actors".&lt;ref name="Primary" /&gt; Mapping those metaphysical innovations involves a strong dedication to [[relativism]], Latour argues. The relativist researcher "learns the actors' language," records what they say about what they do, and does not appeal to a higher "structure" to "explain" the actor's motivations. The relativist "takes seriously what [actors] are obstinately saying" and "follows the direction indicated by their fingers when they designate what 'makes them act'". The relativist recognizes the plurality of metaphysics that actors bring into being, and attempts to map them rather than reducing them to a single structure or explanation.

'''Cognition''' is "the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cognition - definition of cognition in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cognition|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses processes such as [[attention]], the formation of [[knowledge]], [[memory]] and [[working memory]], [[Value judgment|judgment]] and [[evaluation]], [[reason]]ing and "[[computation]]", [[problem solving]] and [[decision making]], [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] and production of [[language]]. Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge.

The processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[anesthesia]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[education]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[systemics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Von Eckardt|first=Barbara|title=What is cognitive science?|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|pages=45-72|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E8l48-DZln0C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=what+is+cognition#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20is%20cognition&amp;f=false|isbn=9780262720236}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other different approaches to the analysis of cognition are synthesised in the developing field of [[cognitive science]], a progressively autonomous [[academic discipline]].

== Etymology ==
The word ''cognition'' comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''cognosco'' (''con'', 'with', and ''gnōscō'', 'know'; itself a cognate of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb γι(γ)νώσκω, ''gi(g)nόsko'', meaning 'I know, perceive'), meaning 'to conceptualize' or 'to recognize'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Search for a Theory of Cognition: Early Mechanisms and New Ideas|author=Stefano Franchi, Francesco Bianchini|publisher=Rodopi, 2011|chapter=On The Historical Dynamics Of Cognitive Science: A View From The Periphery|page=XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The beginnings of the studies on cognition ==
The word ''cognition'' dates back to the 15th century, when it meant "thinking and awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Cognition: Theory and Practice by Russell Revlin&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to cognitive processes came about more than eighteen centuries earlier, however, beginning with [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) and his interest in the inner workings of the mind and how they affect the human experience. Aristotle focused on cognitive areas pertaining to memory, perception, and mental imagery. He placed great importance on ensuring that his studies were based on empirical evidence, that is, scientific information that is gathered through observation and conscientious experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret|title=Cognition|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two millennia later, as [[psychology]] emerged as a burgeoning field of study in Europe and then gained a following in America, other scientists like Wilhelm Wundt, Herman Ebbinghaus, Mary Whiton Calkins, and William James would offer their contributions to the study of human cognition.

[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832–1920) emphasized the notion of what he called introspection: examining the inner feelings of an individual. With introspection, the subject had to be careful to describe his or her feelings in the most objective manner possible in order for Wundt to find the information scientific.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=A. H.|author2=Milar, K.J.|title=Psychology as a science|journal=Handbook of psychology|year=2003|volume=1|issue=The history of psychology|pages=1–26|doi=10.1002/0471264385.wei0101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O. L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=951–952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Wundt's contributions are by no means minimal, modern psychologists find his methods to be quite subjective and choose to rely on more objective procedures of experimentation to make conclusions about the human cognitive process.

[[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850–1909) conducted cognitive studies that mainly examined the function and capacity of human memory. Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over 2,000 syllables made out of nonexistent words, for instance EAS. He then examined his own personal ability to learn these non-words. He purposely chose non-words as opposed to real words to control for the influence of pre-existing experience on what the words might symbolize, thus enabling easier recollection of them.&lt;ref name=Fuchs /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Zangwill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O.L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebbinghaus observed and hypothesized a number of variables that may have affected his ability to learn and recall the non-words he created. One of the reasons, he concluded, was the amount of time between the presentation of the list of stimuli and the recitation or recall of same.  Ebbinghaus was the first to record and plot a "learning curve," and a "forgetting curve."&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "Unit 7: Memory." p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; His work heavily influenced the study of serial position and its effect on memory, discussed in subsequent sections.

[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an influential American pioneer in the realm of psychology. Her work also focused on the human memory capacity. A common theory, called the [[recency effect]], can be attributed to the studies that she conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madigan|first=S.|author2=O'Hara, R.|title=Short-term memory at the turn of the century: Mary Whiton Calkin's memory research|journal=American Psychologist|year=1992|volume=47|pages=170–174|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.2.170|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recency effect, also discussed in the subsequent experiment section, is the tendency for individuals to be able to accurately recollect the final items presented in a sequence of stimuli. Calkin's theory is closely related to the aforementioned study and conclusion of the memory experiments conducted by Hermann Ebbinghaus.&lt;ref name="Matlin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret|title=Cognition|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] (1842–1910) is another pivotal figure in the history of cognitive science. James was quite discontent with Wundt's emphasis on introspection and Ebbinghaus' use of nonsense stimuli. He instead chose to focus on the human learning experience in everyday life and its importance to the study of cognition. James' most significant contribution to the study and theory of cognition was his textbook ''Principles of Psychology'' that preliminarily examines aspects of cognition such as perception, memory, reasoning, and attention.&lt;ref name=Matlin /&gt;

== In psychology ==
[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the [[concept]] of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking (abstract thinking).]]
In psychology, the term "cognition" is usually used within an [[information processing]] view of an individual's psychological [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functions]] (see [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]]),&lt;ref name="Sternberg2009"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; Sternberg, K. (2009). Cognitive psychology (6th Ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the same in [[cognitive engineering]];&lt;ref name="Blomberg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Blomberg, O.|year = 2011|title = Concepts of cognition for cognitive engineering|journal = [[International Journal of Aviation Psychology]]|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 85–104|doi = 10.1080/10508414.2011.537561}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a branch of [[social psychology]] called [[social cognition]], the term is used to explain [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]], and group dynamics.&lt;ref name="Sternberg2009"/&gt;

Human cognition is conscious and unconscious, concrete or abstract, as well as intuitive (like knowledge of a language) and conceptual (like a model of a language). It encompasses processes such as [[memory]], [[Association of Ideas|association]], [[concept formation]], [[pattern recognition]], [[language]], [[attention]], [[perception]], [[action (philosophy)|action]], [[problem solving]] and [[mental images|mental imagery]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sensation &amp; Perception'', 5th ed. 1999, Coren, Ward &amp; Enns, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cognitive Psychology'', 5th ed. 1999, Best, John B., pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, [[emotion]] was not thought of as a cognitive process, but now much research is being undertaken to examine the [[cognitive psychology]] of emotion; research is also focused on one's awareness of one's own strategies and methods of cognition, which is called [[metacognition]].

While few people would deny that cognitive processes are a function of the [[brain]], a cognitive theory will not necessarily make reference to the brain or to biological processes (compare [[neurocognitive]]). It may purely describe behavior in terms of information flow or function. Relatively recent fields of study such as [[neuropsychology]] aim to bridge this gap, using cognitive paradigms to understand how the brain implements the information-processing functions (see also [[cognitive neuroscience]]), or to understand how pure information-processing systems (e.g., computers) can simulate human cognition (see also [[artificial intelligence]]). The branch of psychology that studies brain injury to infer normal cognitive function is called [[cognitive neuropsychology]]. The links of cognition to [[evolution]]ary demands are studied through the investigation of [[animal cognition]].

=== Piaget's theory of cognitive development ===
For years, sociologists and psychologists have conducted studies on [[cognitive development]] or the construction of human thought or mental processes.

[[Jean Piaget]] was one of the most important and influential people in the field of Developmental Psychology. He believed that humans are unique in comparison to animals because we have the capacity to do "abstract symbolic reasoning." His work can be compared to [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Erik Erikson]] who were also great contributors in the field of Developmental Psychology. Today, Piaget is known for studying the cognitive development in children. He studied his own three children and their intellectual development and came up with a theory that describes the stages children pass through during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Jean Piaget Biography|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesofmajorthinkers/p/piaget.htm|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common experiments on human cognition ===
'''Serial position'''

The serial position experiment is meant to test a theory of memory that states that when information is given in a serial manner, we tend to remember information in the beginning of the sequence, called the primacy effect, and information in the end of the sequence, called the recency effect.  Consequently, information given in the middle of the sequence is typically forgotten, or not recalled as easily. This study predicts that the recency effect is stronger than the primacy effect, because the information that is most recently learned is still in working memory when asked to be recalled. Information that is learned first still has to go through a retrieval process. This experiment focuses on human memory processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surprenant|first=A|title=Distinctiveness and serial position effects in total sequences|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|year=2001|volume=63|pages=737–745|doi=10.3758/BF03194434|pmid=11436742|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Word superiority'''

The word superiority experiment presents a subject with a word, or a letter by itself, for a brief period of time, i.e. 40ms, and they are then asked to recall the letter that was in a particular location in the word. By theory, the subject should be better able to correctly recall the letter when it was presented in a word than when it was presented in isolation. This experiment focuses on human speech and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=L.|title=The word-superiority effect and phonological recoding|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1992|volume=20|pages=685–694|doi=10.3758/BF03202718|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brown-Peterson'''

In the Brown-Peterson experiment, participants are briefly presented with a trigram and in one particular version of the experiment, they are then given a distractor task, asking them to identify whether a sequence of words are in fact words, or non-words (due to being misspelled, etc.). After the distractor task, they are asked to recall the trigram from before the distractor task. In theory, the longer the distractor task, the harder it will be for participants to correctly recall the trigram. This experiment focuses on human short-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nairne|first=J.|author2=Whiteman, H. |author3=Kelley, M. |title=Short-term forgetting of order under conditions of reduced interference|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology|year=1999|volume=52|pages=241–251|doi=10.1080/713755806|url=http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~nairne/pdfs/32.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Memory span'''

During the memory span experiment, each subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters that sound similar, and letters that sound dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order in which it was given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length was increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters that sound dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters that sound similar and with longer words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=May|first=C.|author2=Hasher, L. |author3=Kane, M. |title=The role of interference in memory span|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1999|volume=27|pages=759–767|doi=10.3758/BF03198529|issue=5|pmid=10540805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual search'''

In one version of the visual search experiment, a participant is presented with a window that displays circles and squares scattered across it. The participant is to identify whether there is a green circle on the window. In the "featured" search, the subject is presented with several trial windows that have blue squares or circles and one green circle or no green circle in it at all. In the "conjunctive" search, the subject is presented with trial windows that have blue circles or green squares and a present or absent green circle whose presence the participant is asked to identify. What is expected is that in the feature searches, reaction time, that is the time it takes for a participant to identify whether a green circle is present or not, should not change as the number of distractors increases. Conjunctive searches where the target is absent should have a longer reaction time than the conjunctive searches where the target is present. The theory is that in feature searches, it is easy to spot the target, or if it is absent, because of the difference in color between the target and the distractors. In conjunctive searches where the target is absent, reaction time increases because the subject has to look at each shape to determine whether it is the target or not because some of the distractors if not all of them, are the same color as the target stimuli. Conjunctive searches where the target is present take less time because if the target is found, the search between each shape stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=J. |author2=Cave, K. |author3=Franzel, S.|title=Guided search: An alternative to the feature integration model for visual search|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1989|volume=15|pages=419–433|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.15.3.419|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knowledge representation'''

The [[semantic network]] of [[knowledge representation]] systems has been studied in various paradigms. One of the oldest paradigms is the [[leveling]] and [[sharpening]] of stories as they are repeated from memory studied by [[Frederic Bartlett|Bartlett]]. The [[semantic differential]] used [[factor analysis]] to determine the main meanings of words, finding that [[value (ethics)|value]] or "goodness" of words is the first factor. More controlled experiments examine the categorical relationships of words in [[free recall]]. The hierarchical structure of words has been explicitly mapped in [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]]'s [[Wordnet]]. More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with [[neural network]] experiments based on computational systems such as [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA), [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] analysis, and multidimensional [[factor analysis]]. The semantics (meaning) of words is studied by all the disciplines of [[cognitive science]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

An emergent field of research, referred to as "Team Cognition", is arising in military sciences. "Team cognition" indicates “an emergent property of teams that results from the interplay of individual cognition and team process behaviors [...] [Team cognition] underlies team performance” (Arizona State University East, 2005, Cooke NJ, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Russo, M.; Fiedler, E.; Thomas, M.; McGhee (2005),  United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory.

The '''common beisa oryx''' (''Oryx beisa beisa'') also known as the '''beisa oryx''' is a [[nominate subspecies]] of the [[East African oryx]] native to the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Kenya]]. It is closely related to the [[fringe-eared oryx]]. 
There are five species of Oryx. Although they are very similar in appearance they have few distinct characteristics. Common Beisa Oryx have fringe-ears and black tufts of hair that extend past their ears. However, all species of Oryx are compact and muscular with relative long bodies and broad necks. There are not any marked difference between male and female Oryx. 
The Common Beisa Oryx enjoy feeding on variety of grass species. They feed during the day when the plants hold the most water. During dry season, they feed on poisonous adenium plant. 

==Habitat==
Beisa oryx once inhibited a large region of Northeastern Africa, from Sudan to Africa down to Tanzania, but it has been going extinct rapidly. Now they mostly remain in Ethiopia and Northern Kenya. Beisa oryx stay in bushland and grassland areas. During wet season, they move to high ground, avoid tall grass and saturated areas. They move great distant to find a perfect location and stay for few seasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Conceptual architecture''' is a form of architecture that utilizes [[conceptualism]], characterized by an introduction of ideas or concepts from outside of architecture often as a means of expanding the discipline of architecture. This produces an essentially different kind of building than one produced by the widely held 'architect as a master-builder' model, in which craft and construction are the guiding principles. The finished building as product is less important in conceptual architecture, than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations. Architects that work in this vein are [[Diller and Scofidio|Diller + Scofidio]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Peter Eisenman]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]].

Conceptual architecture was studied in the essay, ''Notes on Conceptual Architecture: Towards a Definition'' by [[Peter Eisenman]] in 1970, and again by the Harvard Design Magazine in Fall of 2003 and Winter 2004, by a series of articles under the heading ''Architecture as Conceptual Art''. But the understanding of design as a construction of a concept was understood by many [[modern architecture|modernist architects]] as well. To quote [[Louis Kahn]] on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]:

:''It doesn't work, it doesn't have to work. Wright had the shape conceived long before he knew what was going into it. I claim that is where architecture starts, with the concept.''&lt;ref&gt;
Louis Kahn quote from Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture, a critical history.'' page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1094">'''Conceptual necessity''' is a property of the certainty with which a state of affairs, as presented by a certain description, occurs: it occurs by conceptual necessity if and only if it occurs just by virtue of the meaning of the description. If someone is a [[bachelor]], for instance, then he is bound to be unmarried by conceptual necessity, because the meaning of the word "bachelor" determines that he is.

Alternatively, there is [[metaphysical necessity]], which is a certainty determined, not by the meaning of a description, but instead by facts in the world described.

Historically, [[Baruch Spinoza]] was a subscriber to this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/notes.html |title=Notes to Spinoza's Modal Metaphysics |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2013 |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Democide''' is a term proposed by [[R. J. Rummel]] since at least 1994&lt;ref name=harff1996/&gt;&lt;!-- book was 1994; book review published in 1996 --&gt; who defined it as "''the intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by government agents acting in their authoritative capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command''".&lt;ref name="harf@rummel"/&gt; According to him, this definition covers a wide range of deaths, including forced labor and concentration camp victims; killings by "unofficial" private groups; extrajudicial summary killings; and mass deaths due to the governmental acts of criminal omission and neglect, such as in deliberate famines, as well as killings by ''de facto'' governments, i.e. civil war killings.&lt;ref name="harf@rummel"&gt;Barbara Harff. The Comparative Analysis of Mass Atrocities and Genocide. Chapter 12. p. 112-115. in N.P. Gleditsch (ed.), R.J. Rummel: An Assessment of His Many Contributions, SpringerBriefs on Pioneers in Science and Practice 37, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-54463-2. [http://afes-press-books.de/html/SpringerBriefs_PSP_Rummel.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; This definition covers any murder of any number of persons by any government.&lt;ref name="harf@rummel"/&gt;  

Rummel created the term as an extended concept to include forms of government murder not covered by the term genocide. According to Rummel, democide surpassed war as the leading cause of non-natural death in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democraticpeace.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/democide-vs-other-causes-of-death/|title=Democide Vs. Other Causes of Death|author=R. J. Rummel|date=Feb 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder since 1900|author=R. J. Rummel|year=1998|isbn=978-3825840105|publisher=LIT Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three meanings of genocide==
{{Genocide}}
Democide is the murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide and mass murder. Democide is not necessarily the elimination of entire cultural groups but rather groups within the country that the government feels need to be eradicated for political reasons and due to claimed future threats.

According to Rummel, genocide has three different meanings.

# The '''ordinary''' meaning is murder by government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial or religious group membership. 
# The '''legal''' meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty on genocide, the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].  This also includes nonlethal acts that in the end eliminate or greatly hinder the group. Looking back on history, one can see the different variations of democides that have occurred, but it still consists of acts of killing or mass murder. 
# '''Democide''' – This generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. In order to avoid confusion over which meaning is intended. Rummel created the term democide for this third meaning.&lt;ref name="Genocide"&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/GENOCIDE.HTM Genocide].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The objectives of democide include the disintegration of the political and social institutions of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups; the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity; and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lemkin, Raphael. ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'', 1944.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Some examples of democide cited by Rummel include [[the Great Purges]] carried out by [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Soviet Union]], the deaths from the [[Colonialism|colonial]] policy in the [[Congo Free State]], and [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Great Leap Forward]], which resulted in a [[Great Chinese Famine|famine that killed millions of people]]. According to Rummel, these were not cases of genocide because those who were killed were not selected on the basis of their race, but were killed in large numbers as a result of government policies. Famine is classified by Rummel as democide if it fits the definition above.

For instance, Rummel re-classified [[Mao Zedong]]'s Great Leap Forward as democide in 2005. He originally believed that Mao's policies were largely responsible for the famine, but that Mao's advisers had misled him. Therefore, he believed it was not an intentional famine and thus not a democide. However, reports from [[Jung Chang]] and [[Jon Halliday]]'s ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'' allege that Mao knew about the famine from the beginning but did not care, and eventually Mao had to be stopped by a meeting of 7,000 top Communist Party members. Based on this new evidence, Rummel now believes the famine was intentional and considers it a democide. Taking this into account, the total for Chinese Communist Party democide is 80.86 million, more than the Soviet Union (62 million), Nazi Germany (21 million), or any other regime in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democraticpeace.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/getting-my-reestimate-of-maos-democide-out/|title=Getting My Reestimate Of Mao's Democide Out|date=2005-11-30|accessdate=2007-04-09|author=R.J. Rummel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democide ==
In his estimates, Rummel relies mostly on historical accounts, an approach that rarely provides accurate estimates. His estimates typically include a wide range and cannot be considered determinative.&lt;ref name=harff1996&gt;Barbara Harff. Reviewed Work(s): [https://www.jstor.org/stable/206491 Death by Government] by R. J. Rummel, ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', Vol. 27, No. 1 (Summer, 1996), pp. 117-119. Published by: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Thus, Rummel calculates nearly 43 million deaths due to democide inside and outside the Soviet Union during Stalin's regime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DBG.TAB1.4.GIF&lt;/ref&gt; This is much higher than an often quoted figure of 20 million, or a more recent figure of 9 million&lt;ref&gt;Tymothy Snyder. Hitler vs. Stalin: Who was worse? ''The New York Review of Books'' January 27, 2011,[http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/]&lt;/ref&gt;. Rummel has responded that the 20 million estimate is based on a figure from  [[Robert Conquest]]'s 1968 book ''[[The Great Terror]]'', and that Conquest's qualifier "almost certainly too low" is usually forgotten. Conquest's calculations excluded camp deaths before 1936 and after 1950, executions from 1939–1953, the vast deportation of the people of captive nations into the camps and their deaths 1939–1953, the massive deportation within the Soviet Union of minorities 1941–1944 and their deaths, and those the Soviet Red Army and secret police executed throughout Eastern Europe after their conquest during 1944–1945. Moreover, the [[Holodomor]] that killed 5 million in 1932–1934 is also not included.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

His research shows that the death toll from democide is far greater than the death toll from war. After studying over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, Rummel estimates that there have been 262 million victims of democide in the last century.  According to his figures, six times as many people have died from the actions of people working for governments than have died in battle.

One of his main findings is that liberal democracies have much less democide than authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Miracle"&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/MIRACLE.HTM Miracle].&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there is a relation between political power and democide. Political mass murder grows increasingly common as political power becomes unconstrained. At the other end of the scale, where power is diffuse, checked, and balanced, political violence is a rarity. According to Rummel, "The more power a regime has, the more likely people will be killed. This is a  major reason for promoting freedom." Rummel concludes that "concentrated political power is the most dangerous thing on earth."

Several other researchers have found similar results. "Numerous researchers point out that democratic norms and political structures constrain elite decisions about the use of repression against their citizens whereas autocratic elites are not so constrained. Once in place, democratic institutions—even partial ones—reduce the likelihood of armed conflict and all but eliminate the risk that it will lead to geno/politicide."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/ Genocide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030201259/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/ |date=2007-10-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers often give widely different estimates of mass murder. They use different definitions, methodology, and sources. For example, some include battle deaths in their calculations.

'''Dramatic structure''' is the structure of a [[drama]]tic work such as a [[Play (theater)|play]] or [[film]]. Many scholars have analyzed dramatic structure, beginning with [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE). This article looks at Aristotle's analysis of the Greek tragedy and on [[Gustav Freytag]]'s analysis of [[Theater of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] drama.

==History==
In his ''Poetics'', the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher Aristotle put forth the idea the play should imitate a single whole action. "A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end" (1450b27).&lt;ref name="fall2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1450b Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; He split the play into two parts: complication and unravelling.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] drama critic [[Horace]] advocated a 5-act structure in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]: "Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu fabula" (lines 189–190) ("A play should not be shorter or longer than five acts").

The fourth-century Roman grammarian [[Aelius Donatus]] defined the play as a three part structure, the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]).

In 1863, around the time that playwrights like [[Henrik Ibsen]] were abandoning the 5-act structure and experimenting with 3 and 4-act plays, the [[Germany|German]] playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote ''Die Technik des Dramas'', a definitive study of the 5-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag's pyramid.&lt;ref name="fall3"&gt;University of South Carolina (2006).

==Aristotle's analysis==
Many structural principles still in use by modern storytellers were explained by Aristotle in his ''Poetics''. In the part that we still have, he mostly analyzed the tragedy. A part analyzing the comedy is believed to have existed but is now lost.

Aristotle stated that the tragedy should imitate a whole action, which means that the events follow each other by probability or necessity, and that the causal chain has a beginning and an end.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0009 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VII]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a knot, a central problem that the protagonist must face. The play has two parts:  complication and unravelling.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; During complication, the protagonist finds trouble as the knot is revealed or tied; during unraveling, the knot is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section XVIII ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] are of special interest:  the reversal, which throws the action in a new direction, and the recognition, meaning the protagonist has an important revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0008 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VI]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reversals should happen as a necessary and probable cause of what happened before, which implies that turning points needs to be properly set up.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0013 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications should arise from a flaw in the protagonist. In the tragedy, this flaw will be his undoing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0015 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freytag's analysis&lt;!--'Dramatic arc' redirects here--&gt;==
[[File:Freytags pyramid.svg|thumb|250px|"Freytag's pyramid", symbolizing his theory of dramatic structure]]
According to Freytag, a drama is divided into five parts, or acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freytag|first=Gustav|title=Die Technik des Dramas|year=1863|url=http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|accessdate=2009-01-20|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116004731/http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some refer to as a '''{{visible anchor|dramatic arc}}'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and dénouement. Freytag's Pyramid can help writers organize their thoughts and ideas when describing the main problem of the drama, the rising action, the climax and the falling action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Freytag's analysis of dramatic structure is based on five-act plays, it can be applied (sometimes in a modified manner) to short stories and novels as well, making dramatic structure a [[literary element]]. Nonetheless, the pyramid is not always easy to use, especially in modern plays such as [[Alfred Uhry]]'s ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' and  [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'', which is actually divided into 25 scenes without concrete acts.

===Exposition===
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}

The exposition is the portion of a story that introduces important background information to the audience; for example, information about the setting, events occurring before the main plot, characters' back stories, etc. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising action===
In the rising action, a series of events build toward the point of greatest interest. The rising action of a story is the series of events that begin immediately after the exposition (introduction) of the story and builds up to the climax. These events are generally the most important parts of the story since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and ultimately the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=125-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climax===
{{main article|Climax (narrative)}}

The climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist's fate. If the story is a comedy and things were going badly for the protagonist, the plot will begin to unfold in his or her favor, often requiring  the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths.  If the story is a tragedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from good to bad for the protagonist, often revealing the protagonist's hidden weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=128-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falling action===
During the falling action, the conflict between the [[protagonist]] and the [[antagonist]] unravels, with the protagonist winning or losing against the antagonist. The falling action may contain a moment of final suspense, in which the final outcome of the conflict is in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dénouement&lt;!--'Dénouement' redirects here--&gt;===
{{see also|Detective dénouement }}
The '''''dénouement'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) comprises events from the end of the falling action to the actual ending scene of the drama or narrative. [[Conflict (narrative)|Conflict]]s are resolved, creating normality for the characters and a sense of [[catharsis]], or release of tension and anxiety, for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=137-140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the French word ''dénouement'' is derived from the word ''dénouer'', "to untie", from ''nodus'', Latin for "knot." It is the unraveling or untying of the complexities of a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The comedy ends with a ''dénouement'' (a conclusion), in which the protagonist is better off than at the story's outset. The tragedy ends with a catastrophe, in which the protagonist is worse off than at the beginning of the narrative. Exemplary of a comic ''dénouement'' is the final scene of [[Shakespeare]]’s comedy ''[[As You Like It]]'', in which couples marry, an evildoer repents, two disguised characters are revealed for all to see, and a ruler is restored to power. In Shakespeare's tragedies, the ''dénouement'' is usually the death of one or more characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==

Freytag's analysis was intended to apply to ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama, not modern.

Contemporary dramas increasingly use the fall to increase the relative height of the climax and dramatic impact ([[melodrama]]). The protagonist reaches up but falls and succumbs to doubts, fears, and limitations. The negative climax occurs when the protagonist has an epiphany and encounters the greatest fear possible or loses something important, giving the protagonist the courage to take on another obstacle. This confrontation becomes the classic climax.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;Teruaki Georges Sumioka: The Grammar of Entertainment Film 2005, {{ISBN|978-4-8459-0574-4}}; [http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sumioka-info/resouce/resouce.html lectures at Johannes-Gutenberg-University in German]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''extrinsic incentives bias''' is an [[attributional bias]] according to which people attribute relatively more to "extrinsic incentives" (such as monetary reward) than to "intrinsic incentives" (such as learning a new skill) when weighing the motives of others rather than themselves.

It is a counter-example to the [[fundamental attribution error]] as according to the extrinsic bias others are presumed to have ''situational'' motivations while oneself is seen as having ''dispositional'' motivations. This is the opposite of what the fundamental attribution error would predict. The term was first proposed by [[Chip Heath]], citing earlier research by others in [[management science]].&lt;ref name="heath"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heath|first=Chip|title=On the Social Psychology of Agency Relationships: Lay Theories of Motivation Overemphasize Extrinsic Incentives|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=1999|volume=78|issue=1|pages=25–62|url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/heath/documents/social%20psych%20of%20agency.pdf|doi=10.1006/obhd.1999.2826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
In the simplest experiment Heath reported, [[MBA]] students were asked to rank the expected job motivations of [[Citibank]] [[customer service|customer service representatives]]. Their average ratings were as follows:

# Amount of pay
# Having job security
# Quality of fringe benefits
# Amount of praise from your supervisor
# Doing something that makes you feel good about yourself
# Developing skills and abilities
# Accomplishing something worthwhile
# Learning new things

Actual customer service representatives rank ordered their own motivations as follows:

# Developing skills and abilities
# Accomplishing something worthwhile
# Learning new things
# Quality of fringe benefits
# Having job security
# Doing something that makes you feel good about yourself
# Amount of pay
# Amount of praise from your supervisor

The order of the predicted and actual reported motivations was nearly reversed; in particular, pay was rated first by others but near last for respondents of themselves. Similar effects were observed when MBA students rated managers and their classmates.&lt;ref name="heath"/&gt;

==Debiasing==
Heath suggests trying to infer others' motivations as one would by inferring one's own motivations.&lt;ref name="heath" /&gt;

== In economics ==
[[File:Soft drink shelf 2.jpg|thumb|237px|The freedom to choose which brand and flavor of soda to buy is related to [[Competition (economics)|market competition]]]]
In [[microeconomics]], freedom of choice is the freedom of [[Agent (economics)|economic agents]] to allocate their [[resources]] as they see fit, among the options (such as goods, services, or assets) that are available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Robert E. |authorlink1=Robert Hall (economist) |last2=Lieberman |first2=Marc |title=Microeconomics: Principles &amp; Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR9uvGmChp8C |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |location= |isbn=9781439038970 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pagoso|first1=Cristobal M. |last2=Dinio |first2=Rosemary P. |last3=Villasis |first3=George A.|title=Introductory Microeconomics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8Der6qyzaUC |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |year=1994 |publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc. |location= |isbn=9789712315404 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the freedom to engage in employment available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quizlet.com/3805244/microeconomics-chapter-04-the-market-system-flash-cards/ |title=Quizlet Microeconomics, Chapter 04 – The Market System |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratner et al., in 2008, cited the literature on [[libertarian paternalism]] which states that consumers do not always act in their own best interests. They attribute this phenomenon to factors such as emotion, cognitive limitations and biases, and incomplete information which they state may be remedied by various proposed interventions.  They discuss providing consumers with information and decision tools, organizing and restricting their market options, and tapping emotions and managing expectations. Each of these, they state, could improve consumers' ability to choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ratner | first1 = R.

However, [[economic freedom]] to choose ultimately depends upon [[market competition]], since buyers' available options are usually the result of various factors controlled by sellers, such as overall [[Quality (business)|quality]] of a product or a service and [[Advertising|advertisement]]. In the event that a [[monopoly]] exists, the consumer no longer has the freedom to choose to buy from a different producer. As [[Friedrich Hayek]] pointed out:
{{quote|text=Our freedom of choice in a competitive society rests on the fact that, if one person refuses to satisfy our wishes, we can turn to another. But if we face a monopolist we are at his absolute mercy.|sign=[[Friedrich Hayek]]|source=''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', "Can planning free us from care?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QyQwvLDLycC|accessdate=February 15, 2013|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-32061-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As shown in the above quote, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] thinkers are often strong advocates for increasing freedom of choice. One example of this is [[Milton Friedman]]'s ''[[Free to Choose]]'' book and TV series.

There is no consensus as to whether an increase in economic freedom of choice leads to an increase in happiness.

The [[Axiomatic system|axiomatic]]-[[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] approach has been used to address the issue of measuring the amount of freedom of choice (FoC) an individual enjoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dowding|first1=Keith|authorlink1=Keith Dowding|last2=van Hees|first2=Martin|authorlink2=Martin van Hees|title=Oxford Handbook of Individual and Social Choice|url=http://www.rug.nl/staff/martin.van.hees/2009handb.pdf|accessdate=February 15, 2013|year=2009|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press|chapter=Chapter 15 – Freedom of Choice|pages=374–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pattanaik | first1 = Prasanta K. | last2 = Xu | first2 = Yongsheng | author-link1 = Prasanta Pattanaik | title = On ranking opportunity sets in terms of freedom of choice | journal = Recherches Économiques de Louvain / Louvain Economic Review | volume = 56 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 383–90 | publisher = Department of Economics, Universite Catholique de Louvain via JSTOR | jstor = 40723933 | date = 1990 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Xu | first = Yongsheng | title = On ranking linear budget sets in terms of freedom of choice | journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 281–89 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s00355-003-0287-x | date = February 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-003-0287-x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prasanta Pattanaik|Prasanta K. Pattanaik]] and Yongsheng Xu presented three conditions that a measurement of FoC should satisfy:
#''Indifference between no-choice situations''. Having only one option amounts to the same FoC, no matter what the option is.
#''Strict monotonicity''. Having two distinct options x and y amounts to more FoC than having only the option x.
#''Independence''. If a situation A has more FoC than B, by adding a new option x to both (not contained in A or B), A will still have more FoC than B.
They proved that the [[cardinality]] is the only measurement that satisfies these axioms, what they observed to be counter-intuitive and suggestive that one or more axioms should be reformulated. They illustrated this with the example of the option set "to travel by train" or "to travel by car", that should yield more FoC than the option set "to travel by red car" or "to travel by blue car". Some suggestions have been made to solve this problem, by reformulating the axioms, usually including concepts of [[preference]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sen | first1 = Amartya | author-link1 = Amartya Sen | title = Welfare, preference and freedom | journal = Journal of Econometrics | volume = 50 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 15–29 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/0304-4076(91)90087-T | date = October 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-4076(91)90087-T | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pattanaik | first1 = Prasanta K. | last2 = Xu | first2 = Yongsheng | author-link1 = Prasanta Pattanaik | title = On preference and freedom | journal = Theory and Decision | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–98 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1023/A:1004924211553 | date = April 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004924211553 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sugden | first = Robert | title = The metric of opportunity | journal = Economics and Philosophy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–37 | publisher = Cambridge Journals | doi = 10.1017/S0266267100003874 | date = October 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266267100003874 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rejecting the third axiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Carter | first = Ian | title = Choice, freedom, and freedom of choice | journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–81 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s00355-003-0277-z | date = February 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-003-0277-z | quote = an explication of freedom of choice should reject the third axiom | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with happiness ==
A 2006 study by Simona Botti and Ann L. McGill showed that, when subjects were presented with differentiated options and had the freedom to choose between them, their choice enhanced their satisfaction with positive and dissatisfaction with negative outcomes, relative to nonchoosers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Botti|first1=Simona|last2=McGill|first2=Ann L.|year=2006|title=When Choosing is Not Deciding: The Effect Of Perceived Responsibility on Satisfaction|journal= Journal of Consumer Research|volume=33|ssrn=1516287|accessdate=|doi=10.1086/506302|pages=211–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by [[Hazel Rose Markus]] and [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]] compiled a list of experiments about freedom of choice and argued that "too much choice can produce a paralyzing uncertainty, depression, and selfishness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Markus | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1086/651242 | title = Does Choice Mean Freedom and Well‐Being? | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | page = 344 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz argues that people frequently experience regret due to [[opportunity cost]]s for not making an optimal decision and that, in some scenarios, people's overall satisfaction are sometimes higher when a difficult decision is made by another person rather than by themselves, even when the other person's choice is worse. Schwarts had written a book and given speeches criticizing the excess of options in modern society, though acknowledging that "some choice is better than none".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwartz|first=Barry|title=The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less|year=2005|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=0060005696|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html|title=The paradox of choice|last1=Schwartz|first1=Barry|date=July 2005|work=Talk|publisher=TED|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fruit of the poisonous tree''' is a legal metaphor in the United States used to describe [[evidence]] that is obtained illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Criminal Procedure|last=Dressler|first=Joshua|authorlink=|year=2002|edition=3rd|publisher=LexisNexis|location=Newark, NJ|isbn=0-8205-5405-7|pages=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of the terminology is that if the source (the "tree") of the evidence or evidence itself is tainted, then anything gained (the "fruit") from it is tainted as well.

==History==
The doctrine underlying the name was first described in ''[[Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States]]'', 251 U.S. 385 (1920).&lt;ref&gt;''Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States'', 251 U.S. 385 (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fruit+of+a+poisonous+tree |title=Fruit of a poisonous tree legal definition of Fruit of a poisonous tree.

United States]]'' (1939).

Such evidence is not generally admissible in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaines|first=Larry|authorlink=|author2=Miller, LeRoy|title=Criminal Justice In Action: The Core |year=2006|publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]]|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0-495-00305-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a police officer conducted an unconstitutional ([[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]) search of a home and obtained a key to a train station locker, and evidence of a crime came from the locker, that evidence would most likely be excluded under the fruit of the poisonous tree [[legal doctrine]].  The testimony of a witness who is discovered through illegal means would not necessarily be excluded, however, {{citation needed span|text=due to the "attenuation doctrine"|date=March 2018}}, which allows certain evidence or testimony to be admitted in court if the link between the illegal police conduct and the resulting evidence or testimony is sufficiently attenuated.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  It is believed{{by whom|date=March 2018}} that a witness who freely and voluntarily testifies is enough of an independent intervening factor to sufficiently "attenuate" the connection between the government's illegal discovery of the witness and the witness's voluntary testimony itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  (''United States v. Ceccolini'', 435 U.S. 268 (1978))

The "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine is an extension of the [[exclusionary rule]], which, subject to some exceptions, prevents evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment from being admitted in a criminal trial.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Like the exclusionary rule, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is intended to deter police from using illegal means to obtain evidence.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The doctrine is subject to four main exceptions.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The tainted evidence is admissible if:
# it was discovered in part as a result of an independent, untainted source; or
# [[Inevitable discovery|it would inevitably have been discovered despite the tainted source]]; or
# the chain of causation between the illegal action and the tainted evidence is too attenuated; or
# the search warrant was not found to be valid based on [[probable cause]], but was executed by government agents in good faith (called the [[good-faith exception]]).

This doctrine was also used by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in ''[[Gäfgen v. Germany]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In certain cases continental European countries have similar laws (e.g. in cases of torture), while the doctrine itself is generally not known.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Illegally obtained evidence is used by the courts to ensure that the judgment is factually correct, however the person obtaining the illegal evidence typically faces independent consequences.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

==Use==
A curve can be described, and thereby defined, by a pair of [[scalar field]]s: curvature &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and torsion &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, both of which depend on some parameter which [[parametric equation|parametrizes]] the curve but which can ideally be the [[arc length]] of the curve.  From just the curvature and torsion, the [[vector field]]s for the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors can be derived using the [[Frenet–Serret formulas]].  Then, [[Integral|integration]] of the tangent field (done numerically, if not analytically) yields the curve.

==Congruence==
If a pair of curves are in different positions but have the same curvature and torsion, then they are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to each other.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8337">'''Gestalt qualities''' (''Gestaltqualitäten'' in German) were introduced by the Austrian philosopher [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (1859–1932). The remarkable essay "On Gestalt Qualities," published in 1890 by Ehrenfels has given a name to one of the most characteristic schools of scientific thought in our time and thereby established its existence formally.  It is responsible for the word "Gestalt" having acquired citizenship in the English language; and even the term "Ehrenfels qualities" is encountered here and there in American psychological literature as a term designating Gestalt properties.  The qualities were based on tests done by flashing lights for certain amounts of time. This discovery later led to the famous [[Gestalt effect]] discovered by [[Max Wertheimer]]. A formed Gestalt always is entire, complete structures with clearly defined contours. Quality “trans – positivity” manifested in the fast that the image of the whole remains even if all parts change in its material.  But Ehrenfels did more than baptize the new movement.  With great discernment he immediately alluded to many of the questions that the Gestalt problem raises in the minds of thoughtful theorists even today.&lt;ref&gt;Henle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of Gestalt theory==

Beginning with a few remarks about the history of [[Gestalt psychology]]—because not all chapters of this history are generally known. In the eighties of the past century, psychologists in Europe were greatly disturbed by von Ehrenfels' claim that thousands of percepts have characteristics which cannot be derived from the characteristics of their ultimate components, the so-called [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s. Chords and melodies in hearing, the shape characteristics of visual objects, the roughness or the smoothness of tactual impressions, and so forth were used as examples. All these "Gestalt qualities" have one thing in common. When the physical stimuli in question are considerably changed, while their relations are kept constant, the Gestalt qualities remain about the same. But, At the time, it was generally assumed that the sensations involved are individually determined by their individual stimuli and must therefore change when these are greatly changed.  Both positive and negative esthetic characteristics of the world around us, not only of ornaments, paintings, sculptures, tunes, and so forth, but also of trees, landscapes, houses, cars—and other persons—belong to this class. That relations between the sexes largely depend on specimens of the same class need hardly be emphasized. It is, therefore, not safe to deal with problems of psychology as though there were no such qualities. And yet, beginning with Ehrenfels himself, psychologists have not been able to explain their nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler&lt;/ref&gt;

In the analysis of Gestalts, the whole is primary. The parts are understood within the systematic whole. A [[paradigmatic]] example of "Gestalt qualities" is a [[melody]], which sounds the same in any key. In 1890, Christian von Ehrenfels attributed these qualities to melodies as "a positive quality of presentation," not something projected upon sense data. Ehrenfels extended these qualities to "Gestalt qualities of a higher order," (such as marriage, service, theft, and war) concepts that retain their identity even though the examples that instantiate them change. For [[philosophers]] and [[psychologists]] of the 1890s, it was not clear whether these qualities of structure were philosophical or psychological. The Gestalt theorists would attempt to integrate both in an experimental science. [[Jonathan Crary]] describes Ehrenfels' assertions within the modern problem of form as the attempt to formulate "laws" that would give to perception a semblance of the same unconditional guarantees that vision had had within the classical regime of visuality.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfels&lt;/ref&gt;  

The starting point of the theory of Gestalt qualities was the attempt to answer the question: what is a melody?  The evident answer is the sum of the individual tones which make up the melody.  The fact that the same melody may be made up of different groups of tones opposes this theory.  Ernst Mach, who was struck by this fact, drew from it the conclusion that the essence of melody must reside in a sum of special sensation which accompany the tones as aural sensations.  Mach did not know how to specify these special sensations.  
The pivotal step in founding the theory of Gestalt qualities was the declaration that if memory images of successive tones are present as a simultaneous consciousness-complex, then a presentation of new category can arise in consciousness.  This would in turn be a unitary presentation, which is uncharacteristically associated with the presentations of the related complex of tones.&lt;ref&gt;Boeree&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of Gestalt==

All of the above properties of perception – the constant figure, the background – in gestalt is in a relationship with each other and represents a new property. This is the gestalt form quality. The integrity of the perception and its order are achieved through the following principles of Gestalt psychology:&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfels&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Closeness'''. ''Nearby incentives tend to be seen together''.
*'''Similarity'''. ''Incentives that are similar in size, shape, color or form tend to be seen together.''
*'''Integrity'''. ''Perception tends to simplicity and integrity''.
*'''Insularity'''. ''Reflects the tendency to complete a figure so that it takes a full form''.
*'''Contiguity'''. ''The incentives’ closeness in space and time. Contiguity can predetermine the perception when one event causes another.''
*'''Common area'''. ''Principles of gestalt form our everyday perception, along with learning and past experiences. Anticipating the thoughts and expectations and actively manage our interpretation of sensations.'' &lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfels&lt;/ref&gt;

By pointing out that Gestalt qualities are subject to abstraction Ehrenfels provided, at the same time and apparently without realizing it, the "counterweight to the individualistic tendencies" of which he speaks in the last paragraph of his paper.  More recently, Gestalt theory has indeed been claimed as an ally for the idiographic view, according to which the uniqueness of the individual whole excludes any kind of lawful generalization.  Ehrenfels touches the most sensitive spot of Gestalt theory when he discusses a question likely to be raised in response to his approach.  There is to be assumed an infinitely large number of mutual influences among the parts or combinations of parts.  His most striking counterargument is if we look at the facts, we find that each part is clearly given to us as to its own nature and function in the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Henle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gestalt qualities in poetry==

After an empirical investigation of the perceived effects of poetry the relationship between rhyme pattern and Gestalt qualities was investigated by manipulating the rhyme scheme of a four-line stanza. It was assumed that the perceived effects of poetry are a function of the degree of perceptual organization that can be found in the poetic text. Furthermore, to be receptive to such effects demands an experiential set on the part of the reader, which may be predicted from the reader's rating on the Absorption Scale. The results indicate that high-absorption and low-absorption readers differ in their perception and evaluation of the texts. In particular, what the low-absorption readers judge to be good closure, the high-absorption readers judge to be ‘open’.&lt;ref&gt;Reuven&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''''idée reçue''''' (pronounced {{IPA-fr|ide rəsy|}}), plural '''idées reçues''', a [[French language|French]] phrase literally meaning a received (accepted) idea, is a generally held opinion or concept.  This term was used by [[Gustave Flaubert]] in his work [[Dictionary of Received Ideas|''Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues'']] to refer to clichés and platitudes, most of which are as insipid as they are banal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1667">'''Importance''' is a subjective indicator of value. As a concept, importance is the recognized attribution of a subject's significance or value as defined by a [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. In its most basic form, importance is used to define subjects that are essential and relevant from those that are not. A subject that is defined as of having no importance is often seen as having no value.

== Definition ==
[[Merriam-Webster]] defines "important" as "marked by or indicative of significant worth or consequence: valuable in content or relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/important | title=Important | publisher=Merriam-Webster.com | accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary defines "important" as "having serious meaning or worth, deserving or requiring serious attention, and having power, authority, or influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/definition/important | title="Important" | accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that "the concept of importance appears to be so fundamental that a satisfactory analysis of it may not be possible at all".&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Frankfurt, ''The Importance of What We Care About: Philosophical Essays'' (1988), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">In mathematics, the '''indicator vector''' or '''characteristic vector''' or '''incidence vector''' of a [[subset]] ''T'' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is the vector &lt;math&gt;x_T := (x_s)_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_s = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s \in T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_s = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s \notin T.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''S'' is [[countable set|countable]] and its elements are numbered so that &lt;math&gt;S = \{s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x_T = (x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_i = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s_i \in T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s_i \notin T.&lt;/math&gt;

To put it more simply, the indicator vector of ''T'' is a vector with one element for each element in ''S'', with that element being one if the corresponding element of ''S'' is in ''T'', and zero if it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematical Classification and Clustering|first= Boris Grigorʹevich |last=Mirkin|page=112|isbn=0-7923-4159-7|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brzLe4X4ypEC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=indicator+vector+subset&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=plX5UpzkFITPkQfklIDQDQ&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=indicator%20vector%20subset&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Tutorial on Spectral Clustering|first=Ulrike|last=von Luxburg|work=Statistics and Computing|volume=17|issue=4|year=2007|page=2|url=http://www.kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/attachments/Luxburg07_tutorial_4488%5B0%5D.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Decoding Linear Codes Via Optimization and Graph-based Techniques|first=Mohammad H. |last=Taghavi|page=21|publisher=ProQuest|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UCpDYih3WcC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22indicator+vector%22+subset&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c2T5UteBMsOfkAeitoDQBg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22indicator%20vector%22%20subset&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An indicator vector is a special (countable) case of an [[indicator function]].

==Example==
If ''S'' is the set of [[natural number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and ''T'' is some subset of the natural numbers, then the indicator vector is naturally a single point in the [[Cantor space]]: that is, an infinite sequence of 1's and 0's, indicating membership, or lack thereof, in ''T''.  Such vectors commonly occur in the study of [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

'''Isa Soares''' (born 1953) is a Brazilian-born Argentine dancer and activist involved in creating awareness of the African traditions of Argentina and fighting racism against [[Afro-Argentines|Afro-Argentine]] peoples. She was one of the pioneers in developing [[African dance]] interpretation and instruction in Argentina.

==Early life==
María Isabel Soares Sousa was born in 1953 &lt;!-- on 4 May 1953 --&gt; in [[Maragogipe]], of the Brazilian state of [[Bahia]] to [[Afro-Brazilian]] parents Iraildes Sousa Gomes and Fernando Bispo Soares. Her father had degrees in both biochemistry and music, and her mother was a dressmaker and [[tobacconist]]. After completing her primary and secondary education, Soares attended the [[Federal Institute of Bahia]] in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], earning her teaching credentials in 1972. She moved to [[São Paulo]] and had a son, while continuing her education at the [[University of São Paulo]]. The focus of her studies was on the socio-cultural and historic development of dance and the impact of the [[slave trade]] upon cultural practices.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}

==Career==
While continuing her studies, Soares worked as a primary school teacher.{{sfn|Más|2016}} She took dance lessons with [[Wilson Silva]], who taught her the basic techniques of African dance and how those spread into the Americas through ''[[candombe]]'' in Uruguay, ''[[samba]]'' from Brazil and [[Tap dance|tap dancing]] in the United States. In 1982, she married and as was expected of women in her generation, followed her husband to Argentina, giving up her career in 1983.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Más|2016}} The couple settled in [[Bahía Blanca]] and Soares returned to her studies through the National Technical Education Council ({{lang-es|Consejo Nacional de Educación Técnica (CONET)}}), earning her technical instructor's certification. As there were few prospects for a black woman in the arts to earn a living in Bahía Blanca, she left the area in 1985 and moved to [[Buenos Aires]]. Between 1985 and 1987, Soares studied and worked as a dance instructor on a scholarship in the dance school of [[Aida Prestifilippo]], the principal dancer of the [[Teatro Colón]]. In addition to providing the scholarship Prestifilippo helped introduce Soares to the dance circuit in Buenos Aires, allowing her to perform at various local venues.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}} 

The era was one of cultural expansion, following the suppression of individual expression throughout the period of [[National Reorganization Process]] from 1973-1983.{{sfn|Florencia|2013|p=3}} From the end of the dictatorship, Soares gave lessons in African dance at a small salon on Corrientes Street in Buenos Aires and organized performances and events to expand the knowledge of black culture in Argentina.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Florencia|2013|p=3}} Beginning in 1987, she worked as a dance instructor of a course ''Dance of Orixás'' ({{lang-es|Danza de Orixás}} for the Centro Cultural Rector Ricardo Rojas, an organization affiliated with the [[University of Buenos Aires]].{{sfn|Florencia|2013|p=3}} Between 1990 and 2006, Soares was the coordinator for African dance at the Centro{{sfn|Más|2016}} and began traveling to places like [[Rosario, Santa Fe]] in the [[Santa Fe Province]] to teach and back to Brazil for students to train in Bahia.{{sfn|Florencia|2013|p=3}}{{sfn|Montenegro|2017}} She also hosted annual summer courses on dances with African roots through the Municipal Institute of Education for Art in the [[Avellaneda Partido|Municipality of Avellaneda]].{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2006}} Forming an association with activists, artists and intellectuals, Soares actively worked to fight racial discrimination and bring back an awareness of the roots of black culture in Argentina.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Montenegro|2017}}

At the end of 2006, Soares left the Center, though she continued with private dance instruction and taught a seminar which consolidated Afro-Brazilian and [[Afro-Cuban]] dance styles.{{sfn|Más|2016}} In 2007, she began teaching courses at the [[Instituto Universitario Nacional del Arte]]{{sfn|Infante|2010|p=86}} as well as directing an independent project, known as the Alábase Project, which focuses on the study and performance of the methodology of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruban]] dance based upon the tradition of ''xiré''.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}} She is considered one of the pioneering dancers who brought African cultural expression back to Argentina after the close of the dictatorship.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Plaza|2006}}

'''Jointness''' is a term ([http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=psc.046.0337a R. Solan 1991]) in [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychodynamic]] theory, describing a new look at normal [[object relation]] that takes place from the beginning of life. Till nowadays [[symbiosis]] (propounded by [[Margaret Mahler]] 1968, 1975) is the common term for a normal object relation, while Ronnie Solan emphasizes that symbiosis represents impairment in object relation.

'''Jointness''' is defined as a dynamic process representing an emotional system for [[attachment theory|attachment]] and for [[communication]] between separate individuals who jointly approach each other in a third, joint, [[transitional object|virtual space]]. Jointness represents an encounter between mother and [[infant]], [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] and patient, or any partners experiencing simultaneously mutual [[intimacy]], while concomitantly safeguarding separateness.

The [[newborn]], very early in life, perceives the [[Other (philosophy)|other]], even his mother, as a "not-I" (it indicates a psychic process to safeguard one's own self), and is attached to the "not-I mother" by an intimate acquaintance with her through his/her senses. When both, mother and baby, devote themselves to intimacy, that temporarily blurs the boundaries between them, separateness can be safeguarded. As a result, baby might gradually develop his/her own boundaries and acknowledge those of his or her object and might invest their own innate abilities to participate in human interactions and enjoy relationships ("motivational systems," Emde, 1988).

The development of this basic process of jointness between baby and mother depends on mother's capacity to tolerate separateness. It is the mother who imprints the quality and the intensity of the rapprochement-separation balancing process in their relationship, while both of them are fully invested in each other.

The unique jointness and the unique communication, in a unique psychic virtual space are created by the sharing of interests (emotional or cognitive), and by the mutual investment of partners in a joint phenomenon, object, or idea, meaningful to both. All vital human communication represents both the separateness of the two (or more) individuals and their joining in a third virtual space. Thus, "jointness" elicits the '''triadic''' (triangulation) object relations (mother's space – "virtual transitional space" – baby's space).

In this type of [[transitional object|transitional space]] baby and mother, lovers, or partners of a common task, are jointly determine the extent of [[rapprochement]] between themselves, the extent of safeguarding separateness and also the moment to separate. Each of them is sensorily attentive to the strangeness and the separateness of the “non-I” that the other represents for him. Such a [[psychodynamics|dynamic]] process of jointness, represents healthy [[Developmental psychology|development]] from birth, paves the way to a sense of individuation and culminates to establish the valuable communication with others relating to their otherness, while preserving separateness and self integrity.

It is important to distinguish between '''jointness''' and '''symbiosis'''. Both may commence with the beginning of life; they may seem similar, and yet they are widely different experiences. In symbiosis, baby and mother behave and function as though they were "an omnipotent system - a dual unity within one common boundary" (Margaret Mahler, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;201). Partners of symbiosis can be fully satisfied as long as there is no hint of separateness. Jointness, on the other hand, represents both the separateness of the two (or more) individuals and their joining in a third virtual space.

The development of this basic process (between baby and mother) in '''symbiosis''' depends on mother's inability to endure separateness while both of them are fully invested in each other. It is the mother who imprints on their encounter her need to contain herself with her baby in one unit and to prevent the encouragement of separateness in favor of the boundaries of their unity. Both partners will be motivated, through life, by a powerful need for merging and they will remain almost addicted to finding another object to merge with and attach their symbiotic needs, even at the expense of sacrificing their individuation, their true-self and their self-esteem. Such an encounter fosters only a dyadic relation where the "transitional virtual space" between them is missing.

Hence, '''symbiosis''' is a dyadic pathological process, even from the beginning of life that results in self fragility, [[narcissistic]] disturbances and in an immature personality; while '''jointness''' represents a triadic healthy development that depends on [[healthy narcissism]] and generates separation-individuation, communication and relationship.

The '''Knicks–Nuggets brawl''' was an on-court altercation at a [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) game between the [[New York Knicks]] and [[Denver Nuggets]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] on Saturday, December 16, 2006. This altercation became the most penalized on-court fight in the NBA since the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] from two years before.

The fight began with a [[flagrant foul]] by Knicks [[shooting guard|guard]] [[Mardy Collins]] on Nuggets guard [[J. R. Smith]] in the closing seconds of the game. Several players joined in the confrontation, and began to make physical contact. The fight briefly spilled into the stands, and also stretched to the other end of the court. All ten players on the floor at the time were ejected after the altercation was finished. When suspensions were announced, seven [[List of players banned or suspended by the NBA|players were suspended]] without pay for a combined total of 47 games.

Although they were not penalized, Nuggets coach [[George Karl]] and Knicks coach [[Isiah Thomas]] were both scrutinized for their part in the brawl. [[Carmelo Anthony]] was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players excessively because it wanted to keep its image free from violence.

==Game recap==
Entering the game, the New York Knicks had a record of 9–17 while the Denver Nuggets sported a 13–9 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/teams/schedule?team=nyk&amp;year=2007 |title=New York Knicks Schedule - 2006-07 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/teams/schedule?team=den&amp;year=2007 |title=Denver Nuggets Schedule - 2006-07 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite trailing the entire game, the Knicks came as close as 2 points in the first half but the Nuggets regrouped and closed the half with a 13-point advantage and continued to lead in the second half by as much as 26 points in the third quarter. The Knicks briefly came within 10 points with ten minutes left in the game, but the Nuggets went on a 12–2 run and were never threatened again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=261216018 |title=Denver Nuggets vs. New York Knicks - Play By Play - December 16, 2006 |date=December 16, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmelo Anthony scored 24 [[point (basketball)|points]] to lead the Nuggets, and [[Marcus Camby]] added 24 points and 9 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]; [[Stephon Marbury]] scored a season-high 31 points for the Knicks.&lt;ref name="espnrecap" /&gt;

===Altercation===
The incident occurred with 1:15 remaining in the Knicks' home game at [[Madison Square Garden]], where the Nuggets were leading 119–100. The Knicks' [[Mardy Collins]] fouled the Nuggets' [[J. R. Smith]] on a [[fast break]] by slapping his arms around Smith's neck, knocking him to the floor. As Smith stood up to confront Collins, [[Nate Robinson]] pulled  Smith away, and then began pushing and shouting at him. [[David Lee (basketball)|David Lee]] tried to hold Smith back, but Smith broke free and charged into Robinson, causing both players to fall into the photographers and front row courtside seats, before they were quickly separated by teammates.&lt;ref name="espnrecap"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=261216018 |title=Nuggets, Knicks in wild free-for-all; 10 players tossed |date=December 16, 2006 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the fighting was seemingly coming to an end, [[Carmelo Anthony]] confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. [[Jared Jeffries]] immediately tried to attack Anthony but tripped over [[Marcus Camby]], before being restrained by coaches and teammates, while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also ran down the court to get at Anthony but was blocked by [[Nenê]] and Smith. All ten players on the court at the time of the incident were ejected by the officiating crew that consisted of [[Dick Bavetta]], [[Violet Palmer]], and [[Robbie Robinson (referee)|Robbie Robinson]].&lt;ref name="espnrecap"/&gt; No fans came onto the court during the entire ordeal, which prevented any repetition of the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] from 2 years ago.

NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] reacted with strict penalties for the players involved, stating, "It is our obligation to take the strongest possible steps to avoid such failures in the future." Seven players were suspended for a total of 47 games, and the players lost in excess of $1.2 million in salary. Each team was also fined $500,000.&lt;ref name="suspensions"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/news/Nuggets_Knicks_Suspensions.html |title=Nuggets-Knicks Suspensions |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2701228 |title=Suspensions total 47 games from Knicks-Nuggets fight |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Anthony's suspension was longer than 12 games, he was eligible to appeal to an arbitrator; however, Anthony eventually announced he would not attempt one, saying he did not "want to be a further distraction".&lt;ref name="wontappeal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2704934 |title=Anthony doesn't want to be distraction, won't appeal |last=Stein |first=Marc |date=December 22, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public reaction===
Several sportswriters said the brawl was not as violent as the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] two years before,&lt;ref name="plentyblame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/basketball/296541_miller20.html |title=Brawl fell far short of all the outrage |last=Miller |first=Ted |date=December 20, 2006 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 81% of respondents in a [[SportsNation (Website)|SportsNation]] poll said the biggest difference between the two brawls was that it "didn't involve players going into the stands and fighting fans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/polling?event_id=2642&amp;action=1 |title=Vote: How long should 'Melo and Isiah be suspended? |date=December 17, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[MSNBC]]'s Michael Ventre said that the Knicks and Nuggets brawl was worse because "it was touched off by the actions of players, and it escalated because of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/16254683/ |title=Two years later, a brawl that's worse |last=Ventre |first=Michael |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=NBC Sports |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several writers said that the penalties were more severe because of the Pacers–Pistons brawl, because the league was on a "very serious image-cleanup campaign."&lt;ref name="hittinimage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rockylow" /&gt;

[[Steve Francis]] claimed that the media reaction to the fight and the suspensions itself were "racially motivated." He argued that [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Hockey League]] had "incidents that are way worse than basketball," but did not face the scrutiny that the NBA received "because there are more black players in the NBA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12192006/sports/knicks/knicks_francis__race_a_factor_knicks_dan_martin_and_marc_berman.htm |title=Knicks' Francis: Race a Factor |last=Martin |first=Dan |author2=Berman, Marc |date=December 19, 2006 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430094141/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12192006/sports/knicks/knicks_francis__race_a_factor_knicks_dan_martin_and_marc_berman.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed by several writers, and sportswriter-television personality [[Michael Wilbon]] said that "NBA players have endured more scrutiny, pertaining to image, than any other professional athletes in America."&lt;ref name="plentyblame"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/16245553/ |title=Plenty of blame to go around for this brawl |last=Celizic |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=NBA Sports |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hittinimage" /&gt; [[Martin Luther King III]] called for a meeting to end the violence in the NBA, stating, "Individuals who play a game should be able to conduct themselves appropriately." However, the NBA said through a [[spokesman]] that they "don't think that meeting is necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=aNleXFcZzNb0&amp;refer=home |title=NBA Referees Invite League, Players to Meet on Fight |last=DiTore |first=Larry |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coaches' role in the brawl===
[[Image:Isiah Thomas.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas came under scrutiny for his actions before the brawl.]]
Minutes before the brawl started, Knicks coach [[Isiah Thomas]] asked Carmelo Anthony not to go into the painted area around the basket, despite the fact that they were not members of the same team. Thomas later said that because Denver head coach [[George Karl]] kept his team's [[starting lineup|starting players]] on the court for the closing minutes of the game, which Thomas thought showed a lack of [[sportsmanship]], his orders to Anthony were to "show some class."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2700761 |title=Melo apologizes; Isiah reportedly under investigation |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Karl responded by saying the brawl "was directed by Isiah".&lt;ref name="thomasescape"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/business/manufacturing/feeds/ap/2006/12/18/ap3265869.html  |title=Column: Thomas Escapes Hands of Stern |last=Dahlberg |first=Tim |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=2009-04-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070108091047/http://www.forbes.com/business/manufacturing/feeds/ap/2006/12/18/ap3265869.html |archivedate = 2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas was not penalized after the brawl, as an NBA investigation ruled that they did not have "adequate evidence upon which to make a determination,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/sports/basketball/19isiah.html?fta=y |title=Lack of Evidence Lets Thomas Avoid Punishment |last=Beck |first=Howard |date=December 19, 2006 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but several writers criticized the NBA for not including Thomas in the suspensions.&lt;ref name="hittinimage"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/18/AR2006121801403.html |first=Michael |last=Wilbon |title=A Hittin' Image |date=December 19, 2006 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thomasescape"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigculprit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16269796 |title=Stern let biggest culprit in brawl off easy: Isiah |last=Celizic |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/481112p-404847c.html  |title=Blame Isiah for brawl |last=Lupica |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2006 |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=2009-04-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061222192642/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/481112p-404847c.html |archivedate = 2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheridan |first=Chris |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/insider/columns/story?columnist=sheridan_chris&amp;id=2701751 |title=Not so Stern: Commish lets Isiah off the hook |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN analyst [[Marc Stein (reporter)|Marc Stein]] called Thomas' explanations of his comments "laughable,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=brawlquestions |title=Questions answered: Stern, Melo, Isiah and the brawl |last=Stein |first=Marc |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commentator [[Greg Anthony]], a former Knicks player, said he "never had a coach say that to an opponent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12202006/sports/knicks/not_so_tough_knicks_marc_berman.htm |title=Not so Tough |last=Berman |first=Marc |date=December 20, 2006 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226171845/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12202006/sports/knicks/not_so_tough_knicks_marc_berman.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that Thomas was attempting to resurrect the physical tactics of his former team, the [[Detroit Pistons#1980s|"Bad Boy" Pistons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116654838756654633 |title=Thomas May Be Only Winner In Wake of NBA's Latest Fight |last=Bialik |first=Carl |author2=Fry, Jason  |date=December 19, 2006 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;refer=columnist_soshnick&amp;sid=ap_76o7iBlVg |title=Thomas Has Knicks Fighting Phantoms |last=Soshnick |first=Scott |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Thomas saying that keeping the Nuggets starters on the floor in the final minutes of the game was unsportsmanlike, Karl said that he "never thought about running up the score," and only wanted to "get a big win on the road."&lt;ref name="karlescapes" /&gt; However, several sportswriters criticized his decision, and some said that he should also have been penalized.&lt;ref name="karlescapes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/sports/basketball/19araton.html?fta=y |title=As Thomas Takes Heat, Karl Escapes Scrutiny |last=Araton |first=Harvey |date=December 19, 2006 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earnedban"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12182006/sports/knicks/nuggets_karl_also_earned_ban_knicks_peter_vecsey.htm |title=Nuggets' Karl also earned ban |last=Vecsey |first=Peter |date=December 18, 2006 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122038/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12182006/sports/knicks/nuggets_karl_also_earned_ban_knicks_peter_vecsey.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sternreality"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/articles/2006/12/19/the_stern_reality____7_players_suspended/ |title=The Stern reality -- 7 players suspended |last=May |first=Peter |date=December 19, 2006 |work=Boston Globe |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that Karl was trying to humiliate Thomas due to the perception that Thomas had mistreated [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]], a friend of Karl's.&lt;ref name="bigculprit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="earnedban" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sternreality" /&gt; Karl was also blamed for putting his players in a position to start a fight.&lt;ref name="plentyblame" /&gt;&lt;ref name="earnedban" /&gt;

===Carmelo Anthony===
The day following the brawl, Anthony issued a statement and apology to his family, the league, and fans. He also specifically apologized to Mardy Collins, whom he directly struck during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/nuggets/news/anthony_statement_061217.html |title=Statement from Carmelo Anthony |date=December 17, 2006 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the brawl, Anthony was the league's leading scorer;&lt;ref name="rockylow" /&gt; his suspension was also the longest of the players suspended, and the sixth-longest in NBA history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2006-12-18-brawl-suspensions_x.htm |title=NBA hands out penalties — Anthony suspended 15 games |last=Nance |first=Roscoe |date=December 19, 2006 |work=USA Today |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former NBA player [[Steve Kerr]], Anthony had "tarnished" his image,&lt;ref name="rockylow"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=sk-carmelo121806&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Rocky Mountain low |last=Kerr |first=Steve |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=Yahoo Sports |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and basketball analyst [[Ric Bucher]] said that Anthony had "torched his own career".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=bucherfightview |title=Melo's walking a dangerous line again |last=Bucher |first=Ric |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sports Illustrated]] writer Marty Burns said that Anthony faced becoming known by sports fans across America as the player who punched Collins in the face and then ran away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/marty_burns/12/17/brawl.knicks.nuggets/ |title='Melo drama |last=Burns |first=Marty |date=December 17, 2006 |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the backlash was [[Northwest Airlines]] pulling Anthony from its in-flight magazine cover, as it said it did not want "to condone the behavior of Anthony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2703887 |title=Airline doesn't want to condone brawl, pulls feature |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events after the brawl==
A day after Anthony was suspended, Denver acquired [[Allen Iverson]], who was then second in the league in scoring behind Anthony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2702501 |title=Miller, Smith go to Sixers in deal for Iverson |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Anthony and Smith returned from their suspensions, the trio led the Nuggets to 45 wins and the sixth seed in the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] for the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].&lt;ref name="standings"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/standings?season=2007 |title=NBA Standings - 2006-2007 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were eliminated in the first round by the [[San Antonio Spurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/2007.html |title=2006-07 Denver Nuggets Roster and Statistics |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Knicks finished 33–49, 12th in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], and did not make the playoffs.&lt;ref name="standings"/&gt;

The two teams faced each other for the first time since the altercation on November 17, 2007, which the Nuggets won 115–83. Opposing players [[Renaldo Balkman]] and [[Linas Kleiza]] began arguing with each other after Balkman was called for a hard foul on Kleiza, but the incident was defused after Balkman was given a [[technical foul]].

[[File:31337 h4x0r.jpg|thumb|A "31337 h4x0r" laptop sticker, along with a [[Kevin Mitnick]] sticker]]
'''Leet''' (or "'''1337'''"), also known as '''eleet''' or '''leetspeak''', is a system of modified spellings used primarily on the [[Internet]]. It often uses character replacements  in ways that play on the similarity of their [[glyph]]s via [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] or other resemblance. Additionally, it modifies certain words based on a system of suffixes and alternate meanings. There are many [[dialects]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|linguistic varieties]] in different [[online communities]].

The term "leet" is derived from the word ''[[elite]]'', used as an adjective to describe formidable prowess or accomplishment, especially in the fields of [[online game|online gaming]] and [[Hacker (hobbyist)|computer hacking]]. The leet lexicon includes spellings of the word as ''1337'' or ''l33t''.

==History==
Leet originated within [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS) in the 1980s,&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;Mitchell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;An Explanation of l33t Speak.&lt;/ref&gt; where having "elite" status on a BBS allowed a user access to file folders, games, and special chat rooms.  The [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] hacker collective has been credited with the original coining of the term, in their text-files of that era.&lt;ref&gt;Mello, John P.(2015) "[http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/Google-Expands-Bug-Bounty-Program-81668.html] Google Expands Bug Bounty Program" February 2, 2015. ''E-Commerce Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory is that it was developed to defeat text filters created by BBS or [[Internet Relay Chat]] [[system operators]] for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics, like [[Software cracking|cracking]] and [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]].&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; Creative misspellings and ASCII-art-derived words were also a way to attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer users. 

Once the reserve of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], crackers, and [[script kiddie]]s, leet has since entered the mainstream.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; It is now also used to mock [[newbie|newbies]], also known colloquially as noobs, or newcomers, on web sites, or in gaming communities.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider [[emoticon]]s and [[ASCII art]], like smiley faces, to be leet, while others maintain that leet consists of only symbolic word encryption. More obscure forms of leet, involving the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers, continue to be used for its original purpose of encrypted communication. It is also sometimes used as a script language. Variants of leet have been used for censorship purposes for many years; for instance "@$$" (ass) and "$#!+" (shit) are frequently seen to make a word appear censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with leet.

Leet symbols, especially the number 1337, are [[Internet meme]]s that have spilled over into popular culture. Signs that show the numbers "1337" are popular motifs for pictures and shared widely across the Internet.

==Orthography==

One of the hallmarks of leet is its unique approach to [[orthography]], using substitutions of other characters, letters or otherwise, to represent a letter or letters in a word.&lt;ref name=sterling&gt;Sterling, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goss 80"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; For more casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use [[homoglyph]]s, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. The choice of symbol is not fixed—anything that the reader can make sense of is valid. However, this practice is not extensively used in regular leet; more often it is seen in situations where the [[argot]] (i.e., secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the ''average'' reader ''cannot'' make sense of is valid; a valid reader should himself try to make sense, if deserving of the underlying message. Another use for Leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (usually alphanumeric and underscore){{citation needed|date=October 2017}} require less extensive forms of Leet when used in this application.

Some examples of leet include ''[[B1ff]]'' and ''[[Newbie|n00b]]'', a term for the stereotypical [[newbie]]; the l33t programming language; and the web-comic ''[[Megatokyo]]'', which contains characters who speak leet.

==Morphology==

Text rendered in leet is often characterized by distinctive, recurring forms.

;''-xor'' suffix
:The meaning of this suffix is parallel with the English ''-er'' and ''-r'' suffixes (seen in ''hacker'' and ''lesser''),&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; in that it derives [[agent noun]]s from a verb [[stem (linguistics)|stem]]. It is realized in two different forms: ''-xor'' and ''-zor'', {{IPAc-en|-|s|ɔːr}} and {{IPAc-en|-|z|ɔːr}}, respectively. For example, the first may be seen in the word ''hax(x)or'' (''H4x0r'' in leet) {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|k|s|ɔːr}} and the second in ''[[pwn]]zor'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|n|z|ɔːr}}. Additionally, this [[nominalization]] may also be [[inflection|inflected]] with all of the suffixes of regular [[English verbs]]. The letter 'o' is often replaced with the numeral 0.

;''-age'' suffix
:Derivation of a noun from a verb stem is possible by attaching ''-age'' to the base form of any verb. Attested derivations are ''pwnage'', ''skillage'',  and ''speakage''. However, leet provides exceptions; the word ''leetage'' is acceptable, referring to actively being ''leet''.&lt;ref name="goss 79"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; These nouns are often used with a form of "to be" rather than "to have," e.g., "that was pwnage" rather than "he has pwnage". Either is a more emphatic way of expressing the simpler "he pwns," but the former implies that the person is ''embodying'' the trait rather than merely possessing it.

;''-ness'' suffix
:Derivation of a noun from an adjective stem is done by attaching ''-ness'' to any adjective. This is entirely the same as the English form, except it is used much more often in Leet. Nouns such as ''lulzness'' and ''leetness'' are derivations using this suffix.

;Words ending in ''-ed''
:When forming a past participle ending in ''-ed'', the Leet user may replace the ''-e'' with an apostrophe, as was common in [[poetry]] of previous centuries, (e.g. "pwned" becomes "pwn'd"). Sometimes, the apostrophe is removed as well (e.g. "pwned" becomes "pwnd"). The word ending may also be substituted by ''-t'' (e.g. ''pwned'' becomes ''pwnt'').&lt;ref name="blanc33"&gt;LeBlanc, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Use of the ''-&amp;'' suffix
:Words ending in ''-and'', ''-anned'', ''-ant'', or a similar sound can sometimes be spelled with an [[ampersand]] (''&amp;'') to express the ending sound (e.g. "This is the [[Sandbox (software development)|s&amp;box]]," "I'm sorry, you've been b&amp;", "&amp;hill/&amp;farm"). This is most commonly used with the word ''banned.'' An alternate form of "B&amp;" is "B7", as the ampersand is typed with the "7" key in the standard US keyboard layout.  It is often seen in the phrase "IBB7" (in before banned), which indicates that the poster believes that a previous poster will soon be banned from the site, channel, or board on which they are both posting.

==Grammar==

Leet can be pronounced as a single syllable, {{IPA|/ˈliːt/}}, rhyming with ''eat,'' by way of [[aphesis]] of the initial vowel of "elite". It may also be pronounced as two syllables, {{IPA|/ɛˈliːt/}}. Like [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], leet enjoys a looser grammar than standard English.&lt;ref name=rome/&gt; The loose grammar, just like loose spelling, encodes some level of emphasis, ironic or otherwise. A reader must rely more on intuitive [[parsing]] of leet to determine the meaning of a sentence rather than the actual sentence structure. In particular, speakers of leet are fond of [[verbing]] nouns, turning verbs into nouns (and back again) as forms of emphasis, e.g. "Austin rocks" is weaker than "Austin roxxorz" (note spelling), which is weaker than "Au5t1N is t3h r0xx0rz" (note grammar), which is weaker than something like "0MFG D00D /\Ü571N 15 T3H l_l83Я 1337 Я0XX0ЯZ" ([[SMS language#Common abbreviations|OMG]], dude, Austin is the [[über]]-elite rocks-er!). In essence, all of these mean "Austin rocks," not necessarily the other options. Added words and misspellings add to the speaker's enjoyment. Leet, like hacker slang, employs analogy in construction of new words. For example, if ''haxored'' is the past tense of the verb "to hack" (hack → haxor → haxored), then ''winzored'' would be easily understood to be the past tense conjugation of "to win," even if the reader had not seen that particular word before.

Leet has its own colloquialisms, many of which originated as jokes based on common typing errors, habits of new computer users, or knowledge of [[cyberculture]] and history.&lt;ref name="goss 81"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Leet is not solely based upon one language or character set. Greek, Russian, and other languages have leet forms, and leet in one language may use characters from another where they are available. As such, while it may be referred to as a "[[cipher]]", a "dialect", or a "language", leet does not fit squarely into any of these categories. The term ''leet'' itself is often written ''31337'', or ''1337'', and many other variations. After the meaning of these became widely familiar, ''10100111001'' came to be used in its place, because it is the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] form of ''1337'' decimal, making it more of a puzzle to interpret.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;This appears as an in-joke for technical illustrations such as these: [[:Commons:File:Ami encoding.svg|''(a)'']][[:Commons:File:Manchester encoding.svg|''(b)'']]&lt;/ref&gt; An increasingly common characteristic of leet is the changing of grammatical usage so as to be deliberately incorrect. The widespread popularity of deliberate misspelling is similar to the cult following of the "[[All your base are belong to us]]" phrase. Indeed, the online and computer communities have been international from their inception, so spellings and phrases typical of non-native speakers are quite common.

==Vocabulary==

Many words originally derived from leet slang have now become part of the modern [[Internet slang]], such as "[[pwn]]ed".&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; The original driving forces of new vocabulary in leet were common misspellings and typing errors such as "[[teh]]" (generally considered lolspeak), and intentional misspellings,&lt;ref name="goss 83"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the "z" at the end of words ("skillz").&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; Another prominent example of a surviving leet expression is ''[[w00t]]'', an exclamation of joy.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; w00t is sometimes used as a [[backronym]] for "We owned the other team."

New words (or corruptions thereof) may arise from a need to make one's username unique. As any given Internet service reaches more people, the number of names available to a given user is drastically reduced. While many users may wish to have the username "CatLover," for example, in many cases it is only possible for one user to have the moniker. As such, degradations of the name may evolve, such as "C@7L0vr." As the leet cipher is highly dynamic, there is a wider possibility for multiple users to share the "same" name, through combinations of spelling and transliterations.

Additionally, ''leet''—the word itself—can be found in the [[User (computing)|screen-names]] and [[gamertags]] of many Internet and video games. Use of the term in such a manner announces a high level of skill, though such an announcement may be seen as baseless [[hubris]].&lt;ref name=hope&gt;Computer Hope Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- NOTE: ANY FURTHER ADDITIONS MUST HAVE A PROPER REFERENCE OR WILL BE REMOVED PER WP:OR --&gt;

===Terminology and common misspellings===

''[[Warez]]'' (nominally {{IPAc-en|w|ɛər|z}}) is a plural shortening of "software", typically referring to cracked and redistributed software.&lt;ref name=hope/&gt; ''[[Phreaking]]'' refers to the hacking of telephone systems and other non-Internet equipment.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; ''[[Teh]]'' originated as a typographical error of "the", and is sometimes spelled ''t3h''.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref name="blanc34 35"&gt;LeBlanc, 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; ''j00'' takes the place of "you",&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; originating from the [[affricate]] sound that occurs in place of the [[palatal approximant]], {{IPA|/j/}}, when ''you'' follows a word ending in an [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] [[plosive]] consonant, such as {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}. Also, from German, is ''[[wiktionary:Über|über]]'', which means "over" or "above"; it usually appears as a prefix attached to adjectives, and is frequently written without the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] over the ''u''.&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;Van de Velde &amp; Meuleman.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haxor and suxxor (suxorz)===

''Haxor'', and derivations thereof, is leet for "hacker",&lt;ref name="blanc30 32"&gt;LeBlanc, 30; 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is one of the most commonplace examples of the use of the ''-xor'' suffix. ''Suxxor'' (pronounced suck-zor) is a derogatory term which originated in warez culture and is currently used in multi-user environments such as multiplayer video games and [[instant messaging]]; it, like ''haxor'', is one of the early leet words to use the ''-xor'' suffix. ''Suxxor'' is a modified version of "sucks" (the phrase "to suck"), and the meaning is the same as the English slang. Its negative definition essentially makes it the opposite of ''roxxor'', and both can be used as a verb or a noun. The letters ''ck'' are often replaced with the Greek Χ (chi) in other words as well.

===n00b===
{{main|Newbie}}

Within leet, the term ''n00b'', and derivations thereof, is used extensively. The word means and derives from ''newbie'' (as in new and inexperienced or uninformed),&lt;ref name="goss 83"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt;&lt;ref name=acronym/&gt; and is used as a means of segregating them as less than the "elite," or even "normal," members of a group.

===Owned and pwned===
{{Main|Owned|Pwn}}

''Owned'' and ''pwn3d'' (generally pronounced "owned" and "poned", respectively) both refer to the domination of a player in a video game or argument (rather than just a win), or the successful hacking of a website or computer.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt;&lt;ref name="blanc32 33"&gt;LeBlanc, 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is a common characteristic of leet, the terms have also been adapted into noun and adjective forms,&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt; ''ownage'' and ''pwnage'', which can refer to the situation of ''pwning'' or to the superiority of its subject (e.g., "He is a very good player. He is pwnage.").

===Pr0n&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pr0n]] --&gt;===

''Pr0n'' is [[slang]] for ''[[pornography]]''.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; This is a deliberately inaccurate spelling/pronunciation for ''porn'',&lt;ref name=acronym&gt;The Acronym Finder.&lt;/ref&gt; where a zero is often used to replace the letter O. It is sometimes used in legitimate communications (such as email discussion groups, [[Usenet]], chat rooms, and Internet web pages) to circumvent language and [[content filter]]s, which may reject messages as offensive or [[spam (electronic)|spam]]. The word also helps prevent [[search engines]] from associating commercial sites with pornography, which might result in unwelcome traffic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} ''Pr0n'' is also sometimes spelled backwards (n0rp) to further obscure the meaning to potentially uninformed readers.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;This can be observed by searching for "n0rp" on a search engine.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to [[ASCII art]] depicting pornographic images, or to photos of the internals of consumer and industrial hardware. ''Prawn'', a spoof of the misspelling, has started to come into use, as well; in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', a pornographer films his movies on "Prawn Island". Conversely, in the [[Role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Kingdom of Loathing]]'', ''[[prawn]]'', referring to a kind of [[crustacean]], is spelled ''pr0n'', leading to the creation of food items such as "pr0n chow mein".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">:''This article describes the maximum principle in the theory of partial differential equations. For the maximum principle in optimal control theory, see [[Pontryagin's maximum principle]].''

In [[mathematics]], the '''maximum principle''' is a property of solutions to certain [[partial differential equations]], of the [[elliptic partial differential equation|elliptic]] and [[parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic]] types. Roughly speaking, it says that the [[maximum]] of a function in a [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] is to be found on the boundary of that domain. Specifically, the ''strong'' maximum principle says that if a function achieves its maximum in the interior of the domain, the function is uniformly a constant. The ''weak'' maximum principle says that the maximum of the function is to be found on the boundary, but may re-occur in the interior as well. Other, even weaker maximum principles exist which merely bound a function in terms of its maximum on the boundary. 

In [[convex optimization]], the maximum principle states that the maximum of a [[convex function]] on a [[compact set|compact]] [[convex set]] is attained on the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 32 of [[R. Tyrrell Rockafellar|Rockafellar]] (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The classical example==

[[Harmonic functions]] are the classical example to which the strong maximum principle applies. Formally, if ''f'' is a [[harmonic function]], then ''f'' cannot exhibit a true [[local maximum]] within the domain of definition of ''f''. In other words, either ''f'' is a [[constant function]], or, for any point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; inside the domain of ''f'', there exist other points arbitrarily close to &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; at which ''f'' takes larger values.&lt;ref&gt;Berenstein and Gay.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''f'' be a harmonic function defined on some [[connected space|connected]] [[open set|open]] [[subset]] ''D'' of the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a point in ''D'' such that 

:&lt;math&gt;f(x_0)\ge f(x) &lt;/math&gt; 

for all ''x'' in a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, then the function ''f'' is constant on ''D''.

By replacing "maximum" with "minimum" and "larger" with "smaller", one obtains the '''minimum principle''' for harmonic functions.

The maximum principle also holds for the more general [[subharmonic function]]s, while [[superharmonic function]]s satisfy the minimum principle.&lt;ref&gt;Evans.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heuristics for the proof ===

The ''weak maximum principle'' for harmonic functions is a simple consequence of facts from calculus. The key ingredient for the proof is the fact that, by the definition of a harmonic function, the [[Laplacian]] of ''f'' is zero. Then, if &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a non-degenerate [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] of ''f''(''x''), we must be seeing a [[saddle point]], since otherwise there is no chance that the sum of the second derivatives of ''f'' is zero. This of course is not a complete proof, and we left out the case of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; being a degenerate point, but this is the essential idea. 

The ''strong maximum principle'' relies on the [[Hopf lemma]], and this is more complicated.

The '''McIntyre Final Eight System''' was devised by [[Kenneth McIntyre|Ken McIntyre]] in addition to the McIntyre Four, Five and Six systems. It is a [[playoff]] system of the top 8 finishers in a competition to determine which two teams will play in the [[AFL Grand Final|grand final]].  The teams play each other over three weeks, with two teams eliminated each week.  Teams who finish in a higher position in the competition are given an easier route to the grand final.

In top level sport, the system was used by the [[Australian Football League]] from 1994 until 1999, and by the [[National Rugby League]] from 1999 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/rl/snotes.html |title=Rugby League Tables - Notes |publisher=Rugby League Tables &amp; Statistics |accessdate=2007-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807205808/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/snotes.html |archivedate=August 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.code13rugbyleague.com/2012/02/24/nrl-adopts-super-league-finals-format/ | title = NRL adopts Super League finals format | publisher = Aram Margarian | accessdate = 2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
'''Week 1'''

* 4th qualifying final: 1st v 8th
* 3rd qualifying final: 2nd v 7th
* 2nd qualifying final: 3rd v 6th
* 1st qualifying final: 4th v 5th

The organisation of the rest of the finals series is dependent upon whether teams won or lost in week 1 and their final ranking on the ladder before the finals. The two lowest-ranked losers are eliminated from the finals, while the two highest-ranked winners progress straight to week 3.

'''Week 2'''

* 1st semi final: 4th highest-ranked winner v 2nd highest-ranked loser
* 2nd semi final: 3rd highest-ranked winner (from week 1) v 1st highest-ranked loser (from week 1)

The two losing teams are eliminated, the two winning teams progress to week 3.

'''Week 3'''

* 1st preliminary final: 1st highest-ranked winner (from week 1) v winner of 1st semi final
* 2nd preliminary final: 2nd highest-ranked winner (from week 1) v winner of 2nd semi final

The two losing teams are eliminated, the two winning teams progress to week four.

'''Week 4'''

* Grand final: winner of 1st preliminary final v winner of 2nd preliminary final

'''Scheduling'''

A key element of an effective McIntyre system is scheduling in week 1. In the first week games must be played in the following order: 4 v 5, 3 v 6, 2 v 7, 1 v 8. Teams in the first two games are playing for the chance of a bye in the second week of the finals. If the final two games ultimately go as predicted, then the chance of a bye or the risk of elimination disappears.  Therefore, those games need to be played last so that there is never a situation where two teams know that their result would not matter.

1st: Advances with a win to preliminary final (week 3). Must play the semi final with a loss, cannot be eliminated in week 1, and has a 18,75% of winning the tournament.

2nd: Same as 1st, but has a more difficult opponent in week 1 (7th instead 8th).

3rd: Advances to preliminary final with a win AND at least one upset in one of the two last qualifying finals (1st or 2nd loses his qualifying final). Must play the semi final with a win and no upset in last two qualifying finals or a loss if there is at least one hopeful result in two last qualifying finals. Is eliminated if he loses AND 1st and 2nd too. (Has a 15.625% of winning the tournament).

4th: Advances to preliminary final with a win AND there are at least two upsets in remaining qualifying finals. It must play the semi final if there are, at least, two hopeful results in other qualifying finals, regardless his result. Is eliminated with a loss AND, at least, two upsets (He has a 12,5% of winning the tournament).

5th: Same as 4th (but play away his qualifying final against 4th).

6th: Advances to preliminary final with a win AND 7th and 8th win their qualifying finals. It must play the semi final with a win AND, if there is, at least, one hopeful result, OR, if he loses, if there are BOTH hopeful results in remaining qualifying finals. Is eliminated with a loss AND one upset, at least, in remaining qualifying finals. (He has a 9,375% of winning the tournament).

7th: It can't advance straight to preliminary final. Advances to semi final with a win and is eliminated with a loss (He has a 6,25% of winning the tournament).

8th: Same as 7th (but he has a more difficult opponent in week 1 -1st instead 2nd).

1st, 2nd, 7th and 8th depend on themselves. 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th depend on their results and other qualifying finals results

==Example==
The [[2010 NRL season#Finals Series|2010 NRL Final Series:]]
{{2010 NRL Finals}}

At the qualifying finals, team 1 won and so went straight through to the preliminary finals.  Team 4 also went through to the preliminary finals, because they won while teams 2 and 3 lost.  However, teams 2 and 3 were not eliminated, but played again in the semi finals, because two teams ranking lower than them on the ladder also lost.  Those two losing teams ranking lower than them, teams 5 and 8, were eliminated.

==Advantages==
The major advantages of the system are the number of different combinations of teams which could make the final game and that no matches are repeated in the first three weeks. When compared to other final eight systems, many of which split the participants into two groups, the McIntyre system means only two of the 28 possible combinations (1v7 and 2v8) are impossible in the grand final.

The top two teams after the regular season are rewarded by being given a 'second life' within the finals. If either of these two teams lose to their much lower-ranked opponents in the first week, then one of the two losing teams ranked lower than them are eliminated, which means the 1st- and 2nd-ranked teams can withstand a loss in the finals and their season will continue, albeit with significant disadvantages.

This 'second life' advantage for the highest-ranked teams on the ladder can flow on to teams 3 and 4 (and possibly teams 5 and 6.)  If only one of the top two on the ladder loses in the first week, then team 3 is not eliminated if it has lost.  Similarly, if only one of the top three on the ladder loses in the first week, then team 4 is saved from elimination if it has lost.

If the top two teams win in the first week, then teams 7 and 8 will be the ones to be eliminated.  Only two teams drop out, so even if they were to lose their games, teams 5 and 6 would still have another chance in the second week.

==Criticisms==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
With its adoption by the NRL, debate has arisen over its fairness. The McIntyre system rewards teams who have form coming into the finals rather than during the whole season. The advantages given to a victor in the first week of the finals, even if that team is initially ranked 6th to 8th, includes a home final in the second week against a team ranked 3rd to 6th coming off a loss. This advantage given to lower-ranked teams that win in the first week are significant compared to the alternate final 8 system used by the AFL, which protects teams coming 1st to 4th from elimination and never give home finals to teams ranked 7th or 8th, regardless of whether they win or lose their matches.

In 2008, the first week of the NRL finals saw the then reigning grand finalists the [[Melbourne Storm]] lose to the 8th placed [[New Zealand Warriors]]. Granted a home final as a week 1 winner, the Warriors then defeated the [[Sydney Roosters]] in the second week and proceeded to the final 4, the first team ever to make it that far from 8th position, whereas the Storm had to travel to Brisbane and win away to continue on. This scenario was exceeded in 2009 when the [[Parramatta Eels]], who had finished 8th defeated [[St George Illawarra Dragons]]. Parramatta, with a home advantage, proceeded to defeat the [[Gold Coast Titans]] in week 2, whereas the Dragons were eliminated from the competition in week 2 in their away match against the [[Brisbane Broncos]]. This gave them the dubious distinction of being the first minor premiers to be eliminated after two consecutive losses since the inception of the McIntyre System. Parramatta became the first team ranked last of the finalists to contest the grand final, only to lose to the 4th-placed Melbourne Storm, although this Premiership has been struck from the record due to salary cap breaches by the Storm. For the record, at least one top four team has lost its qualifying final in every year since this system was introduced in 1999, until 2011 when all top four teams won their qualifying final.

Another criticism is that, like many other top-8 systems, there is the possibility of games in the first week that are effectively meaningless, where teams have no risk of elimination and results only determine respective opponents and home ground advantage in the second week. In the McIntyre system if first-week results go as planned, then first defeats eighth and second defeats seventh. This leaves the teams who finished from third to sixth effectively playing "[[dead rubber]]s" in the first week, with the results merely reshuffling the order of these four teams. There is a requirement therefore that the 4v5 contest be played first. This raises a further criticism that the fate of the loser in this match is dependent upon the performance of the higher-ranked teams. A good example of this was the Dragons v Penrith final in 2004. The Dragons lost by a mere point, however, due to the higher ranked Bulldogs and Broncos losing the Dragons were eliminated.

This also makes scheduling much less flexible, since the first vs eighth game must be the last game played, in order to prevent the teams between third and sixth entering their qualifying finals knowing that the game is already a dead rubber. The newly formed ARL Commission accepted a recommendation to scrap the system as of 2012 on the 22nd of February, 2012. It was replaced by the [[AFL final eight system|final eight system currently used by the AFL]].

Another anomaly of scheduling is that in the second week a team may play a higher-ranked opponent than the team they defeated, and similarly a first week loser may play an easier opponent than the team that defeated them. In the second week of the McIntyre system the third highest winner (i.e. the strongest winner of those playing) plays the highest-ranked loser rather than the second highest loser (i.e. the weakest loser). This may ensure no repetition of games in the second week, but it means higher-ranked teams end up with more difficult opponents simply for the sake of more interesting scheduling. An example of this happened in 2005 when the Wests Tigers (4th) defeated the North Queensland Cowboys (5th) in week one of the finals and were 'rewarded' in week 2 with a game against the 3rd placed Brisbane Broncos. Meanwhile, the Cowboys (ranked 5th and first week losers) played the Melbourne Storm who were ranked 6th.

In 2011, the 6th-placed [[New Zealand Warriors]] were beaten convincingly by the [[Brisbane Broncos]] (ranked 3rd) in its qualifying final by the score of 40&amp;ndash;10. Following that match, then-Warriors coach [[Ivan Cleary]] was quoted as saying "the way we played tonight, we don't deserve to be in the finals". That loss saw them at risk of being eliminated initially, but were granted a reprieve after the two lower-ranking teams, [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]] and [[Newcastle Knights|Newcastle]], also lost their finals. A sudden reverse in form would see them advance to the [[2011 NRL Grand Final|grand final]], thus becoming the third team (after the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] in 1999 and the [[Sydney Roosters]] the season previous), to advance to the grand final after finishing sixth at the end of the season. Ultimately, the Warriors would lose to the second-placed [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] who had a much easier run to the decider.

==Competitions==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In addition to the NRL, the McIntyre Final Eight System is also used in the [[Rugby League National Leagues|Rugby League National League Three]] in [[Great Britain]], the NSWRL Premier League and Jersey Flegg competitions. It will be used in the final heads up in Circuito Nacional de Poker (Spain).

In [[mathematics]] and [[group theory]], the term '''multiplicative group''' refers to one of the following concepts:

*the '''[[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication''' of the [[invertible]] elements of a [[field (mathematics)|field]],&lt;ref&gt;See Hazewinkel et al. (2004), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or other structure for which one of its operations is referred to as multiplication. In the case of a field ''F'', the group is {{nowrap|(''F'' ∖ {0}, •)}}, where 0 refers to the [[zero element]] of ''F'' and the [[binary operation]] • is the field [[multiplication]],
*the [[algebraic torus]] GL(1).{{clarify|reason=this is not defined in this article nor in the linked article|date=March 2015}}

== Examples ==
*The [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo ''n'']] is the group under multiplication of the invertible elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  When ''n'' is not prime, there are elements other than zero that are not invertible.
* The multiplicative group of [[positive real numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; is an [[abelian group]] with 1 its [[neutral element]]. The [[logarithm]] is a [[group isomorphism]] of this group to the [[additive group]] of real numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The multiplicative group of a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all nonzero elements: &lt;math&gt;F^\times = F -\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;, under the multiplication operation. If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is [[finite field|finite]] of order ''q'' (for example ''q'' = ''p'' a prime, and &lt;math&gt;F = \mathbb F_p=\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;), then the [[finite field#multiplicative_structure|multiplicative group]] is cyclic: &lt;math&gt;F^\times \cong C_{q-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Group scheme of roots of unity==
The '''group scheme of ''n''-th [[roots of unity]]''' is by definition the kernel of the ''n''-power map on the multiplicative group GL(1), considered as a [[group scheme]]. That is, for any integer ''n'' &gt; 1 we can consider the morphism on the multiplicative group that takes ''n''-th powers, and take an appropriate [[fiber product of schemes]], with the morphism ''e'' that serves as the identity.

The resulting group scheme is written μ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. It gives rise to a [[reduced scheme]], when we take it over a field ''K'', [[if and only if]] the [[characteristic (field)|characteristic]] of ''K'' does not divide ''n''. This makes it a source of some key examples of non-reduced schemes (schemes with [[nilpotent element]]s in their [[structure sheaf|structure sheaves]]); for example μ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; over a [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements for any [[prime number]] ''p''. 

This phenomenon is not easily expressed in the classical language of algebraic geometry. It turns out to be of major importance, for example, in expressing the [[duality theory of abelian varieties]] in characteristic ''p'' (theory of [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]]). The Galois cohomology of this group scheme is a way of expressing [[Kummer theory]].

'''Occupy Central with Love and Peace''' (OCLP; 讓愛與和平佔領中環 or 和平佔中) was a single-purpose Hong Kong [[civil disobedience]] campaign convened by Reverend [[Chu Yiu-ming]], Dr [[Benny Tai]] Yiu-ting, and [[Chan Kin-man]] on 27 March 2013.  Its aim was to pressure the PRC Government into reforming the systems for election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Chief Executive]] and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] so as to satisfy "international standards in relation to universal suffrage" as promised in the 1984 [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|Article 45]] of the 1997 [[Hong Kong Basic Law]].  Its manifesto called for occupation of the region's central business district if such reforms were not made.  Upstaged by the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] (HKFS) and [[Scholarism]] in September 2014, its leaders joined in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|Occupy Central protests]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oclp.hk/index.php?route=occupy/eng_detail&amp;eng_id=9|title=OCLP Manifesto|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/occupy-central-hong-kong-democracy-campaign|title=Occupy Central gives downtown Hong Kong a taste of disobedience|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCLP had originally planned to launch its protest campaign on 1 October 2014, the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Branigan, Tania (31 August 2014).

==Background==

{{main|Democratic development in Hong Kong}}
The implementation of universal suffrage having been established as a matter of Hong Kong's constitutional law in 1997, pressure began [[Democratic development in Hong Kong#Post-1997|steadily building]] from democrats to see its implementation.  As the years went by, the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]] and Beijing were seen to be dragging their feet and failing to comply with [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45]], which sets out the requirements for election of the Chief Executive:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html|title=Hong Kong Basic Law, Chapter IV : Political Structure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|chief executive]] of the [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] shall be selected by election or through consultations held locally and be appointed by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government]].&lt;ref name="HKbasicalaw"&gt;HK basic law web pdf. "[http://www.info.gov.hk/basic_law/fulltext/Basic_Law.pdf HK basic law]." ''The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative region of the People's Republic of China.'' Retrieved 8 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The method for selecting the chief executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by [[universal suffrage]] upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with [[democracy|democratic procedures]].&lt;ref name="HKbasicalaw" /&gt;}}

In December 2007, the National People's Congress Law Committee officially ruled on the issue of universal suffrage in Hong Kong:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/2211/longtitle.html|title=Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Issues Relating to the Methods For Selecting The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region And For Forming The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the Year 2012 And on Issues Relating To Universal Suffrage (Adopted by the Standing Committee of the Tenth National People's Congress at Its Thirty-First Session on 29 December 2007)|work=Hong Kong Legal Information Institute}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|that the election of the fifth chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2017 may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage; that after the chief executive is selected by universal suffrage, the election of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may be implemented by the method of electing all the members by universal suffrage...}}

The ''[[Asia Times]]'' wrote in 2008 that both proposals for the Legislative Council (LegCo) and for the chief executive were "hedged in with so many ifs and buts that there is no guarantee of Hong Kong getting anything at all... "&lt;ref name="Atimes1"&gt;"{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA11Ad01.html|title=Hong Kong on the march – again|newspaper=[[Asia Times Online]] |date= 11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After another six years of government inaction, on 16 January 2013, Benny Tai, then an associate professor of law at the University of Hong Kong, published an article in the ''[[Hong Kong Economic Journal]]'' in which he proposed an act of [[civil disobedience]] be carried out in Central, the business and financial centre of Hong Kong if the government failed to announce reforms introducing genuine universal suffrage. He set no specific timetable for such action.&lt;ref name="16/1/13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkej.com/template/dailynews/jsp/detail.jsp?dnews_id=3609&amp;cat_id=6&amp;title_id=571297&amp;txtSearch=%E6%88%B4%E8%80%80%E5%BB%B7|work=[[Hong Kong Economic Journal]]|title=公民抗命的最大殺傷力武器|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting increased polarisation, disaffection and frustration with government inaction and Beijing intransigence, on 21 March 2013, all 27 democratically inclined lawmakers of the Legislative Council joined in establishing the [[Alliance for True Democracy]], adopting a more determined and confrontational stance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atd.hk/en/?page_id=10|title=Alliance for True Democracy; Manifesto|website=Alliance for True Democracy|access-date=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; than its recently failed and disbanded compromise-leaning predecessor, the [[Alliance for Universal Suffrage]].

On 24 March 2013, [[Qiao Xiaoyang]], then chairman of the Law Committee under the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) startled Hongkongers by announcing that Chief Executive candidates must be persons who love the country and love Hong Kong, and who do not insist on confronting the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/03/26/hong-kongs-future-leader-must-love-china/|title=Hong Kong's Future Leader Must 'Love China'|date=26 March 2013|last=Chen|first=Te-ping|access-date=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement was taken as setting out new, vague pre-conditions for candidacy as a means of screening out candidates not sympathetic to Beijing's goals in Hong Kong, denying the promise of genuine democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Ming Pao|date=26 March 2017|title=Political Screening Unacceptable in Chief Executive Election|url=http://english.mingpao.com/cfm/database3b.cfm?File=20130326/critic/ema1.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CLee"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/1199015/opposition-camp-members-cant-run-chief-executive-says-npc-official|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|last1=Lee|first1=Colleen|last2=But|first2=Joshua|title=Opponents of Beijing ineligible to be CE: top Chinese official|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OCLP was convened three days later.

On 16 January 2013, an article by Benny Tai Yiu-ting was published in the ''[[Hong Kong Economic Journal]]'', entitled 公民抗命的最大殺傷力武器 (''Civil Disobedience's Deadliest Weapon'').  Tai postulated a seven-step progression: 10,000 participants signing a declaration (taking a vow and pledge of willingness to occupy the streets), live TV broadcast of discussions, electronic voting on methods for universal suffrage, a referendum on the preferred formula, resignation of Super-Seat Legislative Council member (then former [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] Chairman [[Albert Ho|Albert Ho Chun-yan]]) to be filled in a by-election to be seen as a referendum on the plan, civil disobedience, and, finally, Occupy Central in July 2014.&lt;ref name="16/1/13"/&gt;  Tai repeated his plan at a forum held on 24 February 2013, emphasising the importance of the non-violence pledge.&lt;ref name="25/2/13"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hot talk swirls on 'occupy Central' idea|last=Luk|first=Eddie|newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=27 March 2013|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=131351&amp;sid=39060291&amp;con_type=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106211405/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=131351&amp;sid=39060291&amp;con_type=1|archivedate=6 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview together with Ho on 6 March 2013, Tai spoke at length about his referendum and protest strategies to bring about universal suffrage in Hong Kong and stated:  "This is a people's movement; frankly speaking, the central government will have to accept [the referendum result] or reject it; if they reject it, we will block the streets."&lt;ref name=Inmedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inmediahk.net/albert-ho-chun-yan-promised-resign-pave-way-occupy-central-movement|title=Albert Ho Chun-Yan Promised to Resign to pave way for the Occupy Central Movement|last=Chan|first=Melody|date=12 March 2013|access-date=9 October 2017|website=Inmedia Hong Kong}}, Chinese original at https://web.archive.org/web/20130310042455/http://www.inmediahk.net/hotai&lt;/ref&gt;

OCLP was launched at a press conference hosted by its three founders, Reverend [[Chu Yiu-ming]], Dr Benny Tai Yiu-ting, and Dr [[Chan Kin-man]], on 27 March 2013 at which they presented its manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/occupy-hong-kong-for-universal-suffrage/|title='Occupy' Hong Kong, for Universal Suffrage|last=Tatlow|first=Didi Kirsten|date=4 April 2013|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
[[File:Genuine Universal Suffrage.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hong Kong protest banner]]

OCLP's manifesto stated that it would campaign for universal suffrage through dialogue, [[deliberative democracy|deliberation]], civil referendum and civil disobedience (Occupy Central);&lt;ref name="Manifesto" /&gt; it also demanded that any [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform consultation|government proposal]] should satisfy international standards in relation to universal suffrage, i.e. equal number of votes, equal weight for each vote and no unreasonable restrictions on the right to stand for election, and that the final proposal for electoral reform be decided by means of a genuine democratic process.  The founders emphasised their objective of non-violent civil disobedience&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt; but, as their campaign had no leaders nor membership, what acts members of the public adopted was a matter for them to decide as individuals.&lt;ref name=risky&gt;{{cite news|title=Occupy Central is action based on risky thinking|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=146299&amp;con_type=3|publisher=The Standard|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912212732/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=146299&amp;con_type=3|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Democratic Party support==
On 5 February 2014, the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] staged a public oath-taking, at [[Statue Square]] , with members swearing to join in Occupy Central irrespective of the risk of arrest and imprisonment.  Members of [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]], disparaging of the Democratic Party's failure to demand direct civil nomination of Chief Executive candidates in its platform, disrupted the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People Power radicals disrupt Democratic Party's Occupy Central event|last=Lau|first=Stewart|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1421488/democratic-party-protest-mob-occupy-central-albert-ho|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deliberations on reform==
{{See also|2014 Hong Kong electoral reform}}
Deliberation days were organised by OCLP on 9 June 2013, 9 March 2014, and 6 May 2014, at which attendees were invited to exchange views on strategies to be adopted to achieve democratic reform.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

On the third deliberation day, the Occupy Central participants voted on electoral reform proposals put forward by various pro-democracy groups, with the objective of determining which should be put to a plebiscite.  Five proposals were put to the attendees and the three most popular selected.  The proposal by student groups [[Scholarism]] and [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] which allowed for public nomination, received 1,124 votes – 45 percent of the vote. People Power's proposal came in second with 685 votes, while the three-track proposal by the [[Alliance for True Democracy]] consisting of 27 pan-democracy lawmakers got 445 votes.  The civil recommendation method proposed by 18 academics got 74 votes and [[Hong Kong 2020]]'s proposal came in last with 43 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=145115&amp;sid=42211090&amp;con_type=1|title=Students' reform proposals get the thumbs-up|first=Kelly|last=Ip|date=7 May 2014|newspaper=The Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 2,508 votes were cast in the poll.

All three selected proposals included the concept of civil nomination, which the mainland authorities had already flatly rejected as not compliant with the Basic Law.  The three chosen proposals were thus considered to be the more radical, leaving moderate [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democrats]] in the cold, laying the ground for friction and division among democrats.&lt;ref name=20140515hks&gt;Luk, Eddie (15 May 2014).

He believed that the poll results would make it harder to find a reform package agreeable to Beijing. He thought Occupy Central's plan to block streets in Central was likely to materialise.&lt;ref name="D-Day3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=20140515hks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?englishnews&amp;20140514&amp;56&amp;1006256 "Plurality backed as democrats 'divide'"].

OCLP commissioned the University of Hong Kong Public Opinion Programme (HKUPOP) to run a poll on three proposals – all of which involved allowing citizens to directly nominate candidates – for presentation to the Beijing government. It ran from 20 to 29 June 2014.&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong's unofficial pro-democracy referendum irks Beijing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/25/hong-kong-unofficial-pro-democracy-referendum-beijing|first=Jonathan|last=Kaiman|date=25 June 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 792,808 people, equivalent to over one fifth of the registered electorate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.gov.hk/legco2016/eng/turnout.html?1507448322993|title=2016 Legislative Council Election|publisher=Electoral Affairs Commission, Hong Kong Government|access-date=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; took part in the poll by either voting online or going to designated polling stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-28076566|publisher=BBC|title=Hong Kong democracy 'referendum' draws nearly 800,000|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal tabled by the Alliance for True Democracy, a group comprising 26 of the 27 pan-democratic lawmakers, won the unofficial referendum by securing 331,427 votes, or 42.1 per cent of the 787,767 valid ballots. A joint blueprint put forward by Scholarism and the Hong Kong Federation of Students came second with 302,567 votes (38.4 per cent), followed by the People Power proposal, which garnered 81,588 votes (10.4 per cent).&lt;ref name=20140630hks&gt;{{cite web|last=Luk|first=Eddie|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=146908&amp;sid=42538382&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20140630&amp;fc=1|title=Alliance proposal wins the day|newspaper=The Standard|date=30 June 2014|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221707/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=146908&amp;sid=42538382&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20140630&amp;fc=1|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ATD wins"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1543231/nearly-800000-hongkongers-vote-occupy-central-poll?page=all|title=Alliance for True Democracy proposal wins Occupy Central poll as nearly 800,000 Hongkongers vote|date=29 June 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post|first1=Tony|last1=Cheung|first2=Jeffie|last2=Lam|first3=Joyce|last3=Ng|first4=Gary|last4=Cheung}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three called for the public to be allowed to nominate candidates for the 2017 Chief Executive election, an idea repeatedly dismissed by Beijing as inconsistent with the Basic Law.  The Alliance's provided for nomination by the election committee and by political parties, as well. The plan was not specific on method of formation of the nominating committee, only stating that it should be "as democratic as it can be". The two other proposals were for nomination by the public and nominating committee only.&lt;ref name="ATD wins"/&gt; 691,972 voters (87.8 per cent) agreed that the Legislative Council should veto any reform proposal put forward by the government if it failed to meet international standards, compared with 7.5 per cent who disagreed.&lt;ref name="ATD wins"/&gt;

The unofficial referendum infuriated Beijing.  Mainland officials and newspapers called it "illegal" while many condemned Occupy Central, claiming it was operating at the behest of foreign "anti-China forces" and would damage Hong Kong's standing as a financial capital.&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"/&gt; [[Zhang Junsheng]], a former deputy director of Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, denounced the poll as "meaningless". The state-run ''[[Global Times]]'' mocked the referendum as an "illegal farce" and a "joke". The region's chief executive, Leung Chun-Ying, offered this rebuke: "Nobody should place Hong Kong people in confrontation with mainland Chinese citizens."  Mainland censors meanwhile scrubbed social media sites clean of references to Occupy Central.&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"/&gt; The poll also prompted a flurry of vitriolic editorials, preparatory police exercises and sophisticated cyber-attacks where strategies evolved over time.  According to [[CloudFlare]], a firm that helped defend against a "unique and sophisticated" attack,&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"/&gt; [[CloudFlare]] the volume of traffic was an unprecedented 500Gbit/s and involved at least five [[botnet]]s. OCLP's servers were bombarded with in excess of 250 million DNS requests per second, equivalent to the average volume of legitimate DNS requests for the entire Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/11/20/the-largest-cyber-attack-in-history-has-been-hitting-hong-kong-sites/|title=The Largest Cyber Attack In History Has Been Hitting Hong Kong Sites|date=20 November 2014|website=Forbes|last=Olson|first=Parmy|publisher=|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the referendum, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] issued a [[The Practice of the 'One Country, Two Systems' Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|white paper]] claiming "comprehensive jurisdiction" over the territory.&lt;ref&gt;Yung, Chester (10 June 2014). [https://online.wsj.com/articles/china-reminds-hong-kong-of-its-control-1402411342 "China Reminds Hong Kong of Its Control"]. ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; "The high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] is not full autonomy, nor a decentralised power," it said. "It is the power to run local affairs as authorised by the central leadership." Michael DeGolyer, director of the transition project at [[Hong Kong Baptist University]], said: "It's very clear from surveys that the vast majority of the people voting in this referendum are doing it as a reaction to this white paper – particularly because they see it as threatening the rule of law ... That's not negotiating on the one country two systems principle, that's demolishing it."&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"/&gt;

==Criminal liability for OCLP protesters==

The OCLP has pointed out the participants in Occupy Central could be guilty of "obstructing, inconveniencing or endangering a person or vehicle in a public place" under the Summary Offenses Ordinance. However, under the Public Order Ordinance, Occupy Central was considered as [[unlawful assembly]], i.e., "when three or more people assemble... to cause any person reasonably to fear that the persons so assembled will commit a breach of the peace or will by such conduct provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace, they are an unlawful assembly." The Hong Kong [[Secretary for Security]] [[Lai Tung-kwok]] stated that the government will "take robust action to uphold the rule of law and maintain safety and order."&lt;ref name=risky/&gt;

OCLP also published a "manual of disobedience" to inform protesters what to do in the event of being detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oclp.hk/index.php?route=occupy/eng_detail&amp;eng_id=28|title=OCLP - Manual of Disobedience |website=Occupy Central with Love and Peace|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions to formation and objective==

===SAR government===

On 21 March 2013, in an apparent response to reports of Tai's statements early that month and the formation that day of the [[Alliance for True Democracy]], [[Commissioner of Police (Hong Kong)|Commissioner of Police]] [[Andy Tsang Wai-hung]] said that any attempt to block major thoroughfares in Central would not be tolerated and warned people to think twice about joining the Occupy Central protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Occupy Central' plan draws warnings|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1196531/occupy-central-plan-draws-warnings|newspaper=South China Morning Post|accessdate=22 March 2013|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, with pressure building in view of the original plan for July 2014 occupy action, [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Leung Chun-ying]] warned that the Occupy Central movement was bound to be neither peaceful nor legal and that actions will be taken to maintain law and order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crackdown warning over 'illegal' Occupy move|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=134475&amp;con_type=1|first1=Kelly|last1=Ip|first2=Eddie|last2=Luk|date=10 June 2014|newspaper=The Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok warned that radical elements of Occupy Central may cause serious disturbances like the violent incident at the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] during the meeting for funding the northeast New Territories new town.  Lai reminded the participants to consider their own personal safety and legal liability.&lt;ref name=risky/&gt;

===PRC government===

====Officials' response====
On 24 March 2013, [[Wang Guangya]], director of the [[Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office]], when asked if he believed the Occupy Central plan would be beneficial to the city, said "I think Hong Kong compatriots don't want to see Hong Kong being messed up. Hong Kong needs development."&lt;ref name="25/3/13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1199036/occupy-central-plan-gets-hong-kong-affairs-chiefs-thumbs-down|title=Occupy Central plan gets Hong Kong affairs chief's thumbs down|last1=Lee|first1=Colleen|last2=But|first2=Joshua|date=25 March 2013|accessdate=27 March 2013|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Qiao Xiaoyang, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]] Law Committee, was quoted as accusing the "opposition camp" of "fuelling" the Occupy Central plan. Qiao said the plan was only "partly truthful", "complex" and a "risk-everything" proposition.&lt;ref name="25/3/13"/&gt;

In October 2013 the Communist Party-controlled ''[[Global Times]]'' objected to Occupy organizers meeting with [[Democratic Progressive Party]] figures such as [[Shih Ming-teh]] in Taiwan, saying that the DPP, the main opposition party to Taiwan's governing [[KMT]], was "pro-independence."  In a piece titled "HK opposition at risk of becoming [[enemy of the State]]," Occupy organizers were warned that "collaborating with the pro-independence forces in Taiwan will put Hong Kong's future at the risk of violence," and advised that "if they collaborated... massive chaos might be created, which will compel the central government to impose tough measures to maintain Hong Kong's stability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/820178.shtml HK opposition at risk of becoming enemy of the State] ''[[Global Times]]'' 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the paper said that OCLP was the "extreme opposition" and that Occupy Central was a "potentially violent concept".  It asked rhetorically, "Why are Benny Tai Yiu-ting, who initiated the Occupy Central campaign and his supporters so bold as to challenge the central government with a bloody proposal over the issue of chief executive election procedures?", answering that the "ulterior motive" lay in "interference from foreign forces".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/822450.shtml Violent democracy threatens HK prospects] ''[[Global Times]]'' 4 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Global Times'' continued its critical commentary the day after OCLP's announcement of the commencement of Occupy Central, describing the occupation as an "illicit campaign [which would] jeopardise the global image of Hong Kong [and] erode the authority of the rule of law". The demonstrators were described as "radical opposition forces", a small minority of extremists incapable of mobilising the "entire populace" to revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Global Times|date=29 September 2014|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/884080.shtml|title=Street movement ruins Hong Kong image|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Censorship====
The Occupy Central campaign was censored from [[Media of China|mainland China news media]] and replaced by cheerful reports of government supporters gathering near the Tamar government headquarters to endorse the central government's plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/china-censors-images-hong-kong-protests|title=China censors images of Hong Kong protests in TV broadcasts to mainland|date=29 September 2014|access-date=9 October 2017|last=Kaiman|first=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users of the mainland-controlled messaging application [[WeChat]] observed that Occupy Central content sent by them was filtered out of their messages as viewed by their addressees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1607452/wechat-allegedly-censoring-photos-hong-kong-protests|title=WeChat allegedly censoring photos from Hong Kong protests|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=2 October 2014|last=Luo|first=Chris|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social media such as [[Tencent Weibo|Weibo]] came under never-before-seen levels of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Record censorship of China's social media as references to Hong Kong protests blocked|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1603869/record-censorship-chinas-social-media-references-hong-kong|last=Boehler|first=Patrick|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=29 September 2014|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually accessible [[Instagram]] was blocked entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/aa0e81a4-479e-11e4-ac9f-00144feab7de|newspaper=Financial Times|title=HK protests: the censored view from Beijing|last=Mitchell|first=Tom|date=29 September 2014|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-democracy camp===
In February 2013, [[Civic Party]] lawmaker [[Kwok Ka-ki]] said he saw the ideas as "the last resort" to pressure Beijing and the SAR administration to introduce universal suffrage. "If Beijing breaks its promise of universal suffrage," he added, "we will have no option but to launch such a civil disobedience movement."&lt;ref name="25/2/13" /&gt;

[[Albert Ho Chun-yan]] of the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] undertook to resign his legislator post to enforce a de facto referendum on universal suffrage just as the pan-democrats had done by triggering the [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|by-election in 2010]].&lt;ref name=Inmedia /&gt;

Not all democrats' reactions were supportive. [[Wong Yeung-tat]], of [[Civic Passion]], for example, was strongly opposed to the movement.&lt;ref name="shidai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.hk.msn.com/sunday/%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E7%9A%84%E7%B5%82%E7%B5%90|date=24 March 2013|accessdate=5 April 2013|title=一個時代的終結|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413185832/http://news.hk.msn.com/sunday/%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E7%9A%84%E7%B5%82%E7%B5%90|archivedate=13 April 2013|df=dmy-all}} in Chinese&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-Beijing camp===
[[Cheung Kwok-kwan]], vice-chairman of the pro-Beijing [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]], questioned whether Hong Kong could "afford the negative impact of people staging a rally to occupy and even paralyze Central for a universal suffrage model". He noted that it was "a mainstream idea" in the SAR not to resort to radical means to fight for democracy.&lt;ref name="25/2/13"/&gt; [[Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai]], a [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] member, feared the occupation would adversely affect Hong Kong's image.&lt;ref name="27/3/13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadailyapac.com/article/npc-deputies-blast-%E2%80%9Coccupy-central%E2%80%9D-threat-opposition|title=NPC deputies blast 'Occupy Central' threat by opposition|newspaper=China Daily|date=11 March 2013|accessdate=27 March 2013|first=Kahon|last=Chan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National People's Congress]] Deputy and Executive Councilor [[Fanny Law|Fanny Law Fan Chiu-fan]] urged the opposition camp to show respect for each other through a rational and pragmatic debate over the issue. She added that there was no need to resort to "extreme action" and claimed that it was not too late to begin consultations in 2014.&lt;ref name="27/3/13"/&gt;

====[[Alliance for Peace and Democracy (Hong Kong)|Alliance for Peace and Democracy (APD)]]====
In mid-July 2014, after the civic referendum, the APD, under its spokesman [[Robert Chow]], initiated a petition against the occupation, with signatures to be gathered from 18 July to 17 August.&lt;ref name=20140721hks/&gt; There were criticisms that no identity checks were carried out and that there were no steps to prevent repeat signings.&lt;ref name=20140721hks/&gt; According to the ''Wall Street Journal'' and ''South China Morning Post'', employees of corporations such as the major utility [[The Hong Kong and China Gas Company|Towngas]] faced pressure to sign petition forms that were being circulated by their department heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HKT|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/07/28/a-million-sign-hong-kong-petition-as-democracy-fight-ratchets-up/ |title=A Million Sign Hong Kong Petition as Democracy Fight Ratchets Up – China Real Time Report |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=28 July 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1555515/towngas-backs-down-after-asking-staff-sign-anti-occupy-central "Towngas Backs Down After Asking Staff Sign Anti Occupy Central"] ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The APD claimed in excess of a million signatures were obtained.&lt;ref name=20140818wsj/&gt; The organisers said they obtained signatures from many supporters including children, secondary school and university students, the elderly, office staff, celebrities and [[foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong|maids]].&lt;ref name=20140721hks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=147555&amp;sid=42656332&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20140721&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2014 |title=Shocking turnout of anti-Occupy backers |work=The Standard |accessdate=19 August 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085030/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=147555&amp;sid=42656332&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20140721&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2014 |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Official endorsements were received from Chief Executive CY Leung and other top Hong Kong officials.&lt;ref name=20140818wsj&gt;Ngai, Edward (18 August 2014) [https://online.wsj.com/articles/hong-kongs-pro-beijing-groups-march-to-oppose-occupy-central-1408294278 "Hong Kong's Pro-Beijing Groups March to Oppose Occupy Central"].

===Business and professional groups===
A meeting held in October 2013 between members of the Occupy Central movement and [[Taiwanese independence]] activists was met with condemnation by eight major local business groups. A statement to that effect was signed by the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Chinese General Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Federation of Hong Kong Industries]], the [[Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong]] and the [[Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International business mulling Occupy Central censure|date=16 May 2014|url=http://harbourtimes.com/openpublish/article/international-business-mulling-occupy-central-censure|newspaper=Harbour Times|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133444/http://harbourtimes.com/openpublish/article/international-business-mulling-occupy-central-censure|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Executives and brokers including tycoons [[Li Ka-shing]] and [[Peter Woo]], and also the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Hong Kong Bahrain Business Association, the Canadian, Indian and Italian chambers of commerce in Hong Kong together published an advertisement on newspapers that said the demonstrations may "cripple commerce in the city's central business district".  The statement was directed at the "organisers of Occupy Central".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business chambers condemn Occupy Central in newspaper ads|first=Cheung|last=Gary|date=11 June 2014|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1529895/business-chambers-condemn-occupy-central-newspaper-ads|newspaper=South China Morning Post|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2014, Hong Kong's [[Big Four (audit firms)|four biggest accounting firms]] issued a statement condemning the Occupy Central movement arguing that the blockade could have an "adverse and far-reaching impact" on the local legal system, social order and economic development. Employees of the firms who called themselves a "group of Big Four employees who love Hong Kong" took out an advertisement saying their employers' statement did not represent their stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Employees from 'Big Four' accounting firms disown anti-Occupy Central ad|first=Stuart|last=Lau|date=30 June 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Cardinal [[Joseph Zen]], the Roman Catholic leader in Hong Kong, gave his conditional support to the campaign, stating that it must have well-defined goals and deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=陳日君有條件支持「佔領中環」|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20130316/-2-2919865/1.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Ming Pao|date=16 March 2013|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329002854/http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20130316/-2-2919865/1.html|archivedate=29 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incumbent bishop Cardinal [[John Tong Hon]] expressed that he did not encourage followers to join the movement, suggesting that both parties should debate universal suffrage through dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=湯漢不鼓勵信眾「佔領中環」|url=http://www.singtao.com/breakingnews/20130323a132502.asp|newspaper=[[Sing Tao Daily]] |date=23 March 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverend Ng Chung-man of the Protestant [[Evangelical Free Church of China]] publicly denounced the Occupy Central plan in his church's newsletter. Ng wrote that while "some Christians are advocating...occupying Central to force the governments to give in to their demands...civil disobedience is acceptable biblically only...when people's rights to religion and to live are under threat". He exhorted believers to pray for those in authority, in an act of  "active subordination" to "relatively just governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church leaders divided over 'Occupy Central' plan|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1218649/church-leaders-divided-over-occupy-central-plan|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=20 April 2013|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September 2014, after the [[2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign|class boycott campaign]], students led by members of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] (HKFS) and [[Scholarism]] occupied Civic Square, triggering a crowd to protest in support outside the [[Central Government Offices]] in Admiralty. On 28 September 2014, at 1.40am, Benny Tai announced the official start of the Occupy Central with Love and Peace civil disobedience campaign on the stage of the student protests. He proposed that the areas around the government headquarters be the occupation site in place of Central proper.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-29397738|publisher=BBC News|title=Thousands at Hong Kong protest as Occupy Central is launched|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday night, 28 September 2014, the scenes in Central and Admiralty became more dramatic, as the police employed tear gas, pepper spray, and batons in their attempts to disperse the protesters. The use of tear gas was a significant move in Hong Kong, as it had not been used in the SAR since 2005 and, on that occasion, in the highly exceptional situation of quelling violent Korean farmers bent on disrupting a [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005|WTO conference]].&lt;ref name="SCMP20140929"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1603350/police-fire-tear-gas-and-baton-charge-thousands-occupy-central|title=Police fire tear gas and baton charge thousands of Occupy Central protesters|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excessive use of force by Hong Kong Police in dispersing Hongkongers antagonised and frustrated the general public and did not deter the protesters; rather, it gave impetus to thousands more to begin occupation of other major thoroughfares of Hong Kong, namely, at [[Mong Kok]] and [[Causeway Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/hong-kong-citizens-protests-police-withdraw "Hong Kong citizens urged to continue protests as police withdraw"], Tania Branigan&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday, the government withdrew the riot police, leaving the three regions occupied by protesters, and there were massive traffic disruptions as all traffic had to be diverted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After night of tear gas, Hong Kong protesters dig in|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-protests/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=CNN|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OCLP bows out==
The scale and scope of the three main occupations was unprecedented, involving many pressure groups as well as many citizens not associated with any group at all.  What had been formulated by the OCLP organisers was now much bigger than OCLP and completely beyond their or any single group's control. Hence, the role of OCLP's volunteers was to provided support, for example, through its legal support team, for what had become a major, yet amorphous, movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 December 2018|title=In full: The testimony of protest organiser Chan Kin-man at the trial of the Umbrella Movement 9|last=Kong|first=Tsung-gan|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/12/01/full-transcript-umbrella-movement-convener-chan-kin-mans-testimony-trial-occupy-9/|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the occupation ended its first month, Chan Kin-man and Benny Tai resumed their teaching duties at their respective universities and OCLP handed over the command of its medic, marshal and supplies teams to the student groups.&lt;ref name="Mingpao20141031"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mingpao20141028"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specials.mingpao.com/cfm/News.cfm?News=84f43439c5680a1a9da4f62b294641921eaef2a9c96006da952c02adade02adad87404|title=陳健民戴耀廷將大學復教 事務隊「交棒」學生 陳：不是退場|work=Ming Pao|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2014, the Occupy Central trio, along with 62 others including Democratic Party lawmaker [[Wu Chi-wai]] and Cardinal [[Joseph Zen]], then Bishop Emeritus of Hong Kong, turned themselves in to the police, admitting taking part in an unauthorised assembly. The police declined to arrest them and no charges were laid at the time.&lt;ref name="SCMP20141204"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police let Occupy organisers walk away without charge after they turn themselves in|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1654634/no-regrets-says-occupys-benny-tai-he-prepares-hand-himself-police|accessdate=6 December 2014|work=South China Morning Post|date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the trio, they did so in order to bear legal responsibility and uphold the rule of law, as well as to affirm their principles of love and peace.

==Background==
[[File:Miller-Urey experiment-en.svg|thumb|The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] showed that organic compounds can be readily produced under the presumed conditions of the early [[Earth]]]]
The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] in 1952, and others since, demonstrated the synthesis of [[organic compounds]], such as [[amino acids]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[sugars]], from the original [[inorganic]] precursors the researchers presumed to have been present in the [[primordial soup]] (but is no longer considered likely). This experiment inspired many others. In 1961, [[Joan Oró]] found that the [[nucleotide]] base [[adenine]] could be made from [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) and [[ammonia]] in a water solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oró J, Kimball AP |title=Synthesis of purines under possible primitive earth conditions. I. Adenine from hydrogen cyanide |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |volume=94|pages=217–27 |date=August 1961 |pmid=13731263 |doi=10.1016/0003-9861(61)90033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments conducted later showed that the other [[Nucleobase|RNA and DNA nucleobases]] could be obtained through simulated prebiotic chemistry with a [[reducing atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Origins of Prebiological Systems and of Their Molecular Matrices| editor= Fox SW| author=Oró J| year=1967| pages=137| publisher=New York Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[RNA world hypothesis]] shows how RNA can become its own [[catalyst]] (a [[ribozyme]]). In between there are some missing steps such as how the first [[RNA]] molecules could be formed. The PAH world hypothesis was proposed by Simon Nicholas Platts in May 2004 to try to fill in this missing step.&lt;ref name=astro/&gt;  A more thoroughly elaborated idea has been published by [[Pascale Ehrenfreund|Ehrenfreund]] ''et al.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ehrenfreund | first1 = P | last2 = Rasmussen | first2 = S | last3 = Cleaves | first3 = J | last4 = Chen | first4 = L | year = 2006 | title = Experimentally tracing the key steps in the origin of life: The aromatic world | url = | journal = Astrobiology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 490–520 | doi=10.1089/ast.2006.6.490 | bibcode=2006AsBio...6..490E | pmid=16805704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the most common and abundant of the known polyatomic molecules in the visible [[universe]], and are considered a likely constituent of the [[primordial sea]].&lt;ref name="SP-20051018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJ-20051010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20110413" /&gt; PAHs, along with [[fullerenes]] (or "[[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]]"), have been recently detected in nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/724/1/L39 |title=Formation Of Fullerenes In H-Containing Planetary Nebulae |last1=García-Hernández |first1=D.

On June 6, 2013, scientists at the [[Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía|IAA-CSIC]] reported the detection of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] in the [[upper atmosphere]] of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest [[Natural satellite|moon]] of the [[planet]] [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="IAA-20130606"&gt;{{cite news |last=López-Puertas |first=Manuel |url=http://www.iaa.es/content/pahs-titans-upper-atmosphere |title=PAH's in Titan's Upper Atmosphere |date=June 6, 2013 |work=[[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, researchers reported low-temperature chemical pathways from simple [[organic compound]]s to complex PAHs. Such chemical pathways may help explain the presence of PAHs in the low-temperature atmosphere of [[Saturn]]{{'s}} moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and may be significant pathways, in terms of the PAH world hypothesis, in producing presursors to biochemcals related to life as we know it.&lt;ref name="DG-20181008"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=“A Prebiotic Earth” – Missing Link Found on Saturn’s Moon Titan |url=https://dailygalaxy.com/2018/10/a-prebiotic-earth-missing-link-found-on-saturns-moon-titan/ |date=11 October 2018 |work=DailyGalaxy.com |accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NA-20181008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhao, Long et al. |title=Low-temperature formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Titan’s atmosphere |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-018-0585-y |date=8 October 2018 |journal=[[Nature Astronomy]] |accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, PAHs are not normally very soluble in sea water, but when subject to ionizing radiation such as solar [[UV]] light, the outer [[hydrogen]] atoms can be stripped off and replaced with a [[hydroxyl]] group, rendering the PAHs far more soluble in water.

These modified PAHs are [[amphiphilic]], which means that they have parts that are both [[hydrophilic]] and [[hydrophobic]]. When in solution, they assemble in [[Columnar phase|discotic]] [[mesogen]]ic ([[liquid crystal]]) stacks which, like [[lipids]], tend to organize with their hydrophobic parts protected.

==Attachment of nucleobases to PAH scaffolding==
In the self-ordering PAH stack, the separation between adjacent rings is 0.34&amp;nbsp;nm.  This is the same separation found between adjacent [[nucleotide]]s of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]]. Smaller molecules will naturally attach themselves to the PAH rings. However PAH rings, while forming, tend to swivel around on one another, which will tend to dislodge attached compounds that would collide with those attached to those above and below. Therefore, it encourages preferential attachment of flat molecules such as [[pyrimidine]] and [[purine]] [[nucleobases]], the key constituents (and information carriers) of RNA and DNA. These bases are similarly amphiphilic and so also tend to line up in similar stacks.

==Attachment of oligomeric backbone==
According to the hypothesis, once the nucleobases are attached (via [[hydrogen bonds]]) to the PAH scaffolding, the inter-base distance would select for "linker" molecules of a specific size, such as small [[formaldehyde]] ([[methanal]]) [[oligomer]]s, also taken from the prebiotic "soup", which will bind (via [[covalent bonds]]) to the nucleobases as well as each other to add a flexible structural backbone.&lt;ref name=snp1&gt;Platts, Simon Nicholas, [http://www.pahworld.com/ "The PAH World - Discotic polynuclear aromatic compounds as a mesophase scaffolding at the origin of life"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=astro&gt;[http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/library-of-resources/annual-reports/2005/ciw/projects/project-4-prebiotic-molecular-selection-and-organization "Prebiotic Molecular Selection and Organization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524050536/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/library-of-resources/annual-reports/2005/ciw/projects/project-4-prebiotic-molecular-selection-and-organization/ |date=2009-05-24 }}, NASA's Astrobiology website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detachment of the RNA-like strands==
A subsequent transient drop in the ambient [[pH]] (increase in acidity), for example as a result of a [[Volcano|volcanic]] discharge of acidic gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]] or [[carbon dioxide]], would allow the bases to break off from their PAH scaffolding, forming RNA-like molecules (with the formaldehyde backbone instead of the ribose-phosphate backbone used by "modern" RNA, but the same 0.34&amp;nbsp;nm pitch).&lt;ref name=snp1/&gt;

==Formation of ribozyme-like structures==
The hypothesis further speculates that once long RNA-like single strands are detached from the PAH stacks, and after ambient pH levels became less acidic, they would tend to fold back on themselves, with [[Base pair|complementary sequences]] of nucleobases preferentially seeking out each other and forming [[hydrogen bonds]], creating stable, at least partially double-stranded RNA-like structures, similar to [[ribozymes]]. The formaldehyde oligomers would eventually be replaced with more stable ribose-phosphate molecules for the backbone material, resulting in a starting milestone for the [[RNA world hypothesis]], which speculates about further evolutionary developments from that point.&lt;ref name=snp1/&gt;&lt;ref name=astro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Parable of the Polygons''''' is a 2014 interactive [[blog]] post created by [[Vi Hart]] and [[Game design|game developer]] Nicky Case. The article focuses on a society of blue squares and yellow triangles which have slight personal biases against diversity, which leads to social segregation. It is based on [[game theory|game theorist]] [[Thomas Schelling]]'s papers about [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]]. The article was well-received, especially its visual and playable aspects, and was called a useful educational tool for topics like [[racial segregation]].

== Content ==

The article is an interactive [[blog]] post, "part story and part game".&lt;ref name="startribune2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt; It has a model consisting of a society of blue squares and yellow triangles, presented in a grid.&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt; At the top of the article, a crowd of triangles and squares are wiggling.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Just under, it says, "This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world."&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; The article first demonstrates step-by-step how [[systemic bias|institutional bias]] can occur even when there is little personal bias against diversity, and individuals are well-intentioned.&lt;ref name="cjr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; The article describes the squares and triangles as "slightly shapist".&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt; In the first example, a square or triangle is happy only if at least a third of its neighbors are of the same shape as it is.&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt; The shapes merely adopt a [[meh]] face in a homogeneous neighborhood.&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt; 

At this point, the article lets the reader interact with the model.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; The reader's goal is to make all residents happy with where they live, by moving only unhappy shapes.&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt; At first, the bias is easily managed; however, as the population grows, the shapes' bias quickly leads to visually segregated areas.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; The article reads: "Sometimes a neighborhood just becomes square, and it's not their fault if no triangles wanna stick around. And a triangular neighborhood would welcome a square, but they can't help it if squares ain't interested."&lt;ref name="wapo2014" /&gt; 

The reader can later execute automated simulations, and increase and decrease the shapes' bias.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mnn2014" /&gt; When the bias is increased, the segregation is more prominent.&lt;ref name="citylab2014" /&gt; A subsequent iteration of the game shows that decreasing bias does not make a difference if the population started out segregated.&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Shapes then have to reject the default scenario of segregation in favor of seeking out the other shapes.&lt;ref name="startribune2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Finally, the reader can generate new models using a sandbox.&lt;ref name="cjr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; 

The article departs from Schelling's work by discussing a demand for "even the smallest bit of diversity" which reverses [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]]; Case said that the article teaches that such segregation is "easily offset" with a "small amount of anti-bias", even if bias is still present.&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; The article also departs from Schelling by concluding with encouraging words on how to enact change.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; The article concludes with: "If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life – that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors."&lt;ref name="bustle2015" /&gt;

== Development and release ==
[[Vi Hart]] and Nicky Case, creator of ''[[Coming Out Simulator 2014]]'', teamed up following a talk on the lack of tech event diversity and [[women in STEM]] delivered by Hart, which convinced Case "of the necessity of active measures".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; The article applies ideas from [[game theory|game theorist]] and economist [[Thomas Schelling]]'s 1978 paper ''Micromotives and Macrobehaviour'' which describes how small personal [[bias]] against diversity leads to greater segregation in the general population.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; It is also based on Schelling's 1971 paper ''Dynamic Models of Segregation''.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; 

Case described Schelling's model as "perfect – simple and fun to play";&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Schelling played his own model on a chess board or graph paper with nickels and dimes, moving them one by one.&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo2014" /&gt; Case said that he was "fascinated with taking models/systems from the arts [and] humanities, and translating them into game models/systems".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; The second part of the article was based on a "new surprising aspect of Schelling's model", which introduced a nonconformity bias.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that by playing around with variables, they found that "just as a ''small'' bias can turn a society segregated, a ''small'' anti-bias can reverse that".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Hart said they knew that nonconformity would mix up the population, but that they were "pleasantly surprised to see it work even [at a] very minimum level".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that the article ends on an "optimistic note" that "small local changes really can change institutions from the bottom-up".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Development of the article began in September 2014.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;

The goal of ''Parable of the Polygons'' was for readers to "learn to demand diversity".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; People are represented by abstract shapes because marking their races and genders would be "really weird" and "have the unfortunate implication that [the races and genders] are binary and immutable".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; A triangle was chosen because it appears in Hart's videos.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; The article contains few words, and the ability to move shapes is introduced "slowly and deliberately".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Hart said that they felt that "it was important to start with moving the shapes by hand, so that later when shapes move automatically [the reader would know] there's nothing going on behind [their] back".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;  The article provides readers with interactive sections governed by simple rules to help them prove the counter-intuitive results to themselves.&lt;ref name="blog2015" /&gt; Case said that there was "an effort made to keep players from being scared off by the big stuff"; thus, the article includes jokes, slang, and "cute and friendly shapes".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Hart said that they wanted to make sure to explain systemic bias without changing the readers' "minds".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that a main message was "[not to] take it personally" because "large collective bias can exist even with small individual bias".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;

{{Quote

The article was released in December 2014; Hart noted that "matters of systematic bias [were] even more topical [at the moment]",&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; and Case said, "There's a huge gap between the racial proportions of the police force and the neighborhoods they're policing, that both reinforces and results from racial tensions."&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; Case said that Schelling's models could be identified in that "a black officer [had led] the police force one night" amidst the [[Ferguson unrest]].&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; A remixed version which includes a green pentagon was made the same year and is featured at the bottom of the article.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Hart described the reaction to the article as "more positive than anything [Hart's] ever done" and "almost disturbingly eerie".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said: "It's been surprisingly positive and polite, especially for something that touches on a touchy subject!"&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Hart said that they planned to "tweak some stuff after release", but did not because the reception was "so overwhelmingly positive".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that the article was doing "shockingly well", so any fixes "might weaken or confuse the message" when applied.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The critical reception for the article was overwhelmingly positive. Joanna Rothkopf of [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']] called the article "an adorable and eloquent primer on issues of segregation".&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt; ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]''{{'s}} Chava Gourarie described the article as "a cute, engaging, playable explanation".&lt;ref name="cjr2016" /&gt; Aatish Bhatia of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] described the design and characters as "charming" and "delightfully animated".&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;

The playable aspect of the article received praise. ''[[Kill Screen]]''{{'s}} Jess Joho wrote, "''Parable of the Polygons'' asks you to tackle Schelling's concepts in a way only a game could."&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;
Bhatia called the article "a truly interactive way of communicating an idea".&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;
Jesse Singal of [[New York (magazine)|''The Cut'']] called the article "a really well-done use of the web".&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt;

Singal noted the article's parallels to human behavior.&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt;
Bhatia said that the article delivers an "effective, lucid and very relevant" lesson on real-world segregation, race and equality.&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;
Laura Moss of ''[[Mother Nature Network]]'' said that it "accurately illustrates [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] neighborhoods", and noted that the article illustrates "Schelling's three major findings": the effect of slight individual bias, the starting game state and the reluctancy to become more diverse, and the necessity of intervention "in creating and maintaining diversity".&lt;ref name="mnn2014" /&gt;
Joho said that "demonstrating a difficult reality while still maintaining a sense of actionable hope" was the article's "greatest achievement by far".&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;

''[[Gamasutra]]''{{'s}} Phill Cameron praised the article for using triangles and squares and effectively dissociating itself from "the prejudices of real life".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;
Bhatia said that the article does not get "embroiled in a heated political debate".&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;
Joho wrote that the article is "careful not to throw blame around", and that it constantly emphasizes that personal biases might be "unexamined, unintentional, or even unconscious".&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;
''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'s}} Ana Swanson said that the call to action is a "powerful" message.&lt;ref name="wapo2014" /&gt;
[[Polygon (website)|''Polygon'']]{{'s}} Megan Farokhmanesh wrote, "Half game, half informational post, ''Parable of the Polygons'' wants to encourage people to talk about topics like racism and sexism in healthy, constructive ways."&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;

Amanda Montañez wrote in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' blog that the shapes assume that "their individual preference for diversity is sufficient to propel their society toward integration", but that "the social system in which they operate prohibits it".&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Montañez said that "true progress requires a more active, dramatic shift than expected" and that, in the article, "the complacent squares and triangles must abandon their preconceptions about the nature of 'shapism' and adopt a new, activist stance on integration".&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Montañez compared the idea of using two-dimensional geometric shapes to represent people to the 1884 illustrated novella ''[[Flatland]]'' by [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]].&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt;

'''Paramanu''' is a technical term in [[Jainism]]. It is defined as the smallest and indivisible particle of matter. It is one of the two types of [[Pudgala]] (matter), the other being [[Skandha (Jainism)|Skandha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atmadharma.com/shastras/laghujainsiddhant_eng_txt/index.html#question020|title=Principles of Jainism (Laghu Jain Siddhant Praveshika) in a concise form|first=Pandit Gopaldasji Baraiya, Rajesh Shah|last=(WebMaster)|website=www.atmadharma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also helps define smallest measure of space. All the Parmanus occupy exactly same amount of space. The measure of the space occupied by one Parmanu is called [[Pradesha]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The '''planning fallacy''', first proposed by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] in 1979,&lt;ref name="PezzoLitman2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pezzo|first1=Mark V.|last2=Litman|first2=Jordan A.|last3=Pezzo|first3=Stephanie P.|title=On the distinction between yuppies and hippies: Individual differences in prediction biases for planning future tasks |journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=41|issue=7|year=2006|pages=1359–1371|issn=0191-8869|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.03.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Daniel |last1=Kahneman |first2=Amos |last2=Tversky |title=Intuitive prediction: biases and corrective procedures |journal= TIMS Studies in Management Science|volume=12 |year=1979| pages=313–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an [[optimism bias]] and underestimate the time needed.

This phenomenon occurs regardless of the individual's knowledge that past tasks of a similar nature have taken longer to complete than generally planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/Exploring-the-Planning-Fallacy_Why-People-Underestimate-Their-Task-Completion-Times.pdf|title = Exploring the Planning Fallacy|date = 1994|accessdate = 7 November 2014|website = |publisher = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ll3md4hy6n.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=J&amp;aulast=Kruger&amp;atitle=If+you+don%27t+want+to+be+late,+enumerate:+Unpacking+reduces+the+planning+fallacy&amp;id=doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2003.11.001&amp;title=Journal+of+experimental+social+psychology&amp;volume=40&amp;issue=5&amp;date=2004&amp;spage=586&amp;issn=0022-1031|title = If you don't want to be late, enumerate: Unpacking Reduces the Planning Fallacy|date = 15 October 2003|accessdate = 7 November 2014|website = |publisher = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=53&amp;sid=d2c8483c-7954-4367-a1cc-d4e1934f7fbb%40sessionmgr4002&amp;hid=4105&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=psyh&amp;AN=2000-12567-007|title = Overcoming the Planning Fallacy Through Willpower|date = November 2000|accessdate = 22 November 2014|website = |publisher = European Journal of Social Psychology|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bias only affects predictions about one's own tasks; when outside observers predict task completion times, they show a pessimistic bias, overestimating the time needed.&lt;ref name="buehlerHandB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abouttime" /&gt; The planning fallacy requires that predictions of current tasks' completion times are more optimistic than the beliefs about past completion times for similar projects and that predictions of the current tasks' completion times are more optimistic than the actual time needed to complete the tasks. In 2003, Lovallo and Kahneman proposed an expanded definition as the tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions and at the same time overestimate the benefits of the same actions. According to this definition, the planning fallacy results in not only time overruns, but also [[cost overruns]] and [[benefit shortfall]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lovallo |first=Dan |author2=Daniel Kahneman  |date=July 2003 |title=Delusions of Success: How Optimism Undermines Executives' Decisions |journal=Harvard Business Review |pages=56–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical evidence ==

=== For individual tasks ===
In a 1994 study, 37 [[psychology]] students were asked to estimate how long it would take to finish their [[senior thesis|senior theses]]. The average estimate was 33.9 days. They also estimated how long it would take "if everything went as well as it possibly could" (averaging 27.4 days) and "if everything went as poorly as it possibly could" (averaging 48.6 days). The average actual completion time was 55.5 days, with only about 30% of the students completing their thesis in the amount of time they predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.3.366 |last=Buehler |first=Roger |author2=Dale Griffin |author3=Michael Ross  |year=1994 |title= Exploring the "planning fallacy": Why people underestimate their task completion times |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=67 |pages= 366–381 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study asked students to estimate when they would complete their personal academic projects. Specifically, the researchers asked for estimated times by which the students thought it was 50%, 75%, and 99% probable their personal projects would be done.&lt;ref name="abouttime"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14792779343000112 |last=Buehler |first=Roger |author2=Dale Griffin |author3=Michael Ross  |year=1995 |title=It's about time: Optimistic predictions in work and love |journal=European Review of Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=6 |pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 13% of subjects finished their project by the time they had assigned a 50% probability level;
* 19% finished by the time assigned a 75% probability level;
* 45% finished by the time of their 99% probability level.

A survey of Canadian tax payers, published in 1997, found that they mailed in their tax forms about a week later than they predicted. They had no misconceptions about their past record of getting forms mailed in, but expected that they would get it done more quickly next time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buehler |first=Roger |author2=Dale Griffin |author3=Johanna Peetz  |year=2010 |title=The Planning Fallacy: Cognitive, Motivational, and Social Origins |journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |publisher=Academic Press |volume=43 |pages=9 |url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/trope/Ledgerwood%20et%20al_Advances%20chapter.PDF#page=10 |accessdate=2012-09-15 |doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(10)43001-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates a defining feature of the planning fallacy; that people recognize that their past predictions have been over-optimistic, while insisting that their current predictions are realistic.&lt;ref name="buehlerHandB" /&gt;

=== For group tasks ===
Carter and colleagues conducted three studies in 2005 that demonstrate empirical support that the planning fallacy also affects predictions concerning group tasks. This research emphasizes the importance of how temporal frames and thoughts of successful completion contribute to the planning fallacy.&lt;ref name=Sanna-2005/&gt;

=== Additional studies ===
[[Bent Flyvbjerg]] and [[Cass Sunstein]] argue that [[Albert O. Hirschman|Albert O. Hirschman's]] [[Hiding hand principle|Hiding Hand principle]] is the planning fallacy writ large, and they tested the empirical validity of the principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|last2=Sunstein|first2=Cass R.|date=2015|title=The Principle of the Malevolent Hiding Hand; or, the Planning Fallacy Writ Large|ssrn=2654423|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also further reading below for additional studies.

== Proposed explanations ==
* Kahneman and Tversky originally explained the fallacy by envisaging that planners focus on the most optimistic scenario for the task, rather than using their full experience of how much time similar tasks require.&lt;ref name="buehlerHandB"&gt;Buehler, Roger; Griffin, Dale, &amp; Ross, Michael (2002). "Inside the planning fallacy: The causes and consequences of optimistic time predictions". In Thomas Gilovich, Dale Griffin, &amp; Daniel Kahneman (Eds.), ''Heuristics and biases: The psychology of intuitive judgment'', pp. 250–270. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Roger Buehler and colleagues account for the fallacy by examining [[wishful thinking]]; in other words, people think tasks will be finished quickly and easily because that is what they want to be the case.&lt;ref name="PezzoLitman2006" /&gt;
* In a different paper, Buehler and colleagues suggest an explanation in terms of the [[self-serving bias]] in how people interpret their past performance. By taking credit for tasks that went well but blaming delays on outside influences, people can discount past evidence of how long a task should take.&lt;ref name="PezzoLitman2006" /&gt; One experiment found that when people made their predictions anonymously, they do not show the optimistic bias. This suggests that the people make optimistic estimates so as to create a favorable impression with others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pezzoa | first1 = Stephanie P. | last2 = Pezzob | first2 = Mark V. | last3 = Stone | first3 = Eric R. | year = | title = The social implications of planning: How public predictions bias future plans | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 2006 | issue = | pages = 221–227 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is similar to the concepts outlined in [[impression management]] theory.
* Another explanation proposed by Roy and colleagues is that people do not correctly recall the amount of time that similar tasks in the past had taken to complete; instead people systematically underestimate the duration of those past events. Thus, a prediction about future event duration is biased because memory of past event duration is also biased. Roy and colleagues note that this memory bias does not rule out other mechanisms of the planning fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roy|first=Michael M.|last2=Christenfeld|first2=Nicholas J. S.|last3=McKenzie|first3=Craig R. M.|title=Underestimating the Duration of Future Events: Memory Incorrectly Used or Memory Bias?|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.5.738|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=131|issue=5|pages=738–756|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.5.738}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sanna and colleagues examined temporal framing and thinking about success as a contributor to the planning fallacy. They found that when people were induced to think about a deadline as far away (i.e., lots of time remaining) vs. rapidly approaching (i.e., little time remaining), they made more optimistic predictions and had more thoughts of success. In their final study, they found that the ease of generating thoughts also caused more optimistic predictions. &lt;ref name=Sanna-2005&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanna|first=Lawrence J.|last2=Parks|first2=Craig D.|last3=Chang|first3=Edward C.|last4=Carter|first4=Seth E.|title=The Hourglass Is Half Full or Half Empty: Temporal Framing and the Group Planning Fallacy.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1089-2699.9.3.173|journal=Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice| year=2005 |volume=9|issue=3|pages=173–188|doi=10.1037/1089-2699.9.3.173}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One explanation, [[focalism]], proposes that people fall victim to the planning fallacy because they only focus on the future task and do not consider similar tasks of the past that took longer to complete than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=12&amp;sid=d2c8483c-7954-4367-a1cc-d4e1934f7fbb%40sessionmgr4002&amp;hid=4111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=psyh&amp;AN=2000-03212-001|title = Focalism: A source of durability bias in affective forecasting.|date = May 2000|accessdate = 21 November 2014|website = |publisher = American Psychological Association|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As described by [[Fred Brooks]] in ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'', adding new personnel to an already-late project incurs a variety of risks and overhead costs that tend to make it even later; this is known as [[Brooks's law]].
* The "authorization imperative" offers another possible explanation: much of project planning takes place in a context which requires financial approval to proceed with the project, and the planner often has a stake in getting the project approved. This dynamic may lead to a tendency on the part of the planner to deliberately underestimate the project effort required. It is easier to get forgiveness (for overruns) than permission (to commence the project if a realistic effort estimate were provided). Such deliberate underestimation has been named by Jones and Euske "strategic misrepresentation".&lt;ref name="jpart-jones-1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones,|first1=Larry R|last2=Euske|first2=Kenneth J |title=Strategic misrepresentation in budgeting|journal=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory|date=October 1991|volume=1|issue=4|pages=437–460
|url=http://jpart.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/4/437
|accessdate=11 March 2013
|publisher=Oxford University Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apart from psychological explanations, the phenomenon of the planning fallacy has also been explained by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Taleb]] as resulting from natural [[asymmetry]] and from [[scale (ratio)|scaling]] issues.  The asymmetry results from random events giving negative results of delay or cost, not evenly balanced between positive and negative results.  The scaling difficulties relate to the observation that consequences of disruptions are not [[linear]], that as size of effort increases the error increases much more as a natural effect of inefficiencies of larger efforts' ability to react, particularly efforts that are not divisible in increments.  Additionally this is contrasted with earlier efforts being more commonly on-time (e.g. the [[Empire State Building]], [[The Crystal Palace]], the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]) to conclude it indicates inherent flaws in more modern planning systems and modern efforts having hidden fragility. (For example, that modern efforts – being computerized and less localized invisibly – have less insight and control, and more dependencies on transportation.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods for counteracting ==

=== Segmentation effect ===
The segmentation effect is defined as the time allocated for a task being significantly smaller than the sum of the time allocated to individual smaller sub-tasks of that task. In a study performed by Forsyth in 2008, this effect was tested to determine if it could be used to reduce the planning fallacy. In three experiments, the segmentation effect was shown to be influential. However, the segmentation effect demands a great deal of cognitive resources and is not very feasible to use in everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FMC.36.4.791|title = Allocating time to future tasks: The effect of task segmentation on planning fallacy bias|date = June 2008|accessdate = 7 November 2014|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|doi=10.3758/MC.36.4.791|volume=36|pages=791–798 | last1 = Forsyth | first1 = D. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation intentions ===
[[Implementation intention]]s are concrete plans that accurately show how, when, and where one will act. It has been shown through various experiments that implementation intentions help people become more aware of the overall task and see all possible outcomes. Initially, this actually causes predictions to become even more optimistic. However, it is believed that forming implementation intentions "explicitly recruits willpower" by having the person commit themselves to the completion of the task. Those that had formed implementation intentions during the experiments began work on the task sooner, experienced fewer interruptions, and later predictions had reduced optimistic bias than those who had not. It was also found that the reduction in optimistic bias was mediated by the reduction in interruptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Reference class forecasting ===
[[Reference class forecasting]] predicts the outcome of a planned action based on actual outcomes in a reference class of similar actions to that being forecast.

== Real-world examples ==
[[File:Sydney Opera House - construction - phase 2 1966.jpg|thumb|Sydney Opera House, still under construction in 1966, three years after its expected completion date]]
The [[Sydney Opera House]] was expected to be completed in 1963. A scaled-down version opened in 1973, a decade later. The original cost was estimated at $7 million, but its delayed completion led to a cost of $102 million.&lt;ref name=Sanna-2005/&gt;

The [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] defense project took six years longer than expected, with an overrun cost of 8 billion euros.&lt;ref name=Sanna-2005/&gt;

The [[Central Artery|Boston Central Artery]] was completed seven years later than planned, costing another $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pogo.org/our-work/reports/90s/tr-bigdig-19950201.html|title = No Light at the End of his Tunnel: Boston's Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project|date = 1 February 1995|accessdate = 7 November 2014|website = |publisher = Project on Government Oversight|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Denver International Airport]] opened sixteen months later than scheduled, with a total cost of $4.8 billion, over $2 billion more than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GAOREPORTS-AIMD-95-230/pdf/GAOREPORTS-AIMD-95-230.pdf|title = Denver International Airport|date = September 1995|accessdate = 7 November 2014|website = |publisher = United States General Accounting Office|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Praise''' is a form of [[social interaction]] expressing recognition, reassurance or [[admiration]].
Praise is expressed verbally as well as by [[body language]] ([[facial expression]] and [[gesture]]s).

Verbal praise consists of a positive evaluations  of another's attributes or actions, where the evaluator presumes the validity of the standards on which the evaluation is based.{{huh|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref name="Kanouse et al 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanouse|first1=D. E.|last2=Gumpert|first2=P.|last3=Canavan-Gumpert|first3=D.|title=The semantics of praise|journal=New directions in attribution research|date=1981|volume=3|pages=97–115.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--how is this NOT tautological? The speaker implies that he endorses the thing which he is saying he is endorsing?--&gt; 

As a form of [[Psychological manipulation|social manipulation]], praise is a form of reward and furthers behavioral [[reinforcement]] by [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]].
The [[Social influence|influence]] of praise on an individual can depend on many factors, including the context, the meanings the praise may convey, and the characteristics and interpretations of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henderlong|first1=Jennifer|last2=Lepper|first2=Mark R.|title=The effects of praise on children's intrinsic motivation: A review and synthesis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2002|volume=128|issue=5|pages=774–795|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.5.774}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While praise may share some predictive relationships (both positive and negative) with tangible (material) rewards, praise tends to be less salient and expected, conveys more information about competence, and is typically given more immediately after the desired behavior.&lt;ref name="Carton 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carton|first1=John|title=The differential effects of tangible rewards and praise on intrinsic motivation: A comparison of cognitive evaluation theory and operant theory|journal=Behavior Analyst|date=19 June 1989|volume=19|issue=2|pages=237–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Praise is distinct from acknowledgement or [[feedback]], which are more neutral forms of recognition, and encouragement, which is expressedly future oriented.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; 

Praise is given across [[social hierarchy|social hierarchy]], and both within the ingroup and towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]]; it is an important aspect in the regulation of social hierarchy and the maintenance of group cohesion, influencing the potential for political action and social upheaval. When given by a dominant individual it takes the form of recognition and reassurance, reducing the potential of political action aiming for 
when given by a submissive to a dominant individual it takes the form of [[deference]], [[admiration|admiration or exultation]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Sweetman, Russell Spears, Andrew G. Livingstone, and Antony S.R. Manstead, "Admiration regulates social hierarchy: Antecedents, dispositions, and effects on intergroup behavior", ''J Exp Soc Psychol''. 2013 May; 49(3): 534–542.
doi:  10.1016/j.jesp.2012.10.007.
"We demonstrate that manipulating the legitimacy of status relations affects admiration for the dominant and that this emotion negatively predicts political action tendencies aimed at social change. In addition, we show that greater warmth and competence lead to greater admiration for an outgroup, which in turn positively predicts deferential behavior and intergroup learning. We also demonstrate that, for those with a disposition to feel admiration, increasing admiration for an outgroup decreases willingness to take political action against that outgroup. Finally, we show that when the object of admiration is a subversive “martyr,” admiration positively predicts political action tendencies and behavior aimed at challenging the status quo. These findings provide the first evidence for the important role of admiration in regulating social hierarchy."&lt;/ref&gt; or in the extreme case of [[deification]] ([[Hallel|prayer of praise]]).

==As behavioral reinforcement==
The concept of praise as a means of behavioral reinforcement is rooted in [[B.F. Skinner]]'s model of [[operant conditioning]]. Through this lens, praise has been viewed as a means of [[positive reinforcement]], wherein an observed behavior is made more likely to occur by contingently praising said behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazdin|first1=Alan|title=History of behavior modification: Experimental foundations of contemporary research|date=1978|publisher=University Park Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of praise in promoting positive behaviors, notably in the study of teacher and parent use of praise on child in promoting improved behavior and academic performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strain|first1=Phillip S.|last2=Lambert|first2=Deborah L.|last3=Kerr|first3=Mary Margaret|last4=Stagg|first4=Vaughan|last5=Lenkner|first5=Donna A.|title=Naturalistic assessment of children's compliance to teachers' requests and consequences for compliance|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1983|volume=16|issue=2|pages=243–249|doi=10.1901/jaba.1983.16-243|pmc=1307879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"/&gt; but also in the study of work performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Charles R.|last2=Anderson|first2=D.

In order for praise to effect positive behavior change, it must be contingent on the positive behavior (i.e., only administered after the targeted behavior is enacted), must specify the particulars of the behavior that is to be reinforced, and must be delivered sincerely and credibly.&lt;ref name="Brophy, 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brophy|first1=Jere|title=On praising effectively|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=1981|volume=81|issue=5|jstor=1001606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the effect of praise as a positive reinforcement strategy, numerous behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols.&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonsen|first1=Brandi|last2=Fairbanks|first2=Sarah|last3=Briesch|first3=Amy|last4=Myers|first4=Diane|last5=Sugai|first5=George|title=Evidence-based Practices in Classroom Management: Considerations for Research to Practice|journal=Education and Treatment of Children|date=2008|volume=31|issue=1|pages=351–380|doi=10.1353/etc.0.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisz &amp; Kazdin, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weisz|first1=John R.|last2=Kazdin|first2=Alan E.|title=Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents|date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008" /&gt; and parenting training interventions,&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garland|first1=Ann F.|last2=Hawley|first2=Kristin M.|last3=Brookman-Frazee|first3=Lauren|last4=Hurlburt|first4=Michael S.|title=Identifying Common Elements of Evidence-Based Psychosocial Treatments for Children's Disruptive Behavior Problems|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=May 2008|volume=47|issue=5|pages=505–514|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816765c2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and behavioral rewards.

==Effects beyond behavior change==
Although the majority of early research on the influences of praise focused on behavior implications, more recent investigations have highlighted important implications in other domains.&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DELIN|first1=CATHERINE R.|last2=BAUMEISTER|first2=ROY F.|title=Praise: More Than Just Social Reinforcement|journal=Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour|date=September 1994|volume=24|issue=3|pages=219–241|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5914.1994.tb00254.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise may have cognitive influences on an individual, by attracting attention to the self, or by conveying information about the values and expectations of the praiser to the recipient.&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt; Effective praise (i.e., praise that is welcomed or accepted by the recipient) may also have positive emotional effects by generating a positive affective state (e.g., happiness, joy, pride).&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt; Praise is also thought to convey that one has surpassed a noteworthy evaluative standard, and if the recipient of the praise is likely to experience a sense of pleasure stemming from a positive self-perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wicklund|first1=R.A.|title=Objective self-awareness. In Advances in experimental social psychology.|date=1975|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=233–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrastingly, praise may create negative emotional consequences if it appears disingenuous or manipulative.&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt;

Alternative views of the effects of praise on motivation exist. In one camp, praise is thought to decrease intrinsic motivation by increasing the presence of external control.&lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985" /&gt; However, praise has also been argued to define standards and expectations, which in turn may motivate an individual to exert effort to meet those standards.&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt; Lastly, praise may serve to influence interpersonal relations. For example, strong pressures to reciprocate praise have been found.&lt;ref name="Jones &amp; Wortman 1973"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=E.E.|last2=Wortman|first2=C.|title=Ingraktion: An attributional approach|date=1973|publisher=General Learning Press|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the mutual praise may serve to increase attraction and strengthen the interpersonal relationship,&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt; and this process may underlie the use of praise in [[ingratiation]].&lt;ref name="Jones &amp; Wortman 1973" /&gt;

==Dimensions==

===Person versus process ===
Over the past several decades, researchers have distinguished between praise that is directed at a person's general abilities and qualities (e.g., "You're such a good drawer.") and praise that is directed at the process of performance (e.g., "You are working so hard at that drawing.").&lt;ref name="Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henderlong Corpus|first1=Jennifer|last2=Lepper|first2=Mark R.|journal=Educational Psychology|date=2007|volume=27|issue=4|pages=487–508.|doi=10.1080/01443410601159852|title=The Effects of Person Versus Performance Praise on Children’s Motivation: Gender and age as moderating factors}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction between person versus process praise is sometimes referred to as ability versus effort praise, though ability and effort statements can be seen as subcategories of person and process statements, respectively.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt;

Traditionally, person(trait)-oriented praise was thought to instill a child's belief that they have the capacity to succeed, and thus help motivate them to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=D. C.|title=You child's self-esteem: The key to life|date=1975|publisher=Random House LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, social-cognitive theorists have more recently suggested that person-oriented (as opposed to process-oriented) praise may have detrimental impacts on a child's self-perceptions, motivation and learning.&lt;ref name="Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper, 2007" /&gt; For example, praising children for their personal attributes, rather than specifics about their performance, may teach them to make interferences about their global worth,&lt;ref name="Kamins &amp; Dweck, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamins|first1=Melissa L.|last2=Dweck|first2=Carol S.|title=Person versus process praise and criticism: Implications for contingent self-worth and coping|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1999|volume=35|issue=3|pages=835–847|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.3.835}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may thus undermine their intrinsic motivation. In a study of person- versus process-oriented praise, Kamins and Dweck&lt;ref name="Kamins &amp; Dweck, 1999" /&gt; found that children who received person-oriented praise displayed more "helpless" responses following a failure including self-blame, than those in the process condition. Henderlong and Lepper&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; suggest that person-oriented praise may function like tangible rewards, in that they produce desired outcomes in the short-run, but may undermine intrinsic motivation and subsequent perseverance.  However, Skipper &amp; Douglas&lt;ref name="Skipper &amp; Douglas, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skipper|first1=Yvonne|last2=Douglas|first2=Karen|title=Is no praise good praise? Effects of positive feedback on children's and university students' responses to subsequent failures|journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology|date=June 2012|volume=82|issue=2|pages=327–339|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8279.2011.02028.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that although person- versus process-oriented praise (and an objective feedback control group) predicted more negative responses to the first failure, all three groups demonstrated similarly negative responses to the second failure. Thus, the long-term negative consequences of person-oriented praise are still unclear.

Person and process (or performance) praise may also foster different attributional styles &lt;ref name="Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Claudia M.|last2=Dweck|first2=Carol S.|title=Praise for intelligence can undermine children's motivation and performance|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1998|volume=75|issue=1|pages=33–52|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.1.33|pmid=9686450}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that person-oriented praise may lead one to attribute success and failure to stable ability, which in turn may foster helplessness reactions in the face of setbacks. Contrastingly, process praise may foster attributions regarding effort or strategy, such that children attribute their success (or failure) to these variables, rather than their stable trait or ability. This attributional style can foster more adaptive reactions to both success and failure.  In support of this notion, Muller and Dweck&lt;ref name="Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998"/&gt; experimentally found praise for child intelligence to be more detrimental to 5th graders' achievement motivation than praise for effort. Following a failure, the person-praised students displayed less task persistence, task enjoyment, and displayed worse task performance than those praised for effort. These findings are in line with personal theories of achievement striving,&lt;ref name="Weiner, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiner|first1=B.|title=Integrating Social and Personal Theories of Achievement Striving|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=1 January 1994|volume=64|issue=4|pages=557–573|doi=10.3102/00346543064004557}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which in the face of failure, performance tends to improve when individuals make attributions to a lack of effort, but worsen when they attribute their failure to a lack of ability.

In the studies mentioned above, person-oriented praise was found to be less beneficial than process-oriented praise, but this is not always found to be the case. Particularly, effort-oriented praise may be detrimental when given during tasks that are exceptionally easy.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt;  This may be especially apparent for older children as they see effort and ability to be inversely related&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Covington|first1=V.|title=The self-worth theory of achievement motivation: Findings and implications|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=1984|pages=5–20.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus an overemphasis on effort may suggest a lack of ability.

===Controlling versus informational===
Proponents of [[cognitive evaluation theory]] (Deci &amp; Ryan &lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deci|first1=E. L.|last2=Ryan|first2=R. M.|title=Intrinsic motivation and self-determination in human behavior|date=1985|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York: Academic Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deci|first1=E. L.|last2=Ryan|first2=R. M.|chapter=The empirical exploration of intrinsic motivational processes|editor=L. Berkowitz|title=Advances in experimental social psychology|date=1980|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press|pages=39–80|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have focused on two aspects of praise thought to influence a child's self-determination: information and control. Taking this perspective, the informational aspect of praise is thought to promote a perceived internal [[locus of control]] (and thus greater self-determination) while the controlling aspects promote a perceived external locus of control and thus extrinsic compliance or defiance.&lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985" /&gt; Thus, Deci &amp; Ryan  &lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985" /&gt; suggest that the effect of praise is moderated by the salience of informational versus controlling aspects of praise.

The theory that informational praise enhances self-determination over controlling praise has been supported by several empirical studies. In a metanalysis including five studies distinguishing informational from controlling praise, Deci, Koestner &amp; Ryan&lt;ref name="Deci, Koestner &amp; Ryan, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=E. L.|last2=Koestner|first2=R.|last3=Ryan|first3=R. M.|title=Extrinsic Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation in Education: Reconsidered Once Again|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=1 January 2001|volume=71|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.3102/00346543071001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that informational-based praise related to greater intrinsic motivation (as measured by free-choice behavior and self-reported interest) while controlling praise was associated with less intrinsic motivation. For example, Pittman and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittman|first1=T. S.|last2=Davey|first2=M. E.|last3=Alafat|first3=K. A.|last4=Wetherill|first4=K. V.|last5=Kramer|first5=N. A.|title=Informational versus Controlling Verbal Rewards|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 June 1980|volume=6|issue=2|pages=228–233|doi=10.1177/014616728062007}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that adults demonstrated more free-choice engagement with a task after receiving informational ("e.g., "Compared to most of my subjects, you're doing really well."), rather than controlling (e.g., "I haven't been able to use most of the data I've gotten so far, but you're doing really well, and if you keep it up I'll be able to use yours.") praise.

Several complexities of informational versus controlling praise have been acknowledged.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; First, though the differences between information and controlling praise have been well-established, it is difficult to determine whether the net effects of these forms of praise will be positive, negative or neutral compared to a control condition. In addition, it is often difficult to determine the extent to which informational, controlling, or both, which may muddy interpretations of results.

===Social-comparison versus mastery ===
Social comparison is a psychological process that is widely prevalent, particularly so in educational settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=J. M.|title=Social Comparison and Education. In J.M. Levine &amp; Wang, M.C. Eds. Teacher and Student Perception: Implications for Learning|date=1983|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Hillsdale: N.J.|pages=29–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Festinger's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Festinger|first1=L.|title=A Theory of Social Comparison Processes|journal=Human Relations|date=1 May 1954|volume=7|issue=2|pages=117–140|doi=10.1177/001872675400700202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[social comparison theory]], he noted that people engage in social comparison as a means to reduce ambiguity and accurately evaluate their own qualities and abilities. However, controversy exists over whether providing children with social-comparison praise has beneficial impact on their motivation and performance.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; Some studies have demonstrated that students who received social-comparison praise (e.g., "you're doing better than most students" or "you're performance is amongst the best we've had") demonstrated greater motivation compared to no-praise or other control groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=Edward L.|title=Effects of externally mediated rewards on intrinsic motivation.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1971|volume=18|issue=1|pages=105–115|doi=10.1037/h0030644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pretty|first1=Grace H.|last2=Seligman|first2=Clive|title=Affect and the overjustification effect.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1984|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1241–1253|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.6.1241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanck|first1=Peter D.|last2=Reis|first2=Harry T.|last3=Jackson|first3=Linda|title=The effects of verbal reinforcement of intrinsic motivation for sex-linked tasks|journal=Sex Roles|date=March 1984|volume=10|issue=5–6|pages=369–386|doi=10.1007/BF00287554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarafino, Russo, Barker, Consentino and Titus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sarafino|first1=Edward P.|last2=Russo|first2=Alyce|last3=Barker|first3=Judy|last4=Consentino|first4=Annmarie|last5=Consentino|first5=Annmarie|title=The Effect of Rewards on Intrinsic Interest: Developmental Changes in the Underlying Processes|journal=The Journal of Genetic Psychology|date=September 1982|volume=141|issue=1|pages=29–39|doi=10.1080/00221325.1982.10533454}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that students who received social-comparison voluntarily engaged in the task more so than those who received feedback that they performed similar to others. Though these studies demonstrate the possible positive influence of social-comparison praise, they have been criticized for inadequate control groups.&lt;ref name="Henderlong, Ogle, Love-Geiger, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corpus|first1=Jennifer Henderlong|last2=Ogle|first2=Christin M.|last3=Love-Geiger|first3=Kelly E.|title=The Effects of Social-Comparison Versus Mastery Praise on Children's Intrinsic Motivation|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=25 August 2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=333–343|doi=10.1007/s11031-006-9039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a control group given feedback that they are average may be seen as negative, rather than neutral. In addition, most social-comparison studies do not examine motivation or behavior following a subsequent unsuccessful task.&lt;ref name="Henderlong, Ogle, Love-Geiger, 2006" /&gt;

Beyond methodology, the primary criticism to social-comparison praise is that it teaches children to evaluate themselves on the basis of the performance of others, and may therefore lead to maladaptive coping in situations in which one is outperformed by others individuals.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; Social-comparison praise has been hypothesized to decrease intrinsic motivation for the praised children because they may then view their behaviors as externally controlled.&lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985" /&gt; Contrastingly, it is suggested that praise that focused on a child's competence (mastery) rather than social comparison may be important for fostering motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohn|first1=A.|title=By All Available Means: Cameron and Pierce's Defense of Extrinsic Motivators|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=1 January 1996|volume=66|issue=1|pages=1–4|doi=10.3102/00346543066001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is relatively understudied, though some interesting findings have emerged. In a study of adults, Koestner, Zuckerman, and Olsson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koestner|first1=Richard|last2=Zuckerman|first2=Miron|last3=Olsson|first3=Jennifer|title=Attributional style, comparison focus of praise, and intrinsic motivation|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=March 1990|volume=24|issue=1|pages=87–100|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(90)90008-T}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that gender moderated the influence of social-comparison and mastery praise, where women were more intrinsically motivated following mastery praise, while men were more motivated following social-comparison praise. In a study of children, Henderlong Corpus, Ogle &amp; Love-Geiger&lt;ref name="Henderlong, Ogle, Love-Geiger, 2006" /&gt; found that social-comparison praise lead to decreased motivation following ambiguous feedback for all children, and also decreased motivation following positive feedback for girls only. Thus, mastery praise may be more conducive than social-comparison to fostering intrinsic motivation, particularly for females,&lt;ref name="Henderlong, Ogle, Love-Geiger, 2006" /&gt; though more research is needed to tease apart these relationships.

==Factors that affect influence==

===Age===

The function of praise on child performance and motivation may likely vary as a function of age. Few studies have directly examined developmental differences in praise, though some evidence has been found. Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper&lt;ref name="Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper, 2007" /&gt; found person praise (as opposed to process praise) to negatively influence motivation for older girls (4th/5th grade), while for preschool-age children, there were no differences in the effects of process, person and product praise, though all three forms of praise were associated with increased motivation as compared to neutral feedback. In a different study, Henderlong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderlong|first1=J.|title=Beneficial and detrimental effects of praise on children's motivation: Performance versus person feedback|type=Unpublished doctoral dissertation|publisher=Stanford University|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that for older children, process praise enhanced post-failure motivation more so than person praise, and person praise decreased motivation as compared to neutral feedback. Contrastingly, for preschool-age children process praise enhanced post-failure motivation more than person praise, but both were better than neutral feedback. Some posit that younger children do not experience the negative effects of certain types of praise because they do not yet make causal attributions in complex ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barker|first1=George P.|last2=Graham|first2=Sandra|title=Developmental study of praise and blame as attributional cues|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=1987|volume=79|issue=1|pages=62–66|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.79.1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are more literal in their interpretations of adult speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ackerman|first1=Brian P.|title=Young children's understanding of a speaker's intentional use of a false utterance|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1981|volume=17|issue=4|pages=472–480|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.4.472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===

The function of praise on child behavior and motivation has also found to vary as a function of child gender. Some researchers have shown that females are more susceptible to the negative effects of certain types of praise (person-oriented praise, praise that limits autonomy). For example, Koestner, Zuckerman &amp; Koestner&lt;ref name="Koestner, Zuckerman &amp; Koestner, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koestner|first1=R.|last2=Zuckerman|first2=M.|last3=Koestner|first3=J.|title=Attributional Focus of Praise and Children's Intrinsic Motivation: The Moderating Role of Gender|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 March 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1177/0146167289151006}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that girls were more negatively influenced by praise that diminished perceived autonomy. Henderlong Corpus and Lepper&lt;ref name="Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper, 2007" /&gt; found that process praise was more beneficial to motivation than person praise, but only for girls. This difference was found for older children, but not preschool-aged children.

Others have found young girls to be more negatively influenced by the evaluations of adults more generally.&lt;ref name="Carol S 1649"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dweck|first1=Carol S.|last2=Davidson|first2=William|last3=Nelson|first3=Sharon|last4=Enna|first4=Bradley|title=Sex differences in learned helplessness: II. The contingencies of evaluative feedback in the classroom and III. An experimental analysis.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1978|volume=14|issue=3|pages=268–276|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.14.3.268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have posited that this gender difference is due to girls more often attributing failure to lack of ability rather than a lack of motivation or effort.&lt;ref name="Carol S 1649"/&gt; Gender differences may be attributable to normative socialization practices, in which people generally emphasize dependence and interpersonal relationships for girls, but achievement and independence for boys.&lt;ref name="New York: Academic Press"/&gt;

===Culture===

Culture has been referred to as a "blind spot" in the praise literature.&lt;ref name="Wang, Wiley &amp; Chiu, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Y. Z.|last2=Wiley|first2=A. R.|last3=Chiu|first3=C.-Y.|title=Independence-supportive praise versus interdependence-promoting praise|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|date=1 January 2008|volume=32|issue=1|pages=13–20|doi=10.1177/0165025407084047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there is reason to believe that cultural differences in the effects of praise exist. Much of the discussion on culture and praise has focused on differences between independent and interdependent cultures (e.g.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt;). Stated briefly, independent cultures, common in Western cultures, generally value and seek to promote individualism and autonomy, while interdependent cultures promote fundamental connectedness and harmony in interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=Hazel R.|last2=Kitayama|first2=Shinobu|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation|journal=Psychological Review|date=1991|volume=98|issue=2|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking through this cultural lens, clear differences in the use and impact of praise can be found. In comparison to the United States, praise is rarely in China and Japan (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=C.

{{Main|Privacy}}
'''Privacy law''' refers to the laws that deal with the regulating, storing, and using of [[personally identifiable information]] of individuals, which can be [[Personally identifiable information (PII) gathering|collected]] by governments, public or private organizations, or other individuals.

Privacy laws are considered within the context of an individual's [[privacy]] rights or within reasonable [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Classification of privacy laws ==
Privacy laws can be broadly classified into:
* General privacy laws that have an overall bearing on the personal information of individuals and affect the policies that govern many different areas of information.
* Specific privacy laws that are designed to regulate specific types of information. Some examples include:
** Communication privacy laws
** Financial privacy laws
** Health privacy laws
** [[Information privacy law]]s
** Online privacy laws
** Privacy in one's home

== International legal standards on privacy ==

=== Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ===
[[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] created a voluntary Privacy Framework that was adopted by all 21 member economies in 2004 in an attempt to improve general information privacy and the cross-border transfer of information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2009|title=Five years of the APEC Privacy Framework: Failure or promise?|ssrn=2022907|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Report|volume=25|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Framework consists of nine Privacy Principles that act as minimum standards for privacy protection: Preventing harm, Notice, Collection limitation, Use of personal information, Choice, Integrity of personal information, Security safeguards, Access and correction, and Accountability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2011, APEC implemented the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System with the goal of balancing "the flow of information and data across borders ... essential to trust and confidence in the online marketplace."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marvin, et al.|first=Lynn M.|date=2015|title=Conducting U.S. Discovery in Asia: An Overview of E-Discovery and Asian Data Privacy Laws|url=https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&amp;context=jolt|journal=Richmond Journal of Law &amp; Technology|volume=21|pages=|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four agreed-upon rules of the System are based upon the APEC Privacy Framework and include self-assessment, compliance review, recognition/acceptance, and dispute resolution and enforcement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Council of Europe ===
Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which was drafted and adopted by the [[Council of Europe]] in 1950 and currently covers the whole European continent except for Belarus and Kosovo, protects the right to respect for private life: "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence." Through the huge case-law of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]], privacy has been defined and its protection has been established as a positive right of everyone.

The Council of Europe also addressed privacy protection in regards to the Internet in 1998 when it published "Draft Guidelines for the protection of individuals with regard to the collection and processing of personal data on the information highway, which may be incorporated in or annexed to Code of Conduct."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reidenberg|first=Joel R.|date=2000|title=Resolving Conflicting International Data Privacy Rules in Cyberspace|jstor=1229516|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=52|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council developed these guidelines in conjunction with the [[European Commission]], and they were adopted in 1999.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== European Union (EU) ===
The 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] (officially Directive 95/46/EC) recognized the authority of [[National data protection authority|National data protection authorities]] and required that all [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] adhere to universal privacy protection standards.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Member States must adopt strict privacy laws that are no more relaxed than the framework provided by the directive.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhasin|first=Madan Lal|date=2016|title=Challenge of guarding online privacy: role of privacy seals, government regulations and technological solutions|url=http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.ijfa.20120106.03.html|journal=Socio-Economic Problems &amp; the State|volume=15|pages=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Directive outlines that non-EU countries must adopt privacy legislation of equal restriction in order to be allowed to exchange personal data with EU countries. Furthermore, companies in non-EU countries must also adopt privacy standards of at least equal restriction as provided in the Directive in order to do business with companies located in EU countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Thus, the Directive has also influenced the development of privacy legislation in non-European countries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The proposed [[EPrivacy Regulation (European Union)|ePrivacy Regulation]], which would replace the [[Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002]], also contributes to EU privacy regulations.

The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] will replace the Data Protection Directive of 1995 when it takes effect on 25 May 2018. A notable contribution that will come from the General Data Protection Regulation is its recognition of a "right to be forgotten", which requires any group that collects data on individuals to delete the data related to an individual upon that individual's request.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victor|first=Jacob M.|date=November 2013|title=The EU General Data Protection Regulation: Toward a Property Regime for Protecting Data Privacy|url=https://www.jstor.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/pdf/23744289.pdf|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=123|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulation was influenced by the aforementioned European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ===
In 1980, the [[OECD]] adopted the voluntary OECD Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data in response to growing concerns about information privacy and data protection in an increasingly technological and connected world.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tene|first=Omar|date=2013|title=Privacy Law's Midlife Crisis: A Critical Assessment of the Second Wave of Global Privacy Laws|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ohslj74&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1255&amp;startid=&amp;endid=1300|journal=Ohio State Law Journal|volume=74|pages=|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD Guidelines helped establish an international standard for privacy legislation by defining the term "personal data" and outlining fair information practice principles (FIPPs) that other countries have adopted in their national privacy legislation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 2007, the OECD adopted the Recommendation on Cross-border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy. This framework is based on the OECD Guidelines and includes two cooperation based model forms to encourage the enforcement of privacy laws among member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdrecommendationoncross-borderco-operationintheenforcementoflawsprotectingprivacy.htm|title=OECD Recommendation on Cross-border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Recommendation is also notable for coining the term "Privacy Enforcement Authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2012|title=Independence of data privacy authorities (Part 1): International standards|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364911001889|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=28|pages=|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations (UN) ===
Article 17 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] of the United Nations of 1966 also protects privacy: "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."

On 18 December 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 68/167 on the right to privacy in the digital age. The resolution makes reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirms the fundamental and protected human right of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=III.V.7 UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 68/167 (ON THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE)|url=https://dx.doi.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/10.1163/2211-4394_rwilwo_COM_033375|journal=International Law &amp; World Order: Weston's &amp; Carlson's Basic Documents|doi=10.1163/2211-4394_rwilwo_com_033375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Privacy in Australian law}}
The current state of privacy law in Australia includes Federal and state information privacy legislation, some sector-specific privacy legislation at state level, regulation of the media and some criminal sanctions. The current position concerning civil causes of action for invasion of privacy is unclear: some courts have indicated that a tort of invasion of privacy may exist in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|QDC|151|2003|litigants=Grosse v Purvis |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|236|2008|litigants=Giller v Procopets |date=10 December 2008 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Doe v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCC/2007/281.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[2007]&lt;/nowiki&gt; VCC 281], County Court of Victoria&lt;/ref&gt; However this has not been upheld by the higher courts, which have been content to develop the equitable doctrine of Breach of Confidence to protect privacy, following the example set by the UK.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 2008, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended the enactment of a statutory cause of action for invasion of privacy.&lt;ref name=NZLCIP14&gt;"Invasion of privacy: penalties and remedies: review of the law of privacy: stage 3" (2009) (Issues paper 14), New Zealand Law Commission, {{ISBN|978-1-877316-67-8}}, 2009 NZIP 14 accessed 27 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahamas===
The Bahamas has an official data protection law that protects the personal information of its citizens in both the private and public sector: Data Protection Act 2003 (the Bahamas Law).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Bahamas Law appoints a data protection commissioner to the Office of Data Protection to ensure that data protection is being held. Even though there is legislation enforced in the Bahamas through the Data Protection Act 2003, the act lacks many enforcements since a data protection officer doesn't need to be in office nor does any group or organization need to notify the Office of Data Protection when a hacker has breached privacy law. Also, there are no requirements for registering databases or restricting data flow across national borders. Therefore, the legislation does not meet European Union standards, which was the goal of creating the law in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Bahamas Law. http:// laws.bahamas.gov.bs/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/ 2003/2003-0003/ DataProtectionPrivacyofPersonalInformationAct_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahamas is also a member of [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]], the Caribbean Community.

===Belize===
Belize is currently part of the minority of countries that do not have any official data privacy laws.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Greenleaf, Graham. 2015. "Global Data Privacy Laws 2015: 109 Countries, with European Laws Now a Minority"''.'' ''Privacy Laws &amp; Business International Report'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Freedom of Information Act (2000) currently protects the personal information of the citizens of Belize, but there is no current documentation that distinguishes if this act includes electronic data.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

As a consequence of the lack of official data privacy laws, there was a breach of personal data in 2009 when an employee's laptop from Belize's Vital Statistics Unit was stolen, containing birth certification information for all citizens residing in Belize. Even though the robbery was not intentionally targeting the laptop - the robber did not predict the severity of the theft - Belize was put in a vulnerable position which could have been avoided if regulations were in order.

===Brazil===
A Brazilian citizen's privacy is protected by the country's constitution, which states:

:''The intimacy, private life, honor and image of the people are inviolable, with assured right to indenization by material or moral damage resulting from its violation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil de 1988 / Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil of 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 14th, 2018 Brazil enacted a full-fledged data protection bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2015-2018/2018/Lei/L13709.htm Lei 13709 Dispõe sobre a proteção de dados pessoais e altera a Lei nº 12.965, de 23 de abril de 2014 (Marco Civil da Internet) / Law 13709 Provides for the protection of personal data and amends Law no. 12.965, of April 23, 2014 ([[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet]])]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill has 65 articles and has many similarities to the GDPR. The first translation into English of the new data protection law was published by [[Ronaldo Lemos]], a Brazilian lawyer specialized in technology, on that same date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pnm.adv.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Brazilian-General-Data-Protection-Law.pdf Translation of Brazil's Data Protection Law by Ronaldo Lemos]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Canadian privacy law}}
In Canada, the federal ''[[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]]'' (PIPEDA) governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in connection with commercial activities and personal information about employees of federal works, undertakings and businesses. It generally does not apply to non-commercial organizations or provincial governments. Personal information collected, used and disclosed by the federal government and many crown corporations is governed by the ''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]''. Many provinces have enacted similar provincial legislation such as the Ontario ''Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act'' which applies to public bodies in that province.

There remains some debate whether there exists a common law tort for breach of privacy. There have been a number of cases identifying a common law right to privacy but the requirements have not been articulated.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Somwar v. McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd'', [2006] O.J. No. 64 for a discussion on this&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Eastmond v. Canadian Pacific Railway &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Canada''&lt;ref name=Eastmond&gt;''Eastmond v. Canadian western Railway &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Canada'', 11 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's Supreme Court found that CP could collect Eastmond's personal information without his knowledge or consent because it benefited from the exemption in paragraph 7(1)(b) of [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act|PIPEDA]], which provides that personal information can be collected without consent if "it is reasonable to expect that the collection with the knowledge or consent of the individual would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement".&lt;ref name=Eastmond /&gt;

===China===
Computer Processed Personal Information Protection Act was enacted in 1995 in order to protect personal information processed by computers. The general provision specified the purpose of the law, defined crucial terms, prohibited individuals from waiving certain rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kobsa|first=Alfred|title=Tailoring Privacy to Users’ Needs 1|date=2001|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44566-8_52|work=User Modeling 2001|pages=301–313|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/3-540-44566-8_52|isbn=9783540423256|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fijian Government — Department of Information. Retrieved 1 May 2017. {{cite web |url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/getattachment/8e981ca2-1757-4e27-88e0-f87e3b3b844e/Click-here-to-download-the-Fiji-Constitution.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206063023/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/getattachment/8e981ca2-1757-4e27-88e0-f87e3b3b844e/Click-here-to-download-the-Fiji-Constitution.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its constitution, the people inhabiting the land are granted the right to [[privacy]]. The exact workings from the constitution is the following: "Every person has the right to personal privacy, which includes the right to&amp;nbsp;— (a) [[confidentiality]] of their personal information; (b) confidentiality of their communications; and (c) respect for their private and family life".&lt;ref name="fiji.gov.fj" /&gt; But in this very same constitution, it is expressed that it is possible "to the extent that it is necessary" for a law to be passed that limits or impacts the execution of the right to privacy law. Another privacy related law can be seen in section 54 of the Telecommunications Promulgation passed in 2008, which states that "any service provider supplying telecommunications to consumers must keep information about consumers confidential".&lt;ref&gt;"Telecommunications Promulgation 2008" Telecommunications Authority of Fiji.

This is in regards to (but not limited to) information collected during bookings, the use of one technology of another that belongs to said company or through the use of a [[Service (business)|service]] of the company, or when making [[payment]]s. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, the Fiji is bound by the universal declaration of Human Rights which states in article two "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks".&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;"Universal Declaration of Human Rights." The United Nations.

===France===
France adopted a data privacy law in 1978. It applies to public and private organizations and forbids gathering sensitive data about physical persons (sexuality, ethnic, political or religious opinions&amp;nbsp;...). The law is administered by the [[Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés]] (CNIL), a dedicated national administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/france.php|title=Online Privacy Law: France {{!}} Law Library of Congress|last=|first=|date=2016-06-05|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|others=Atwill, Nicole|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123115319/http://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/france.php|archive-date=2014-11-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany is known to be one of the first countries (in 1970) with the strictest and most detailed data privacy laws in the world. The citizens' right to protection is stated in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Constitution of Germany]], in Art. 2 para. 1, and Art. 1 para. 1.&lt;ref&gt;Tschentscher, Axel, The Basic Law (Grundgesetz) 2016: The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany (23 May 1949) — Introduction and Translation (Fourth Edition) (6 July 2016). {{SSRN|1501131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citizens' data of Germany is mainly protected under the [[Bundesdatenschutzgesetz|Federal Data Protection Act]] (1977) from corporations, which has been amended the most recently in 2009. This act specifically targets all businesses that collect information for its use. The major regulation protects the data within the private and personal sector, and as a member of the European Union (EU), Germany has additionally ratified its act, convention, and additional protocol with the EU according to the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.

In Germany, there are two kinds of restrictions on a transfer of personal data. Since Germany is part of the EU Member States, the transfer of personal data of its citizens to a nation outside the EEA is always subject to a decent level of data protection in the offshore country. Secondly, according to German data policy rules, any transfer of personal data outside the EEA symbolizes a connection to a third party which requires a reason. That reason may be for emergency reasons and a provision must be met with consent by the receiver and the subject of the data. Keep in mind that in Germany, data transfers within a group of companies are subject to same treatment as transfer to third-parties if the location is outside the EEA.

Specifically the Federal Data Protection Commission is in charge of regulating the entirety of the enforcement of data privacy regulations for Germany. In addition, Germany is part of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Western Hemisphere Data Protection Laws. 2012. U.S. Department of Commerce. http://web.ita.doc.gov/ITI/itiHome.nsf/9b2cb14bda00318585256cc40068ca69/a54f62c93fd1572985257623006e32d5/$FILE/Western%20Hemisphere%20Data%20Protection%20Laws%205-12%20final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Data Protection Commission of Ireland is a member of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, European Data Protection Authorities, the EU Article 29 Working Party, and the [[Global Privacy Enforcement Network]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Regarding the protection of children, Germany is potentially the first nation that has played an active role in banning the share of data within toys connected to Wifi and the Internet, like for instance, "My Friend Cayla". The group in charge of protecting the data of children is the Federal Network Agency (the Bundessnetzagentur).&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Donell|date=16 August 2016|title=The Internet of Toys|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22041451.2016.1266124?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Communication Research and Practice|volume=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
During the military dictatorship era the 57 AK law prohibited taking photos of people without their permission but the law has since been superseded. The 2472/1997 law protects personal data of citizens but consent for taking photos of people is not required as long as they aren't used commercially or are used only for personal archiving ("οικιακή χρήση" / "home use"), for publication in editorial, educational, cultural, scientific or news publications, and for fine art purposes (e.g. [[street photography]] which has been uphold as legal by the courts whether done by professional or amateur photographers). However, photographing people or collecting their personal data for commercial (advertising) purposes requires their consent. The law gives photographers the right to commercially use photos of people who have not consented to the use of the images in which they appear if the depicted people have either been paid for the photo session as models (so there is no separation between editorial and commercial models in Greek law) or they have paid the photographer for obtaining the photo (this, for example, gives the right to wedding photographers to advertise their work using their photos of newly-wed couples they photographed in a professional capacity). In Greece the right to take photographs and publish them or sell licensing rights over them as fine art or editorial content is protected by the [[Constitution of Greece]] (Article 14&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/Vouli-ton-Ellinon/To-Politevma/Syntagma/article-14/ Article 14 of the Constitution of Hellas]&lt;/ref&gt; and other articles) and free speech laws as well as by [[Precedent|case law]] and legal cases. Photographing the police or children and publishing the photographs in a non-commercial capacity is also legal.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the law governing the protection of personal data is principally found in the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) which came into force on 20 December 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/B4DF8B4125C4214D482575EF000EC5FF/$FILE/CAP_486_e_b5.pdf Hong Kong Ordinances — Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap.486)]&lt;/ref&gt; Various amendments were made to enhance the protection of personal data privacy of individuals through the Personal Data (Privacy) (Amendment) Ordinance 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/pdf/20121627/es12012162718.pdf Hong Kong Government Gazette Ord No.18 of 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of personal data protected include names, phone numbers, addresses, identity card numbers, photos, medical records and employment records. As Hong Kong remains a common law jurisdiction, judicial cases are also a source of privacy law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/legal/ Hong Kong Department of Justice — Legal System in Hong Kong]&lt;/ref&gt; The power of enforcement is vested with the Privacy Commissioner (the "Commissioner") for Personal Data. Non-compliance with data protection principles set out in the ordinances does not constitute a criminal offense directly. The Commissioner may serve an enforcement notice to direct the data user to remedy the contravention and/or instigate the prosecution action. Contravention of an enforcement notice may result in a fine and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/data_privacy_law/ordinance_at_a_Glance/ordinance.html The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The Right to Privacy is a [[fundamental rights in India|fundamental right]] and an intrinsic part of Article 21 that protects life and liberty of the citizens and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. In June 2011, India passed a new privacy package that included various new rules that apply to companies and consumers. A key aspect of the new rules requires that any organization that processes personal information must obtain written consent from the data subjects before undertaking certain activities. Application of the rule is still uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941494 Regulation of the Cloud in India], Ryan, Falvey &amp; Merchant, Journal of Internet Law, Vol 15, No. 4 (October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The Aadhar Card privacy issue became controversial when the case reached the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/nation/2017/07/19/supreme-court-right-to-privacy-fundamental-right.html Aadhaar Card Privacy issue]&lt;/ref&gt;.

On August 24, 2017, a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court in [[Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors.]] unanimously held that the right to privacy is an intrinsic part of right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://previewtech.net/data-privacy-it-act-spdi-rules/ Data Privacy Regime in India: IT Act and SPDI Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the [[Information Technology Act, 2000#The Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008|Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008]] made changes to the [[Information Technology Act, 2000]] and added the following two sections relating to Privacy:

===Ireland===
The island of Ireland is under the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act 1988]] and amended by the Data Protection Act 2003 along with the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC, which regulates the utilization of personal data. [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act 1988]] along with 2003 is known as the DPA and protects data within the private and personal sector. The DPA ensures that when data is transported, the location must be safe and in acknowledgement of the legislation to maintain [[Information privacy|data privacy]]When collecting and processing data, some of the requirements are listed below:
* the subject of personal data must have given [[consent]]
* the data is in the subject's interest
* the reason for the processing of data is for a contract
* the reason for the processing of data is the prevention of injury
Specifically the [[Data Protection Commissioner]] oversees the entirety of the enforcement of data privacy regulations for Ireland. All persons that collect and process data must register with the Data Protection Commissioner unless they are exempt (non-profit organizations etc.) and renew their registration annually.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

;Electronic Privacy Protection
Considering the protection of internet property and online data, the ePrivacy Regulations 2011 protects the communications and higher-advanced technical property and data such as social media and the telephone.

In relation to international data privacy law that Ireland is involved in, the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 Section 51 extensively states the relationship between data security between the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kuner, Christopher. 2007.

The Act on the Protection of Personal Information was fully enacted in 2005 to protect the rights and interests of individuals while taking consideration of the usefulness of personal information. The law applies to business operators that hold the personal information of 5,000 or more individuals.

=== Kenya ===
Kenya at the moment does not have a strong general privacy protection law for its constituents. But in chapter 4&amp;nbsp;— The Bill of Rights and in the second part which is titled "Rights and Fundamental Freedoms," of the [[Constitution of Kenya|consitiution]] privacy is allocated its own section. There we see that the [[Government of Kenya|Kenyan government]] express that all its people have the right to privacy, "...&amp;nbsp;which includes the right not to have&amp;nbsp;— (a) their person, home or property searched; (b) their possessions seized; (c) information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed, or (d) the privacy of their communications infringed".&lt;ref&gt;Laws of Kenya.

This act also goes as far as protecting data for Kenyans especially for the use of fraud and other ill manners. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, Kenya is bound by [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|the universal declaration of Human Rights]] which states in article two "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation.

=== Malaysia ===
After their independence from Great Britain in 1957, Malaysia's existing legal system was based primarily on English common law.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Mathews|date=2004|title=Is Malaysia's MyKad the "one card to rule them all"?

In June 2010, the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Malaysian Parliament]] passed the Personal Data Protection Act 2010, and it came into effect in 2013.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;Anon. 2017. "Global Data Privacy Directory". Norton Rose Fulbright.

On 5 July 2010, Mexico enacted a new privacy package focused on treatment of personal data by private entities. The key elements included were:
* Requirement of all private entities who gather personal data to publish their privacy policy in accordance to the law.
* Set fines for up to $16,000,000 MXN in case of violation of the law.
* Set prison penalties to serious violations.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the Privacy Act 1993 sets out principles in relation to the collection, use, disclosure, security and access to personal information.

The introduction into the New Zealand common law of a tort covering invasion of personal privacy at least by public disclosure of private facts was at issue in ''Hosking v Runting'' and was accepted by the Court of Appeal. In ''Rogers v TVNZ Ltd'' the Supreme Court indicated it had some misgivings with how the tort was introduced, but chose not to interfere with it at that stage.

Complaints about privacy are considered by the [http://www.privacy.org.nz ''Privacy Commissioner'']

===Nigeria===
Federal Republic of Nigeria's constitution offers its constituents the right to [[privacy]] as well as privacy protection. The following can be found in the constitution pertaining to this: "The privacy of citizens, their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations and telegraphic communications is hereby guaranteed and protected".&lt;ref&gt;"Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999." Nigeria-Law. Retrieved 13 April 2017. http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, Nigeria is bound by the universal declaration of Human Rights which states in article twelve "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks".&lt;ref name="un.org" /&gt; Nigeria is one of the few African countries that is building on the privacy laws. This is evident in the fact that Nine years later in the year 2008, the [[Computer security|Cybersecurity]] and Information Protection Agency Bill was passed. This bill is responsible for the creation of the Cybersecurity and Information Protection Agency.&lt;ref name="Anon 2017" /&gt; This agency is tasked with the job of preventing [[cyberattack]]s and regulating the Nigerian information technology industry.&lt;ref name="Anon 2017" /&gt; Additional laws have been passed that are meant to prevent the disclosure of information without permission and the intercepting of some form of transaction with or without evil intent.

=== Philippines ===
In Article III, Section 3, paragraph 1 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution of the Philippines]] lets its audience know that "The privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable except upon lawful order of the court, or when public safety or order requires otherwise as prescribed by law".&lt;ref&gt;"Article III, Bill of Rights.

In the year 2012, the Philippines passed the Republic Act No. 10173, also known as the "Data Privacy Act of 2012". &lt;ref&gt;"Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines." http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2012/08/15/republic-act-no-10173/&lt;/ref&gt; This act extended [[privacy]] regulations and laws to apply to more than just individual industries. This act also offered protection of data belonging to the people regardless of where it is stored, be it in private spheres or not. In that very same year, the cybercrime prevention law was passed. This law was "intended to protect and safeguard the integrity of computer and [[communications system]]s" and prevent them from being misused.&lt;ref name="nortonrosefulbright.com" /&gt; Not only does the Philippines have these laws, but it has also set aside agents that are tasked with regulating these privacy rules and due ensure the punishment of the violators. Additionally, with the constitution, previous laws that have been passed but that are in violation of the laws above have been said to be void and nullified. Another way this country has shown their dedication in executing this law is extending it to the government sphere as well. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, the Philippines is bound by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] which states in article two "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks".&lt;ref name="un.org" /&gt;

=== Singapore ===
Singapore, like other Commonwealth jurisdictions, relies primarily on common law, and the law of confidence is employed for privacy protection cases.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chesterman|first=Simon|date=2012|title=After Privacy: the Rise of Facebook, the Fall of Wikileaks, and Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012|ssrn=2255274|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|volume=|pages=391–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, privacy can be protected indirectly through various common law torts: defamation, trespass, nuisance, negligence, and breach of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandran|first=Ravi|date=2000|title=Privacy in Employment|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/24868246|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|volume=2000|pages=263–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, however, the Singaporean government decided that the common law approach was inadequate for their emerging globalized technological economy.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thus, the National Internet Advisory Committee published the Model Data Protection Code for the Private Sector, which set standards for personal data protection and was influenced by the EU Data Protection Directive and the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In the private sector, businesses can still choose to adopt the Model Code, but in 2005 Parliament decided that Singapore needed a more comprehensive legislative privacy framework.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

In January 2013, Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012 came into effect in three separate but related phases.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The phases continued through July 2014 and dealt with the creation of the Personal Data Protection Commission, the national Do Not Call Registry, and general data protection Rules.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Act's general purpose "is to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations" while acknowledging the individual's right to control their personal data and the organizations' legal needs to collect this data.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It imposes eight obligations on those organizations that use personal data: consent, purpose limitation, notification, access, correction, accuracy, protection/security, and retention.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Act prohibits transfer of personal data to countries with privacy protection standards that are lower than those outlined in the general data protection rules.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The Personal Data Protection Commission is responsible for enforcing the Act, which is based primarily on a complaints-based system.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The punishments for violating the Act can include being ordered by the Commission to stop collecting and using personal data, to destroy the data, or to pay a penalty of up to $1 million.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Singapore has also passed various sector-specific statutes that more indirectly deal with privacy and personal information, including:
* Banking Act
* Statistics Act
* [[Official Secrets Act]]
* Statutory Bodies and Government Companies Act&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;
* [[Central Provident Fund]] Act
* Telecommunications Act&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are also more specific acts for electronically stored information:
* Spam Control Act 2007
* Electronic Transactions Act
* National Computer Board Act
* Computer Misuse Act&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] of South Africa guarantees the most general right to privacy for all its citizens. This provides the main protection for [[Personally identifiable information|personal data]] privacy so far.

The Protection of Personal Act 2013 (POPI) was signed into act, focusing on data privacy and is inspired by other foreign national treaties like the United Kingdom. Minimum requirements are presented in POPI for the act of processing personal data, like the fact that the data subject must provide consent and that the data will be beneficial, and POPI will be harsher when related to cross-border international data transfers, specifically with personal information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, POPI won't be in full effective until an estimated date of 2018 as it is still being deliberated by the [[National Council of Provinces]].

The recording of conversations over phone and internet is not allowed without the permission of both parties with the [[Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-related Information Act, 2002|Regulation of Interception of Communications]] and [[Provision of Communications Related Act]] (2002).

The [[Data Act (Sweden)|Data Act]] is the world's first national data protection law and was enacted in Sweden on 11 May 1973.&lt;ref name=impl&gt;{{cite web|last1=Öman|first1=Sören|title=Implementing Data Protection in Law|url=http://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/47-18.pdf|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Colin J.|title=Regulating Privacy: Data Protection and Public Policy in Europe and the United States|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801480108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D17pcdORb9UC&amp;pg=PA63|access-date=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Privacy Law: Sweden|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/sweden.php|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=Law Library of Congress|access-date=10 May 2017|language=en|date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was then superseded on 24 October 1998 by the Personal Data Act (Sw.

===Switzerland===
The main legislation over personal data privacy for the personal and private sector in Switzerland is the [[Swiss Federal Protection Act,]] specifically the Data Protection Act, a specific section under the Swiss Federal Protection Act. The Data Protection Act has been enacted since 1992 and is in charge of measuring the consent of sharing of personal data, along with other legislation like the Telecommunication Act and the Unfair Competition Act. The Act generally guides on how to collect, process, store, data, use, disclose, and destruct data. The Data Inspection Board is in charge of overseeing data breaches and privacy enforcement.

Personal data must be protected against illegal use by "being processed in good faith and must be proportionate".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, the reason for the transfer of personal data must be known by the time of data transfer. Data not associated with people (not personal data) is not protected by the Data Protection Act.

In the case of data transfer to unsafe data protection countries, these are the major regulations required by the Data Protection Act:
* Need of direct channels for data transfer
* Individual case must have consent from receivers of data
* Disclosure is accessible to public

Switzerland is a white-listed country, meaning that it is a nation that has proper levels of data protection under the surveillance by the [[European Commission]] (EU Commission). Switzerland is not under the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf, Graham. 2015. "Global Data Privacy Laws 2015: 109 Countries, with European Laws Now a Minority"''.'' ''Privacy Laws &amp; Business International Report.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the data protection regulations are sufficient enough under European Union (EU) regulations without being a member of the EU.

In addition, Switzerland is part of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The Data Inspection Board of Switzerland is a member of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, European Data Protection Authorities, the EU Article 29 Working Party, and the Nordic Data Protection Authorities.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Republic of China ===
The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the Republic of China Constitution, but it can be protected indirectly through [[judicial interpretation]]. For example, article 12 of the Constitution states "the people shall have freedom of confidentiality of correspondence" while article 10 states "the people shall have freedom of residence and of change of residence."&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt; Along with several other articles that assert the Constitution's protection of freedoms and rights of the people, the Grand Justices are able to decide how privacy protection fits into the legal system.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peng|first=Shin-Yi|date=2003|title=Privacy and the Construction of Legal Meaning in Taiwan|jstor=40707869|journal=The International Lawyer|volume=37|pages=1037–1054}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justices first made reference to privacy being a protected right in the 1992 "Interpretation of Council of Grand Justices No. 293 on Disputes Concerning Debtors' Rights," but it was not directly or explicitly declared to be a right.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

In 1995, Taiwan passed the Computer-Processed Personal Data Protection Act which was influenced by the OECD Guidelines and enforced by each separate Ministry depending on their industry sector responsibility.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2012|title=Independence of data privacy authorities (Part 2): Asia-Pacific experience|ssrn=1971627|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=28|pages=121–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only protected personal information managed by government agencies and certain industries.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2010, Taiwan enacted the Personal Data Protection Act that laid out more comprehensive guidelines for the public and private sectors and was still enforced by individual Ministries.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In the 2010 Act, personal data is protected and defined as any "data which is sufficient to, directly or indirectly, identify that person", and includes data such as name, date of birth, fingerprints, occupation, medical records, and financial status, among many others.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

A few other administrative laws also deal with communication-specific personal privacy protection:
* Telecommunications Act
* Communications Protection and Surveillance Act

Additionally, chapter 28 of the [[Law of Taiwan|Criminal Code]] outlines punishments for privacy violations in article 315, sections 315-1 and 315-2. The sections primarily address issues of search and seizure and criminal punishment for wrongful invasion of privacy.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

Finally, articles 18(I),184(I), and 195(I) of the Taiwanese [[s:Portal:Law of the Republic of China|Civil Code]] address the "personality right" to privacy and the right to compensation when one injures the "rights" of another, such as when someone uses another's name illegally.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

=== Thailand ===
Thailand's unique history of being an authoritarian buffer state during the Cold War and being under the constant threat of a [[coup d'état]] means that privacy laws have so far been limited in order to preserve national security and public safety.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramasoota|first=Pirongrong, et al.|date=2014|title=Online Privacy in Thailand: Public and Strategic Awareness|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jlinfos23&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|journal=Journal of Law, Information &amp; Science|volume=23|pages=97–136|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand uses bureaucratic surveillance to maintain national security and public safety, which explains the 1991 Civil Registration Act that was passed to protect personal data in computerized record-keeping and data-processing done by the government.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The legislature passed the Official Information Act 1997 to provide basic data protection by limiting personal data collection and retention in the public sector.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; It defines personal information in a national context in relation to state agencies.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Two communication technology related laws, the Electronic Transactions Act 2001 and the Computer Crime Act 2007, provide some data privacy protection and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Nevertheless, Thailand still lacks legislation that explicitly addresses privacy security.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Thus, with the need for a more general and all-encompassing data protection law, the legislature proposed the Personal Data Protection Bill in 2013, which is heavily influenced by the OECD Guidelines and the EU Directive.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The draft law is still under evaluation and its enactment date is not yet finalized.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Privacy in English law}}
As a member of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the United Kingdom adheres to [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], which guarantees a "right to respect for privacy and family life" from state parties, subject to restrictions as prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society towards a legitimate aim.

However, there is no independent tort law doctrine which recognises a right to privacy. This has been confirmed on a number of occasions.
* ''[[Kaye v Robertson]]''
* ''[[Wainwright v Home Office]]''

===United States===
{{Main|Privacy laws of the United States}}
The right to privacy is not explicitly stated anywhere in the Bill of Rights.
The idea of a right to privacy was first addressed within a legal context in the United States. [[Louis Brandeis]] (later a Supreme Court justice) and another young lawyer, [[Samuel D. Warren]], published an article called "The Right to Privacy" in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1890 arguing that the [[United States Constitution]] and [[common law]] allowed for the deduction of a general "right to privacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 | title = The Right to Privacy| author = Warren and Brandeis | journal = Harvard Law Review | volume = IV | date = 15 December 1890 | issue = 5 | page = 193 | doi=10.2307/1321160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their project was never entirely successful, and the renowned tort expert and Dean of the College of Law at University of California, Berkeley, [[William Lloyd Prosser]] argued that "privacy" was composed of four separate torts, the only unifying element of which was a (vague) "right to be left alone".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lloyd Prosser]], "Privacy" (1960) 48 ''[[California Law Review]]'', 383&lt;/ref&gt; The four torts were:
* Appropriating the plaintiff's identity for the defendant's benefit
* Placing the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye
* Publicly disclosing private facts about the plaintiff
* Unreasonably intruding upon the seclusion or solitude of the plaintiff
One of the central privacy policies concerning minors is the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA), which requires children under the age of thirteen to gain parental consent before putting any personal information online.&lt;ref&gt;BOYD, danah et al. [http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3850/3075 Why parents help their children lie to Facebook about age: Unintended consequences of the 'Children's Online Privacy Protection Act'].&amp;nbsp;'''First Monday''', [S.l.], oct. 2011. {{ISSN|1396-0466}}. {{doi|10.5210/fm.v16i11.3850}}.

===Uzbekistan===
Though the right to privacy exists in several regulations, the most effective privacy protections come in the form of constitutional articles of Uzbekistan. Varying aspects of the right to privacy are protected in different ways by different situations.{{Vague|date=March 2016}}

=== Vietnam ===
Vietnam, lacking a general data protection law, relies on Civil Code regulations relating to personal data protection. Specifically, the Code "protects information relating to the private life of a person."&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The 2006 Law on Information Technology protects personal information, such as name, profession, phone number, and email address, and declares that organizations may only use this information for a "proper purpose". The legislation, however, does not define what qualifies as proper.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The 2005 Law on Electronic Transactions protects personal information during electronic transactions by prohibiting organizations and individuals from disclosing "part or all of information related to private and personal affairs ... without prior agreement."&lt;ref&gt;The National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. (2005). "Legislature XI, Session 8: Law on E-Transactions." https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/vnm_e/WTACCVNM43_LEG_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights provides further protection for consumer information, but it does not define the scope of that information or create a data protection authority; additionally, it is only applicable in the private sector.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

In 2015, the Vietnam legislature introduced the Law on Information Security, which ensures better information safety and protection online and in user's computer software. It took effect on 1 July 2016 and is Vietnam's first overarching data protection legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treutler, et al.|first=Thomas J.|date=March 2016|title=Legal Update: New Regulations in the ICT Sector in Vietnam|url=http://www.tilleke.com/sites/default/files/2016_Mar_New_Regulations_ICT_Sector_Vietnam.pdf|journal=Tilleke &amp; Gibbins|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychical nomadism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] term that refers to the practice of taking as one needs from any moral, religious, political, ethical, or whatever system, and leaving behind the parts of that system found to be unappealing. 

It is one of the main characteristics of the [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]] by [[Hakim Bey]], but the notion was previously discussed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''Nomadology and the War Machine'',  by [[Jean-François Lyotard]] in ''Driftworks'' and by various authors in the "Oasis" issue of ''Semiotext(e)''.

Psychic nomadism facilitates the construction of ad hoc reference frames in which to situate the temporary actions required by [[Temporary Autonomous Zone|TAZ]].

Bey in his essay explains why he chose the name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"We use the term "psychic nomadism" here rather than "urban nomadism," "nomadology," "driftwork," etc., simply in order to garner all these concepts into a single loose complex, to be studied in light of the coming- into-being of the TAZ."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He states that there is a paradox where our modern society’s false unity blurs all [[cultural diversity]] and any place is as good as another.

Bey describes psychic nomadism's tactical qualities along with Deleuze and Guattari's sensibilities about the war machine:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“These nomads practice the razzia, they are corsairs, they are viruses; they have both need and desire for TAZs, camps of black tents under the desert stars, interzones, hidden fortified oases along secret caravan routes, 'liberated' bits of jungle and bad-land, no-go areas, black markets, and underground bazaars.”''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bey also discusses these nomads in terms of [[the Internet]] and [[cyberspace]]. His poetry foreshadows ideas that appear in CAE’s ''[http://www.critical-art.net/books/ted/ The Electronic Disturbance]'' and later in [[electronic civil disobedience]]. With the words “cyberspace” and “hallucination” used interchangeably, we can see [[William Gibson]]'s [[cyberpunk]] novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984) being combined with Deleuze and Guattari.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“These nomads chart their course by strange stars, which might be luminous clusters of data in cyberspace, or perhaps hallucinations. Lay down a map of the land; over that, set a map of political change; over that, a map of the Net, especially the counter-Net with its emphasis on clandestine information-flow and logisitics - and finally, over all, the 1:1 map of the creative imagination, aesthetics, values. The resultant grid comes to life, animated by unexpected eddies and surges of energy, coagulations of light, secret tunnels, and surprises.”''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29099">{{short description|Using something again for the same or different purpose}}
[[File:Interior Jacobsen House Bathroom Earthship 2009.JPG|right|thumb|300px| An interior bathroom wall that incorporates repurposed clear glass bottles into a [[bottle wall]]]]
'''Reuse''' is the action or practice of using something again, whether for its original purpose (conventional reuse) or to fulfil a different function ([[creative reuse]] or [[repurposing]]). It should be distinguished from [[recycling]], which is the breaking down of used items to make [[raw material]]s for the manufacture of new products. Reuse – by taking, but not reprocessing, previously used items – helps save time, money, energy and resources. In broader economic terms, it can make quality products available to people and organizations with limited means, while generating jobs and business activity that contribute to the economy.

Historically, financial motivation was one of the main drivers of reuse. In the developing world this driver can lead to very high levels of reuse, however rising wages and consequent consumer demand for the convenience of [[disposable]] products has made the reuse of low value items such as packaging uneconomic in richer countries, leading to the demise of many reuse programs. Current environmental awareness is gradually changing attitudes and regulations, such as the new packaging regulations, are gradually beginning to reverse the situation.

One example of conventional reuse is the doorstep delivery of [[milk]] in refillable [[bottle]]s; other examples include the [[Retread|retreading of tires]] and the use of returnable/reusable plastic boxes, [[shipping container]]s, instead of single-use [[corrugated fiberboard]] boxes.

== Advantages and disadvantages==
[[File:Kadina-Ants-run-on-the-rails-0678.jpg|thumb|[[Ant]]s, being social insects, have been able to reuse rail tracks abandoned by humans for their own transportation. ([[Kadina, South Australia]])]]

Reuse has certain potential advantages:

* Energy and raw materials savings as replacing many single use products with one reusable one reduces the number that need to be manufactured.
* Reduced disposal needs and costs.
* [[Remanufacturing|Refurbishment]] can bring sophisticated, sustainable, well paid jobs to underdeveloped economies.
* Cost savings for business and consumers as a reusable product is often cheaper than the many single use products it replaces.
* Some older items were better handcrafted and appreciate in value.

Disadvantages are also apparent:

* Reuse often requires cleaning or transport, which have environmental costs.
* Some items, such as [[freon]] appliances, infant auto seats, older tube TVs and secondhand automobiles could be hazardous or less energy efficient as they continue to be used.
* Reusable products need to be more durable than single-use products, and hence require more material per item. This is particularly significant if only a small proportion of the reusable products are in fact reused.
* Sorting and preparing items for reuse takes time, which is inconvenient for consumers and costs money for businesses.
* Special skills are required to tweak the functional throughput of items when devoting them to new uses outside of their original purpose.
* Knowing the standards that legacy products conform to is required for knowing what adapters to buy for newer products to be compatible with them, even though the cost of adapters for such applications is a minor disadvantage.
* Being a rather minor disadvantage, metal that is repurposed later on can sometimes contain rust, seeing as it sometimes ages before reuse.

==Examples==

===Reuse centers and virtual exchange===

These services facilitate the transaction and redistribution of unwanted, yet perfectly usable, materials and equipment from one entity to another. The entities that benefit from either side of this service (as donors, sellers, recipients, or buyers) can be businesses, nonprofits, schools, community groups, and individuals. Some maintain a physical space (a reuse center), and others act as a matching service (a virtual exchange). Reuse centers generally maintain both warehouses and trucks. They take possession of the donated materials and make them available for redistribution or sale. Virtual exchanges do not have physical space or trucks, but instead allow users to post listings of materials available and wanted (for free or at low cost) on an online materials exchange website. Staff will help facilitate the exchange of these materials without ever taking possession of the materials.

Consumer resources exist for exchanging usable materials, such as [[freecycling]] sites which are often grassroots and entirely nonprofit movements of people who are giving (and getting) stuff for free in their own towns. It's all about reuse and keeping good stuff out of landfills. Membership is normally free. In, addition, there are directory-based resources such as RecycleChicken.com which point consumers to local and national locations for reuse and repurposing of materials not normally accepted in [[recycling]] programs.

With technological innovations, new applications and shorter product lifetimes there is an ever-increasing quantity of waste electrical and electronic equipment. The environmental pressures associated with this are well documented and include material and energy losses and an increase in air, water and land pollution from waste treatment methods. The incorrect disposal and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment also poses threats to human health, particularly when involving illegal exports.

'''Addressing issues of repair, reuse and recycling'''

One way to address this is to increase product longevity; either by extending a product’s first life or addressing issues of repair, reuse and recycling. Reusing products, and therefore extending the use of that item beyond the point where it is discarded by its first user is preferable to recycling or disposal, as this is the least energy intensive solution, although it is often overlooked.

The EU Circular Economy Package recognises the importance of extending product lifetimes and includes repair and reuse of products in its action plan to ensure products reach their optimum lifespan. If targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are to be reached, then reuse needs to be included as part of a whole life cycle approach.

A strong second hand market-place exists, with charity shops on most high streets, car boot(trunk) sales and online auction sites maintaining popularity and regular TV shows featuring both buying and selling at auction.

Inadequate repair infrastructure

However, the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment products remains low due to inadequate infrastructure, lack of repair networks and products. Local authority collection systems are better suited for handling waste than handling goods and preserving reuse potential. Retailer delivery staff are trained to handle goods carefully.

So, do we need a radical rethink on how we move unwanted, still usable items to the second-hand market place? Is there a case for changing our approach to producer responsibility and insisting that producers finance collection for reuse, and additionally, drive consumer choices for reuse, repair and remanufacture; whilst addressing the costs of recycling and disposal?

There are opportunities for producers, waste management companies and local authorities to make both repair and reuse habitual, whilst these require changes to householder behaviour change through raising awareness, they also require investment in infrastructure and logistical operations. Is it time to insist that more products are designed to have longer lifetimes? That they can be disassembled, repaired and reused before being recycled?

Business models providing opportunities

This would not necessarily be a poor strategy for businesses, there are business models that provide opportunities to retain ownership of valuable products and components through leasing, servicing, repair and re-sale.

While it is choices made by consumers that will ultimately determine the success of such ventures, there is huge potential for the reuse of goods and materials to deliver social and economic and environmental benefits. The EU Circular Economy Package, the Scottish Circular Economy Strategy and the national reuse target set by the Spanish Government are examples of governments recognising that second-hand goods should be a good value mainstream option and are working towards making reuse easier for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=COLE, C., COOPER, T. and GNANAPRAGASAM, A.,|title=Extending product lifetimes through WEEE reuse and repair: opportunities and challenges in the UK.|date=2016|issue=Electronics Goes Green 2016+ Conference, Berlin, Germany, 7–9 September 2016.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In environmental terms, reuse ought to be more common than recycling and [[energy recovery]], with both the financial and environmental costs of simple refurbishment of some products being a fraction of original manufacturing costs. If we are going to be serious about living in a Circular Economy we need to recognise the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer, slow down the use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused and materials are recycled rather than landfilled.

===Remanufacturing===
{{Main|Remanufacturing}}
The most involved reuse organizations are "repair and overhaul" industries which take valuable parts, such as [[engine block]]s, [[office furniture]], [[#Printer cartridges and toners reuse|toner cartridges]], [[single-use camera]]s, [[aircraft hull]]s, and [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) and refurbish them in a factory environment in order to meet the same/similar specifications as new products. [[Xerox]] (copy machines), and [[Cummins Engine]] are examples of refurbishing factories in the USA. [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls Royce]] has a very large aircraft remanufacturing factory in Singapore; [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] recently announced the opening of a tractor refurbishing plant in China.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some factories operate in competition with the [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM). When the refurbished item is resold under a new label (used monitor CRTs made into TVs, or cameras resold under a new label) this has been found legal by most courts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

When the item is resold under the same OEM name, it is informally considered a "gray market" item - if it is sold as used, it's legal, if it's represented as an OEM product eligible for [[Rebate (marketing)|rebate]]s and [[warranties]], it is considered "counterfeit" or "black market".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The automobile parts industry in the USA is governed by laws on the disclosure of "used" parts and, in some states, [[mattress]]es which have been used are required to be sanitized or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2002/julqtr/41cfr101-45.309-8.htm Code of Federal Regulations, Title 41, Volume 2] ''CITE: 41CFR101-45.309-8'' Part 101-45--Sale, Abandonment, Or Destruction Of Personal Property&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these laws are in place to protect consumers from black market items, or to protect manufacturers ("hindsight obsolescence"), is often an area of intense debate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Fuji Photo Film Co. v. Jazz Photo Corp. is a recent example of the war between patent holders and refurbishing factories. To quote the 2003 District Court of New Jersey:''"Thus, the key issue in the dispute between Fuji and Jazz is whether the cameras sold by Jazz are "refurbished" in such a way that they can be considered to have been permissibly "repaired" or impermissibly "reconstructed."''

===Package deposit programs===

{{main|Reusable packaging}}
[[File:E8086-Bishkek-glass-bottle-collection-point.jpg|left|thumb|Reusable glass bottles collected in [[Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan]]. Deposit values (0.5-2 [[Kyrgyz som]]) are posted next to the sample bottles on the rack]]
[[Container-deposit legislation|Deposit]] programs offer customers a financial incentive to return [[packaging]] for reuse. Although no longer common, international experience is showing that they can still be an effective way to encourage packaging reuse.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} However, financial incentive, unless great, may be less of an incentive than convenience: statistics show that, on average, a milk bottle is returned 12 times, whereas a lemonade bottle with a 15p deposit is returned, on average, only 3 times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Refillable bottles are used extensively in many European countries; for example in [[Denmark]], 98% of bottles are refillable, and 98% of those are returned by consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/envirohealth/21651/ Litterbug World], Ariane Conrad Hyde, ''[[LiP Magazine]]''. April 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are typically supported by [[Container deposit legislation|deposit laws]] and other regulations.

Sainsbury Ltd have operated a [[plastic bag|plastic carrier bag]] cash refund scheme in 1991 - “the penny back scheme”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date=1991-05-16|title=Recession fails to subdue Sainsbury|author=Graham Searjeant}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme is reported to save 970 tonnes of plastic per annum. The scheme has now been extended to a penny back on a voucher which can be contributed to schools registered on the scheme; it estimates this will raise the savings in plastic to 2500 tonnes per annum.

[[File:Garrafa cerveja.jpg|thumb|right|The 600 ml brown bottle is the "standard [[beer]] reused bottle" in [[Brazil]].]]

In some developing nations like India and Pakistan, the cost of new bottles often forces manufacturers to collect and refill old glass bottles for selling [[cola]] and other drinks. India and Pakistan also have a way of reusing old newspapers: "Kabadiwalas" buy these from the readers for scrap value and reuse them as packaging or recycle them. Scrap intermediaries help consumer dispose of other materials including metals and plastics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Closed-loop programs===
These apply primarily to items of packaging, for example, where a company is involved in the regular transportation of goods from a central manufacturing facility to warehouses or warehouses to retail outlets. In these cases there is considerable benefit to using reusable “transport packaging” such as plastic crates or pallets.

The benefits of closed-loop reuse are primarily due to low additional transport costs being involved, the empty lorry returning with the empty crates.
There have been some recent attempts to get the public to join in on closed loop reuse schemes  where shoppers use reusable plastic baskets in place of carrier bags for transporting their goods home from the supermarket; these baskets fit on specially designed trolleys making shopping supposedly easier.

===Refilling programs===
There have been some market-led initiatives to encourage packaging reuse by companies introducing [[refill pack]]s of certain commodities (mainly soap powders and cleaning fluids), the contents being transferred before use into a reusable package kept by the customer, with the savings in packaging being passed onto the customer by lower shelf prices. The refill pack itself is not reused, but being a minimal package for carrying the product home, it requires less material than one with the durability and features (reclosable top, convenient shape, etc.) required for easy use of the product, while avoiding the transport cost and emissions of returning the reusable package to the factory.

===Regifting===
{{Main|Regift}}
Some items, such as clothes and children's toys, often become unwanted before they wear out due to changes in their owner's needs or preferences; these can be reused by selling or giving them to new owners. Regiving can take place informally between family, friends, or neighbours, through environmental [[freecycling]] organisations or through anti-poverty charities such as the [[Red Cross]], [[United Way of America|United Way]], [[Salvation Army]], and [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]] which give these items to those who could not afford them new. Other organizations such as [[iLoveSchools]] have websites where both new and used goods can be offered to any of America's school teachers so their life can be extended and help schoolchildren. The average American, for example, throws away 67.9 pounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textilerecycle.org |title=Council for Textile Recycling (CTR) |publisher=Textilerecycle.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of used clothing and rags. With the U.S. population at approximately 296 million people, that translates into 20 billion pounds of used clothing and textiles that are tossed into the landfills each year. This has partly motivated movements such as [[The Compact]], whose members promise not to buy anything new for a year, and rely on reusing items that otherwise would be thrown away. Reuse not only reduces [[landfill]] inline with the [[waste minimization]] program but can help raise money for a good cause.

===Printer cartridges and toners===
Printer [[ink cartridge]]s can be reused. They are sorted by brand and model, to be refilled or resold back to the manufacturers. The companies then refill the ink reservoir to resell to consumers. [[Toner cartridge]]s are recycled the same way as ink cartridges, using toner instead of ink. This method is highly efficient as there is no energy spent on melting and recreating the cartridges.

===Repurposing===
{{Main|Repurposing}}
[[File:Plastic Bottles and LED Lights repurposed as a chandelier during Ramadan in Muslim Quarter, Jerusalem 2011.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Plastic bottles (with LED lights) repurposed as a chandelier during Ramadan in the Muslim Quarter, [[Jerusalem]] ]]

Repurposing is to use a tool for use as another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk or garbage. A good example of this would be the [[Earthship]] style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as [[boat fender]]s and [[steel drum]]s or plastic drums as [[feeding trough]]s and/or composting bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/6081/repurpose/100-ways-repurpose-reuse-broken-household-items | title=100 Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Broken Household Items | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste Exchanges===
A [[waste exchange]], or virtual exchange, facilitates the use of a waste product from one process as a raw material for another. As with new life reuse of finished items, this avoids the environmental costs of disposing of the waste and obtaining new raw material, and may still be possible if the nature of the process makes avoiding production of the waste or recycling it back into the original process impossible.

This sort of scheme needs to have a far broader base than is currently the case, it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One of the problems is once a demand for a waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a “waste” but a sellable commodity which often prices itself out of the market, c.f waste cement kiln dust and N-viro (lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer). In the former [[East Germany]], organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state's control of agriculture; the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

=== Reuse of Waste Water and excreta in agriculture ===
{{Main|Reuse of excreta}}
The nutrients, i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients, and organic matter contained in [[wastewater]], excreta ([[urine]] and [[feces]]) and [[greywater]] have traditionally been reused in agriculture in many countries and are still being reused in agriculture to this day - unfortunately often in an unregulated and unsafe manner. This is particularly a problem in many developing countries (e.g. Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Ghana) where untreated or poorly treated wastewater is used directly in agriculture. The WHO Guidelines from 2006 have set up a framework how this reuse can be done safely by following a multiple barrier approach.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; Work by the [[International Water Management Institute]] has led to a better understanding on how such wastewater reuse can be safely implemented in practice, for which they won the [[Stockholm Water Prize]] in 2012. Reuse of sanitised excreta in agriculture has also been called a "closing the loop" approach for sanitation and agriculture and is central to the [[ecological sanitation]] approach.

==Measuring the impact of reuse, reuse metrics==
Determining the balance of how the several effects of reuse interact is often best accomplished by a formal [[life cycle assessment]]. For example, research has shown that reusing a product can reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint by more than 50% relative to the complete product life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citeulike.org/article/9832067 |title=Impact of closed-loop network configurations on carbon footprints: A case study in copiers |publisher=Citeulike.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively unknown effective way to reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint is reusing products. Often the relative carbon footprint of manufacturing and the [[supply chain]] is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse | title=How to reduce your carbon footprint - by reuse! | publisher=Durabilt, Q1 2011 | accessdate=June 14, 2014 | author=Krikke, H.R. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083915/http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse | archivedate=August 19, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific methodology has been developed to calculate how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used or second hand hardware versus new hardware, the so-called durability greener network calculator.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

There are many ways of measuring the positive environmental, economic and social impact data. These include:
* # of tons diverted from the landfill
* $ avoided disposal costs 
* $ avoided purchase costs 
* $ value of materials donated 
* $ revenues earned 
* # of jobs created or retained 
* # of families/individuals/organizations assisted

==Internalized environmental costs==
{{Main|Pigovian tax}}

A [[Pigovian tax]] is an [[environmental tax]]: a charge on items that reflects the environmental costs of their manufacture and disposal. This makes the environmental benefit of using one reusable item instead of many disposable ones into a financial incentive. Such charges have been introduced in some countries.{{specify|date=June 2014}}{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Comparison to recycling==
[[Recycling]] differs from reuse in that it breaks down the item into raw materials which are then used to make new items, as opposed to reusing the intact item. As this extra processing requires energy, as a rule of thumb reuse is environmentally preferable to recycling ("[[Waste hierarchy|reduce, reuse, recycle]]"), though recycling does have a significant part to play as it can often make use of items which are broken, worn out or otherwise unsuitable for reuse.  However, as transport emissions are significant portion of the environmental impact of both reuse and recycling, in some cases recycling is the more prudent course as reuse can require long transport distances. A complex [[life cycle analysis]] may be required during a product's design phase to determine the efficacy of reuse, recycling, or neither, and produce accordingly.

[[File:PS 109 rehab 215 E. 99th St jeh.jpg|thumb|left|A school being prepared for reuse as housing]]

==Reuse of information==
Besides physical resources, [[information]] is often reused, notably [[Source code|program code]] for the software that drives computers and the [[Internet]], but also the [[documentation]] that explains how to use every modern device. And it is proposed as a way to improve education by assembling a great library of shareable [[learning object]]s that can be reused in [[learning management system]]s.

Software reuse grew out of the standard [[subroutine]] libraries of the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is the main principle of today's [[object-oriented programming]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Instead of constantly reinventing software wheels, [[programming language]]s like [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Objective-C]], and others are building vast collections of reusable software objects and [[Component-based software engineering|components]].{{https://natureofgeography.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-three-R-principle.html|date=Dec, 2018 by Joydeep}}

Reuse of information has a tremendous [[return on investment]] for organizations whose [[documentation]] is translated into many languages. [[Translation memory]] systems can store text that has already been translated into dozens of languages for retrieval and reuse.

===Reuse of older software===
Reuse of older software is popular among [[retrocomputing]].  Most of the time, [[emulator]]s are used to run older software from other platforms, or other [[operating system]]s.

Sometimes, older operating systems such as [[DOS]] are reused for computing roles that don't demand lots of computing power.  However, the widespread of availability of secondhand [[Windows XP]] computers at extreme low prices has largely supplanted immediate opportunities for using DOS on some repurposing applications, especially since something like [[USB]] isn't found on most pre-Windows XP computers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21861">In [[theoretical physics]], a '''scalar–tensor theory''' is a theory that includes both a [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]] and a [[tensor]] field to represent a certain interaction.  For example, the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] of [[gravitation]] uses both a scalar field and a [[tensor field]] to mediate the gravitational interaction.

== Tensor fields and field theory ==
Modern physics tries to derive all physical theories from as few principles as possible. In this way, [[Newtonian mechanics]] as well as [[quantum mechanics]] are derived from [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s ''[[principle of least action]]''. In this approach, the behavior of a system is not described via [[force]]s, but by functions which describe the energy of the system. Most important are the energetic quantities known as the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] function and the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] function. Their derivatives in space are known as [[Hamiltonian field theory|Hamiltonian density]] and [[Lagrangian (field theory)|the Lagrangian density]]. Going to these quantities leads to the field theories.

Modern physics uses [[field (physics)|field]] theories to explain reality. These fields can be [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], [[vector field|vectorial]] or [[tensor field|tensorial]]. An example of a scalar field is the temperature field. An example of a vector field is the wind velocity field. An example of a tensor field is the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]] field in a stressed body, used in [[continuum mechanics]].

== Gravity as field theory ==
In physics, forces (as vectorial quantities) are given as the derivative (gradient) of scalar quantities named potentials. In classical physics before [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], gravitation was given in the same way, as consequence of a gravitational force (vectorial), given through a scalar potential field, dependent of the mass of the particles. Thus, [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] gravity is called a [[scalar theory]]. The gravitational force is dependent of the distance ''r'' of the massive objects to each other (more exactly, their centre of mass). Mass is a parameter and space and time are unchangeable.

Einstein's theory of gravity, the [[General Relativity]] (GR) is of another nature. It unifies space and time in a 4-dimensional ''manifold'' called space-time. In GR there is no gravitational force, instead, the actions we ascribed to being a force are the consequence of the local curvature of space-time. That curvature is defined mathematically by the so-called [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]], which is a function of the total energy, including mass, in the area. The derivative of the metric is a function that approximates the classical Newtonian force in most cases. The metric is a tensorial quantity of degree 2 (it can be given as a 4x4 matrix, an object carrying 2 indices).

Another possibility to explain gravitation in this context is by using both tensor (of degree n&gt;1) and scalar fields, i.e. so that gravitation is given neither solely through a scalar field nor solely through a metric. These are scalar–tensor theories of gravitation.

The field theoretical start of General Relativity is given through the Lagrange density. It is a scalar and gauge invariant (look at [[gauge theories]]) quantity dependent on the curvature scalar R. This Lagrangian, following Hamilton's principle, leads to the field equations of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. If in the Lagrangian the curvature (or a quantity related to it) is multiplied with a square scalar field, field theories of scalar–tensor theories of gravitation are obtained. In them, the [[gravitational constant]] of Newton is no longer a real constant but a quantity dependent of the scalar field.

===Mathematical formulation===

An action of such a gravitational scalar–tensor theory can be written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \frac{1}{c} \int {d^4 x \sqrt{-g} \frac{1}{2 \mu}} \times \left[ \Phi  R-\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi} (\partial_\sigma \Phi)^2-V(\Phi)+ 2 \mu~\mathcal{L}_m (g_{\mu \nu}, \Psi)  \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the metric determinant, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar constructed from the metric &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a coupling constant with the dimensions &lt;math&gt;L^{-1} M^{-1}T^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar-field potential, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_m&lt;/math&gt; is the material Lagrangian and &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; represents the non-gravitational fields. Here, the Brans–Dicke parameter &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; has been generalized to a function. Although &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is often written as being &lt;math&gt;8 \pi G / c^4&lt;/math&gt;, one has to keep in mind that the fundamental constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there, is not the [[Gravitational constant|constant of gravitation]] that can be measured with, for instance, [[Cavendish experiment|Cavendish type experiments]]. Indeed, the [[Gravitational constant|empirical gravitational constant]] is generally no longer a constant in scalar–tensor theories, but a function of the scalar field &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. The metric and scalar-field equations respectively write:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}R= \frac{\mu}{\Phi}T_{\mu
\nu}+ \frac{1}{\Phi} [\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu -g_{\mu \nu}\Box]\Phi 
+\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi^2}(\partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi
- \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}(\partial_\alpha \Phi)^2)-g_{\mu \nu} \frac{V(\Phi)}{2 \Phi} , &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\omega(\Phi)+3}{\Phi}\Box \Phi=  \frac{\mu}{\Phi} T   - \frac{\omega'(\Phi)}{\Phi} (\partial_\sigma \Phi)^2 + V'(\Phi) - 2 \frac{V(\Phi)}{\Phi} . &lt;/math&gt;
Also, the theory satisfies the following conservation equation, implying that test-particles follow space-time [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]] such as in general relativity:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\sigma T^{\mu \sigma} = 0, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; T^{\mu \sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stress–energy tensor|stress-energy tensor]] defined as
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu}=-\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta(\sqrt{-g}\mathcal{L}_m)}{\delta g^{\mu \nu}}. &lt;/math&gt;

====The Newtonian approximation of the theory====

Developing perturbatively the theory defined by the previous action around a Minkowskian background, and assuming non-relativistic gravitational sources, the first order gives the Newtonian approximation of the theory. In this approximation, and for a theory without potential,  the metric writes
:&lt;math&gt;g_{00}=-1+ 2 \frac{U}{c^2}+\mathcal{O}(c^{-3}),~ g_{0i}=\mathcal{O}(c^{-2}),~ g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}+\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}),&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following usual [[Poisson's equation|Poisson equation]] at the lowest order of the approximation:
:&lt;math&gt;\triangle U = 8 \pi G_\mathrm{eff}~ \rho+\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}),&lt;/math&gt;

It corresponds to the remaining [[General covariance|diffeomorphism]] degree of freedom that is not fixed by the weak isotropy condition. The sources are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{eff}= \frac{2\omega_0+4}{2\omega_0+3}G,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the (true) constant that appears in the coupling constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; defined previously.

== Observational constraints on the theory ==

Current observations indicate that &lt;math&gt;\gamma-1=(2.1 \pm 2.3)\times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which means that &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 &gt; 40 000&lt;/math&gt;. Although explaining such a value in the context of the original [[Brans–Dicke theory]] is impossible, [[Thibault Damour|Damour]] and [[Kenneth Nordtvedt|Nordtvedt]] found that the field equations of the general theory often lead to an evolution of the function &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; toward infinity during the evolution of the universe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hence, according to them, the current high value of the function &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; could be a simple consequence of the evolution of the universe.

The best current constraint on the post-Newtonian parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; comes from Mercury's perihelion shift and is &lt;math&gt;|\beta-1|&lt;3 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Both constraints show that while the theory is still a potential candidate to replace general relativity, the scalar field must be very weakly coupled in order to explain current observations.

Generalized scalar-tensor theories have also been proposed as explanation for the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerated expansion of the universe]] but the measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] has ruled this out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |class=astro-ph.CO |date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezquiaga|first=Jose María|last2=Zumalacárregui|first2=Miguel|date=2017-12-18|title=Dark Energy After GW170817: Dead Ends and the Road Ahead|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251304|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=119|issue=25|pages=251304|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251304|bibcode=2017PhRvL.119y1304E|arxiv=1710.05901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creminelli|first=Paolo|last2=Vernizzi|first2=Filippo|date=2017-12-18|title=Dark Energy after GW170817 and GRB170817A|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251302|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=119|issue=25|pages=251302|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251302|arxiv=1710.05877|bibcode=2017PhRvL.119y1302C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher-dimensional relativity and scalar–tensor theories ==

After the postulation of the [[General Relativity]] of Einstein and Hilbert, [[Theodor Kaluza]] and [[Oskar Klein]] proposed in 1917 a generalization in a 5-dimensional manifold: [[Kaluza–Klein theory]]. This theory possesses a 5-dimensional metric (with a ''compactified and constant 5th metric component, dependent on the ''gauge potential'') and unifies [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]], i.e. there is a geometrization of electrodynamics.

This theory was modified in 1955 by [[P. Jordan]] in his ''Projective Relativity'' theory, in which, following group-theoretical reasonings, Jordan took a functional 5th metric component that lead to a variable gravitational constant ''G''. In his original work, he introduced coupling parameters of the scalar field, to change energy conservation as well, according to the ideas of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]].

Following the ''Conform Equivalence theory'', multidimensional theories of gravity are ''conform equivalent'' to theories of usual General Relativity in 4 dimensions with an additional scalar field. One case of this is given by Jordan's theory, which, without breaking energy conservation (as it should be valid, following from microwave background radiation being of a black body), is equivalent to the theory of [[Carl H. Brans|C. Brans]] and [[Robert H. Dicke]] of 1961, so that it is usually spoken about the ''Brans–Dicke theory''. The [[Brans–Dicke theory]] follows the idea of modifying Hilbert-Einstein theory to be compatible with [[Mach's principle]]. For this, Newton's gravitational constant had to be variable, dependent of the mass distribution in the universe, as a function of a scalar variable, coupled as a field in the Lagrangian. It uses a scalar field of infinite length scale (i.e. long-ranged), so, in the language of [[Hideki Yukawa|Yukawa]]'s theory of nuclear physics, this scalar field is a ''massless field''. This theory becomes Einsteinian for high values for the parameter of the scalar field.

In 1979, R. Wagoner proposed a generalization of scalar–tensor theories using more than one scalar field coupled to the scalar curvature.

JBD theories although not changing the geodesic equation for test particles, change the motion of composite bodies to a more complex one. The coupling of a universal scalar field directly to the gravitational field gives rise to potentially observable effects for the motion of matter configurations to which gravitational energy contributes significantly. This is known as the "Dicke–Nordtvedt" effect, which leads to possible violations of the Strong as well as the Weak Equivalence Principle for extended masses.

JBD-type theories with short-ranged scalar fields use, according to Yukawa's theory, ''massive scalar fields''. The first of this theories was proposed by A. Zee in 1979. He proposed a Broken-Symmetric Theory of Gravitation, combining the idea of Brans and Dicke with the one of Symmetry Breakdown, which is essential within the [[Standard Model]] SM of [[elementary particles]], where the so-called Symmetry Breakdown leads to mass generation (as a consequence of particles interacting with the Higgs field). Zee proposed the Higgs field of SM as scalar field and so the Higgs field to generate the gravitational constant.

The interaction of the Higgs field with the particles that achieve mass through it is short-ranged (i.e. of Yukawa-type) and gravitational-like (one can get a Poisson equation from it), even within SM, so that Zee's idea was taken 1992 for a scalar–tensor theory with Higgs field as scalar field with Higgs mechanism. There, the massive scalar field couples to the masses, which are at the same time the source of the scalar Higgs field, which generates the mass of the elementary particles through Symmetry Breakdown. For vanishing scalar field, this theories usually go through to standard General Relativity and because of the nature of the massive field, it is possible for such theories that the parameter of the scalar field (the coupling constant) does not have to be as high as in standard JBD theories. Though, it is not clear yet which of these models explains better the phenomenology found in nature nor if such scalar fields are really given or necessary in nature. Nevertheless, JBD theories are used to explain [[cosmic inflation|inflation]] (for massless scalar fields then it is spoken of the inflaton field) after the [[Big Bang]] as well as the [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]. Further, they are an option to explain dynamics usually given through the standard [[cold dark matter]] models, as well as [[MOND]], [[Axion]]s (from Breaking of a Symmetry, too), [[MACHOS]],...

== Connection to string theory ==

A generic prediction of all string theory models is that the spin-2 graviton has a spin-0 partner called the [[dilaton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Damour|first=Thibault|author-link=Thibault Damour|last2=Piazza|first2=Federico|last3=Veneziano|first3=Gabriele|author-link3=Gabriele Veneziano|date=2002-08-05|title=Runaway Dilaton and Equivalence Principle Violations|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.081601|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=89|issue=8|pages=081601|arxiv=gr-qc/0204094|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.081601|via=|bibcode=2002PhRvL..89h1601D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, string theory predicts that the actual theory of gravity is a scalar–tensor theory rather than general relativity. However, the precise form of such a theory is not currently known because one does not have the mathematical tools in order to address the corresponding non-perturbative calculations. Besides, the precise effective 4-dimensional form of the theory is also confronted to the so-called [[String theory landscape|landscape issue]].

[[File:Ueber Sinn und Bedeutung Frege 1892.jpg|thumb|right|360px| ''Die Gleichheit fordert das Nachdenken heraus durch Fragen, die sich daran knüpfen und nicht ganz leicht zu beantworten sind''. Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer]]

In the [[philosophy of language]], the distinction between '''sense and reference''' was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]] in 1892 (in his paper "'''On Sense and Reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;"; German: "Über Sinn und Bedeutung"),&lt;ref name=A/&gt; reflecting the two ways he believed a [[singular term]] may have [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].

The [[reference]] (or "referent"; ''Bedeutung'') of a proper name is the object it means or indicates (''bedeuten''), its sense (''Sinn'') is what the name expresses. The reference of a sentence is its [[truth value]], its sense is the thought that it expresses.&lt;ref name=A&gt;"On Sense and Reference" ["Über Sinn und Bedeutung"], ''[[Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik]]'', vol. 100 (1892), pp. 25–50, esp. p. 31.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege justified the distinction in a number of ways.
#Sense is something possessed by a name, whether or not it has a reference. For example, the name "[[Odysseus]]" is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds.
#The sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege argued that if an identity statement such as "[[Hesperus]] is the same planet as [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]" is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is a 'mode of presentation', which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of [[analytic philosophy]] is traceable to Frege's philosophy of language.&lt;ref name=Speaks&gt;Jeff Speaks, [https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2011-12/83104/handouts/frege-reference.pdf "Frege's theory of reference"] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Frege's views on logic (i.e., his idea that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]) led to his views on a [[theory of reference]].&lt;ref name=Speaks/&gt;

==Background==
Frege developed his original theory of meaning in early works like ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' ('concept script') of 1879 and ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Grundlagen]]'' ('foundations of arithmetic') of 1884. On this theory, the meaning of a complete sentence consists in its being true or false,&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Evans, ''The Varieties of Reference'', Oxford: Clarendon 1982, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an extralinguistic entity which Frege called its ''Bedeutung'', literally 'meaning' or 'significance', but rendered by Frege's translators as 'reference', 'referent', '''M''eaning', 'nominatum', etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Function and Concept", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'Caesar conquered Gaul' divides into the complete term 'Caesar', whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term '—conquered Gaul', whose reference is a Concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence – its truth value – appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts.

==Sense==
[[File:Mengs, Hesperus als Personifikation des Abends.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Hesperus]]]]
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier, The Countess de Brac as Aurora (1741).jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]]] 
Frege introduced the notion of "sense" (German: ''Sinn'') to accommodate difficulties in his early theory of meaning.

First, if the entire significance of a sentence consists of its truth value, it follows that the sentence will have the same significance if we replace a word of the sentence with one having an identical reference, as this will not change its truth value.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The reference of the whole is determined by the reference of the parts. If ''the evening star'' has the same reference as ''the morning star'', it follows that ''the evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun'' has the same truth value as ''the morning star is a body illuminated by the Sun''. But it is possible for someone to think that the first sentence is true while also thinking that the second is false. Therefore, the thought corresponding to each sentence cannot be its reference, but something else, which Frege called its ''sense''.

Second, sentences that contain proper names with no reference cannot have a truth value at all. Yet the sentence 'Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense, even though 'Odysseus' has no reference. The thought remains the same whether or not 'Odysseus' has a reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a thought cannot contain the objects that it is about. For example, Mont Blanc, 'with its snowfields', cannot be a component of the thought that Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high. Nor can a thought about Etna contain lumps of solidified lava.&lt;ref&gt;See Frege's undated letter to [[Philip Jourdain]], published in ''Frege's Philosophical and Mathematical Correspondence'', ed. Gottfried Gabriel, Hans Hermes, Friedrich Kanbartel, Christian Thiel and Albet Veraart, transl. Hans Kaal, Oxford: Blackwell 1980. (See also Frege's letter to Russell dated 1904, in the same collection.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege's notion of sense is somewhat obscure, and neo-Fregeans have come up with different candidates for its role.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cumming, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/names/Names Names], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts based on the work of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alonzo Church|Church]]&lt;ref&gt;“A Formulation of the Logic of Sense and Denotation”, in P. Henle, M. Kallen, and S. K. Langer, eds., ''Structure, Method, and Meaning'', New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; treat sense as an [[intension]], or a function from [[possible world]]s to [[Extension (semantics)|extensions]]. For example, the intension of ‘number of planets’ is a function that maps any possible world to the number of planets in that world. [[John McDowell]] supplies cognitive and reference-determining roles.&lt;ref&gt;“On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name”, ''Mind'', 86: 159–85, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Devitt&lt;ref&gt;''Designation'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; treats senses as causal-historical chains connecting names to referents.

==Sense and description==
In his [[theory of descriptions]], [[Bertrand Russell]] held the view that most proper names in ordinary language are in fact disguised [[definite description]]s. For example, 'Aristotle' can be understood as "The pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander," or by some other uniquely applying description. This is known as the [[descriptivist theory of names]]. Because Frege used definite descriptions in many of his examples, he is often taken to have endorsed the descriptivist theory. Thus Russell's theory of descriptions was conflated with Frege's theory of sense, and for most of the twentieth century this 'Frege-Russell' view was the orthodox view of proper name semantics. However, [[Saul Kripke]] argued compellingly against the descriptivist theory. According to Kripke,&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980, 48-9&lt;/ref&gt; proper names are [[rigid designator]]s which designate the same object in every possible world. Descriptions such as 'the President of the U.S. in 1970' do not designate the same in every possible world. For example, someone other than [[Richard Nixon]], e.g. [[Hubert Humphrey]], might have been the President in 1970. Hence a description (or cluster of descriptions) cannot be a rigid designator, and thus a proper name cannot ''mean'' the same as a description.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'' p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Russellian descriptivist reading of Frege has been rejected by many scholars, in particular by [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] in ''The Varieties of Reference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Gareth|title=The Varieties of Reference|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|editor=John McDowell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John McDowell]] in "The Sense and Reference of a Proper Name,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=John|title=On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name|journal=Mind|date=April 1977|volume=86|series=New Series|issue=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Michael Dummett]], who argued that Frege's notion of sense should not be equated with a description. Evans further developed this line, arguing that a sense without a referent was not possible. He and McDowell both take the line that Frege's discussion of empty names, and of the idea of sense without reference, are inconsistent, and that his apparent endorsement of descriptivism rests only on a small number of imprecise and perhaps offhand remarks. And both point to the power that the sense-reference distinction ''does'' have (i.e., to solve at least the first two problems), even if it is not given a descriptivist reading.

==Translation of ''Bedeutung''==
As noted above, translators of Frege have rendered the German ''Bedeutung'' in various ways. The term 'reference' has been the most widely adopted, but this fails to capture the meaning of the original German ('meaning' or 'significance'), and does not reflect the decision to standardise key terms across different editions of Frege's works published by [[Wiley-Blackwell#Blackwell Publishing history|Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Beaney (''The Frege Reader'', Oxford: Blackwell 1997, p. 36) 'the decision was taken at a meeting in the early 1970s attended by Michael Dummett, Peter Geach, William Kneale, Roger White and a representative from Blackwell. The translation of ''Bedeutung'' by 'meaning' was unanimously agreed after lengthy discussion'.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was based on the principle of [[exegetical neutrality]], namely that 'if at any point in a text there is a passage that raises for the native speaker legitimate questions of [[exegesis]], then, if at all possible, a translator should strive to confront the reader of his version with the same questions of exegesis and not produce a version which in his mind resolves those questions'.&lt;ref&gt;Long, P. and White, A., 'On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung'': A Reply to Dr. Bell', ''Analysis'' 40 pp. 196-202, 1980, p. 196. See also Bell, D., "On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung''", ''Analysis'' Vol. 40, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'meaning' best captures the standard German meaning of ''Bedeutung'', and Frege's own use of the term sounds as odd when translated into English as it does in German. Moreover, 'meaning' captures Frege's early use of ''Bedeutung'' well,&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and it would be problematic to translate Frege's early use as 'meaning' and his later use as 'reference', suggesting a change in terminology not evident in the original German.

==Precursors==
===Antisthenes===
The Greek philosopher [[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], apparently distinguished "a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference." This "suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Susan |title=Antisthenes of Athens: Texts, Translations, and Commentary|publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2015}} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
The principal basis of this claim is a quotation in [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]'s “Comments on [[Aristotle]]'s 'Topics'” with a three-way distinction: 
# the semantic medium, δι' ὧν λέγουσι
# an object external to the semantic medium, περὶ οὗ λέγουσιν
# the direct indication of a thing, σημαίνειν … τὸ …&lt;ref&gt;Prince 2015, pp. 518–522 (Antisthenes' literary remains: t. 153B.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stuart Mill===
The sense-reference distinction is commonly confused with that between [[connotation]] and [[denotation]], which originates with [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;See section §5 of book I, chapter i of Mill's [[A System of Logic]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mill, a common term like 'white' ''denotes'' all white things, as snow, paper. But according to Frege, a common term does not refer to any individual white thing, but rather to an abstract Concept (''Begriff''). We must distinguish between the relation of reference, which holds between a proper name and the object it refers to, such as between the name 'Earth', and the planet [[Earth]], and the relation of 'falling under', such as when the Earth falls under the concept ''planet''. The relation of a proper name to the object it designates is direct, whereas a word like 'planet' has no such direct relation at all to the Earth at all, but only to a concept that the Earth falls under. Moreover, judging ''of'' anything that it falls under this concept is not in any way part of our knowledge of what the word 'planet' means.&lt;ref&gt;Frege, "A critical elucidation of some points in E. Schroeder's ''Vorlesungen Ueber Die Algebra der Logik'', ''Archiv fur systematische Philosophie'' 1895, pp. 433-456, transl. Geach, in Geach &amp; Black 86-106.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between connotation and denotation is closer to that between Concept and Object, than to that between 'sense' and 'reference'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15459">'''Sham peer review''' or '''malicious peer review''' is a name given to the abuse of a [[medical peer review]] process to attack a [[physician|doctor]] for personal or other non-medical reasons.&lt;ref name="Chalifoux"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Medscape General Medicine|year=2005|volume=7|issue=4|pages=47|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/515862|author=Roland Chalifoux, Jr|title=So What Is a Sham Peer Review?|pmid=16614669|pmc=1681729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Medical Association]] conducted an investigation of medical peer review in 2007 and concluded that while it is easy to allege misconduct and 15% of surveyed physicians indicated that they were aware of peer review misuse or abuse, cases of malicious peer review able to be proven through the legal system are rare.&lt;ref name="AMA"&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/471/bot24.doc "Inappropriate Peer Review. Report of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
Those who maintain that sham peer review is a pervasive problem suggest that the [[Healthcare Quality Improvement Act]] ([[HCQIA]]) of 1986 allows sham reviews by granting significant [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] from liability to doctors and others who participate in peer reviews. This immunity extends to investigative activities as well as to any associated peer review hearing, whether or not it leads to a disciplinary (or other) action.

The definition of a peer review body can be broad, including not only individuals but also (for example, in [[Oregon]]), "tissue committees, governing bodies or committees including medical staff committees of a [licensed] health care facility...or any other medical group in connection with bona fide medical research, quality assurance, utilization review, credentialing, education, training, supervision or discipline of physicians or other health care providers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=JCAHO Periodic Performance Review |url=http://oahhs.org/legal/legal_services_bulletin_january2004.htm |journal=Legal Bulletin of Oregon Association of Hospital and Health Systems |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AJCAHO+Periodic+Performance+Review&amp;as_publication=Legal+Bulletin+of+Oregon+Association+of+Hospital+and+Health+Systems&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928210714/http://oahhs.org/legal/legal_services_bulletin_january2004.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California State Legislature|California legislature]] framed its statutes so as to allow "aggrieved physicians the opportunity to prove that the peer review to which they were subject was in fact carried out for improper purposes, i.e., for purposes unrelated to assuring quality care or patient safety".  These statutes allow that a peer review can be found in court to have been improper due to bad faith or malice, in which case the peer reviewers' immunities from civil liability "fall by the wayside".&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sierra Sacramento Valley Medicine, Vol. 57, No. 3, May/Jun 2006|title=Attacking Bad Faith Peer Review: Is It a SLAPP?|author=Greg Abrams, Esq.|url=http://www.ssvms.org/ssv_medicine/archives/2006/03/toc.asp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225158/http://www.ssvms.org/ssv_medicine/archives/2006/03/toc.asp|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who practice sham peer review could draw out the process by legal maneuvering, and the fairness of a peer review that has been unduly delayed has been called into question. Many medical staff laws specify guidelines for the timeliness of peer review, in compliance with [[JCAHO]] standards.

==Medical peer review process==
{{main|Medical peer review}}
The [[medical peer review]] system is a [[quasi-judicial]] one. It is modeled in some ways on the [[grand jury]] / petit jury system. After a complainant asks for an investigation, a review body is assembled  for fact-finding. This fact-finding body, called an ''ad hoc committee'', is appointed by the medical Chief of Staff and is composed of other physician staff members chosen at the Chief of Staff's discretion.  This ad hoc committee then conducts an investigation in the manner it feels is appropriate.  This may include a review of the literature or an outside expert.  Thus, there is no standard for impartiality and specifically no standard for due process in the "peer-review 'process' ."

Once the physician has been indicted (and sanctioned) he or she then has the right to request a hearing. At the hearing, [[counsel]] is allowed.  A second independent panel of physicians is chosen as the petit jury, and a hearing officer is chosen.  The accused physician has the option to demonstrate conflicts of interest and attempt to disqualify jurors based on reasonable suspicions of bias or conflicts of interest in a [[voir dire]] process.

Although some medical staff bodies utilize the hospital attorney and accept hospital funds to try peer review cases, the [[California Medical Association]] discourages this practice. California has enacted legislation formally requiring the separation of the hospital and medical staff.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Stanford  Hospital and Clinics Medical Staff Updates|date=March 2005|url=http://med.stanford.edu/shs/update/archives/MAR2005/pres.html|author=Bruce Adornato, MD|title=Column by the President of the Medical Staff: Purple fingers, Purple toes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged cases==
Some physicians allege that sham peer review is often conducted in retaliation for [[whistleblowing]], although one study in 2007 suggested that such events were rare.&lt;ref name="AMA"/&gt;

===Khajavi v. Feather River Anesthesiology Medical Group===
Those who disagree with the AMA point to the case of Nosrat Khajavi. In 1996, Khajavi, an anesthesiologist in [[Yuba City]], [[California]], disagreed with a surgeon over the appropriateness of cataract surgery for a patient and refused to attend during the procedure. Khajavi was subsequently terminated from his anesthesia group. He sued for wrongful termination under California Business &amp; Professions' Code Section 2053, and the suit was allowed by the California Court of Appeals. In 2000, the court held that Khajavi was not protected from termination on the basis of advocating for what he felt was medically appropriate care. The court did not rule on the merits of the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine]]|year=2000|title="Employment: Physician Not Protected From Termination For Advocating Medically Appropriate Health Care"—Khajavi v. Feather River Anesthesia Medical Group, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 627 (Cal. App. 3d 2000)|author=Arnold MS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 10, 2000|title=Khajavi v. Feather River Anesthesia Medical Group, Inc|author=California Appeals Court|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/C029159.DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mileikowsky v. Tenet===
A doctor was allegedly subject to multiple hearings for the same charges, and his rights to an expedited hearing were allegedly denied while a suspension was in place. On May 15, 2001, the California Medical Association filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief to emphasize legal protections meant to prevent physicians being arbitrarily excluded from access to healthcare facilities based on mechanisms such as summary suspension without a speedy hearing.  This case was decided on April 18, 2005.  The court ruled that the hearing officer in the case could indeed terminate the physician's peer review hearing based on grounds that the physician refused to cooperate on procedural and other matters necessary for the good conduct of the proceedings.  Thus, the physician lost his membership and privileges at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;''Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem'' (April 18, 2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 531, 27 Cal.Rptr.3d 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CMA_AC"&gt;{{cite web|date=January 2007|title=Health Policy in the Courts -- California Medical Association's participation in Amicus Curiae Briefs - January 2007|url=http://www.cmanet.org/member/upload/Acdept-cas.pdf|publisher=California Medical Association|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the same physician was brought into a peer review hearing at another facility a short time later.  The hearing officer in that case also terminated the proceedings, this time due to the physician's failure to turn over certain evidence for use in the hearing.  The physician challenged the termination through the court system arguing, contrary to the Tenet appellate court ruling, that California's peer review statutes never intended the hearing officer in peer review hearings to have such powers of termination.  The California Supreme Court reviewed the case and agreed in April 2009.  The High Court ruled, among other things, that peer review hearing officers must defer the question of termination to the panel of physicians who sit in judgment of each peer review hearing.&lt;ref&gt;''Mileikowsky v. West Hills Hosp. and Medical Center'' (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1259, 203 P.3d 1113, 91 Cal.Rptr.3d 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roland Chalifoux===
Roland Chalifoux, member of an advocacy organisation called the Semmelweis Society, had his medical license revoked in Texas in 2004 after numerous incidents including the death of a patient. The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners stated that Chalifoux's practices "constitute such a deviation from the standard of care that revocation of his license is the only sanction that will adequately protect the public".&lt;ref&gt;Horvit M and Jarviss J, "Board revokes doctor's license," Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX), 12 June 2004, p.1B&lt;/ref&gt; Chalifoux subsequently secured permission to practice in [[West Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell M, "Former Texas neurosurgeon granted licenses in West Virginia," Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX), 7 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and alleges that the Texas board's actions constitute sham peer review.

===Charles Williams, MD===
Six years after Charles Williams, MD, an anestesiologist was summarily suspended by University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, a federal jury in Las Vegas awarded Dr. Williams $8.8 million as compensation for the due process violations he experienced in his sham peer review.&lt;ref&gt;Thevenot, C., "Jury awards $8.8 million to anesthesiologist," Las Vegas Review-Journal (NV), 26 May 2011, http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/jury-awards-88-million-anesthesiologist&lt;/ref&gt; Before the trial, which began May 16, U.S. District Judge Philip Pro made a finding that Ellerton and UMC's medical staff had violated Williams' due process rights. That left only the question of damages for the jury.  This case appears to be the highest jury verdict in the nation for sham peer review which has not been overturned.

===Richard Chudacoff, MD===
On May 28, 2008, without any notice or opportunity to be heard, the Medical Staff of UMC suspended Dr. Chudacoff’s clinical privileges. As a result of this, UMC filed a report against Dr. Chudacoff with the National Practitioner Data Bank claiming that Dr. Chudacoff was a risk to patient safety and had inadequate skills. This led to the virtual destruction of Dr. Chudacoff’s career. Dr. Chudacoff sued.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Reed opined that, in Nevada, a physician's hospital privileges are a constitutionally protected property right.&lt;ref&gt;Chudacoff v. Univ. Med. Ctr. of S. Nev., 609 F.Supp. 2d 1163, 1172-73 (D. Nev. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then affirmed that Dr. Chudacoff's due process rights were violated by UMC.&lt;ref&gt;Chudacoff v. Univ. Med. Ctr. of S. Nev., 649 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the Patient Safety Organization (PSO)==
The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-41) allows for the creation of Patient Safety Organizations, quality of care committees that can act in parallel with peer review boards. PSOs were authorized to gather information to be analyzed by hospital administrators, nurses, and physicians as a tool for systems failure analysis. They may be used by any healthcare entity except insurance companies, but must be registered with the [[AHRQ]] wing of the US [[Department of Health and Human Services]].

In PSOs, [[root cause analysis]] and "near misses" are evaluated in an attempt to avert major errors. Participants in PSOs are immune from prosecution in civil, criminal, and administrative hearings.&lt;ref name="pso"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Patient Safety Organizations|author=William E.

[[File:Agent William's Car.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An FBI agent's bullet-riddled car after the [[1975 Pine Ridge shootout]].]]

A '''shootout''', also called a '''firefight''' or '''gunfight''', is a [[gun]] battle between armed groups. A shootout often, but not necessarily, pits [[law enforcement]] against [[criminal]] elements; it could also involve two groups outside of law enforcement, such as rival gangs. A shootout in a [[war]]-like context (i.e. regularly constituted [[armed forces]] or even [[guerrilla]] or [[insurgent]] forces) would usually be considered a '''[[battle]]''' (depending on size), rather than a ''shootout''. Shootouts are often portrayed in [[action film]]s and [[Western (genre)|Western films]].

==Famous shootouts in the United States and territories==

===The Greatest Shootout in the West===
On December 19, 1854, while trekking on a miner's trail along the North Fork of the [[American River]], Dr. Bolivar Sparks, James McDonald and [[Jonathan R. Davis|Captain Jonathan Davis]] were bushwhacked by an international band of bandits.  The bandits, who included a Frenchman, two Americans, two Englishmen, four Mexicans and four Australians, had recently robbed and killed four American miners on December 18, 1854, and six Chinese miners on December 17, 1854.  McDonald was killed instantly, and Dr. Sparks was fatally wounded, however Captain Davis, an Army veteran, pulled out both of his pistols and killed seven of the bandits in quick order. Out of bullets, Captain Davis, an expert fencer, pulled out his Bowie knife and killed four more of his attackers.  The surviving bandits fled for their lives. The shootout was witnessed by a group of miners, who buried the bodies of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Kulczyk, David. (2008). California Justice: Shootouts, Lynching and Assassinations in the Golden State.

The FBI agents were unarmed, but the local police exchanged fire with the criminal gang. The gang unintentionally killed Nash along with the law officers.

The FBI claimed that the gang included [[Pretty Boy Floyd|Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd]], but the evidence is debatable and contradicts with Floyd's alleged presence.

On November 26, 2008, 10 members of the Pakastani militant group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] carried out shooting sprees at several different locations throughout the Indian city of [[Mumbai]].  The terrorists, heavily armed with automatic weapons and explosives, overwhelmed the initial response from lightly armed and minimally trained police and held out for nearly three days, inflicting almost 500 casualties, with 157 deaths (including 17 police officers and soldiers).  9 of the 10 attackers were killed, while the 10th was arrested and later executed for the crime.

'''Date:''' 26–29 November 2008
'''Location:''' Mumbai, India
'''Results''' 166 deaths (including 9 of 10 attackers), 293 injuries, 1 terrorist arrested (later hanged after being sentenced to death).

Further information:  [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]

===[[Manila hostage crisis]]===
Former police officer Rolando Mendoza boarded a bus with Hong Kong tourists taking the occupants hostage. After freeing 4 children, senior citizens and a disabled woman, the shootout began after the on-board TV broadcast showing the arrest of his younger brother. Enraged, Mendoza took the tour guide and shot him in the head at the door. It took the SWAT team almost 2 hours to kill Mendoza with a sniper. The assault killed 8 hostages (the youngest being 14), and wounded 7 hostages, 1 journalist and 1 bystander.

'''Date:''' 23 August 2010
'''Location:''' Rizal Park, Manila, Philippines
'''Result:''' Shooter: 1 dead, hostages: 8. 9 others wounded.

===January 2015 Île-de-France attacks===
Three [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|AQAP]] terrorists, brothers [[Chérif and Saïd Kouachi]] and [[Amedy Coulibaly]], committed [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|a series of five attacks]] that resulted in the deaths in 20 people, including themselves. The Kouachis killed two police officers during the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] on 7 January before fleeing. Coulibaly shot and killed a policewoman the next day. Finally on 9 January, the Kouachis and Coulibaly held separate sieges which resulted in shootouts with police and all three being killed.

'''Date:''' 7&amp;ndash;9 January 2015&lt;br/&gt;
'''Location:''' [[Ile-de-France]], France &lt;br/&gt;

'''Social impact theory''' was created by Bibb Latané in 1981 and consists of four basic rules which consider how individuals can be "sources or targets of social influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karau|first1=Steven|last2=Williams|first2=Kipling|title=Social Loafing: Research Findings, Implications, and Future Directions|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=October 1995|volume=4|issue=5|page=135|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10772570 |jstor=20182353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social impact is the result of social forces including the strength of the source of impact, the immediacy of the event, and the number of sources exerting the impact.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Hogg, Scott Tindale; ''Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Group Processes''; John Wiley &amp; Sons (2008); p.239; {{ISBN|047099844X}},&lt;/ref&gt; The more targets of impact that exist, the less impact each individual target has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karau|first1=Steven|last2=Williams|first2=Kipling|title=Social Loafing: Research Findings, Implications, and Future Directions|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=October 1995|volume=4|issue=5|page=135|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10772570 |jstor=20182353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original research==
According to psychologist Bibb Latané, social impact is defined as any influence on individual feelings, thoughts or behavior that is created from the real, implied or imagined presence or actions of others. The application of social impact varies from diffusion of responsibility to social loafing, stage fright or persuasive communication. In 1981, Latané developed the social impact theory using three key variables:
* Strength (S) is a net of all individual factors that make a person influential. It covers stable, trans-situational, intrapersonal factors — size, intellect, wealth — as well as dynamic, situation-specific relational components like belonging to the same group.
* Immediacy (I) takes into account how recent the event occurred and whether or not there were other intervening factors
* The number of sources (N) refers to the amount of sources of influence
With these variables, Latané developed three laws through formulas — social forces, psychosocial, and multiplication/division of impact.

=== Social forces ===
The social forces law states that i = f(S * I * N). Impact (i) is a function of the three variables multiplied and grows as each variable is increased. However, if a variable were to be 0 or significantly low, the overall impact would be affected.

=== Psychosocial law ===
The Psychosocial law states that the most significant difference in social impact will occur in the transition from 0 to 1 source and as the number of sources increases, this difference will become even eventually. The equation Latané uses for this law is
&lt;math&gt;Impact = s\cdot N^t&lt;/math&gt; 
That is, some power (t) of the number of people (N) multiplied by the scaling constant (s) determines social impact.  Latané applied this theory to previous studies done on imitation and conformity as well as on embarrassment. Asch's study of conformity in college students contradicts the psychosocial law, showing that one or two sources of social impact make little difference. However, Gerard, Wilhelmy, and Conolley conducted a similar study on conformity sampling from high school students. High school students were deemed less likely to be resistant to conformity than college students, and thus may be more generalizable, in this regard, than Asch's study. Gerard, Wilhelmy, and Conolley's study supported the psychosocial law, showing that the first few confederates had the greatest impact on conformity.  Latané applied his law to imitation as well, using Milgram's gawking experiment. In this experiment various numbers of confederates stood on a street corner in New York craning and gawking at the sky. The results showed that more confederates meant more gawkers, and the change became increasingly insignificant as more confederates were present.  In a study Latané and Harkins conducted on stage fright and embarrassment, the results also followed the psychosocial law showing that more audience members meant greater anxiety and that the greatest difference existed between 0 and 1 audience members.

=== multiplication/divisions of impact ===
The third law of social impact states that the strength, immediacy, and number of targets play a role in social impact. That is, the more strength and immediacy and the greater number of targets in a social situation causes the social impact to be divided amongst all of the targets. The equation that represents this division is
&lt;math&gt;Impact = f(1/(S\cdot I\cdot N))&lt;/math&gt;
This law relates to [[diffusion of responsibility]], in which individuals feel less accountable as the number of people present increases. In emergency situations, the impact of the emergency is reduced when more people are present.

The social impact theory is both a generalizable and a specific theory. It uses one set of equations, which are applicable to many social situations. For example, the psychosocial law can be used to predict instances of conformity, imitation and embarrassment. Yet, it is also specific because the predictions that it makes are specific and can be applied to and observed in the world. The theory is falsifiable as well. It makes predictions through the use of equations; however, the equations may not be able to accurately predict the outcome of social situations. Social impact theory is also useful. It can be used to understand which social situations result in the greatest impact and which situations present exceptions to the rules.
 
While Social Impact theory explores social situations and can help predict the outcomes of social situations, it also has some shortcomings and questions that are left unresolved. The rules guiding the theory depict people as recipients that passively accept social impact and do not take into account the social impact that people may actively seek out. The model is also static, and does not fully compensate for the dynamics involved in social interactions. The theory is relatively new and fails to address some pertinent issues. These issues include finding more accurate ways to measure social outcomes, understanding the "t" exponent in psychosocial law, taking susceptibility into account, understanding how short-term consequences can develop into chronic consequences, application to group interactions, understanding the model's nature (descriptive vs. explanatory, generalization vs. theory).

== Applying Social Impact Theory ==
The social impact theory specifies the effects of social variables — strength, immediacy, and number of sources — but does not explain the nature of these influencing processes. There are various factors not considered by experimenters while implementing the theory. Concepts such as peripheral persuasion affect how communicators may be more credible to some individuals and untrustworthy to others. The variables are inconsistent from individual to individual, possibly associating strength with source credibility and attractiveness or immediacy with physical closeness. Therefore, in the application of the social impact theory, the idea of persuasiveness, the ability to induce someone with an opposing position to change, and supportiveness, the ability to help those who agree with someone's point of view to resist the influence of others, is introduced. Ultimately, an individual's likelihood of change and being influenced is a direct function of strength (persuasiveness), immediacy and the number of advocates and is a direct inverse function of strength (supportiveness), immediacy and number of target individuals.

==Subsequent development==
The '''Dynamic Social Impact Theory''' was developed by Latané and his colleagues in 1996. This theory is considered an extension of the Social Impact Theory as it uses its basic principles, mainly that social influence is determined by the strength, immediacy, and number of sources present, to describe how majority and minority group members influence one another. As its name suggests, the Dynamic Social Impact Theory proposes that groups are complex systems that are constantly changing and are never static. Groups that are spatially distributed and interact repeatedly organize and reorganize themselves in four basic patterns: ''consolidation, clustering, correlation,'' and ''continuing diversity''. These patterns allow for group dynamics to operate and ideas to be diffused throughout the group.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2009). Group dynamics: New York: Wadsworth. [Chapter 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

1. '''Consolidation''' – as individuals interact with each other, over time, their actions, attitudes, and opinions become uniform. In this manner, opinions held by the majority of the group spread to the minority, which then decreases in size.

2. '''Clustering''' – individuals tend to interact with clusters of group members with similar opinions. Clusters are common  when group members communicate more frequently with members in close proximity, and less frequently with members who are more distant. Minority group members are often shielded from majority influence due to clustering. Therefore, subgroups can emerge which may possess similar ideas to one another, but hold different beliefs than the majority population.

3. '''Correlation''' – over time, individual group members` opinions on a variety of issues converge and correlate with each other; this is true even of issues that are not discussed by the group.

4. '''Continuing Diversity''' – a degree of diversity can exist within a group if minority group members cluster together or minority members who communicate with majority members resist majority influence. However, if the majority is large or minority members are physically isolated from one another, this diversity drops.

==Contemporary research==
In 1985 Mullen analyzed two of the factors that Latané associated with Social Impact theory. Mullen conducted a meta-analysis that examined the validity of the source strength and the source immediacy. The studies that were analyzed were sorted by the method of measurement used with the self-reported in one category and the behavior measurements in the other category. Mullen's results showed that the source strength and immediacy were only supported in cases in which tension was self-reported, and not when behavior was measured.  He thus concluded that Latané's source strength and immediacy were weak and lacked consistency. Critics of Mullen's study, however, argue that perhaps not enough studies were available or included, which may have skewed his results and given him an inaccurate conclusion.

A study conducted by Constantine Sedikides and Jeffrey M. Jackson took another look at the role of strength and within social impact theory. This study was conducted in a bird house at a zoo. In one scenario, an experimenter dressed as a bird keeper walked into the bird house and told visitors that leaning on the railing was prohibited. This was considered the high-strength scenario because of the authority that a zookeeper possesses within a zoo. The other scenario involved an experimenter dressed in ordinary clothes addressing the visitors with the same message. The results of the study showed that visitors responded better to the high-strength scenario, with fewer individuals leaning on the railing after the zookeeper had told them not to.  The study also tested the effect that immediacy had on social impact. This was done by measuring the incidences of leaning on the rail both immediately after the message was delivered and at a later point in time. The results showed that immediacy played a role in determining social impact since there were fewer people leaning on the rails immediately after the message. The visitors in the bird house were studied as members of the group they came with to determine how number of targets would influence the targets' behavior. The group size ranged from 1 to 6 and the results showed that those in larger groups were less likely to comply with the experimenter's message than those in smaller groups. All of these findings support the parameters of Latané's Social Impact Theory.

Kipling D. Williams, and Karen B. Williams theorized that social impact would vary depending on the underlying motive of compliance. When compliance is simply a mechanism to induce the formation of a positive impression, stronger sources should produce a greater social impact. When it is an internal motive that induces compliance, the strength of the source shouldn't matter. Williams and Williams designed a study in which two persuasion methods were utilized, one that would evoke external motivation and one that would evoke internal motivation. Using these techniques, experimenters went from door to door using one of the techniques to attempt to collect money for a zoo.  The foot-in-the-door technique was utilized to evoke the internal motive. In this technique, the experimenter would make an initial request that was relatively small, and gradually request larger and larger amounts. This is internally motivated because the target's self-perception is altered to feel more helpful after the original contribution. The door-in-the-face technique, on the other hand, involves the experimenter asking for a large amount first; and when the target declines, they ask for a much smaller amount as a concession. This technique draws on external motivation because the request for a concession makes one feel obliged to comply. The experiment was conducted with low-strength and high-strength experimenters. Those who were approached by higher-strength experimenters were more likely to contribute money. Using the different persuasion approaches did not produce statistically significant results; however, it did support Williams and Williams hypothesis that the strength of the experimenter would heighten the effects of the door-in-the-face technique, but have minimal effect on the foot-in-the-door technique

There have also been studies done to examine Latané's dynamic social impact theory. One study was conducted within three classrooms. Two of these classes were small and one of them was large. The experimenter would develop 10 moderate multiple choice questions, which were read aloud to the class one at a time. The students were then instructed to discuss each question as it was read aloud with their neighbors and come to a final answer at the end of the given time period. The results of this simple study were able to illustrate and support the effects of dynamic social impact theory. The answers were consolidated because many of those with a minority answer within their group would comply with the majority opinion, which reduced the diversity of the answers. There was also considerable clustering: those sitting near each other tended to have the same answers. Correlation was visible because answers that weren't originally apparently related, became connected for students within some of the groups. However, none of the answers were entirely eliminated, allowing for continuing diversity. Many of the groups had members that changed their answers from the wrong answer to the right answer; however, there were also students that changed their answer to the wrong one after the discussion.

Due to social media's influence, there has been movement towards e-commerce.  Researchers have since looked into the relationship between social media influence and visit and purchase intentions within individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Kwahk, Ge (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, Rodrigo Perez-Vega, Kathryn Waite, and Kevin O'Gorman &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perez-Vega | first1 = R. | last2 = Waite | first2 = K. | last3 = O'Gorman | first3 = K. | year = 2016 | title = Social impact theory: An examination of how immediacy operates as an influence upon social media interaction in Facebook fan pages | url = | journal = The Marketing Review | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 299–321 | doi=10.1362/146934716x14636478977791}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the theory is also relevant in the context of social media. Empirical research on this context has found support for the effects of numbers of sources (i.e. likes) in performance outcomes such as box office sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ding | first1 = C. | last2 = Cheng | first2 = H.

(in press), Twittermania: Understanding how social media technologies impact engagement and academic performance of a new generation of learners, Communications of the AIS&lt;/ref&gt; operationalized strength, immediacy, and number using [[Social network analysis|Social Network Analysis]] centrality measures, i.e., betweeness, closeness, and degree centralities to test two of the rules stipulated in Social Impact Theory. They compared the influence of using Twitter and discussion board in a learning management system (e.g., Moodle and Blackboard) on student performance, measured as final grade in a course. The results provide support for the first law, i.e., impact (grade) as a multiplicative resultant of strength, immediacy, and number of interactions among students. Additional interesting insights were observed in this study that educators ought to consider to maximize the integration of new social technologies into pedagogy.

'''Spider mapping''' which is sometimes called Semantic map is a graphic organizer that can be used for [[brainstorming]] ideas, aspects, and thoughts of normally a single theme or topic. It gets its name because of the way it looks when drawn out. Typically done for [[Storytelling|writing stories]], papers, and research brainstorming.

== Main idea ==
The main idea starts in the center, or where ever you choose to place it; sub ideas, views, support for or against, major conflicts and so on stem off of it and they also get stemmed off of throughout the process of mapping out ideas. There are many types of charts&lt;ref&gt;Enchanted learning http://www.enchantedlearning.com/graphicorganizers/spider/&lt;/ref&gt; one can use, spider mapping is the most common.

=== How to plan it ===
A spider map is a [[planning]] tool however additional planning is needed before and after, not every idea can be turned into a story or something writing worthy. There can many steps to take before or after creating a spider map; one is outlining.&lt;ref&gt;Creating a plot outline. http://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/plot-outline.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Getting started: outlining. http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/composition/brainstorm_outline.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How it helps ===
Normally one would draw these charts out, getting ideas on paper is the best first start and when it on paper it out of your head and you can think of how characters or ideas link together, what the conflict is, what plot twists could make to story or idea more successful.

== Subcategories ==
Aside from the main point the sub stems hold the important ideas, people, and views, conflicts to the main character or idea. Many sub characters; Minor characters&lt;ref&gt;what is a Minor character. http://www.writersdigest.com/whats-new/what-is-a-minor-character-understanding-the-minor-characters-role&lt;/ref&gt; play comic relief, supporting, weaker conflict, thought provoking roles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11106">'''Systematic desensitization''', also known as '''graduated exposure therapy''', is a type of [[cognitive behavior therapy]] developed by South African psychiatrist, [[Joseph Wolpe]]. It is used in the field of [[clinical psychology]] to help many  people effectively overcome [[phobias]] and other [[anxiety disorders]] that are based on [[classical conditioning]], and shares the  same elements of both [[cognitive psychology]] and [[applied behavior analysis]]. When used by the [[professional practice of behavior analysis|behavior analysts]], it is based on [[radical behaviorism]] and [[functional analysis (psychology)|functional analysis]], as it incorporates [[counterconditioning]] principles, such as meditation (a private behavior/[[covert conditioning]]) and breathing (which is a public behavior/overt conditioning). From the cognitive psychology perspective, however, cognitions and feelings trigger motor actions.

The process of systematic desensitization occurs in three steps. The first step of systematic desensitization is the identification of an anxiety inducing [[Exposure hierarchy|stimulus hierarchy]]. The second step is the learning of relaxation or coping techniques. When the individual has been taught these skills, he or she must use them in the third step to react towards and overcome situations in the established [[hierarchy]] of fears. The goal of this process is for the individual to learn how to cope with, and overcome the fear in each step of the hierarchy.

==Three steps of desensitization==
There are three main steps that Wolpe identified to successfully [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitize]] an individual.
#[[Exposure hierarchy|Establish anxiety stimulus hierarchy]]. The individual should first identify the items that are causing the anxiety problems. Each item that causes anxiety is given a subjective ranking on the severity of induced anxiety. If the individual is experiencing great anxiety to many different triggers, each item is dealt with separately. For each trigger or stimuli, a list is created to rank the events from least anxiety provoking to the greatest anxiety provoking.
#Learn the mechanism response. Relaxation training, such as meditation, is one type of  best coping strategies.  Wolpe taught his patients relaxation responses because it is not possible to be both relaxed and anxious at the same time. In this method, patients practice tensing and relaxing different parts of the body until the patient reaches a state of serenity.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, J. (1958). Psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is necessary because it provides the patient with a means of controlling their fear, rather than letting it increase to intolerable levels. Only a few sessions are needed for a patient to learn appropriate coping mechanisms. Additional coping strategies include anti-anxiety medicine and breathing exercises. Another example of relaxation is [[cognitive reappraisal]] of imagined outcomes. The therapist might encourage patients to examine what they imagine happening when exposed to the  anxiety-inducing stimulus and then allowing for the client to replace the imagined catastrophic situation with any of the imagined positive outcomes.
#Connect stimulus to the incompatible response or coping method by  counter conditioning. In this step the client completely relaxes and is then presented with the lowest item that was placed on their hierarchy of severity of anxiety phobias. When the patient has reached a state of serenity again after being presented with the first stimuli, the second stimuli that should present a higher level of anxiety is presented. This will help the patient overcome their phobia. This activity is repeated until all the items of the hierarchy of severity anxiety is completed without inducing any anxiety in the client at all . If at any time during the exercise the coping mechanisms fail  or became a failure, or the patient fails to complete the coping mechanism due to the severe anxiety, the exercise is then stopped. When the individual is calm, the last stimuli that is presented without inducing anxiety is presented again and the exercise is  then continued depending on the patient outcomes&lt;ref&gt;Mischel, W., Shoda, Y. &amp; Ayduk, O. Introduction to Personality. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
A client may approach a therapist due to their great phobia of snakes. This is how the therapist would help the client using the three steps of systematic desensitization:
#[[Exposure hierarchy|Establish anxiety stimulus hierarchy]]. A therapist may begin by asking the patient to identify a fear hierarchy. This fear hierarchy would list the relative unpleasantness of various levels of exposure to a snake. For example, seeing a picture of a snake might elicit a low fear rating, compared to live snakes crawling on the individual—the latter scenario becoming highest on the fear hierarchy.
#Learn coping mechanisms or incompatible responses. The therapist would work with the client to learn appropriate coping and relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep muscle relaxation responses.
#Connect the stimulus to the incompatible response or coping method. The client would be presented with increasingly unpleasant levels of the feared stimuli, from lowest to highest—while utilizing the deep relaxation techniques (i.e. progressive muscle relaxation) previously learned. The imagined stimuli to help with a phobia of snakes may include: a picture of a snake; a small snake in a nearby room; a snake in full view; touching of the snake, etc. At each step in the imagined progression, the patient is desensitized to the phobia through exposure to the stimulus while in a state of relaxation. As the fear hierarchy is unlearned, anxiety gradually becomes extinguished.

==Specific phobias==
[[Specific phobia]]s are one class of [[mental disorder]] often treated via systematic desensitization. When persons experience such phobias (for example fears of heights, dogs, snakes, closed spaces, etc.), they tend to avoid the feared stimuli; this avoidance, in turn, can temporarily reduce anxiety but is not necessarily an adaptive way of coping with it. In this regard, patients' avoidance behaviors can become reinforced – a concept defined by the tenets of [[operant conditioning]]. Thus, the goal of systematic desensitization is to overcome avoidance by gradually exposing patients to the phobic stimulus, until that stimulus can be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, A. E., &amp; Wilson, G.T. (1978). Evaluation of behavior therapy: Issues, evidence and research strategies. Cambridge, MA: Ballinger.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpe found that systematic desensitization was successful 90% of the time when treating phobias.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, J. ''The practice of behavior therapy.'' New York: Pergamon Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1947, Wolpe discovered that the cats of Wits University could overcome their fears through gradual and systematic exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Dubord, Greg. "Part 12. Systematic desensitization." Canadian Family Physician 57 (2011): 1299+. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpe studied [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s work on artificial [[Neurosis|neuroses]] and the research done on elimination of children's fears by Watson and Jones. In 1958, Wolpe did a series of experiments on the artificial induction of neurotic disturbance in cats. He found that gradually deconditioning the neurotic animals was the best way to treat them of their neurotic disturbances. Wolpe deconditioned the neurotic cats through different feeding environments. Wolpe knew that this treatment of feeding would not generalize to humans and he instead substituted relaxation as a treatment to relieve the anxiety symptoms.&lt;ref name = Rachman&gt;Rachman, S. Systematic Desensitization. ''Psychological Bulletin'' 67:2, 93–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolpe found that if he presented a client with the actual anxiety inducing stimulus, the relaxation techniques did not work. It was difficult to bring all of the objects into his office because not all anxiety inducing stimuli are physical objects, but instead are concepts. Wolpe instead began to have his clients imagine the anxiety inducing stimulus or look at pictures of the anxiety inducing stimulus, much like the process that is done today.&lt;ref name = Rachman/&gt;

==Recent use==
Desensitization is widely known as one of the most effective therapy techniques. In recent decades, systematic desensitization has been used less and less as a treatment of choice for anxiety disorders. Since 1970 academic research on systematic desensitization has declined, and the current focus has been on other therapies.  In addition, the number of clinicians using systematic desensitization has also declined since 1980. Those clinicians that continue to regularly use systematic desensitization were trained before 1986.  It is believed that the decrease of systematic desensitization by practicing psychologist is due to the increase in other techniques such as [[Flooding (psychology)|flooding]], implosive therapy, and [[Observational learning|participant modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;McGlynn, F., Smitherman, T., Gothard, K.. 2004 “Comment on the Status of Systematic Desensitization”. ''Behavior Modification'', 28: 2, pp. 194–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test anxiety==
Between 25 and 40 percent of students experience [[test anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassady, J.C. (2010). Test anxiety: Contemporary theories and implications for learning. In J.C. Cassady (Ed.), ''Anxiety in schools: The causes, consequences, and solutions for academic anxieties'' (pp. 7–26). New York, NY: Peter Lang,&lt;/ref&gt; Children can suffer from low self-esteem and stress induced symptoms as a result of test anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Deffenbacher, J., &amp; Hazaleus, S. (1985). Cognitive, emotional, and physiological components of test anxiety. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 9, 169180.&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of systematic desensitization can be used by children to help reduce their test anxiety. Children can practice the muscle relaxation techniques by tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. With older children and college students, an explanation of desensitization can help to increase the effectiveness of the process. After these students learn the relaxation techniques, they can create an anxiety inducing [[Exposure hierarchy|hierarchy]]. For test anxiety these items could include not understanding directions, finishing on time or marking the answers properly. Teachers, school counselors or school psychologists could instruct children on the methods of systematic desensitization.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. Sue &amp; Partridge, E. (1995). "Prevent school failure: Treat test anxiety." ''''Preventing School Failure.'''' 40:1, 10–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Neuropsychology}}

'''Thought''' encompasses an “aim-free flow of ideas and associations that can lead to a reality-oriented conclusion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marić |first=Jovan |date=2005 |title=Klinicka psihijatrija |url=http://www.datastatus.rs/proizvod/8040/klinicka-psihijatrija-11-izdanje |location=Belgrade |publisher=Naša knjiga |page=22 |isbn=9788690155910 |author-link=Jovan Maric}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although thinking is an activity of an existential value for humans, there is no consensus as to how it is defined or understood.

Because thought underlies many human actions and interactions, understanding its physical and metaphysical origins, processes, and effects has been a longstanding goal of many academic disciplines including [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[biology]], [[sociology]] and
[[cognitive science]].

Thinking allows humans to make sense of, interpret, represent or [[Conceptual model|model]] the world they experience, and to make predictions about that world. It is therefore helpful to an organism with needs, objectives, and desires as it makes [[plans]] or otherwise attempts to accomplish those goals.

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:Eugene de Blaas A Pensive Moment.jpg|thumb|right|228px|''A Pensive Moment'' (1904), by [[Eugene de Blaas]]]]

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Phenomenology (philosophy)|Philosophy of mind}}
{{Quotation|What is most thought-provoking in these thought-provoking times, is that we are still not thinking.|[[Martin Heidegger]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''What is Called Thinking?''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:ThinkingMan Rodin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[The Thinker]]'' by [[Rodin]] (1840–1917), in the garden of the [[Musée Rodin]]]]
The phenomenology movement in philosophy saw a radical change in the way in which we understand thought. Martin Heidegger's phenomenological analyses of the existential structure of man in ''[[Being and Time]]'' cast new light on the issue of thinking, unsettling traditional cognitive or rational interpretations of man which affect the way we understand thought. The notion of the fundamental role of non-cognitive understanding in rendering possible thematic consciousness informed the discussion surrounding [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Hubert. Dreyfus, Stuart. ''Mind Over Machine''. Macmillan, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenomenology, however, is not the only approach to thinking in modern Western philosophy. Philosophy of mind is a branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the [[mind]], [[mental event]]s, [[mental function]]s, [[mental property|mental properties]], [[consciousness]] and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain. The mind–body problem, i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"/&gt; 

===Mind–body dichotomy===
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}

The mind–body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between [[mind]]s, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kim |first=J. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=Problems in the Philosophy of Mind. Oxford Companion to Philosophy |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;!--Kim, J., "Problems in the Philosophy of Mind". ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.

Human perceptual experiences depend on [[stimulation|stimuli]] which arrive at one's various [[sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in one's mental state, ultimately causing one to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how someone's [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause that individual's [[neuron]]s to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[epistemologist]]s and philosophers of mind from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;''Companion to Metaphysics'', By Jaegwon Kim, Gary S. Rosenkrantz, Ernest Sosa, Contributor Jaegwon Kim, 2nd edition, Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-5298-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functionalism vs. embodiment===
The above reflects a classical, functional description of how we work as cognitive, thinking systems. However the apparently irresolvable mind–body problem is said to be overcome, and bypassed, by the [[embodied cognition]] approach, with its roots in the work of [[Heidegger]], [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[Vygotsky]], [[Merleau-Ponty]] and the pragmatist [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Varela, Francisco J., Thompson, Evan T., and Rosch, Eleanor. (1992). ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience''. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-72021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowart |first=Monica |year=2004 |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |issn= 2161-0002 |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/ |accessdate= 27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach states that the classical approach of separating the mind and analysing its processes is misguided: instead, we should see that the mind, actions of an embodied agent, and the environment it perceives and envisions, are all parts of a whole which determine each other. Therefore, functional analysis of the mind alone will always leave us with the mind–body problem which cannot be solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Di Paolo, Ezequiel|title= Shallow and Deep Embodiment|publisher= University of Sussex|date= 2009  |format=Video, duration: 1:11:38 |url=https://cast.switch.ch/vod/clips/74nrkbwys |accessdate=

==Biology==
{{Main|Neuron}}

A neuron (also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an excitable [[cell (biology)|cell]] in the [[nervous system]] that processes and transmits information by electrochemical [[signal (biology)|signaling]]. Neurons are the core components of the [[Human brain|brain]], the [[vertebrate]] [[spinal cord]], the [[invertebrate]] [[ventral nerve cord]] and the peripheral nerves. A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the [[sense|sensory organs]] that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord that cause [[muscle contraction]]s and affect [[gland]]s. [[Interneuron]]s connect neurons to other neurons within the brain and spinal cord. Neurons respond to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and communicate the presence of stimuli to the central nervous system, which processes that information and sends responses to other parts of the body for action. Neurons do not go through [[mitosis]] and usually cannot be replaced after being destroyed, although [[astrocytes]] have been observed to turn into neurons, as they are sometimes [[pluripotent]].

[[File:Thinking২.jpg|thumb|right|Man thinking on a train journey]]

{{Main|Cognitive psychology}}

Psychologists have concentrated on thinking as an intellectual exertion aimed at finding an answer to a question or the solution of a practical problem. Cognitive psychology is a branch of [[psychology]] that investigates internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and language. The school of thought arising from this approach is known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], which is interested in how people mentally represent information processing. It had its foundations in the [[Gestalt psychology]] of [[Max Wertheimer]], [[Wolfgang Köhler]], and [[Kurt Koffka]],&lt;ref&gt;''Gestalt Theory'', By Max Wertheimer. Hayes Barton Press, 1944, {{ISBN|978-1-59377-695-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who provided a theory of stages/phases that describes children's cognitive development.

Cognitive psychologists use [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] and experimental approaches to understand, diagnose, and solve problems, concerning themselves with the mental processes which mediate between stimulus and response. They study various aspects of thinking, including the [[psychology of reasoning]], and how people make decisions and choices, solve problems, as well as engage in creative discovery and imaginative thought. Cognitive theory contends that solutions to problems either take the form of [[algorithm]]s: rules that are not necessarily understood but promise a solution, or of [[heuristics]]: rules that are understood but that do not always guarantee solutions. [[Cognitive science]] differs from cognitive psychology in that algorithms that are intended to simulate human behavior are implemented or implementable on a computer. In other instances, solutions may be found through insight, a sudden awareness of relationships.

In [[developmental psychology]], [[Jean Piaget]] was a pioneer in the study of the development of thought from birth to maturity. In his [[theory of cognitive development]], thought is based on actions on the environment. That is, Piaget suggests that the environment is understood through assimilations of objects in the available schemes of action and these accommodate to the objects to the extent that the available schemes fall short of the demands. As a result of this interplay between assimilation and accommodation, thought develops through a sequence of stages that differ qualitatively from each other in mode of representation and complexity of inference and understanding. That is, thought evolves from being based on perceptions and actions at the sensorimotor stage in the first two years of life to internal representations in early childhood. Subsequently, representations are gradually organized into logical structures which first operate on the concrete properties of the reality, in the stage of concrete operations, and then operate on abstract principles that organize concrete properties, in the stage of formal operations.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1951). ''Psychology of Intelligence''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the Piagetian conception of thought was integrated with information processing conceptions. Thus, thought is considered as the result of mechanisms that are responsible for the representation and processing of information. In this conception, [[speed of processing]], [[cognitive control]], and [[working memory]] are the main functions underlying thought. In the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], the development of thought is considered to come from increasing speed of processing, enhanced [[cognitive control]], and increasing working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Demetriou |first=A. |year=1998 |title=Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K. F. M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology''. pp. 179–269. London: Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Positive psychology]] emphasizes the positive aspects of human psychology as equally important as the focus on mood disorders and other negative symptoms. In ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues]]'', [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] list a series of positive characteristics. One person is not expected to have every strength, nor are they meant to fully capsulate that characteristic entirely. The list encourages positive thought that builds on a person's strengths, rather than how to "fix" their "symptoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |year=2011 |title =Psychology Second Edition, "Positive Psychology" |location= New York}} 584 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalysis==
{{Main|Id, ego and super-ego|Unconscious mind}}
The "id", "ego" and "super-ego" are the three parts of the "[[psychic apparatus]]" defined in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[ego psychology|structural model]] of the psyche; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described. According to this model, the uncoordinated instinctual trends are encompassed by the "id", the organized realistic part of the psyche is the "ego", and the critical, moralizing function is the "super-ego".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Teach Yourself Freud |first= Ruth |last=Snowden |edition= illustrated |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-07-147274-6 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] was considered by Freud throughout the evolution of his [[psychoanalytic]] theory to be a [[sentient]] force of [[Will (philosophy)|will]] influenced by human desire and yet operating well below the perceptual [[conscious mind]]. For Freud, the unconscious is the storehouse of instinctual desires, needs and psychic drives. While past thoughts and reminiscences may be concealed from immediate consciousness, they direct the thoughts and feelings of the individual from the realm of the unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Geraskov |first=Emil Asenov |title=The internal contradiction and the unconscious sources of activity |website=The Journal of Psychology |date=November 1, 1994 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16528826.html |accessdate=April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For psychoanalysis, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, rather only what is actively repressed from conscious thought or what the person is averse to knowing consciously. In a sense this view places the self in relationship to their unconscious as an adversary, warring with itself to keep what is unconscious hidden. If a person feels pain, all he can think of is alleviating the pain. Any of his desires, to get rid of pain or enjoy something, command the mind what to do. For Freud, the unconscious was a repository for socially unacceptable ideas, wishes or desires, traumatic memories, and painful emotions put out of mind by the mechanism of [[psychological repression]]. However, the contents did not necessarily have to be solely negative. In the psychoanalytic view, the unconscious is a force that can only be recognized by its effects—it expresses itself in the [[symptom]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge companion to Freud'', By Jerome Neu. Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 29, {{ISBN|9780521377799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
[[File:Thought bubble.svg|thumb|A "[[thought bubble]]" is an illustration depicting thought.]]
{{Main|Social psychology}}

Social psychology is the study of how people and groups interact. Scholars in this [[interdisciplinary]] area are typically either [[psychology|psychologists]] or [[sociologists]], though all social psychologists employ both the [[individual]] and the [[group (sociology)|group]] as their [[unit of analysis|units of analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hrydA45eCk0C&amp;q=social+psychology&amp;dq=social+psychology&amp;pgis=1 ''Social Psychology''], David G. Myers, McGraw Hill, 1993. {{ISBN|0-07-044292-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their similarity, psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals, approaches, methods, and terminology. They also favor separate [[academic journals]] and [[learned society|professional societies]]. The greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, W.H. (1989). Some reflections on the golden age of interdisciplinary social psychology. ''Annual Review of Sociology'', Vol. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years, some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvz5Y8e1N84C ''The Psychology of the Social''], Uwe Flick, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-58851-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[collective unconscious]], sometimes known as collective subconscious, is a term of [[analytical psychology]], [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Carl Jung]]. It is a part of the [[unconscious mind]], shared by a [[society]], a people, or all [[human]]ity, in an interconnected system that is the product of all common experiences and contains such concepts as [[science]], [[religion]], and [[morality]]. While [[Freud]] did not distinguish between an "individual psychology" and a "collective psychology", Jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the [[personal unconscious|personal]] [[unconscious mind|subconscious]] particular to each human being. The collective unconscious is also known as "a reservoir of the experiences of our species".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Peter S., Mrazek, David, Knapp, Penelope K., [[Laurence Steinberg|Steinberg, Laurence]], Pfeffer, Cynthia, Schowalter, John, &amp; Shapiro, Theodore. (Dec 1997) "Evolution and revolution in child psychiatry: ADHD as a disorder of adaptation. (attention-deficit hyperactivity syndrome)". ''Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry''. 36. p. 1672. (10). July 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Definitions" chapter of Jung's [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] work ''Psychological Types'', under the definition of "collective" Jung references ''representations collectives'', a term coined by [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] in his 1910 book ''How Natives Think''. Jung says this is what he describes as the collective unconscious. Freud, on the other hand, did not accept the idea of a collective unconscious.

== Debate about inclusion of transgender people in the military ==
{{Globalize|section|date=November 2017}}

=== Arguments against inclusion ===

There are arguments against the inclusion of transgender people in military service. One argument is based on the view that being transgender is a [[mental illness]], and as such transgender individuals are unfit for service.&lt;ref name="hcss"/&gt; This argument follows a high incidence of depression and suicide manifest in transgender individuals. This is especially pertinent in individuals who have had [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex-reassignment surgery]] and are unsatisfied with the results; in such cases severe depression is prevalent.&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;Clements T.I., Wicks R.E.,"Transsexualism and Flight Safety" ''Aerospace Medicine Branch Education'' USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks Air Force Base, Texas [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a229995.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hormone therapy]] can affect mood and a sense of well-being, a factor that counts against inclusion of transgender people and its effect on service capability.&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"/&gt; Besides the well-being argument of hormone treatment, complications may arise due to hormone treatments. Possible complications arising from [[estrogen]] and [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] therapies include an increased risk of [[thromboembolic disease]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[breast cancer]], fertility problems, [[stroke]], abnormal liver function, [[renal disease]], [[endometrial cancer]], and [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="loc.gov"&gt;Major Bunn S.A., ''Straight talk: The implications of repealing "Don't ask, Don't tell" and the rationale for preserving aspects of the current policy'' 203 MIL. L Rev. 207, 236 (2010) [https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Military_Law_Review/pdf-files/203-spring-2010.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these could cause significant issues to effective military service, especially when deployed in remote areas or in field training settings.

A further argument is that in order to have an effective, smooth-running military, there must be cohesion within the unit. It is argued that transgender individuals would have a negative impact on unit cohesion. "The bonds of trust among individual service members" are vital.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan D., Rosenmann A, ''Unit social cohesion in the Israeli military as a case study of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'' 33 Pol. Psychol. 419, 422 (2012)l&lt;/ref&gt; There is a fear that if transgender personnel be allowed to serve openly, morale will be detrimentally affected. But this argument neglects to deal with the question of what kinds of structural accommodations might be needed to maintain morale and unit cohesion in such situations. Military service forces members into very intimate living quarters. Requiring members to live in situations that make them feel disconcerted and uncomfortable may result in their performance being undermined.&lt;ref name="hcss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt; The logistics of accommodating a group of individuals with such varying degrees of gender representation would be staggering. The costs alone of allowing transgender people to serve counts heavily against inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Needs Citation&lt;/ref&gt; Not only logistically and structurally, but also in medical costs. It is estimated that a male-to-female transition can cost between US$7,000 and $24,000; female-to-male transition can exceed US$50,000.&lt;ref name="Sex Reassignment Surgery"&gt;''[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Sex-Reassignment-Surgery.html Sex Reassignment Surgery]'' Encyclopaedia of Surgery, Retrieved 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Which, depending on policy, the military may have to fund.

=== Arguments for inclusion ===

By excluding a demographic from equal service, militaries are overtly intensifying the stigma of that group's civic inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;Binkin M., Eitelberg M.j., ''Blacks and the military,'' (1982) Washington, DC, Brookings Institution&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the notion that all citizens are obligated to serve their nations if the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;Herek G.M., "Sexual orientation and military service: A social science perspective," ''American Psychologist'' 48, no. 5 (1993) pp. 538-549&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing transgender military personnel to serve openly without fear of exclusion would be a huge step toward equality. It has been recognized by some academics that the inclusion of all LGBT personnel in the military is more than a mere human rights issue, it is argued that for militaries to survive in the twenty-first century diversity is critical.&lt;ref name="hcss"/&gt;

With advancements in the current understanding of human experience, sexual identity is now better understood. Where being transgender was once considered a [[paraphilic disorder]], the current [[DSM V|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] places being transgender in a separate chapter, terming the condition [[gender dysphoria]]. It is argued that militaries that exclude transgender people on grounds of mental illness, whose policies pathologize gender dysphoria, are at odds with the current medical understanding. This argument requires that transgender personnel be treated by the same level of medical care as all other personnel, in accordance with established medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gale S.P. (co-chair), Shannon M. (co-chair), "Report of the Planning Commission on Transgender Military Service" ''A nonpartisan national commission offering implementation guidance for the inclusion of openly-serving transgender personnel in the US military'' (Aug 2014) Palm Centre Blueprints for sound public policy&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts argue that there is absolutely no empirical evidence that supports the argument that transgender people are unfit for service. Often cited are factors such as a supposed predisposition of transgender individuals to problems such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts; this is countered by the prevalence of these same issues in the LGB community, yet in many countries their service is not excluded.&lt;ref&gt;King M. et al., "A systematic review of mental disorder, suicide, and deliberate self harm in lesbian, gay and bisexual people," ''BMC Psychiatry'' 8 (2008) pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://lgbtpov.frontiersla.com/2012/10/24/carpenter-why-lgb-people-should-care-about-trans-bias-in-the-military/ ''Carpenter: Why LGB people should care about trans bias in the military'']'' Tom Carpenter &amp; Karen Ocamb, LGBt POV, (24 October 2012) Retrieved 28 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; By creating a more accepting environment, distress that transgender personnel feel might be mitigated if they may serve openly with full support.&lt;ref&gt;Ross A., "The Invisible Army: Why the military needs to rescind its ban on transgender service members" 23 ''S. Cal. Interdisc. L.J.'' (2014) p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst militaries often cite the high medical cost of transgender people, they fail to reconcile this argument with current standards with other service members. For example, militaries often allow hormone treatments for an array of reasons and conditions, besides gender dysphoria; a common hormone treatment being contraceptive. Furthermore, the often cited risks of cross hormone treatment are rare,&lt;ref&gt;Asscheman H. et al., "A long-term follow up study of mortality in transsexual receiving treatment with cross-sex hormones," ''European Journal of Endocrinology'' 164, 4 (2011) pp. 635&lt;/ref&gt; and not likely to cause any significant issues to the military. Whilst the cost of gender reassignment surgery is high,&lt;ref name="Sex Reassignment Surgery"/&gt; it is suggested that fewer than 2% of transgender members per year will choose to undergo gender reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="Elders"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elders |first=M.

The 18 confirmed cases are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps one of the most supporting arguments is based on the experiences of the 18 countries that currently allow transgender service. Research on the impacts of allowing LGBT to serve openly in the [[Israel Defense Forces#LGBT people|Israeli Defense Forces]], [[Sexual orientation and the military of the United Kingdom|British Armed Forces]], and [[Sexual orientation and the Canadian military|Canadian Armed Forces]] found no necessary negative impacts on performance, unit cohesion or morality.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin A., Levitt M., "Homosexuality and the Israel Defense Forces: Did Lifting the Gay Ban Undermine Military Performance?," 27 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' 4 ( 2001) p. 544; Belkin and Evans, "The Effects of Including Gay and Lesbian Soldiers in the British Armed Forces," 4; Belkin A., McNichol J., "Homosexual Personnel Policy in the Canadian Forces: Did Lifting the Gay Ban Undermine Military Performance?," 56 ''Canadian International Journal'' 1 (2000) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of unit cohesion can also be demonstrated by a social study conducted less than one year prior to the repeal of the ban preventing transgender personnel from serving openly in the United States military. Morten G. Ender, David E. Rohall, and Michael D. Matthews presented the American military academy, Reserve Officers Training Corps, and civilian undergraduates with a survey to assess the general attitude on the prospect of the transgender community serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. After statistical analysis, 50.8% of individuals disagreed with the ban. In regards to productivity, 72.6% of subjects say that transgender inclusion would have no impact on their ability to do their job. Finally, on the subject of visibility, 21.8% of those interviewed said they would want transgender individuals to tell them their gender preferences, 56.1% said no preference. Overall, based on this study one year prior to the ban, the majority of the people that participated in the survey showed overwhelming support towards the inclusion of the transgender community in the United States military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ender|first1=Morton G.|last2=Matthews|first2=Michael D.|last3=Rohall|first3=David E.|title=Cadet and Civilian Undergraduate Attitudes toward Transgender People|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|date=2016|volume=42.2|pages=427–435}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2017, ruling that a renewed ban within the US military should not go into force, US District Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]] stated that the evidence presented up to that time showed that ''"all of the reasons proffered ... for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself"''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-transgender-20171030-story.html|title=Federal court blocks Trump's ban on transgender people in the military|first=W.

== Status of transgender people in the military by country ==

=== Australia ===
Eighteen years after the [[Australian Defence Force]] lifted their ban on gay and lesbian service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia Ends a Prohibition On Homosexuals in Military|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/24/world/australia-ends-a-prohibition-on-homosexuals-in-military.html|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=29 April 2015|location=Canberra|date=24 November 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ADF reversed policy that excluded transgender people from military service. The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017.&lt;ref name="18 countries" /&gt;

It is believed that the Australian Defence Force was the last agency whose policy specifically allowed for firing employees for transitioning gender.&lt;ref name="Dennett"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dennett|first1=Harley|title=Let them serve: Defence drops ban on transgender soldiers|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2010/09/15/let-them-serve-defence-drops-ban-on-transgender-soldiers/|publisher=Crikey|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADF policy supports diversity in the military identifying [[LGBTI]] as a main priority, whose key objective is to position the ADF as an employer of choice, who as an organisation respects and supports the inclusion of gender diverse persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/code/strategy/priorities.asp Australian Government; Department of Defence: Our Identified Priorities] retrieved 29 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Australian law formally codified protections against discrimination based on gender identity by including federal protections for LGBTI in the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/sexual-orientation-sex-gender-identity/projects/new-protection New protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status] Australian Human Rights Commission, 1 August 2013; Retrieved 29 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 15 transgender service member who are openly living as their identified gender,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changelingaspects.com/PDF/Scan0031.pdf The Secret I Kept for 50 Years] Australian Women's Weekly, Jan 2014, Retrieved 29 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; with the support of ADF ranking officials who have been vocally committed to creating an inclusive and diverse military environment.

In a One Plus One interview with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC News]] ADF's highest ranking transgender service member [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Cate McGregor]] speechwriter to the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of Army]], [[Lieutenant General]] [[David Morrison]] [[Order of Australia|AO]], stated that the Chief of Army took the view that the "army could not survive if it became a demographic ghetto" and described an underbelly within the military whose culture was to exclude those who are different.&lt;ref name="oneplus"&gt;{{cite web|title=One Plus One (Video)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-05/one-plus-one-lieutenant-colonel-cate-mcgregor/4802564|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the Jedi Council sex scandal&lt;ref name="Canberra Criminal Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jedi Council (Online)|url=https://canberracriminallaw.wordpress.com/tag/jedi-council/|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.gov.au/Our-work/Speeches-and-transcripts/Chief-of-Army-Press-Conference Transcript] of Morrison's press conference on 2013 email scandal, 13 June 2013, www.army.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; Chief of Army released a strongly worded statement urging all service members to show moral courage, to stand against any person degrading another individual.

As of 2014, France allowed transgender people to serve openly in its military forces.&lt;ref name=Elders /&gt; The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017.&lt;ref name="18 countries" /&gt;

In France, the military is sometimes initially more accepting of transgender service members than civilian authorities are, at least in some localities and jurisdictions, but they are also influenced by rulings of civilian courts which have strict requirements about changing identity documents. One service member was whipsawed by initially positive reception in the military, later overruled after a civilian court decision.

In 2009, a transgender [[Adjutant#France|Adjutant]] in the [[French Air Force]] who had already served 18 years as a man, returned to her unit in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] as a woman after a sick leave. Her superiors took stock of the situation, and provided the necessary uniforms and military papers with her new name. Delphine Ravisé-Giard was reintegrated into the military smoothly and without incident. On the other hand, she had difficulties in civilian life, such as when presenting her driver's license, passport, or other papers. The military then issued a request to the Nancy {{ill|Tribunal de grande instance (France)|fr||lt=District Court}} to have her gender and name altered on her birth certificate, but their decision was negative based on the fact that she had not yet undergone [[sex reassignment surgery]] so her situation was reversible. A 1992 decision by the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]]'' (Court of Appeals) requires those wishing to change their legal documents to show proof of being diagnosed with "transsexual syndrome" which is listed as a long-term psychiatric disorder in France, and to have undergone surgical intervention, but the Adjutant declared that she had no "long-term psychiatric disorder", and any question about any surgical interventions she had or didn't have was her private affair. Her lawyer insinuated that the real reason for the denial had to do with her ability to still have a child, and that the court's objective was sterilization before they would accord a legal name and gender change. The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] of the [[European Council]] said that a transgender person "seeking to have their gender identity legally recognized should not be forced to submit to sterilization or to any other medical treatment."&lt;ref name=Tissier-2009&gt;{{cite web |language=French |last1=Tissier |first1=Julia |date=13 August 2009 |title=Femme à l’armée, homme au civil |trans-title=In the Army, a Woman; to City Hall, a Man |url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2009/08/13/femme-a-l-armee-homme-au-civil_575661 |website=[[Libération]] |location=Paris |accessdate=3 November 2017 |subscription= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in December, following the District Court decision, [[Hervé Morin]], the [[Minister of Defense (France)|Minister of Defense]], ordered her to turn in her military papers, which she did. Meanwhile, she discovered that the name on her pay stub reverted to her old name, that the military supplement that women service members receive for feminine undergarments had been removed, and that the military was even going to dock her pay for the supplement she received while serving two years as a woman.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |language=French |last1=Mercier |first1=Philippe |date=11 February 2010 |title=Nancy: militaire transgenre au rapport |trans-title=Transgender Soldier On Report |url=http://www.estrepublicain.fr/actualite/2010/02/11/nancy-militaire-transgenre-au-rapport |website=[[L'Est Républicain]] |issn=1760-4958 |publisher=Societe Du Journal L'est Republicain |location=Nancy |accessdate=3 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Iran requires all male citizens over age 18 to serve in the military, but transgender women, who are classified as having mental disorders. New military identity cards listed the subsection of the law dictating this exemption. This practice of identifying transgender individuals put them at risk of physical abuse and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277485.pdf IRAN 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, identity documents may not be changed. All males must show up for the military conscription event on draft day, and [[kathoey]]s are not exempt from this requirement. It is possible for [[kathoey]]s to get an exemption certificate that will allow them to avoid service, but they must still attend, in order to present the document and be dismissed. As a result, on draft day, lines of people awaiting processing may include transgender women in makeup and feminine attire, waiting along with the male draftees. Contrary to the wide impression of acceptance of transgender women in Thailand, many complain about being treated as second-class citizens, and of the stress of being undressed or publicly humiliated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transsexuals are forced to stand in line for army conscription in dresses and skirts as 100,000 21-year-old men are drafted into the Thai military |last1= |first1= |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4381806/Trans-women-forced-army-conscription-Thailand.html |date=5 April 2017 |website=Mail Online |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Ltd]] |accessdate=3 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nightmare looms for transgender Thais at army draft |last1=Tanakasempipat |first1=Patpicha |last2=Kittisilpa |first2=Juarawee |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-armydraft/nightmare-looms-for-transgender-thais-at-army-draft-idUSKBN1780FS |date=5 April 2017 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher= |accessdate=3 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Transgender personnel in the United States military}}
The United States' military policy previously allowed for exclusion of transgender people from service on medical grounds. While gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members were allowed to serve openly since 2011, transgender service members risked discharge if they did not pass as their assigned sex. This required that service members conceal their gender identities throughout service.&lt;ref&gt;Ross A., "The invisible army: why the military needs to rescind its ban on transgender service members," ''Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal'' 23 (2014) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;
