'''Armenian Golgotha''' ({{lang-hy|Հայ Գողգոթան}}) is a memoir written by [[Grigoris Balakian]] about his eyewitness account of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. The memoir was released in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittemore|first1=Katharine|title=Seven books on the Armenian genocide - The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2015/09/25/seven-books-armenian-genocide/vXumdvQTsNR061mOupX7xJ/story.html|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=BostonGlobe.com|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 1, about his life prior to and during the Armenian Genocide, was released in 1922. Volume 2, about his life as a fugitive after the Genocide, was released in 1959. Originally published in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], the memoir was later published in various languages including an English translation by [[Peter Balakian]], Balakian's great-nephew, with Aris Sevag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Carlin|title="Armenian Golgotha: A Memoir of the Armenian Genocide, 1915-18" by Grigoris Balakian|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/chi-books-review-armenian-golgotha-memoir-balakian-story.html|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Upon the release of the English translation in 2009, many publications reviewed the account. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' referred to the account as "a fascinating first-hand testimony to a monumental crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidson|first1=Amy|title=Armenian Golgotha|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/04/armenian-golgotha|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=The New Yorker|date=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elie Wiesel]], the author best known for the novel [[Night (book)|Night]], referred to the account as "heartbreaking" because he believes that the memory presented by Balakian "must remain a lesson for more than one generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Praise From Elie Wiesel and Others for Grigoris Balakian’s Armenian Golgotha: A Memoir of The Armenian Genocide|url=http://asbarez.com/60401/early-praise-from-elie-wiesel-and-others-for-grigoris-balakians-armenian-golgotha-a-memoir-of-the-armenian-genocide/|website=Asbarez.com|accessdate=23 June 2016|date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Republic]]'' praised the account as "a powerful and important book" because "it takes place as one of the key first-hand sources for understanding the Armenian Genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Republic|first1=The New|title=The Evil That Men Do|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/62933/the-evil-men-do|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=New Republic|date=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Chris Bohjalian]] (a second-generation Armenian American) felt personally connected by understanding what happened to his great-grandparents. Bohjalian opined that Balakian's account was "rich with evidence of the Turkish government's complicity and its leaders' premeditation." Bohjalian also hoped that the account would be widely read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bohjalian|first1=Chris|title=A Deadly Time Brought to Life|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/03/AR2009040301894.html|work=Washington Post|accessdate=28 November 2017|date=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''art dealer''' is a person or company that buys and sells [[works of art]]. Art dealers' professional associations serve to set high standards for accreditation or membership and to support art exhibitions and shows.&lt;ref name="ADAA"&gt;[http://www.artdealers.org/dnloads/adaa_guide.pdf Collector's Guide to Working with Art Dealers, 45th Anniversary Edition, The Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), New York] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008045449/http://www.artdealers.org/dnloads/adaa_guide.pdf |date=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
An art dealer typically seeks out various [[artist]]s to represent, and builds relationships with [[art collector|collectors]] and [[museum]]s whose interests are likely to match the work of the represented artists. Some dealers are able to anticipate [[market trends]], while some prominent dealers may be able to influence the taste of the market. Many dealers specialize in a particular style, period, or region. They often travel internationally, frequenting [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]], [[auctions]], and artists' [[studio]]s looking for good buys, little-known treasures, and exciting new works. When dealers buy works of art, they resell them either in their galleries or directly to collectors. Those who deal in [[contemporary art]] usually exhibit artists' works in their galleries, and take a percentage of the price the works sell for.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7u8s0SN7KcC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=art+dealer%27s+percentage+of+the+artwork+price&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AAbXUoOSH-iy0QXf44DQDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=art%20dealer's%20percentage%20of%20the%20artwork%20price&amp;f=false Alan D. Bryce, ''Art Smart: The Intelligent Guide to Investing in the Canadian Art Market''], Dundurn, 2007. {{ISBN|1550026763}}, 9781550026764&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job requirements==
[[File:Gillis van Tilborgh - A Picture Gallery.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Picture Gallery'' by [[Gillis van Tilborch]], 1660s]]
Art dealers often study the [[history of art]] before entering on their careers. Related careers that often cross-over include [[curator]]s of museums and [[art auction]] firms are industry-related careers.&lt;ref name="ADAA" /&gt; Gallery owners who do not succeed may seek to work for more successful galleries. Others pursue careers as [[art critic]]s, academics, curators of museums or auction houses, or practicing artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=12 Career: Art Dealer, The Princeton Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dealers have to understand the business side of the art world. They keep up with trends in the market and are knowledgeable about the style of art people want to buy. They figure out how much they should pay for a piece and then estimate the resale price. They are also often passionate and knowledgeable about art. Those who deal with contemporary art promote new artists, creating a market for the artists' works and securing financial success for themselves.  The art world is subject to economic booms and bust just like any other market. Art dealers must be economically conscious in order to maintain their livelihoods. The mark ups of art work must be carefully monitored. If prices and profits are too large, then investments may be devalued should an overstock or economic downturn occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/04/15/smbusiness/singing_in_rain_art.fsb/index.htm?section=magazines_fsb | author=Cowley, Stacy | title=Amid art boom, dealers brace for a bust | publisher=Fortune Small Business | date=2008-04-16 | accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine an artwork's value, dealers inspect the objects or paintings closely, and compare the fine details with similar pieces. Some dealers with many years of experience learn to identify unsigned works by examining stylistic features such as brush strokes, color, form. They recognize the styles of different periods and individual artists. Often art dealers are able to distinguish authentic works from [[forgeries]] (although even dealers are sometimes fooled).&lt;ref name="ADAA" /&gt;

==Notable art dealers==
[[File:Frans Francken the Younger - A visit to the Art Dealer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''A visit to the Art Dealer'' by [[Frans Francken the Younger]], early 1600s]]
* [[Guillam Forchondt|Guillam Forchondt the Elder]] (1608–1678)

A 17th century Flemish Baroque painter and art dealer based in Antwerp.  He established an important art dealing business with international connections in Europe maintained by his extended family. He originally trained as a painter and cabinet maker but built a reputation through his international art business.  His children became art dealers who settled in various cities in Europe such as Venice, Paris, Vienna, Prague, Linz, [[Passau]] and [[Cadiz]] where they supplied an elite clientele with a variety of art objects.  When in the 1670s Flanders suffered a severe economic downturn due mostly to an invasion by the French, Guillam Forchondt and his brother Melchior the Younger became art entrepreneurs by hiring lesser painters to create group projects such as large commissioned copies of famous works or large decorative objects. At one point, the ''Brothers Forchondt'' had 60 painters in service for export to France, Austria, Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/28613 Guilliam Forchondt] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her establishment The Downtown Gallery, one of the first in Greenwich Village, introduced and showcased many modern art luminaries. Halpert died at age 70 a multimillionaire, with [[Sotheby's]] crediting her with having put modernist painting auctions on the map. Its posthumous sale of her collection went for million in 1973.

* [[Klaus Perls]]
Perls (1912–2008) was born and raised in Berlin. He studied art history in Munich, but was forced to finish his education in Basel, Switzerland, as the Nazis were no longer allowing degrees for Jews.

'''Beit Lessin Theater''' ({{lang-he-n|תיאטרון בית ליסין}}, [[Transliteration|translit]]: ''Teatron Bet Lessin'') is a theater in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].
==History==
Established in 1978 by [[Yaakov Agmon]] for the [[Histadrut]],&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ben-Zvi. ''Theater in Israel''. University of Michigan Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-472-10607-4}}. pg.22. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=v_tXKyDG5j4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=beit%20lessin&amp;f=false ''Theater in Israel'' on Google Books ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the years the theater has shown over a thousand contemporary American and European plays, as well as original productions. In 1993, [[Zippi Pines]] started managing the theater. It was separated from the Histadrut and started showing mostly original Israeli material reflecting the political and social situation in Israel.

In 2003, the theater moved from Lessin House to the old residence of the Cameri Theater after it was remodeled. This venue having more seats allowed larger and more expensive plays to be produced, such as [[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]] and [[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]].

The theater's production "Mikveh" won the Israeli Theater Prize in 2005.

'''''Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich''''' is a 2015 [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestselling]] book by [[Peter Schweizer]] in which he investigates donations made to the [[Clinton Foundation]] by foreign entities, paid speeches made by [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], and the state of the Clintons' finances since leaving the White House in 2001. It was published by [[Broadside Books]], a division of [[HarperCollins]] and was adapted into both a film and a graphic novel.

==Origins==
Schweizer wrote the book using researchers from the [[Government Accountability Institute]] (GAI). The Mercer Family Foundation funded the $2.6 million cost of producing the book with a $1.7 million contribution to the Institute in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mider|first=Zachary|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-18/-clinton-cash-book-got-most-of-its-funding-from-hedge-fund-star |title=‘Clinton Cash’ Book Got Most of Its Funding From One Hedge Fund Star|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=January 18, 2017|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Andy|url= https://www.investopedia.com/news/trump-donor-robert-mercer-funded-book-clinton-cash-dealings/ |title=Trump Donor Robert Mercer Funded Book on Clinton Cash Dealings|newspaper=Investopedia|date=January 19, 2017|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was more than GAI's entire budget for the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Jane|url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency |title=‘The Reclusive Hedge-Fund Tycoon Behind the Trump Presidency

==Synopsis==
[[File:Hillary Clinton sworn in as SecState 1-21-09 clinton-SIC-1.21.09 600 1.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Hillary Clinton]] being sworn in as Secretary of State in 2009. Her husband and former U.S. President, [[Bill Clinton]], holds the Bible.]]

''Clinton Cash'' is an investigation of the foreign benefactors of Bill and Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.&lt;ref name=russia&gt;{{cite news|last1=Becker|first1=Jo|last2=McIntire|first2=Mike|title=Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html|accessdate=28 August 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It investigates alleged connections between Clinton Foundation donors and Hillary Clinton’s work at the State Department.&lt;ref name=politico&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karni|first1=Annie|title='Clinton Cash' publisher corrects '7 or 8' inaccurate passages|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/clinton-cash-publisher-corrects-7-or-8-inaccurate-passages-117946|accessdate=28 August 2015|publisher=Politico|date=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book argues that the Clinton family accepted lavish donations and speaking fees from foreign donors at times when the State Department was considering whether to award large contracts to groups and people affiliated with those donors.&lt;ref name=Newsweek0501&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wofford|first1=Taylor|title=Everything You Need to Know About 'Clinton Cash'|url=http://www.newsweek.com/everything-you-need-know-about-clinton-cash-327694|accessdate=28 August 2015|publisher=Newsweek|date=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those donors include [[Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi]], an Ethiopian and Saudi Arabian billionaire businessman.

The book has eleven chapters. Some chapters focus on particular transactions or deals, such as the creation of UrAsia Energy and [[Uranium One]] in [[Kazakhstan]], and the connection shareholders had and have to the Clintons. Other chapters focus on a broader set of relationships, particularly with regard to Bill Clinton’s paid speeches during the years Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, and whether those paying for his speeches had significant business before the State Department.&lt;ref name=Newsweek0501 /&gt; Schweizer dubs the Clintons' blend of government service and private remuneration the “Clinton blur.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Joshua|last2=Epstein|first2=Jennifer|title=Author Alleges Bill Clinton Just Quit Education Company Because of 'Clinton Cash'|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-25/author-alleges-bill-clinton-just-quit-education-company-because-of-clinton-cash-|accessdate=28 August 2015|publisher=Bloomberg|date=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and [[Fox News]] were granted exclusive agreements with the book's author to pursue the story lines found in the book.&lt;ref name=public&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Margaret|title=An ‘Exclusive’ Arrangement on a Clinton Book, and Many Questions|url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/an-exclusive-arrangement-on-a-clinton-book-and-many-questions/?_r=0|accessdate=28 August 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' faced considerable criticism for this arrangement from both its readers and from other media outlets.&lt;ref name=public/&gt; The paper's own public editor, [[Margaret Sullivan (journalist)|Margaret Sullivan]], said the arrangement was "troubling" and lacked transparency.&lt;ref name=public/&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' wrote that Schweizer was not a responsible journalist and that the arrangement showed that right-wing forces were luring the mainstream press into giving attention to gossip and innuendo much as they had during various supposed Clinton controversies of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The right’s new Clinton obsession just went mainstream: How a sketchy Hillary "exposé" hooked the New York Times |work=Salon |date=April 21, 2015 |url=https://www.salon.com/2015/04/21/inside_the_rights_new_clinton_cash_obsession_the_sketchy_new_hillary_expose_that_hooked_the_new_york_times/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Media Matters]] criticized these two newspapers for failing to report in a timely fashion on inaccuracies that had been discovered in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/05/01/after-forming-clinton-cash-exclusives-ny-times/203492|title=After Forming Clinton Cash "Exclusives," NY Times, Washington Post Fail To Report On Book's Errors|date=30 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinton campaign reaction ===
The day the book was published, Hillary Clinton's campaign set up a portal called "The Briefing" on its official website. The Briefing is designed to rebut the allegations made in Schweizer's book. Clinton's campaign manager, [[John Podesta]], wrote: "The book has zero evidence to back up its outlandish claims... While we will not be consumed by these kinds of attacks, we will also not let them go unchallenged."&lt;ref&gt;Haberman, Maggie.

Accessed: May 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Various spokespeople for Hillary and Bill Clinton disputed the book's allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanton|first1=John|title=Spokesman Disputes Book: Bill Clinton Not Paid For Series Of Speeches|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/spokesman-bill-clinton-was-not-paid-for-speeches-book-says-h#.sypZZdWmv2|accessdate=1 April 2016|publisher=buzzfeed.com|date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. concerning the charges that Clinton was paid for speeches by Irish billionaire [[Denis O'Brien]] of [[Digicel]] in exchange for help in securing telecommunications contracts in Haiti in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/spokesman-bill-clinton-was-not-paid-for-speeches-book-says-h#.nyXB0X8mD|title='Spokesman Disputes Book: Bill Clinton Not Paid For Series Of Speeches|date=April 28, 2015|publisher=buzzfeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial reception==
''Clinton Cash'' debuted at number two on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].

A paperback edition of the book released in 2016 made the relevant ''Times'' best seller list as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/paperback-nonfiction/?_r%3D0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6iGXZr0Zt?url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/paperback-nonfiction/?_r=0 |archivedate=2016-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]] of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', the book sold approximately 200,000 copies, in hardcover and paperback as of July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/hillary-and-bill-clintons-story-of-money-grubbing-and-sleaze/article/2003412|title=Hillary and Bill Clinton's Story of Money-Grubbing and Sleaze|date=21 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reaction and actions taken==
Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', academic and political activist (and brief 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential primary opponent of Hillary Clinton) [[Lawrence Lessig]] wrote "On any fair reading, the pattern of behavior that Schweizer has charged is corruption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lessig|first1=Lawrence|title=Democrats embrace the logic of 'Citizens United'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-clintons-citizens-united-and-21st-century-corruption/2015/05/08/7f11a0d6-f57b-11e4-b2f3-af5479e6bbdd_story.html|accessdate=28 August 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Freeman reviewed the book for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', writing that "Almost every page of the fascinating ''Clinton Cash''... will be excruciating reading for partisans on both sides of the aisle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freeman|first1=James|title=There’s Money to Be Made |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-clinton-cash-by-peter-schweizer-1430952794|accessdate=28 August 2015|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Pilkington, writing for ''The Guardian'', reported that it was factually correct that "large donations to the foundation from the chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, at around the time of the Russian purchase of the company and while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, were never disclosed to the public. The multimillion dollar sums were channeled through a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation, CGSCI, which did not reveal its individual donors."&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; Following publication and in reaction to areas where it said improvements were warranted, the Clinton Foundation said it would put into place some new procedures for better financial reporting and that it would limit some kinds of foreign donations. Pilkington assessed those claims made by the Clinton Foundation as unlikely to put the matter to rest: "But with Bill refusing doggedly to give up his speaker engagements – 'I gotta pay our bills' – and foreign corporations and super-rich individuals still able to donate to the family charity, it looks like this controversy may run and run."&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

Pilkington also described the book as "an unrestrained attack on the former president and first lady." Pilkington notes that some of the claims in the book have been proven factually inaccurate. According to Pilkington, Schweizer does not prove corruption on the part of the Clintons, but "one of his main contentions – that the former president’s rates skyrocketed after his wife became secretary of state – is correct... pointing to several glaring conflicts of interest."&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pilkington|first1=Ed |title=Clinton Cash: errors dog Bill and Hillary exposé – but is there any 'there' there?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/05/clinton-cash-bill-hillary-scandal-book|accessdate=28 August 2015|work=The Guardian|date=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks after the book's initial publication, HarperCollins and the author made some corrections to the Kindle edition of the book. Schweizer corrected "seven or eight" passages that were revealed to be inaccurate after the book was released.&lt;ref name=politico /&gt; [[FactCheck.org]] found Schweizer's assertion that Clinton, as Secretary of State, could have stopped Russia from buying a company with extensive uranium mining operations in the U.S. to be false, due to Obama's decision on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiely|first1=Eugene |title='No ‘Veto Power’ for Clinton on Uranium Deal |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2015/04/no-veto-power-for-clinton-on-uranium-deal/|publisher=FactCheck.org|date=April 28, 2015 |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PolitiFact]] found the assertion that Clinton changed her views on a nuclear deal with India in response to donations to her family's foundation to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=Lauren|title='Clinton Cash' author: Hillary Clinton changed positions on India nuclear deal |url=http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/may/06/peter-schweizer/clinton-cash-author-hillary-changed-positions-indi/|accessdate=1 April 2016|publisher=PunditFact |work=Tampa Bay Times|date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
In May 2016, a [[film adaptation]] of the book, funded by co-founder of [[Government Accountability Institute]] and [[Breitbart News]] executive chairman [[Steve Bannon]] (CEO of the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016]]), was screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="GreenFilm"&gt;Joshua Green, [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-04-28/clinton-cash-has-been-made-into-a-movie 'Clinton Cash' Has Been Made Into a Movie], Bloomberg Politics (April 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianFilmAdaptation"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/clinton-cash-film-hillary-foundation-finances Clinton Cash film aims to cause likely Democratic nominee maximum damage], ''The Guardian'' (May 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] reported that conservatives were not the intended audience for the film adaptation of the book: "Environmentalists. Anti-nuke activists. Gay-rights advocates. Good-government folks. They’re all going to find themselves increasingly uncomfortable over claims that the likely Democratic nominee, in the film’s words, takes cash from the “darkest, worst corners of the world.”&lt;ref name="timemag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliott|first1=Philip|title=Clinton Cash: A Scathing Film Aimed at Persuading Liberals|url=http://time.com/4328254/clinton-cash-movie-hillary-clinton-peter-schweizer-breitbart/|website=TIME.com|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=7 October 2016|location=New York|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's U.S. premiere was scheduled for July 24, 2016 in Philadelphia (prior to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] there) and the film had a [[limited release]] in four other major U.S. cities in early August.&lt;ref name="GreenFilm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianFilmAdaptation" /&gt;

==Graphic novel adaptation==
A [[graphic novel]] adaptation of the book, written by [[Chuck Dixon]] and illustrated by Brett R. Smith, was released by [[Regnery Publishing]] on August 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harper|first1=Jennifer|title=Bill and Hillary: The graphic novel|publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]''|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/24/bill-hillary-clinton-featured-in-graphic-novel/|accessdate=5 August 2016|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-1-62157-545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late summer 2016 this graphic adaptation placed itself atop the ''Times'' best seller list for the Hardcover Graphic format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/hardcover-graphic-books/?_r=0] {{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex''', also known as '''CCP Complex''', is an {{convert|88|ha|adj=on}} owned by The [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] (CCP) located along [[Roxas Boulevard]] in [[Metro Manila]], Philippines, most of which fall under the jurisdiction of the city of [[Pasay]].&lt;ref group="note" name="Manila Note II"/&gt; 

Development of the complex was stalled until 2000, when the Philippine Supreme Court ruled with finality the CCP's ownership of some {{convert|35|ha}} of prime real estate in the complex. The property is {{convert|62.4|ha}} of land, with the rest being occupied by the [[Government Service Insurance System]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], and the Privatization and Management Office. It is part of [[Bay City, Metro Manila|Bay City]] (formerly Boulevard 2000) that spans {{convert|1500|ha}} of reclaimed land along [[Manila Bay]] which is occupied by the [[SM Prime Holdings|SM]] Central Business Park, [[Philippine National Bank]]'s Financial Center Area, and [[PAGCOR]]'s [[Entertainment City]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pea.gov.ph/programs-and-projects/reclamation |title=Reclamation |publisher=Philippine Reclamation Authority |accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The complex is bounded by the Manila Bay to the north and west, the [[Philippine Navy]] headquarters to the northeast, Roxas Boulevard to the east, and [[Jose Diokno Boulevard]] to the south. It is divided into two zones: the Art Zone, and the Commercial and Entertainment Zone.&lt;ref name="ccp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pea.gov.ph/13-bay-city/24-cultural-center-of-the-philippines |title=Cultural Center of the Philippines |publisher=Philippine Reclamation Authority |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features several [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] structures designed in the 1960s and 1970s by [[Leandro Locsin]], such as the [[Tanghalang Pambansa]], the [[Philippine International Convention Center]], and the [[Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila]]. Other locators in the complex include the [[Coconut Palace]], the [[Manila Film Center]] and [[Star City (amusement park)|Star City]] amusement park.&lt;ref name="ccp"/&gt;

==Buildings==

===Tanghalang Pambansa===
{{Main|Tanghalang Pambansa}}
[[File:Ccp ext 1.jpg|thumb|Façade of the [[Tanghalang Pambansa]]]]
The [[Tanghalang Pambansa]] ({{lang-en|National Theater}}) is the flagship venue and principal offices of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]. Formally called the Theater of Performing Arts, it houses three major performing arts venues, one theater for film screenings, galleries, a museum and the center's library and archives. 

* '''Tanghalang [[Nicanor Abelardo]] (Main Theater)'''
* '''Tanghalang [[Aurelio Tolentino]] (Little Theater)'''
* '''Tanghalang Huseng Batute (Studio Theater)'''

Designed by National Artist for Architecture [[Leandro Locsin]], its design was based and expanded upon the unconstructed Philippine-American Friendship Center. The ''Tangahalan'' is a primary example of the architect's signature style known as the floating volume, a trait can be seen in structures indigenous to the Philippines such as the [[nipa hut]]. Being a work of a National Artist, the [[brutalist]] structure is qualified to be an important cultural landmark as stipulated in Republic Act No. 10066.&lt;ref name="CCPRA10066"&gt;Republic Act No. 10066 "Providing for the protection and conservation of the national cultural heritage, strengthening the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and its affiliated cultural agencies, and for other purposes". Full Text available [http://www.unesconatcom.ph/docs/culture/NatlCulturalHeritage%20Act2009.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanghalang Fransisco Balagtas===
[[File:MetroManilajf9625 23.JPG|thumb|[[Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas]]]]
{{main|Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas}}
The [[Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas]], more commonly known by its original name of Folk Arts Theater, is a covered [[proscenium]] [[amphitheater]] is where popular concerts are usually staged. It has a seating capacity of 8,458 in ten sections. The building was originally built to seat an audience of 10,000 and was commissioned by then [[First Lady of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]] in 1974 for the [[Miss Universe]] Pageant, which was to be held in Manila. The theater was built in record time of seventy-seven days in time for the pageant and was designed by [[Leandro V. Locsin]].

It was host to many popular musical acts of the 1980s onwards, including [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] group [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], British pop group [[5ive]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Gary Valenciano]] and [[Jay R Sillona|Jay R]]. The Folk Arts Theater is also used as a site by different religious groups. [[Day by Day Christian Ministries]], a large international religious organization, has leased the area since 2005. They have dedicated the Theatre as ''Bulwagan ng Panginoón'' ({{lang-en|Hall of the [[Tetragrammaton|Lord]]}}). The building is expected to be torn down in the future, subject to the development of the Complex.

===Other buildings===
[[File:MFCjf0093 35.JPG|thumb|[[Philippine International Convention Center]]]]
The CCP Complex is also home to the following:
* [[Philippine International Convention Center]] (Owned by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas|BSP]])
* [[Manila Film Center]] (CCP)
* [[Coconut Palace]] ([[Government Service Insurance System|GSIS]])
* [[Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila]] ([[Government Service Insurance System|GSIS]])

==History==
The Cultural Center of the Philippines was conceived in 1966 when Ferdinand Marcos issued Executive Order No. 60, establishing its board and arranging for his wife Imelda to become chair of its Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=CCPLicoEdifice&gt;{{cite book |last=Lico |first=Gerald |title=Edifice Complex: Power, Myth and Marcos State Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |location=Quezon City, Philippines |isbn=978-971-550-435-5 |pages=178 p}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CCPSanctuary&gt;{{cite news |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |title=Sanctuary for the Filipino Soul |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/10643/sanctuary-of-the-filipino-soul |accessdate=10 October 2011 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine-American Culture Foundation provided a Ninety Thousand Peso Grant for its construction and additional funds were taken from the Cultural Development Fund and the Special Fund for Education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edifice complex : power, myth, and Marcos state architecture|last=Gerard.|first=Lico|date=2003|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-9715504355|location=Quezon City|oclc=53371189}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became the premier symbol of what would be called Imelda's [[edifice complex]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Expansion==
A comprehensive master plan for the development of the complex was unveiled in 2003. The plan would divide the CCP Complex into six clusters, each of which will be anchored by a major building. First, the Promenade, which will tentatively be named after Lucresia Reyes-Urtula, will include retail and other mixed-use facilities, as well as dock facilities. The second cluster will be the Arts Sanctuary, which will serve as the complex's cultural core. To be anchored by the Tanghalang Pambansa, it will contain a new performing arts theater, the artists' center, a [[bandstand]], the CCP's Production Design Center, as well as other open areas.

The third cluster, the Green Zone will contain a mix of museums, parks with commercial and office spaces. Fourth, the Creative Hub cluster, containing spaces for creative industries. Fifth, The Arts Living Room, envisioned to be a high-density, high-rise area that will house condominiums and similar residential projects. The final cluster, the Breezeway, will be located by low-rise, low-density commercial structures with seafront entertainment facilities. Covered walkways, plazas, and bicycle lanes are planned to connect the various buildings and clusters to ensure a pedestrian-centered design. The master plan is envisioned to be completed in four phases, from 2004 to 2014; ₱5 billion will be needed for the plan's first five years, and another ₱8 billion for the plan's latter half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=5398 ‘Commercialized’ CCP embraces the poor]. ''ABS-CBN News Online''. Retrieved 3 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A design contest was held in 2005 to design the first two clusters. Three firms won for their concepts; Syndicated Architects, Manalang-Tayag-Ilano Architects, and JPA Buensalido Design. The concepts of each winner will then be presented to prospective investors and stakeholders for approval.&lt;ref&gt;3 architect groups win CCP design contest. ''ABS-CBN News Online''.

'''Dexter Morgan''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[antihero]] of the Dexter book series, written by [[Jeff Lindsay (writer)|Jeff Lindsay]], as well as the [[Dexter (TV series)|television series of the same name]], where he is portrayed by American actor [[Michael C. Hall]], and by [[Devon Graye]], [[Dominic Janes]], and [[Maxwell Huckabee]] as a youth. 

In both the novels and the TV series, Dexter is a [[forensic science|forensic]] [[blood spatter analysis|blood spatter analyst]] who works for the fictitious Miami-Metro Police Department. In his spare time, he is a [[vigilante]] [[serial killer]] who targets other murderers who have evaded the justice system. He follows a code of ethics taught to him in childhood by his adoptive father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry]], which he refers to as "The Code" or "The Code of Harry" and hinges on two principles: Dexter can only kill people after finding conclusive evidence that they are guilty of murder, and he must not get caught.

Dexter's novel appearances include ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]'' (2004), ''[[Dearly Devoted Dexter]]'' (2005), ''[[Dexter in the Dark]]'' (2007), ''[[Dexter by Design]]'' (2009), ''[[Dexter Is Delicious]]'' (2010), ''[[Double Dexter]]'' (2011), ''[[Dexter's Final Cut]]'' (2013), and ''[[Dexter Is Dead]]'' (2015).  The eighth and final novel in the series written by Lindsay was titled ''Dexter Is Dead'', and released in July 2015, signifying the ending of the character. 

In 2006, the first novel was adapted into the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] TV series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and its companion web series ''[[Dexter: Early Cuts]].'' Season one is largely based on the first novel, ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]'' (2004), but the following seasons veered away from the rest of the book series. 

For his performance as Dexter, [[Michael C. Hall]] has received critical acclaim. In 2009, he was awarded a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series or Drama]]. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' ranked Dexter Morgan number 6 on their list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Josh|last=Jackson|title=The 20 Best TV Characters of 2011|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/12/the-20-best-tv-characters-of-2011.html?p=2|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|publisher=[[Wolfgang's Vault]]|location=Avondale Estates, Georgia|date=December 5, 2011|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Hall was awarded with a [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Award]] for [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama|Individual Achievement in Drama]] in 2007, and was nominated five times for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]]. 
 
== Characterization ==

=== Psychological profile ===
Since childhood, Dexter Morgan has felt homicidal urges directed by an inner voice he calls "the Dark Passenger"; when that voice cannot be ignored, he "lets the Dark Passenger do the driving". He abides by a moral code taught to him by his adoptive father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry]], in which he only allows himself to kill people who are themselves murderers.

Dexter considers himself emotionally divorced from the rest of humanity; in his narration, he refers to "humans" as if he is not one himself. He makes frequent references to an internal feeling of emptiness and says he kills to feel alive. He claims to have no feelings or [[conscience]], and that all of his emotional responses are part of a well-rehearsed act to conceal his true nature. He has no interest in romance or sex; he considers his relationship with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) [[Rita Bennett]] to be part of his "disguise".

Dexter likes children, finding them much more interesting than adults; accordingly, he treats victims who prey on children with particular wrath. His connection to Rita's children, Astor, and Cody, sometimes supersedes his relationship with Rita herself. For example, in the novels, Dexter continues his relationship with Rita because he realizes that Rita's children are exhibiting the same [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] tendencies he did at their age, and he tries to control their violent urges by providing them with "guidance" similar to that which Harry provided him. In the show, Dexter deviates from his code of only killing murderers to dispose of a [[pedophile]] who is [[stalking]] Astor.

Animals do not like Dexter, which can cause noise problems when he stalks a victim who has pets. The novels reveal that he once owned a dog that barked and growled at him until he was forced to get rid of it and a turtle that hid from him in its shell until it died of starvation.

Dexter occasionally behaves in a way that suggests that he does feel some rudimentary human connection. He acknowledges loyalty to family, particularly to his late adoptive father, saying: "If I were capable of love, how I would have loved Harry." Since Harry's death, Dexter's only family is his sister [[Debra Morgan|Debra]], Harry and Doris' biological daughter. Dexter admits that he cannot hurt Debra or allow anyone else to harm her because he is "fond of her". In the [[Dexter (episode)|first episode]] of [[Dexter (season 1)|season one]], he says: "I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb".

In the first season, Dexter's relationship with Rita sets in motion his slow but steady introduction to human feelings, progressing further each season. During the episode "[[Shrink Wrap (Dexter episode)|Shrink Wrap]]", when his current target is a psychologist, Dexter infiltrates the doctor's office by posing as a patient, and the doctor astutely speculates that part of Dexter's problem in admitting to his feelings is his need for control. In the second season finale, "[[The British Invasion (Dexter)|The British Invasion]]", Dexter finally admits that he needs the people in his life.&lt;ref name="The British Invasion"&gt;{{cite episode
| title = The British Invasion | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 14, 2007| season = 2 | number = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dexter (season 3)|season three]], when he is threatened by a target, Dexter fights to live because he wants to see his unborn child. In [[Dexter (season 4)|season four]], before killing a police officer who has murdered her own husband and daughter, Dexter is overwhelmed with the realization that he does not want to lose his new family. He is also horrified when he finds out that one of his potential victims is an abusive husband and father; Dexter vehemently insists he is nothing like that and would never hurt his family. In [[Dexter (season 5)|season five]], after Rita is murdered, Dexter realizes that he genuinely loved her and is devastated by losing her.&lt;ref name="My Bad"&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Bad | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 26, 2010| season = 5 | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Modus operandi'' ===
In both the books and the show, Dexter selects his victims according to his adoptive father's code and kills them only after he has discovered enough evidence to prove their guilt.  For each victim, he ritually prepares a kill site that has some symbolic relevance to the killer (e.g., killing a boxer in a [[boxing ring]] or a gambler in a casino's storage shed). He completely drapes the site in clear plastic [[tarpaulin]] to catch all spilled blood, and often adorns it with evidence or photos of his victim's crimes.

The actual capture of his victims differs between the books and the show. On the show, it usually entails approaching the victims from behind and injecting an [[anesthetic]] (specified to be an animal [[tranquilizer]] called [[Etorphine|etorphine hydrochloride]], or M99), which renders his victims temporarily unconscious.&lt;ref name="Return to Sender"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Return to Sender | episodelink = Return to Sender (Dexter) | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = May 11, 2006| season = 1 | number = 06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The injection is a tradition established with his first victim, the hospital nurse.&lt;ref name="Popping Cherry"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Popping Cherry | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 15, 2006| season = 1 | number = 03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the alias [[Patrick Bateman]] (the serial killer protagonist of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' ''[[American Psycho]]'') to procure these tranquilizers.&lt;ref name="Return to Sender"/&gt; Other times, Dexter incapacitates his target by using either his hands or a [[garrote]] to cut off blood flow to the brain. In the books (and twice in the television program), he hides in the back seat of his victim's vehicle, then wraps a noose of fishing line around his victim's throat when he sits down. Dexter then uses the threat of [[asphyxiation]] to force his victim to drive them to his prepared kill site.

Once they have arrived, he either strangles them into unconsciousness or uses the noose to drag them to the kill site proper. In such cases, he anesthetizes them once he has informed them of his judgment. When victims awaken, they are naked and secured to a table with plastic wrap, and for stronger victims, duct tape. If he has not already done so, he confronts them with narrative evidence of their crimes. In the novels, the method usually involves an extended "exploration" with various sharp knives; on the show, Dexter's favored method usually involves an immediately fatal wound to the chest, neck, or gut with a variety of weapons. He occasionally varies his methods to fit particular victims; he kills his brother (and fellow serial killer) Brian by cutting his throat with a dinner knife (with the manner of the death and Dexter's own hesitation at inflicting the wound causing pathologists to conclude that Brian killed himself);&lt;ref name="Born Free"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Born Free | episodelink = Born Free (Dexter) | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 17, 2006| season = 1 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he stabs gang lord [[List of Dexter characters#Little Chino|Little Chino]] in the chest with a [[machete]].&lt;ref name="Waiting to Exhale"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Waiting to Exhale | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 7, 2007| season = 2 | number = 02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He kills Santos Jimenez—the man who murdered his mother—in the same manner in which his mother was killed, by dismembering him with a chainsaw.  On other occasions, he uses hammers, drills, and other power tools.

Just before the murder, Dexter collects trophies from his victims so he can relive the experience. Dexter's trophy signature is to slice the victim's right cheek with a surgical scalpel to collect a small blood sample, which he preserves on a [[microscope slide]]. In the TV show, Dexter keeps blood slides from all his victims neatly organized in a wooden filing box, which he hides inside his air conditioner. In the novels, he keeps them in a [[rosewood]] box on his bookcase.

Ultimately, he dismembers the bodies into several pieces, stows them and the plastic sheeting in black, heavy duty, [[biodegradable]] garbage bags, then adds rocks from the dock where he keeps his boat as anchor weight, and seals the bags with duct tape. He then takes the wrapped bags out on his boat and disposes of them by dumping them overboard into the ocean at a defined location; in the TV series, his dumping ground is a small [[oceanic trench]] just offshore. In one episode, the dump site and remains are inadvertently discovered by scuba divers, so he changes tactics, cutting the bodies into smaller pieces and dumping them further offshore, where they will be dispersed by the [[Gulf Stream]].  The books give less detail about disposal, with Dexter usually improvising depending on the victim. He has dumped some victims into the ocean due to the victim's owning a boat and doing the same with their own victims, but uses anchors to weight the bags. He disposes of another body in a vat of [[hydrochloric acid]].

=== General biography ===
Dexter was born on February 15, 1971 (though according to Dr. Evelyn Vogel’s journal in S8 E4, Dexter’s date of birth was notated as “2/1/71”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=This Is the Way the World Ends |episodelink=This Is the Way the World Ends |series= Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series) |credits=[[James Manos, Jr.]] |network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |station= |airdate=December 18, 2011 |season=6 |episode=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the story's outset, Dexter knows very little about his life prior to being adopted by Harry Morgan (a Miami detective) and his wife Doris. Harry only tells Dexter that his parents were killed in a car accident, and Harry brought him home from the crime scene. When Dexter is seven, Harry discovers that the boy has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that Dexter is a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] with a deep need to kill. Consequently, Harry decides to channel the boy's homicidal urges in a "positive" direction by teaching him to be a careful, meticulous killer of people who "deserve it"—murderers who have escaped justice. Doris died when Dexter was 16, and Harry died when Dexter was 20.&lt;ref name="Our"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Our Father|episodelink=Dexter (season 3)#ep1|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=September 28, 2008|season=3|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second season, Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant James Doakes]], discovers that Dexter forsook a career in medicine to pursue blood spatter analysis, despite being top of his class at medical school.  He also notes that Dexter studied advanced [[jujutsu]] in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Resistance is Futile|episodelink=Dexter (season 2)#ep9|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=November 25, 2007|season=2|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the television show and the first novel gradually reveal Dexter's complete back story. Dexter was born out of wedlock in 1971 to a young woman named Laura (Laura Moser on the show). In the novels, Laura was involved in the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]].&lt;ref name="Born Free"/&gt; On the show, Laura was a [[police informant]] for Harry Morgan and his secret mistress. Dexter's father (named Joseph Driscoll on the show) was in the [[US Army]] and served in the [[Vietnam War]], but later became a drug-addicted criminal. Dexter also had an older brother, named Brian.&lt;ref name="Born Free"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Truth Be Told"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Truth Be Told | episodelink = | series = Dexter | serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 12, 2006| season = 1 | number = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 1973, Dexter and Brian witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of three drug dealers.  For two days, the brothers were left in a crate, surrounded by dismembered body parts and sitting in a pool of blood.{{cref|a}}  Harry adopted the three-year-old Dexter, while Brian was left to the [[child welfare]] [[Child and family services|system]].{{cref|b}}

Dexter only remembers his mother's murder later in life, when he is called to an extremely bloody crime scene left by his brother—who has also grown up to be a serial killer.  In the novel, Brian escapes Miami, but returns in ''[[Dexter Is Delicious]]''. On the show, however, Dexter catches and (reluctantly) kills Brian, aware that Brian would never stop trying to kill Debra or other innocent people.&lt;ref name="Born Free"/&gt;

== Character development in the book series ==

=== ''Darkly Dreaming Dexter'' ===
Doris Morgan, Dexter's adoptive mother, dies of [[cancer]] when he is 16. When Dexter reaches puberty, he realizes that he is uninterested in sex and needs instruction by his father on how to behave with women. Around this time, Harry discovers that Dexter has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that the boy has an innate need to kill. Harry decides to channel Dexter's urges in a "positive" direction by teaching him to kill people who "deserve it", and to get rid of any evidence so he does not get caught.

When Dexter is 18, Harry is diagnosed with cancer and hospitalized. There, Harry gives Dexter his "permission" to kill his first human victim, a nurse who is murdering her patients with overdoses of morphine.

Throughout the novel, Dexter is involved in the investigation of the "Tamiami Butcher", a serial killer who dismembers his victims and puts the body parts in refrigerated trucks. The killer begins leaving taunting clues for Dexter to draw him in personally. The killer kidnaps Deborah and meets with Dexter in a storage container, and reveals their true connection: he is Brian, Dexter's biological brother. Brian tells Dexter that as children, they witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of drug dealers, and were locked in a crate for two days, surrounded by dead bodies. Dexter persuades Brian to spare Deborah, and instead the two of them kill Lieutenant [[Maria LaGuerta|Migdia LaGuerta]] (this does not occur in the TV series, in which LaGuerta &amp;mdash; whose first name is changed to "Maria" &amp;mdash; is a recurring character until her death at the end of the seventh season).

At the end of the novel, Deborah learns of Dexter's secret life after he saves her from Brian. She appears to accept it, but in subsequent books feels torn between her duties as a police officer and her loyalty to Dexter, whom she loves as her real brother.

=== ''Dearly Devoted Dexter'' ===
Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant Doakes]], suspects Dexter of being involved in LaGuerta's murder, and starts following him around.  Doakes and Dexter are soon forced to work together to stop "Dr. Danco", a [[psychopath]]ic surgeon who removes his victims' limbs and sensory organs, leaving them in a state of living death.

Doakes' pursuit forces Dexter to spend more time with Rita and her children. While attempting to bond with Astor and Cody, he realizes that they both have "Dark Passengers" of their own, and he resolves to provide them with the same "guidance" that Harry had given him. After finding [[FBI]] agent Kyle Chutsky's ring in Dexter's pocket, Rita believes Dexter is about to propose to her, and happily accepts before Dexter can explain.

At the climax of the book, Danco kidnaps Dexter and Doakes, mutilating the latter by removing his hands, feet, and tongue. Just as Danco is about to turn his attentions to Dexter, however, Deborah bursts in and kills him, saving Dexter's life.

=== ''Dexter in the Dark'' ===
In ''[[Dexter in the Dark]],'' the third novel of the series, third-person narrative reveals through an entity referred to as "IT" that the Dark Passenger is an independent agent inhabiting Dexter, rather than a [[abnormal psychology|deviant psychological construction]]. Later, Dexter realizes the Dark Passenger is related to [[Moloch]], a [[Middle East]]ern deity worshiped in [[Bible|Biblical]] times. The Dark Passenger is one of Moloch's many offspring; Moloch had many children (formed through [[human sacrifice]]), and learned to share its knowledge with them. Eventually, there were too many, and Moloch killed the majority; however, some of them escaped into the world. In the novel, Dexter learns of the Dark Passenger's true nature when it briefly "leaves" him, frightening him into researching possible reasons for its existence.

By now, Dexter has embraced his role as stepfather to both children, but is annoyed when thoughts of them – wondering if Cody had brushed his teeth before bed and if Astor had set out her Easter dress for picture day at her school – distract him from hunting an intended victim. By the end of the book, he has begun training Astor and Cody to be careful, efficient killers, with great success: when the novel's antagonist, a Moloch-worshipping cult leader, kidnaps the three of them, Cody saves Dexter's life by killing one of his henchmen.

The novel ends with the Dark Passenger returning to Dexter on his wedding day.

=== ''Dexter by Design'' ===
''[[Dexter by Design]]'' opens in Paris, with Dexter and Rita on their honeymoon.  There, while visiting an art gallery, Dexter and Rita see an ''[[avant-garde]]'' performance piece called "Jennifer's Leg" in which the artist amputates her own limb.  When they return to Miami, Dexter crosses paths with a suspicious homicide detective and a serial killer who preys on tourists. In the novel's closing paragraphs, Dexter learns that Rita is pregnant with his child.

===''Dexter is Delicious''===
In ''[[Dexter is Delicious]]'', Dexter grapples with raising his infant daughter, Lily-Anne, and wonders if she can help restore his humanity. Brian reappears in Dexter's life, situating himself with Dexter's family. The main event for the Miami Police Department is related to the appearance of cooked, partially eaten bodies and the disappearance of a teenaged girl, Samantha. Dexter has sex with Samantha while under the influence of [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], and tries to prevent Rita from finding out while helping Deborah solve the murders.

The novel reintroduces Dexter's brother, Brian, who shows up unexpectedly at Dexter's doorstep and inserts himself into his brother's new family. Dexter is reluctant at first to let Brian back into his life, but changes his mind when he sees him bond with Astor and Cody over their shared bloodlust.

===''Double Dexter''===
In ''[[Double Dexter]]'', Dexter is seen by an anonymous Shadow while killing a victim in a secluded house. He continues on with his life until he starts receiving threatening emails from the person who claims to have seen him over a pile of dead body parts. Instead of turning him in, the Shadow, as he is referred to, takes it upon himself to take Dexter down. While Dexter tries to find and dispose of this Shadow, he quickly finds out that this person is much more capable than he initially suspected. Dexter is eventually framed for a murder, at least circumstantially, by his still anonymous Shadow.

While on suspension from the police force for being a 'person of interest' in a murder investigation, Dexter finally finds out who his Shadow is: Doug Crowley. When he goes to dispatch Crowley, he finds he is once again being tailed by Doakes. Realizing that no way exists to take down Crowley with Doakes on his tail, he enlists the help of his brother, Brian, and finally thinks that his problems have been taken care of.

While Brian is dispatching Doug Crowley, Dexter goes down to Key West with his family. Despite learning from his brother that a Doug Crowley had been taken care of, he finds the body of Detective Hood, the lead detective investigating him for murder, in his hotel suite, with the only explanation being that Brian killed the wrong Doug Crowley.

While Dexter is preoccupied with the Key West police, Crowley finally attacks Dexter by abducting his step children, Cody and Astor. Dexter hunts down Crowley to a small island off the coast of Key West. He finally gets the drop on him, and Crowley escapes with Astor on a speedboat. Dexter manages to sneak aboard and overpower Crowley, with some assistance from Astor. They shove Crowley overboard, where he is eaten by a hammerhead shark.

With Crowley dispatched, Dexter can finally focus on clearing his name in the murder investigation. He plants evidence in Hood's apartment, thoroughly discrediting him, while Doakes is now under review for excessive force and intimidating a witness. These developments leave Dexter in the clear.

===''Dexter's Final Cut''===
In ''[[Dexter's Final Cut]]'', a famous celebrity becomes obsessed with Dexter Morgan after researching him for his new role. When the Big Ticket Network comes to Miami, Deborah and Dexter are assigned as "technical advisors" to the stars of the show. Deborah is shadowed by female lead Jackie Forrest and Dexter is left with over-the-hill star Robert Chase. Sensing a strangeness in him, Dexter keeps Robert at arm's length. When a series of murders leads Miami Metro's Detective Anderson through a loop, Dexter is assigned to guard Jackie.

Deborah and Dexter quickly realize that the string of bodies all bear a striking resemblance to Jackie. Dexter is assigned to protect her in her hotel room. At first, things seem perfectly routine; Dexter accompanies Jackie to the station each morning and returns with her to the hotel at night, but when the killer's identity is revealed to him, Dexter's "Dark Passenger" leads him out into the streets in pursuit.

While working a crime scene where police have found another body matching the pattern of Jackie's obsessed fan, Dexter notices a man fitting the description in a kayak out in the bay watching the scene. Stealing away to his boat, Dexter slips alongside the man and kills him. After a hard day's work, they return to the hotel only to be disturbed in the night by sirens; Jackie's assistant Kathy has been murdered in the room below. The murder seems to fit the pattern, but Dexter notices several errors. That night, Dexter and Jackie fall into bed together and start a brief but intense affair. Dexter thinks he has fallen in love with Jackie, and considers leaving Rita.

Dexter is called onto the set to appear as a minor character in the series following a conversation with Jackie and Robert. Suddenly, Dexter gets a panicked phone call from Rita: Astor has disappeared. Fearing the worst, Dexter goes in search of Robert, who had shown a suspicious interest in Astor. He questions the show's director, who confirms that Robert is a [[pedophile]]. Moments later, he finds Jackie's dead body in her trailer. Dexter then pieces it together: Robert killed Kathy after she caught him in a compromising position with Astor, and then killed Jackie when she found out what he had done. Dexter follows a hunch and heads to Rita and his new house. Robert catches him sneaking in and knocks him unconscious.

Waking some time later, Dexter finds Astor and Robert together in the house. Robert has lured Astor with promises of stardom, and she appears ready to help him to kill Dexter. Thinking quickly, Dexter tells Astor that Robert will be arrested and sent to prison, and is thus useless to her. When Robert tries to take Astor as a hostage, she stabs him to death. Dexter realizes that circumstantial evidence implicates him as the murderer of Robert and Jackie, and that the only person who can exonerate him is Rita. When Dexter searches the house, however, he finds that Rita is dead, murdered by Robert. Dexter sees that his luck has finally run out, and waits for the police to arrive.

===''Dexter is Dead''===
In the final book of the series' ''[[Dexter is Dead]]''; Dexter is in jail after being charged with Robert's crimes - thanks to the corrupt Detective Anderson, who has falsified evidence and reports to make it seem that Dexter is guilty. Only Masuoka tries to clear Dexter's good name, but he gets swatted down by everyone from the beat cops to the state attorney. Deborah, meanwhile, disowns Dexter for cheating on Rita and putting Astor in danger, and decides to take custody of his children.

Dexter's brother Brian bails him out of prison and gets him the best lawyer in town, but the lawyer happens to be in the pocket of a very powerful Mexican drug cartel led by a man named Raul, who is after Brian. The cartel tries to kill Dexter several times to get to Brian. Eventually, Dexter and Brian find out their lawyer sold them out to the cartel, so they kill him and all the cartel's members, save for one, whom they torture to find out where Raul is holding Cody and Astor. 

Brian, Deborah, and Dexter team up, storm Raul's yacht, and take the kids back. Deborah and the kids get away, but Brian is killed by a bomb and Raul shoots Dexter in the shoulder. Dexter kills Raul and sets a bomb so no evidence is left, then jumps off the boat into the water and sinks into the ocean. The book leaves it open to interpretation whether he survives.

== Dexter in the television show ==

=== Season one ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DexterBornFree.jpg|thumb|Dexter with his biological brother, Brian.]] --&gt;
By the start of season one, Dexter is a [[Bloodstain Pattern Analysis|blood spatter analyst]] for the Miami Metro Police Department; in his "secret life", he is a serial killer who preys on people who are themselves murderers. In his private life, Dexter maintains superficial relationships &amp;ndash; with his sister [[Debra Morgan|Debra]] ([[Jennifer Carpenter]]), his girlfriend [[Rita Bennett|Rita]] ([[Julie Benz]]), and Rita's children, [[Astor Bennett|Astor]] ([[Christina Robinson (actress)|Christina Robinson]]) and [[List of Dexter characters#Cody Bennett|Cody]] (Daniel Goldman in season one, Preston Bailey in subsequent seasons) to appear normal. Dexter has internal conversations with his late foster father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry Morgan]] ([[James Remar]]), who gives him advice about killing and navigating his personal life.

Rita's previous, abusive marriage leaves her afraid to have sex, which suits the [[asexuality|asexual]] Dexter perfectly.  When she overcomes her demons and becomes more amorous, however, Dexter considers ending the relationship, fearing that she will see him as he really is if they become a real couple.&lt;ref name="Shrink"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Shrink Wrap | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 19, 2006| season = 1 | number = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during a therapy session with one of his intended victims, psychologist Emmett Meridian ([[Tony Goldwyn]]), Dexter is put into a state of deep relaxation, wherein he sees a frightening image of a small boy sitting in a pool of blood. In a heightened emotional state, he runs to Rita's house for comfort, and they have sex.&lt;ref name="Shrink"/&gt;

Meanwhile, a serial killer of prostitutes appears in Miami, and Dexter notices that the killer is leaving hidden clues at the scene that have personal significance to Dexter. One day, Dexter receives official notification that a man named Joseph Driscoll is his biological father, and that, since Dexter is the only next of kin, he must come settle the estate and claim the body.  Debra's new boyfriend, Rudy Cooper ([[Christian Camargo]]), insists that they accompany Dexter and Rita to clean out the house.  Dexter doubts that Driscoll is his father, but while cleaning, discovers a thank-you card that he sent his blood donor as a child, as Dexter has a rare [[blood type]] ([[AB-]]).&lt;ref name="Father Knows Best"&gt;{{cite episode

Dexter's rivalry with Rita's recently paroled ex-husband Paul ([[Mark Pellegrino]]) turns violent; Paul tries to fight Dexter, who knocks him unconscious. To cover his tracks, Dexter injects Paul with [[heroin]] and leaves him to be found.  Paul fails a drug test (thus breaking his probation) and returns to jail.

Dexter is called to analyze a hotel room flooded with the blood of multiple persons. The sight triggers a panic attack and calls up several memories of himself as a child sitting in blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Seeing Red | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = June 12, 2006| season = 1 | number = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His research leads him to discover he witnessed his mother's murder as a child, and he had a brother named Brian. 
Eventually, the Ice Truck Killer (who turns out to be none other than Rudy) kidnaps Debra after proposing to her, then drugs her and takes her to Dexter's childhood home. When Dexter goes to rescue Debra, he finally recognizes Rudy as his long-lost brother, Brian Moser.

Brian proposes that they begin to murder together, and leads Dexter to a bound and drugged Debra, suggests that she be their first kill. After wrestling with internal conflicts from his attachment to his biological brother and need to protect his adoptive sister, Dexter ultimately decides that his loyalty lies with Debra. Later on, Brian begins to hunt down Debra himself, but Dexter apprehends Brian and then ties him down to an operating table in Brian's apartment. Dexter tearfully slits Brian's throat, staging the crime scene to make it look like Brian committed suicide. Eventually, the police find the body and close the case. The season ends with Dexter wondering what it would be like if everyone knew his secrets and imagining being celebrated outside the police station by an adoring crowd.&lt;ref name="Born Free"/&gt;

=== Season two ===
In season two, Dexter is so haunted by killing his own brother that he cannot resume killing. To make matters worse, Debra, traumatized by her ordeal with the Ice Truck Killer, moves in with Dexter, which hinders his secret life. Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant James Doakes]] ([[Erik King]]), harbors lingering suspicions about Dexter's possible connection with the Ice Truck Killer, and he begins to tail Dexter everywhere. To throw him off, Dexter reluctantly refrains from killing for a month. Just as Dexter finds a chance to kill again, over 30 bodies are found in a Miami harbor, provoking a massive search for the so-called "Bay Harbor Butcher".

Rita soon figures out that Dexter has been lying to her and concludes that Dexter is a heroin addict, with which he goes along to hide his real secret. Rita forces him to attend [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings, where he meets [[Lila West|Lila Tournay]] ([[Jaime Murray]]), who becomes his sponsor. Lila convinces him to explore his past, and while under extreme duress after confronting and killing his mother's murderer, his relationship with Lila becomes sexual. Dexter confesses to Rita, who dumps him. Lila becomes obsessed with Dexter, believing he is her soulmate. Eventually, however, Dexter's desire to be with Astor and Cody compels him to ask for Rita's forgiveness; she grants it, and they get back together. Dexter learns that Lila is in fact a sociopath who attends NA meetings to vicariously experience emotions she is incapable of feeling, and tells her to leave him alone. Lila retaliates by framing Dexter's colleague and friend [[Angel Batista]] ([[David Zayas]]) for [[rape]], though he is eventually cleared.

Doakes' suspicions subside some when he realizes that Dexter is attending Narcotics Anonymous, but he begins to suspect this is a cover for an even worse secret. As Doakes gets closer to discovering the truth, Dexter provokes him into a physical altercation at work, resulting in Doakes' suspension. In "[[The British Invasion (Dexter)|The British Invasion]]", Doakes finally catches Dexter in the act of disposing of a dismembered body in the [[Florida Everglades]]. Dexter is forced to take Doakes captive and sets about framing him. Lila discovers the cabin in the Everglades where Dexter is holding Doakes and blows it up (with Doakes inside), to protect Dexter. The police eventually find Doakes' charred body, surrounded by Dexter's murderous paraphernalia, and conclude that Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher, much to Dexter's relief.&lt;ref name="The British Invasion"/&gt;

Dexter pretends to want to run away with Lila, but she soon discovers that he intends to kill her. Lila kidnaps Astor and Cody, and when Dexter finds them at her house, she sets it on fire and leaves the three of them locked inside. Dexter manages to save the children and escape unhurt. Weeks later, he follows Lila to Paris, where he thanks her for showing him his "true self" before killing her.&lt;ref name="The British Invasion"/&gt;

=== Season three ===
In season three, Dexter finds his life manageable until he discovers that Rita is pregnant.&lt;ref name="Our"/&gt;  Rita and he tacitly consider terminating the pregnancy, until Rita announces she will keep the baby regardless of whether or not Dexter wants to be a father to the child.  Dexter, afraid of what kind of father he would be, considers leaving Rita to parent alone, until Debra convinces him that he would be a great father.  After a few failed marriage proposals, Dexter proposes again by mimicking a declaration of love from a criminal. Rita finally accepts, with her children's blessing.&lt;ref name="Our"/&gt;

Meanwhile, after killing an unknown man in self-defense while attempting to murder a homicidal drug dealer named Freebo, Dexter forms an unlikely friendship with the man's brother, [[Miguel Prado]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]), a popular assistant district attorney.&lt;ref name="Our"/&gt; While hunting down Freebo at night, Prado stumbles upon Dexter, bloody from murdering Freebo; Dexter claims he killed Freebo in self-defense. Prado offers Dexter Freebo's bloody shirt as proof that he will not reveal Dexter's secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Finding Freebo | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 5, 2008| season = 3 | number = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men grow closer, and Dexter even makes Prado his best man. Prado gradually discerns that Dexter is a serial killer, and they begin to murder together according to Dexter's "code". When Prado deviates from the code to murder a rival defense attorney, it sets off a game of competing leverage and blackmail between the two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Damage a Man Can Do | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 16, 2008| season = 3 | number = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dexter discovers the blood on the shirt is actually bovine, meaning that Prado was just using him as an excuse to kill.

After being tipped off by Prado, a serial killer called "the Skinner" ([[Jesse Borrego]]), who is searching for Freebo, kidnaps Dexter on Dexter's wedding day. Facing certain death, Dexter resolves to keep fighting so he can live to see his son; he frees himself and kills the Skinner by snapping his neck and throwing his body into an arriving police car. Dexter then kills Prado&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = I Had a Dream | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 7, 2008| season = 3 | number = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and marries Rita, with Debra as his "best man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Do You Take Dexter Morgan? | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 14, 2008| season = 3 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the season, Dexter justifies killing two people who do not fit his code: Nathan Marten (Jason Kaufman), a [[pedophile]] who is stalking Astor;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Lion Sleeps Tonight | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 12, 2008| season = 3 | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his old friend Camilla Figg ([[Margo Martindale]]), who is dying of cancer and asks him to end her suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Easy as Pie | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 9, 2008| season = 3 | number = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Season four ===
At outset of season four, Rita has given birth to a baby boy, Harrison. Dexter is happy to have a child of his own, but his responsibilities as a new father leave him too exhausted to kill.&lt;ref name="Living"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Living the Dream | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 19, 2009| season = 4 | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dexter finds it increasingly difficult to keep concealing his secret life, which leads to conflict with Rita and Astor, who has entered [[adolescence]].  At Rita's urging, Dexter and she enter couple's therapy.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dexter episode 412 screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Dexter, ready to kill [[Arthur Mitchell (Dexter)|Arthur Mitchell]].]] --&gt;
After his first kill of the new season, Dexter falls asleep while driving and has an accident, and the resultant short-term memory loss causes him to forget where his victim's body is.&lt;ref name="Living"/&gt; He eventually retraces his steps and disposes of the body.  After retired Special Agent [[Frank Lundy]] ([[Keith Carradine]]) is murdered, Dexter begins his pursuit of the so-called [[Arthur Mitchell (Dexter)|"Trinity Killer"]], who has been committing ritualistic murders across the country for 30 years.&lt;ref name="Living"/&gt; Once Dexter finds the killer, however, he is shocked to discover that "Trinity" is actually Arthur Mitchell ([[John Lithgow]]), a family man and pillar of his community.

Dexter assumes the alias Kyle Butler and begins to insinuate himself into Mitchell's personal life in an effort to learn how Mitchell balances his family responsibilities with his secret life as a serial killer. To that end, Dexter repeatedly puts off murdering Mitchell, thwarts police efforts to apprehend him, and even saves Mitchell's life when he attempts suicide. Upon getting to know Mitchell, however, Dexter realizes that he misjudged him; after spending Thanksgiving with the Mitchell family, Dexter learns that his would-be mentor is an abusive tyrant whose family is terrified of him. After getting into a violent altercation with Mitchell, Dexter insists that they are nothing alike and thinks he may be able to silence his Dark Passenger permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Hungry Man | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 22, 2009| season = 4 | number = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returns home, Dexter makes arrangements for Rita and him to take a belated honeymoon.  He sends Rita ahead and entraps Mitchell as Mitchell tries to skip town. Before Dexter kills him with a hammer, Mitchell tells him that Dexter will not be able to control his violent urges for long, and "it's already over" &amp;mdash; the same thing Mitchell tells his victims just before killing them. {{Rquote|right|Harry was right. I thought I could change what I am, keep my family safe. But it doesn't matter what I do, what I choose... ''I'm'' what's wrong. This is... fate|Dexter Morgan|"The Getaway", Episode 4.12}}
After returning home, Dexter calls Rita's phone to find out if her and Harrison made it alright. He immediately hears Rita's phone start to ring, indicating that she is in the house. Harrison then starts crying and Dexter is devastated to find Rita lying dead in the bathtub, with Harrison on the floor in a pool of his mother's blood; she was Trinity's final victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Getaway | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 13, 2009| season = 4 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Season five ===
The season opens with a shocked, guilt-ridden Dexter clutching Harrison as the police respond to his call, in which Dexter says "It was me". While he means that he killed her by letting Trinity know his identity, the police interpret this as an admission of direct guilt. The FBI, however, soon clear Dexter, as he was with the police at Arthur Mitchell's house at the time Rita was murdered.

Dexter spends the next day completely numb, unable to even fake any sort of emotion or grief. As Dexter plans to disconnect and restart, he finds himself confronted by Rankin ([[Brad Carter]]), a brash, foul-mouthed hillbilly. When Rankin insults Rita, Dexter kills him in a fit of rage. Harry tells Dexter that this act is the first human thing he has seen Dexter do since Rita's death.&lt;ref name="My Bad"/&gt;

Distraught over Rita's death, Astor and Cody leave to go live with their grandparents. A struggling Dexter attempts to move on by hiring an Irish nanny to look after Harrison while he goes out to find his next kill. He settles on Boyd Fowler ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), a convicted [[rape|rapist]] whose connection to a string of missing women makes him the perfect target. Dexter kills Fowler, only to find Fowler's latest victim, a young woman named [[Lumen Pierce]] ([[Julia Stiles]]), who is still alive. After debating whether or not to kill her (and thus eliminate a potential witness), Dexter gives in to his better nature and decides to protect her.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dexter the big one.jpg|right|thumb|Dexter and Lumen are captured by Jordan Chase.]] --&gt;
Lumen is slow to trust Dexter, but comes to realize he means her no harm. She reveals that Fowler was not the only man who raped her. As Lumen gradually becomes integrated into Dexter's life, she begs him to help her to go after her attackers; Dexter reluctantly agrees. They stalk a children's dentist and the head of security for a high-profile motivational speaker named [[Jordan Chase]] ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]). As the plot thickens, it becomes clear that Chase was also one of Lumen's attackers. Complicating the situation further is Detective [[Joey Quinn]] ([[Desmond Harrington]]), who believes that Dexter killed Rita and is getting too close to finding out Dexter's secrets.

To keep the police occupied, Dexter puts them on Fowler's trail. Dexter becomes personally acquainted with Chase and stumbles onto a photo that proves that all of Lumen's attackers (who are also guilty of [[torture|torturing]], raping, and murdering 12 other women) have known each other since childhood.

Dexter eventually finds a vial of blood that Chase wears around his neck. After extracting a sample, he discovers that the blood belongs to Emily Birch ([[Angela Bettis]]), the rape club's first victim. She provides Lumen and Dexter with the identity of the mysterious fourth attacker in the photo, Alex Tilden ([[Scott Grimes]]). Dexter allows Lumen to kill Tilden by stabbing him in the heart. Dexter and Lumen then become lovers, before continuing their hunt for Chase. As Lumen and Dexter plan to capture Chase, Dexter realizes cameras are in his apartment. Dexter, assuming he is being watched by Quinn, waits for him to return to the surveillance van. As Dexter opens the door to capture Quinn, Stan Liddy ([[Peter Weller]]), a private investigator Quinn had hired to tail Dexter, stuns Dexter with a taser. After Liddy calls Quinn to bust Dexter, Dexter attacks Liddy and kills him in self-defense, after Liddy tries to stab him.

While Dexter deals with Liddy, Lumen gets a call from Emily. Emily appears frightened of Chase and threatens to call the police, but she is revealed to be setting a trap to allow Chase to capture them. Dexter returns to the apartment to find Lumen gone. He tracks Chase to the camp where the rape club had started. In a fit of emotion, he accidentally wrecks the stolen car he is driving, allowing Chase to take him prisoner. Chase brings Dexter to the building in which he is holding Lumen. As Chase is about to kill them, Dexter frees himself with a knife he had stashed and immobilizes Chase by stabbing him through his foot and into the floor. Dexter cuts Lumen free and knocks Chase out. When Chase wakes up, Dexter allows Lumen to kill him. While they are still in the kill room, preparing to move the body, Debra arrives on the scene, though her view of Dexter and Lumen is obstructed by a sheet of plastic. Dexter and Lumen, trapped, remain silent. Without requesting their identity, Debra warns them that she is about to call in backup and allows them to flee before the police arrive.

The next day, when Dexter returns from work, Lumen tells him that she no longer feels the need to kill, and they cannot be together because Dexter's homicidal urges will never leave him. She then leaves to return to the life she had before her kidnapping. The season ends with Dexter surrounded by friends and family at Harrison's first birthday party.

===Season six===
About a year later, Harrison is old enough to walk, and Dexter has begun searching for a preschool, though his [[atheism]] conflicts with the largely religious preschools to which he applies. He finds a greater understanding through Brother Sam ([[Mos Def]], credited as Mos and later as yasiin bey&lt;!-- DO NOT CAPITALIZE yasiin bey AS THIS IS THE EXACT MANNER HE WAS CREDITED ON THE SHOW! --&gt;), an ex-con and murderer whom Dexter once considered killing, who has since become a [[born-again Christian]] who counsels other ex-cons. Dexter initially sees Brother Sam's religious conversion as a scam, but Brother Sam proves himself a truly changed man, and even helps Dexter through a crisis when Harrison undergoes an [[appendectomy]].

However, things go awry when Brother Sam is shot and mortally wounded in his garage. Dexter realizes that a friend of Sam's, Nick ([[Germaine De Leon]]), is responsible, and swears revenge. On his deathbed, Sam forgives Nick and implores Dexter to also forgive him. Dexter considers sparing Nick when he initially appears remorseful, but that proves to be an act; after Sam refuses to press charges on his deathbed, Nick brags about what he did.  An enraged Dexter drowns Nick in the surf, reawakening in him the presence of his dead brother, Brian, who begins to guide him in much the same way that Harry's presence once had.

Brian convinces Dexter to go after Arthur Mitchell's son Jonah ([[Brando Eaton]]), who appears to have also become a killer. Dexter adheres to his father's code, however, causing a schism between his personalities. Dexter finally catches Jonah with the intent of killing him, but relents when he sees that Jonah feels guilty about failing to protect his sister, who committed suicide by slitting an artery in a bathtub, similar to how her father killed his victims. When Jonah and his mother discovered Jonah's sister, their mother blamed the children for their father's shortcomings. This enraged Jonah, who then killed his mother. Learning this new information, Dexter rejects Brian and reaffirms the "Code of Harry", leaving Jonah alive to forgive himself.

In the meantime, Dexter begins investigating "the Doomsday Killer", a serial killer who models his crimes after the [[Book of Revelation]]. Dexter soon finds that the murders are being committed by two people: a [[religious fanaticism|fanatically religious]] college professor named [[List of Dexter characters#James Gellar|James Gellar]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) and his protégé, [[Travis Marshall]] ([[Colin Hanks]]). Dexter tracks Marshall down, but balks at killing him, believing that Marshall has a conscience and is simply being led down the wrong path. Dexter then resolves to save Marshall from himself.

After the death of Marshall's sister, Dexter follows him to the old church and discovers Gellar's body in a freezer, concluding that Marshall had been acting alone the whole time, with Gellar as a [[dissociative identity]]. After being forced to accept Gellar's death, Marshall begins to target Dexter, managing to capture him and enact the [[lake of fire]]. Dexter escapes, however, and is rescued by a fishing boat carrying illegal immigrants bound for Florida. Marshall kidnaps Harrison to sacrifice him as the "[[lamb of God]]" during a solar eclipse, but Dexter rescues Harrison and takes Marshall to the old church. Debra walks into the church—seeking to find Dexter after a recent meeting with a therapist helped her realize that she was in love with her adoptive brother—only to see Dexter kill Marshall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

===Season seven===
In the season-seven opener, Dexter tells a bewildered Debra that he killed Marshall on impulse after Marshall ambushed him. Debra believes him at first, and helps him destroy the old church, with Marshall's body inside. A few days later, however, Debra finds Dexter's knives and collection of blood slides, and asks him point blank if he is a serial killer. Not knowing what else to say, Dexter replies that he is. Debra is horrified, but resolves to help Dexter stop killing by moving in with him and keeping a constant eye on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

After weeks under Debra's surveillance, a stressed out Dexter kidnaps Louis Greene ([[Josh Cooke]]), a former coworker with a grudge against him, with the intent of killing him.

Dexter escapes Debra's watch long enough to dispose of Ray Speltzer ([[Matt Gerald]]), a brutal serial killer who had evaded prison on a technicality, and Debra comes to understand why Dexter kills.

Dexter sets his sights on killing [[Hannah McKay]] ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]), a serial poisoner, who as a teenager, had gone on a cross-country killing spree with her boyfriend. Dexter subdues her and prepares to kill her, but stops when Hannah does not appear to fear him. They are both suddenly overcome with attraction and have sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Do the Wrong Thing | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 4, 2012| season = 7 | number = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dexter falls in love with Hannah, who helps him realize that his "Dark Passenger" does not control his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Dark...

Dexter's romance with Hannah complicates his relationship with Debra, however. Debra is intent on arresting Hannah for the murder of Sal Price, a crime writer for whom Debra had feelings, and Dexter has trouble reconciling his feelings for his girlfriend with his responsibility to his adoptive sister. To make matters worse, Miami-Metro Captain [[Maria LaGuerta]] ([[Lauren Velez]]) reopens the Bay Harbor Butcher case, convinced that Doakes was innocent and that Dexter is hiding something.  When Dexter tries to kill Hector Estrada ([[Nestor Serrano]]), the man who ordered Dexter's mother's murder, LaGuerta arrives at the scene, forcing him to let Estrada go so he can escape. Dexter deduces that LaGuerta had orchestrated Estrada's release from prison to set Dexter up.&lt;ref name="Do You See What I See?"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Do You See What I See? | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 9, 2012| season = 7 | number = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the season, mobster [[List of Dexter characters#Isaak Sirko|Isaak Sirko]] ([[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]]) vows to kill Dexter to avenge his lover, Viktor Baskov ([[Enver Gjokaj]]), a cop killer and one of Dexter's victims. Fearing for his family's safety, Dexter engineers Sirko's arrest, but Sirko is soon released on bail and resumes his vendetta. Sirko asks for Dexter's protection against his former associates, who fear that he will testify against them; in return, he promises Dexter that he will let him live. Dexter refuses, but ends up inadvertently coming to Sirko's aid when one of his former henchmen attacks them both. Dexter kills the mobster, but is too late to save Sirko, who is mortally wounded during the struggle. As he dies, Sirko tells Dexter that it is not too late for Dexter to find happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Helter Skelter | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 25, 2012| season = 7 | number = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debra gets into a near-fatal car accident following a confrontation with Hannah, and insists to Dexter that Hannah poisoned her. Dexter refuses to believe it at first, but he is suspicious enough to order a tox screen on Debra's water bottle found on the driver's floorboard of her car after the accident. To Dexter's horror, the results prove that Hannah had spiked Debra's water with an overdose of [[Xanax]]. Left with no other choice, Dexter gives Debra proof that Hannah murdered Price and looks on, heartbroken, as Debra arrests her.&lt;ref name="Do You See What I See?"/&gt;

LaGuerta has Dexter arrested for the Bay Harbor Butcher murders, but Dexter is released thanks to evidence with which he had tampered to throw LaGuerta off. Dexter is certain that LaGuerta will not give up, however, and resolves to kill her, though doing so would be a violation of his "code". He kidnaps and kills Estrada to lure LaGuerta in, and then knocks her unconscious, planning to shoot her to make it look like Estrada killed her. At that moment, Debra bursts in, holding Dexter at gunpoint and begging him not to go through with it. LaGuerta regains consciousness and urges Debra to kill Dexter. Seeing no way out, Dexter resigns himself to his fate and tells Debra to "do what you have to do". Much to Dexter's surprise, however, Debra turns the gun on LaGuerta, and shoots her dead. As the countdown to the new year begins, Dexter wonders if this is the "beginning of the end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Surprise, Motherfucker! | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 16, 2012| season = 7 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season eight===
The eighth season opens six months later, with Dexter growing increasingly worried about Debra, who has quit the police force and spiraled into depression and self-destructive behavior. Dexter goes to her new job as a private investigator and learns that Debra is pursuing, and sleeping with, drug dealer Andrew Briggs ([[Rhys Coiro]]). When Dexter confronts her, Debra tells him that she wishes she had killed him instead of LaGuerta. A few days later, Dexter learns that an assassin, El Sapo ([[Nick Gomez (actor)|Nick Gomez]]), is going to kill Briggs and Debra, and Dexter goes to Debra's hotel to save her. A scuffle ensues, in which Dexter kills Briggs. He begs Debra to come with him, but she refuses.&lt;ref name="beautiful"&gt;{{cite episode| title = A Beautiful Day | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = June 30, 2013| season = 8 | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon afterward, El Sapo is found dead, and Dexter is called in to investigate. He discovers that some of the blood at the scene belongs to Debra. She admits to killing El Sapo, and Dexter reluctantly covers up the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Every Silver Lining... | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = July 7, 2013| season = 8 | number = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dexter meets Dr. Evelyn Vogel ([[Charlotte Rampling]]), a [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrist]] consulting with Miami Metro about a serial killer dubbed "the Brain Surgeon" who removes parts of his victims' brains. She tells Dexter that she knew Harry, with whom she came up with Dexter's "code". Vogel believes the killer is one of her former patients and asks Dexter to kill him before the killer goes after her.&lt;ref name="beautiful"/&gt;

Quinn calls Dexter to tell him that Debra has shown up at Miami Metro, blind drunk, and confessed to killing LaGuerta. Panicked, Dexter rushes over with Vogel in tow, and knocks Debra unconscious with a low dose of the tranquilizer he uses on his victims. He realizes he cannot help Debra and asks Vogel to treat her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = [[What's Eating Dexter Morgan?]] | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = July 13, 2013| season = 8 | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dexter starts looking into another of Vogel's former patients, serial killer A.J. Yates ([[Aaron McCusker]]). He saves one of Yates' victims and confronts the killer, who escapes. The following day, Debra asks Dexter to take a drive with her so they can talk. During the drive, she intentionally crashes the car into the bay, intent on killing them both. Debra survives, however, and saves Dexter's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Scar Tissue | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = July 14, 2013| season = 8 | number = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Yates kidnaps Vogel, the two of them put aside their differences to track him down.

Dexter sets his sights on a new victim: Zach Hamilton ([[Sam Underwood]]), a teenager from a wealthy family who murdered his father's mistress and is now preparing to kill his father. Dexter kidnaps Zach, who admits that he enjoys killing and will do it again. Seeing in Zach a kindred spirit, Dexter promises to teach him how to kill.&lt;ref name="reflection"&gt;{{cite episode| title = A Little Reflection | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = August 4, 2012| season = 8 | number = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dexter's neighbor Cassie Jollenston ([[Bethany Joy Lenz]]) is murdered, he at first believes Zach is responsible and decides to kill him. Dexter confronts Zach, who swears that he did not target Cassie, but another murderer, giving Dexter hope that Zach can be trained after all. That hope is dashed, however, when Dexter finds Zach's dead body in his apartment &amp;mdash; with a piece of his brain missing.&lt;ref name="there"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Are We There Yet? | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = August 18, 2013| season = 8 | number = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah reappears in Dexter's life when she nonlethally poisons Debra and him,  to get his attention.&lt;ref name="reflection"/&gt; Dexter investigates and finds that she has changed her name and married Miles Castner ([[Julian Sands]]), a wealthy businessman. Dexter goes to see Hannah, who says she had wanted him to kill Castner, but changed her mind after realizing she is still in love with Dexter. Dexter goes to Castner's boat to protect Castner, but finds that Hannah has already killed him. The two of them dispose of the body, and Dexter arranges for her to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Dress Code | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = August 11, 2012| season = 8 | number = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The night before Hannah leaves, however, Dexter and she have sex, and he realizes that he is still in love with her.

After investigating, Dexter discovers that Zach's killer is related to Vogel. Vogel tells Dexter that she had a son, Daniel, who as a teenager murdered his younger brother Richard before apparently dying in a fire. Dexter discovers that Daniel set the fire himself to fake his own death, and that he is now living under the identity of Cassie's boyfriend Oliver Saxon ([[Darri Ingolfsson]]). Dexter suspects that Saxon is the "Brain Surgeon" and warns Vogel, who tells him to stay out of it; Dexter is unaware that she is sheltering her son.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; Dexter makes preparations to move while hunting Saxon, the last "loose end". He goes to Vogel's house to make sure she is safe &amp;mdash; only to see Saxon slit her throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Goodbye Miami| episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 8, 2013| season = 8 | number = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days later, Saxon shows up at Dexter's apartment and offers a truce: he will spare Dexter's family if Dexter will leave him alone. Dexter pretends to accept, but is now more than ever determined to kill Saxon. He finds proof of Saxon's murders, which he turns over to the police so that Saxon will be forced to come after him before he leaves Miami. Dexter then enlists Debra's help in subduing Saxon and prepares to kill him. At the last moment, however, Dexter realizes that his love for Hannah is stronger than his need to kill, and he spares Saxon's life. He calls Debra so she can arrest Saxon, and says his goodbyes to  Harry and her. Saxon escapes his bindings, however, and shoots Debra in the gut when she tries to arrest him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Monkey in a Box | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 15, 2013| season = 8 | number = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series finale, "[[Remember the Monsters?]]", Dexter's flight to Argentina is delayed by a hurricane, and he tells Hannah and Harrison to go on without him, intending to take care of Saxon. When he learns what has happened to Debra, Dexter rushes to her side at the hospital, but she tells him to go on and live a good life. Moments later, she suffers a major stroke that leaves her in a [[persistent vegetative state]]. Dexter blames himself and realizes that he will always destroy those he loves; he sees at last that he can never have a happy life. After Saxon is arrested, Dexter kills him in his cell, and convinces Quinn and Batista that he acted in self-defense. Dexter goes to see Debra one last time, turns off her life support, and buries her at sea. He then fakes his own death by wrecking his boat. The series' final scene reveals that he has assumed a new identity as a lumberjack and begun a new life, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = [[Remember the Monsters?]] | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 22, 2013| season = 8 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cnote|a|While Harry finds the boys in the shipping container on the television show, the investigating officer who finds Dexter is never specified in the novels.}}
{{cnote|b| Brian was ultimately sent to a [[mental institution]] for disturbed children. The first novel implies that Harry chose not to adopt Brian because he was older and more likely to be traumatized; in the TV program, both Brian and Tom Matthews, Harry's best friend and former superior, state this to be true.}}

'''''Epítome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada''''' (English: ''Summary of the conquest of the New Kingdom of Granada'') is a document of uncertain authorship, possibly (partly) written by [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] between 1548 and 1559. The book was not published until 1889 by [[List of Muisca scholars|anthropologist]] [[Marcos Jiménez de la Espada]] in his work ''Juan de Castellanos y su Historia del Nuevo Reino de Granada''.

''Epítome'' narrates about the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]], from the start from Santa Marta in April 1536 to the leave of main conquistador Jiménez de Quesada in April 1539 from Bogotá, arriving to Spain, about "The Salt People" ([[Muisca people|Muisca]]) encountered in the conquest expedition in the heart of the [[Colombia]]n [[Andes]], their society, rules, [[Muisca religion|religion]], [[Muisca mummification|handling of the dead]], [[Muisca warfare|warfare]] and neighbouring "cannibalistic" [[Panche people|Panche]].

The text has been studied by various authors over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, mainly by [[Juan Friede]] and modern [[List of Muisca scholars|scholars]] and various theories about authorship and temporal setting have been proposed. The document is held by the [[National Historical Archive (Spain)|National Historical Archive]] in [[Madrid]], Spain.

== Contents ==
The document is written in old Spanish in the present tense and first person with descriptions of Jiménez de Quesada, written as Ximénez de Quesada, in the third person. The margins of the main texts are notes with sometimes difficult to discern text, vagued in time.&lt;ref name=Ramos_p283&gt;Ramos Pérez, 1972, p.283&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The route from the coast to ''La Tora'' ===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca#1536 - the harsh expedition towards Muisca territory}}
''Epítome'' starts with a description of the Caribbean coastal area where the expedition [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]] started. The author speaks of the [[Magdalena River]], dividing the Spanish provinces of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] to the west and [[Santa Marta]] to the east. In the document, the Magdalena River is also called ''Río Grande'', thanks to the great width of the river close to Santa Marta. A description of the journey over the river is given where the heavy and frequent rains made it impossible to disembark the ships ([[brigantine]]s). According to the ''Epítome'', the Spanish could not ascend further than [[El Paso, Cesar|Sompallón]]. The distance unit used, is the ''legua'' ([[league (unit)|league]]), an old and poorly defined unit of distance varying from {{convert|4|km|mi}} to {{convert|6|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p81&gt;''Epítome'', p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second page, the rich [[gold]]en [[Muisca mummification|burial sites]] of the [[Zenú]] are described, as well as the routes inland from later [[Venezuela]], that was conquered by German conquistadors. The next paragraph narrates about the start of the main expedition inland from Santa Marta, leaving the city in the month of April 1536. It is said Gonzalo Ximénez de Quesada left with 600 men, divided into 8 groups of [[infantry]], 10 groups of [[cavalry]] and a number of brigs on the Magdalena River. De Quesada and his troops marched over land on the bank of the river. Names of the captains in the army of De Quesada are given as ''San Martín'' ([[Juan de Sanct Martín]]), ''Céspedes'' ([[Juan de Céspedes Ruiz|Juan de Céspedes]]), ''Valençuela'' ([[Pedro Fernández de Valenzuela (conquistador)|Pedro Fernández de Valenzuela]]), [[Lázaro Fonte]], ''Librixa'' ([[Antonio de Lebrija (conquistador)|Antonio de Lebrija]]), [[Juan del Junco|Juan de(l) Junco]] and ''Suarex'' ([[Gonzalo Suárez Rendón]]). The captains heading the brigs are named as ''Corral'' ([[Francisco Gómez del Corral]]), ''Cardosso'' ([[Antonio Díaz de Cardoso]]) and ''Albarracín'' ([[Juan de Albarracín]]). The troops went out of free will and consent of the governor of Santa Marta; [[Pedro de Lugo]], ''after the death of [[García de Lerma]]''. The troops went under command of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p82&gt;''Epítome'', p.82&lt;/ref&gt; The third page describes that the troops spent more than a year and more than 100 ''leguas'' on their journey. They reached ''La Tora'' [present-day [[Barrancabermeja]]], farther than any soldier had gone before, after 150 ''leguas''. The expedition took so long because of the waters and the narrow passages of the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p83&gt;''Epítome'', p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''El Camino de la Sal'' ===
[[File:Salt - Nemocón 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The high quality salt of the Muisca gave them the name "The Salt People" and drew the conquistadors inland]]
[[File:Altiplano Cundiboyacense.png|thumb|right|250px|The Altiplano Cundiboyacense was entered in March 1537 by the greatly reduced troops of De Quesada, following the [[Suárez River]] upstream]]
From ''La Tora'', Jiménez de Quesada sent the ships further upriver, for another 20 ''leguas'', until it became impossible to continue. The indigenous (''yndios'') here didn't live on the river banks, but on small islands. Because of the impossible trajectory along the river, Jiménez de Quesada agreed to ascend over land "on his left hand", climbing a mountain range that later became known as the [[Sierras del Opón]]. The consumption of salt is described as coming from Santa Marta along the river for "70 leguas" and so far from the coast the grainy salt was expensive and only available to the highest social classes. The rest of the salt came from [[urine]] or palm trees. Higher up, the salt was different; came in loafs, much like sugar loafs.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p83/&gt;

The salt of this type was less expensive and the conquistadors concluded that the grainy salt went up the river, while the better salt came from higher altitudes down the river. The indigenous people who carried the salt, told the conquistadors that it was coming from a land of richness. This led the Spanish uphill, on the ''Camino de la Sal'' ("The Salt Route") to search for its source. At this point, the Sierras del Opón were crossed and the brigantines returned to the coast, leaving the majority of the soldiers with De Quesada because many of his troops had died already during the expedition. The route over the Sierras del Opón is described as rugged and little populated by natives, a journey of various days and 50 ''leguas'' long. In the sparse settlements, the conquistadors found great quantities of the high quality salts and after a while they had crossed the difficult mountainous area, reaching a flatter terrain, described as "what would become the New Kingdom of Granada". It is described that the people of this area were different and also spoke a different language from the people along the Magdalena River and of the Sierras del Opón, making it impossible to understand them at first. Over time, it became possible to communicate and the people in the flatter area, called ''San Gregorio'' provided the conquistadors with [[emerald]]s.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p84&gt;''Epítome'', p.84&lt;/ref&gt; Jiménez de Quesada asked the people where they were coming from and the natives pointed him to the ''Valle de los Alcázares'' ([[Bogotá savanna]]), upon which the troops headed that way. They encountered a "king" they called ''Bogothá'' who gave the conquistadors many [[Muisca art#goldworking|golden objects]] to expel the Spanish from his lands and the indigenous people told the Spanish the emeralds were coming from lands belonging to the "king" of [[Tunja]].&lt;ref name=Epitome_p85&gt;''Epítome'', p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entering Muisca territory ===
[[File:Sabana de Bogota.png|thumb|right|250px|De Quesada and his men conquered first the flatlands of "Bogothá" (''Bacatá'')]]
{{see also|Altiplano Cundiboyacense|Bogotá savanna|Muisca Confederation}}
The lands crossing the Sierras del Opón consisted of valleys (on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]), where each valley was ruled by a different person. The valleys were densely populated and around the valleys (to the west) lived indigenous people who were called ''[[Panche people|Panches]]''. They consumed human flesh, while the people from the New Kingdom of Granada (i.e. [[Muisca people|Muisca]], called ''moxcas'') did not perform [[cannibalism]]. Also the difference in [[Muisca Confederation#Climate|climate]] is reported; the Panche lived in warm climates while the Muisca lived in cold or temperate climates. ''Epítome'' describes the extent of the New Kingdom as "130 leguas, more or less, long" and "30 leguas, in some parts 20 wide". The Kingdom is divided into two provinces; that of Tunja and of Bogotá (modern names are used). The document describes that the [[Muisca rulers|rulers]] have surnames referring to the terrain and are "very powerful" and have ''[[cacique]]s'' who are subject to their reign. The population is described as approximately "70,000 in the Bogotá area, that is larger" and about "40,000 in the smaller and less powerful Tunja province". The relation between Tunja and Bogotá is described as filled with many and ancient [[Muisca warfare|wars]]. According to the ''Epítome'', the people from the Bogotá area had long-standing wars with the Panche, that lived closer to them than to the people from the Tunja province.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p85/&gt;

=== From Funza to Hunza ===
[[File:Beryl-Calcite-Pyrite-62617.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The route to Somondoco led the conquistadors for the first time into the rich emerald terrains of the Muisca&lt;br&gt;''sample from Chivor mine'']]
Jiménez de Quesada left Bogotá and went to ''Coçontá'' ([[Chocontá]]), that he called ''Valle del Spiritusancto''. From there he went to [[Turmequé]] in a valley he named ''Valle de la Trompeta'', the first of the Tunja lands.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p85/&gt; From Turmequé he send his men to discover the emerald mines and after that leaving for another valley, of San Juan, in [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]] called ''Tenesucha'' and from there to the valley of [[Somondoco]] where he spoke to the ''cacique Sumindoco'', who governed the mines or quarries of emeralds and was subject to the ''gran cacique'' of Tunja. Many emeralds were extracted. He decided to continue to search for the ''cacique'' of Tunja, who was at war with the Christians. The document describes the lands of Tunja as richer than those of Bogotá, although those were already rich, but gold and precious emeralds are more abundant in Tunja. In total 1800 emeralds, large and small were found and De Quesada had never seen so many and precious ones in his life. The rich resources of Peru are described in relation to the mines of Tunja, where the emeralds were more numerous than in Peru. ''Epítome'' describes the process of extracting the emeralds with wooden sticks from the veins in the rocks.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p87&gt;''Epítome'', p.87&lt;/ref&gt; From the emerald mines of Tunja, he returned to Bogotá.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p86&gt;''Epítome'', p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception of the conquistadors by the Muisca ===

[[File:Estatua a los indígenas 2014-09-13.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The guecha warriors of the bellicose Panche are described as cannibals]]
''Epítome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada'' continues with a description of how the indigenous people received and saw the conquistadors. The people experienced great fears seeing the Spanish, and saw them as children of the deities Sun ([[Sué]]) and Moon ([[Chía (goddess)|Chía]]). The people believed, according to ''Epítome'', they were sent to punish the people for their sins. Hence they named the Spanish ''usachíes''; a combination of ''Usa'', referring to the Sun and ''Chíe'' to the Moon as "children of the Sun and the Moon". The document narrates that the [[Women in Muisca society|Muisca women]] climbed the hills surrounding the valleys and threw their infants to the Spanish, some from their breasts, to stop the fury of the gods. It is described that the people very much feared the horses, and only bit by bit got used to them.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p87/&gt; ''Epítome'' says that the people started to attack the Spanish, but were easily beaten because they feared the horses so much and fled. The text describes this as the common practice in the battles of the indigenous people (''bárbaros'') against the conquistadors during all of 1537 and part of 1538, until they finally bowed to the reign of his Majesty, the King of Spain.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p88&gt;''Epítome'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Panche ===
{{main|Panche people}}
The description of the Panche is different in ''Epítome'' than the Muisca; the Panche are described as a much more war-like people, their rugged terrain worse for the cavalry and the style of warfare different. While the Muisca "fought" using screams and shouting, the Panche are described as fighting silently with [[slingshot]]s, poisoned arrows and large heavy poles made of palm trees (''macanas'') swinging them with both hands to hit their enemies. The practice, later described from the Muisca as well, of tieing [[Muisca mummification|mummies]] on their backs is reported from the Panche. The habit is described as showing what will happen to their opponents; fighting like they fought and to instigate fear in the enemy.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p88/&gt; Of the Panche is described that when they won their battles, they celebrated their victory with festivities, took the children of their enemies to [[Muisca religion#Sacrifice|sacrifice]] them, captured the women and killed the men by poking out the eyes of the combat leaders. The combat of the Panche is described as fiercer as of the Muisca and the combatants walked naked. They had tubes made of animal skins where they held the lances and bow and arrows to shoot. The Panche warriors are described as eating the flesh of their enemies at the battlefield or later at home with their wives and children. The process of treaties is described as performed not by the men, but by the women, as "they cannot be refused".&lt;ref name=Epitome_p89&gt;''Epítome'', p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Descriptions of society ===
[[File:Rc11029 Timucua Indian village drawing by Le Moyne de Morgues.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The construction of the ''bohíos'' of the Muisca was similar to that found in North America; a circular structure of wooden poles surrounding the settlements with a central larger house for the ''cacique'']]
The people, and especially the women, from the New Kingdom are described as highly religious and beautiful in faces and body shapes; less brown than "the other indigenous that we have seen". The women wore white, black and colourful dresses that covered their bodies from breast to feet instead of the capes and mantles seen with other natives (''Yndias''). On their heads they wore [[garland]]s (''guirnaldas'') of [[cotton]], decorated with flowers.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p89/&gt; The ''caciques'' wore hats (''[[:es:Bonete (indumentaria)|bonetes]]'') made of cotton. The wives of the ''caciques'' wore a type of [[Kofia (hat)|kofia]] on their heads. The climate and daytime is described as roughly the same all year round and the [[Muisca architecture|architecture]] of the houses as made of wood. The houses of the ''caciques'' are located behind various circular posts, described in ''Epítome'' as "a labyrinth of Troy". The houses were surrounded by large patios and painted walls.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p90&gt;''Epítome'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cuisine ====
{{main|Muisca cuisine}}
[[File:Cavia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Guinea pigs were already domesticated by the ancestors of the Muisca and served as part of the carnivorous diet for the people]] 
The [[Muisca cuisine|cuisine]] of the Muisca is described as mainly consisting of [[maize]] and [[yuca]], with other food coming from farther away. Plantation of the various [[tubers]] was arranged in multiple ways. The infinite supply of [[Muisca economy#Mining|salt]] is described in ''Epítome'', extracted from wells on the Bogotá savanna [in [[Zipaquirá]], [[Nemocón]] and other places] and made into loafs of salt. The salt was traded up until the north, the Sierras del Opón and until the Magdalena River, as earlier described. The meat of the people consisted of [[white-tailed deer|deer]], that is described to have been in great quantities, "like livestock in Spain". Other meat were [[eastern cottontail|rabbits]], also in large quantities, and named ''fucos''. ''Epítome'' names those "rabbits" also existed in Santa Marta and other parts, where they were called ''curíes'' ([[guinea pig]]s). Poultry is named as [[pigeon]]s and ducks, that are raised in the many lakes. The diet is supplied further with fish, described as only one species and small, "only one or two handpalms long", but of a good taste.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p90/&gt;

==== Penalties, position of ''caciques'' and marriage ====
The [[Nemequene#Code of Nemequene|penal system of the Muisca]] is described as "moral" and of "medium reason", because the offenses are punished "very well". ''Epítome'' describes "there are more gallows than in Spain" with people hanging between two posts with arms, feet and hair attached to them. The Muisca are described as cutting hands, noses and ears for "not so serious crimes". Shaming happened to the [[Muisca society|higher social classes]] where hair and pieces of the clothing were cut. The respect for the ''caciques'' is told to have been "enormous", as the people didn't look them in the face and when a ''cacique'' enters, the people turned and inclined showing him their backs. When the "Bogothá" (''[[zipa]]'') spit, the people caught his saliva in cotton bowls, to prevent it from hitting the ground.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p91&gt;''Epítome'', p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

When the people were marrying, the men are reported to not organise festivities, but simply take the [[Women in Muisca society|women]] home. [[Polygamy]] is noted; "the men could marry as many women as they wanted, given that they could maintain them"; so some had ten wives and others twenty. Of the "Bogothá" is stated that "he had more than 400 wives". Marrying first degree relatives was forbidden and in some parts second degree marriages too. [[Women in Muisca society#Matrilineal heritage of rule|Heritage of rule]] was not the sons of the former ''cacique'', but the siblings and if they didn't have or lived, the sons of the brother or sister of the deceased ''cacique''.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p91/&gt;

==== Time-keeping and preparation for young ''caciques'' ====
[[File:CalendièrMuisca.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The complex Muisca calendar&lt;br&gt;''sketch by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'']]
{{main|Muisca calendar}}
The [[Muisca calendar|conscience of time]] is specified as years and months well divided, with during the first ten days of the months a habit of eating [[coca]] (''hayo''). The next ten days are for working the [[Muisca agriculture|farmfields]] and [[Muisca architecture|houses]]. The last ten days are described as time when people rest and the women live separately from the men; all the women together in one ''bohío'' and every man in his own.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p91/&gt; It is reported that in other parts of the New Kingdom of Granada, the division of time is different; the described ten day periods are longer and two months of the year are reserved for [[lent|fasting]] (''quaresma'').&lt;ref name=Epitome_p92&gt;''Epítome'', p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for the ''cacicazgo'', the young boys and girls are held solitary in houses for some years, depending on the role they will fulfill in society. They are incarcerated for seven years in small spaces without a view of the Sun and given delicacies at certain times. Only the people caring for the children are allowed access to the space and they torture them. After their imprisonment, the children are allowed to wear [[Muisca art#Jewelry|golden jewels]]; nosepieces and earrings. The people are also described as wearing breast plates, golden [[mitre]]s (''mitras'') and bracelets. ''Epítome'' reports the people lost themselves in [[Muisca music|music, singing and dances]], one of their greatest pleasures. The author calls the people "lying very much, they never tell the truth". The [[Muisca art#Goldworking|goldworking]] and [[Muisca economy#Weaving|weaving]] by the Muisca is described as "the first not as well as the people from [[New Spain]] and the second not as well as the people from [[Inca Empire|Peru]]".&lt;ref name=Epitome_p92/&gt;

==== Religion, sacrifice and warfare ====
{{main|Muisca religion|Muisca mythology|Muisca warfare}}
[[File:Chía Bogotá May 2016.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Chía, the Moon goddess, was one of the two most celebrated deities in the Muisca religion. Her main temple was located in [[Chía, Cundinamarca|Chía]], just north of present-day [[Bogotá]]]]
[[File:Templo del Sol - Suamox - Smoke at Fiesta del Huán.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]] in [[Sogamoso|Suamox]] was the most important sacred site in the religion of the Muisca. Herbs as ''yopo'' and ''tobacco'' were burnt and the smoke inhaled at the rituals performed there]]
The [[Muisca religion|religion]] of the Muisca is reported as very important and they constructed in each settlement a temple, with many others scattered across the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense|area]], accessible by [[Muisca architecture#Roads|roads]] and isolated. Lots of gold and [[Colombian Emeralds|emeralds]] adorn the sacred places. The process of [[Muisca religion#Sacrifice|sacrifices]] is described as happening with blood, water and fire. Birds are killed and their blood runs over the temples, their heads hanging from the sides of the holy places. Water running through pipes also is used as a sacrifice. Fire and aromatic smoke is used in the temples too. The religious rituals are reported to be accompanied with singing.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p92/&gt;

It is described the Muisca did not sacrifice humans for religious purposes, yet in two other ways. When the [[Panche people|Panche]] were beaten, the boys who were presumed still being virgin were taken and sacrificed. The ritual passed with screams and the heads of the victims were hanged on the posts of their ''bohíos''. The other way would be to sacrifice the young boys by priests [''chyquy''] close to the temples.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p93&gt;''Epítome'', p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

''Epítome'' reports the young boys called ''moxas'', taken from a place called ''Casa del Sol'' at thirty ''leguas'' from the New Kingdom. They are carried on the shoulders and stay seven to eight years in the temples to be sacrificed afterwards. The process is described as cutting their heads off and letting the blood flow over the sacred sites. The boys have to be virgins, as if they are not, their blood is not considered pure enough to serve as sacrifice. Before going to war, the guecha warriors are described to stay one month in a temple, with people outside singing and dancing and the Muisca honouring Sué and Chía. The warriors sleep and eat little during this time. After the battles, the people perform the same ritual for various days and when the warriors are defeated, they also do this to lament the losses.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p93/&gt;

During these rituals, the people are described to burn certain herbs, called ''Jop'' ([[Anadenanthera peregrina|yopo]]) and ''Osca'' (''hosca''; [[tobacco]]) in ''Epítome'', inhaling the smoke and putting those herbs on the joints of their bodies. When certain joints are moving it would be a sign of luck in [[Muisca warfare|warfare]] and when others move, it means bad luck.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p93/&gt;

The sacred sites of the Muisca consist of forests and lakes, according to ''Epítome'', where the people bury gold and emeralds and throw those precious resources in the lakes. The people do not cut the trees of the sacred woods but bury their [[Muisca mummification|dead]] there. The Sun and Moon are considered husband and wife and are celebrated as the creators of things. Apart from that, the people have various other gods, "much like our [Spanish] saints", honoured in temples throughout the area. On top of that, the people all have personal idols, called in ''Epítome'' ''Lares'' (''[[tunjo]]s''). They are described as small figures made of fine gold with emeralds in their bellies. It is described the people wore those on their arms and when going to battle, having them in one hand and the weapons in the other, "especially in the province of Tunja where the people are more religious."&lt;ref name=Epitome_p94&gt;''Epítome'', p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The dead and afterlife ====
[[File:Momia-museo-del-oro-2500px.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Muisca mummy]]
{{main|Muisca mummification}}
The dead, as reported in ''Epítome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada'', are buried in two ways; in Tunja the main members of society are not buried, yet their intestines taken out, wrapped in cloths, and adorned with gold and emeralds placed on slightly elevated beds in special dedicated ''bohíos'' and left there forever.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p94/&gt; The other way of treating the deceased Muisca is in Bogotá, where they are buried or thrown into the deepest lakes after putting them in coffins filled with gold and emeralds.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p95&gt;''Epítome'', p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas about the [[afterlife]] of the Muisca is described as "barbaric" and "confused" in terms of the immortality of the soul. The people who have been good in life would have great pleasures and rest after their death, while those who were bad during their lifetime would have a lot of work and be punished with lashes. The guecha who died in warfare and the women dying when giving birth would have access to the same right of rest and pleasures, "although they were bad in life".&lt;ref name=Epitome_p95/&gt;

In contrast to the spiritual life of the Muisca, the Panche are described as immoral, as they only care about their crimes and vices. ''Epítome'' narrates they do not care about gold or other precious things of life, yet only about war, pleasure and eating human flesh, the only reason to invade the New Kingdom. In other parts of the Panche territories, "close to Tunja across two fast flowing rivers", it is noted that the people eat [[ants]] and make bread of the insects. The ants (''hormiga culona'', still a delicacy in [[Santander Department|Santander]]) are described as available in great quantities, some small, but mostly large. The people of the region kept them as livestock enclosed by large leaves.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p95/&gt;

=== Return to Spain of the conquest leaders ===
[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta I - Rutas de los conquistadores de Colombia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The last part of ''Epítome'' describes the establishment of the New Kingdom of Granada, here shown in '''{{orange|orange}}''', with the three cities Bogotá, Tunja and Vélez]]
[[File:Rio Magdalena map.png|thumb|right|250px|The Magdalena River is the main fluvial artery of Andean Colombia and formed part of the route south into the Muisca Confederation in 1536-37 and all of the journey for Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada returning to the coast for his voyage back to Spain]]
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca#April 1539 - return to Spain of Gonzalo, Sebastián and Nikolaus}}
The period of conquest of the New Kingdom of Granada is reported in ''Epítome'' to have taken most of 1538. This period resulted in the creation of three main cities; the province of Bogotá in the city of "[[Bogotá|Santa Fee]]", the province of Tunja in the [[Tunja|city with the same name]] and the later founded city of [[Vélez, Santander|Vélez]], where the conquistadors entered afterwards. The conquest is said to have been completed in the year 1539, when Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada ("El Licenciado") returned to Spain to report to the King and claim his rewards. ''Epítome'' describes that Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada left the reign of the New Kingdom in the hands of his brother, [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada]], and traveled along the [[Magdalena River]] (''Río Grande'') using brigs to not have to cross the strenuous Sierras del Opón again, the way he reached Bogotá.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p96&gt;''Epítome'', p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

It is described that "one month before this leave" from Venezuela came [[Nikolaus Federmann|Nicolás Fedreman]] [sic], captain under [[Georg von Speyer|Jorge Espira]], governor of the province of Venezuela for the Germans, with news about natives from very rich lands. He brought 150 men with him. During the same period, some fifteen days later, came from Peru [[Sebastián de Belalcázar|Sebastián de Venalcázar]], captain under [[Francisco Pizarro]], and brought 100 soldiers and the same news. The three commanders laughed about their three years so close to each other. ''Epítome'' describes that Jiménez de Quesada took all of the soldiers of De Federman and half of those of De Benalcázar to refresh his troops and sent them to the settlements of the New Kingdom to populate the area. The other half of De Benalcázar's men he sent (back) to the province between the New Kingdom and [[Quito]], called [[Popayán#History|Popayán]], of which De Benalcázar was governor. Federmann and some of his men accompanied De Quesada in his journey along the Magdalena River to the coast and back to Spain. ''Epítome'' reports they arrived there in November 1539, when the Spanish King was crossing France to reach [[Flanders]].&lt;ref name=Epitome_p96/&gt;

On the last page of ''Epítome'' it is said that the ''Licenciado'' had differences of opinion with [[Alonso de Lugo]], married to Beatriz de Noroña, sister of María de Mendoza, wife of the great commander De Léon. The disagreements were about the reign over the New Kingdom, because De Lugo and his son had the governance over [[Santa Marta]]. It is described that his [sic] Majesty created a Royal Chancillery in the year 1547 [sic] with ''oídores'' in charge of the New Kingdom. The name of the New Kingdom of Granada was given by Jiménez de Quesada based on the [[Kingdom of Granada]] "here" (in Spain), that showed similiraties in size, topography and climate.&lt;ref name=Epitome_p97&gt;''Epítome'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

The text notes that Jiménez de Quesada received for his efforts of conquering and populating the New Kingdom the title ''Mariscal'' and 2000 ducats for him and his descendants for the reign of the New Kingdom. For the natives of the New Kingdom another 8000 ducats were provided as well as an annual fee of 400 ducats for the [[List of mayors of Bogotá|mayor of Bogotá]].&lt;ref name=Epitome_p97/&gt;

The closing paragraph of ''Epítome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada'' concludes with the description of the family of Jiménez de Quesada as son of Gonçalo Ximénez and Ysabel de Quesada, living in the city of [[Granada, Spain|Granada]] and originating from [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name=Epitome_p97/&gt;

== Theories about authorship ==
[[File:Alonso de Santa Cruz (MUNCYT, Eulogia Merle).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alonso de Santa Cruz may have been a (partial) author of ''Epítome'']]
''Epítome'' has produced a number of reviewing articles, books and other texts since the first publication by Jiménez de la Espada in 1889. [[Enrique Otero D'Costa]] has attributed parts of ''Epítome'' to Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, written in 1539, and other parts to other people, unrelated to the conquistador.&lt;ref name=Friede_p93/&gt; Friede concludes these errors not definitive; he maintains the ''Epítome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada'' is written in its totality in the years 1548 to 1549, when Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada was in Spain.&lt;ref name=Friede_p94&gt;Friede, 1960, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Fernando Caro Molina concluded in 1967 that only minor parts were written by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada.&lt;ref name=CaroMolina_p130&gt;Caro Molina, 1967, p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmen Millán de Benavides wrote an article in 2014, a book in 2001, and her PhD thesis about the document in 1997.&lt;ref name=CVBenavides&gt;{{es}} [http://scienti.colciencias.gov.co:8081/cvlac/visualizador/generarCurriculoCv.do?cod_rh=0000177253 ''Curriculum Vitae'' Carmen Millán de Benavides] - Colciencias&lt;/ref&gt; She concludes the work is written by [[Alonso de Santa Cruz]] (1505-1567), [[cosmographer]] who worked for the kings [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos II]] and [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]].&lt;ref name=Millan2014_p11&gt;Millán de Benavides, 2014, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; She describes the ''Epítome'' as a fragmentary text, not a narrative.&lt;ref name=Millan2014_p14&gt;Millán de Benavides, 2014, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviations used in the text, led her to conclude it was a scribble text, not meant for direct publication.&lt;ref name=Millan2014_p15&gt;Millán de Benavides, 2014, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel Lucena Salmoral wrote in an article in 1962 that the document was written by an unknown writer, none of the authors suggested by other researchers.&lt;ref name=CaroMolina_p117&gt;Caro Molina, 1967, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Also Javier Vergara y Velasco maintains the document is written entirely by someone else.&lt;ref name=Millan2001_p27&gt;Millán de Benavides, 2001, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Folklore''' is the expressive body of culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the [[Tradition|traditions]] common to that culture, subculture or group. These include [[oral traditions]] such as [[Narrative|tales]], [[proverbs]] and [[jokes]]. They include [[material culture]], ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes [[Tradition|customary lore]], the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a [[Cultural artifact|folklore artifact]]. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. Folklore is not something one can typically gain in a formal school curriculum or study in the [[fine arts]]. Instead, these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called [[Folklore studies]], and it can be explored at undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfs.osu.edu/about/resources/programs|title=Folklore Programs in the US and Canada|last=|first=|date=November 7, 2018|website=Ohio State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
To fully understand folklore, it is helpful to clarify its component parts: the terms '''folk''' and '''lore'''. It is well-documented that the term was coined in 1846 by the Englishman [[William Thoms]]. He fabricated it to replace the contemporary terminology of "popular antiquities" or "popular literature". The second half of the compound word, ''[[:wikt:lore|lore]]'', proves easier to define as its meaning has stayed relatively stable over the last two centuries. Coming from Old English lār 'instruction,' and with German and Dutch cognates, it is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group, frequently passed along by word of mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/lore|title=lore - Definition of lore in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''folk'' proves somewhat more elusive. When Thoms first created this term, ''folk'' applied only to rural, frequently poor and illiterate peasants. A more modern definition of ''folk'' is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits, who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions. "Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] or to a [[Family folklore|single family.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv |Dundes|1969|page=13, footnote 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded social definition of ''folk'' supports a broader view of the material, i.e. the lore, considered to be ''folklore artifacts''. These now include all "things people make with words (verbal lore), things they make with their hands (material lore), and things they make with their actions (customary lore)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wilson|2006|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folklore is no longer circumscribed as being chronologically old or obsolete. The folklorist studies the [[traditional]] artifacts of a social group and how they are transmitted.

'''Transmission''' is a vital part of the folklore process. Without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time, they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists. For folklore is also a verb. These [[Cultural artifacts|folk artifacts]] continue to be passed along informally, as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants. The folk group is not individualistic, it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community. "As new groups emerge, new folklore is created… surfers, motorcyclists, [[:Category:Computer folklore|computer programmers]]".&lt;ref name="Dundes"&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1980|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In direct contrast to [[high culture]], where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law, folklore is a function of shared identity within the social group.&lt;ref name="Bauman"&gt;{{harv|Bauman|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having identified folk artifacts, the professional folklorist strives to understand the '''significance''' of these beliefs, customs and objects for the group. For these cultural units&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group. That meaning can however shift and morph. So [[Halloween]] of the 21st century is not the All Hallows' Eve of the Middle Ages, and even gives rise to its own set of  [[Poisoned candy myths|urban legends]] independent of the historical celebration. The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water; now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew. Compare this to brushing your teeth, also transmitted within a group, which remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1965|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For tradition is initially remembered behavior. Once it loses its practical purpose, there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action. This meaning is at the core of folkloristics, the study of folklore.

With an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences, it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group, it is indeed all around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not have to be old or antiquated. It continues to be created, transmitted and in any group is used to differentiate between "us" and "them".

==Origin and development of folklore studies==
{{main|Folkloristics#History of Folklore Studies}}

Folklore began to distinguish itself as an autonomous discipline during the period of romantic nationalism in Europe. A particular figure in this development was [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], whose writings in the 1770s presented oral traditions as organic processes grounded in locale. After the German states were invaded by Napoleonic France, Herder's approach was adopted by many of his fellow Germans who systematized the recorded folk traditions and used them in their process of [[nation building]]. This process was enthusiastically embraced by smaller nations like Finland, Estonia, and Hungary, which were seeking political independence from their dominant neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Noyes|2012|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklore as a field of study further developed among 19th century European scholars who were contrasting [[tradition]] with the newly developing [[modernity]]. Its focus was the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations, which were considered as residue and survivals of the past that continued to exist within the lower strata of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Noyes|2012|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Kinder- und Hausmärchen]]" of the [[Brothers Grimm]] (first published 1812) is the best known but by no means only collection of verbal folklore of the European peasantry of that time. This interest in stories, sayings and songs continued throughout the 19th century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folkloristics with literature and mythology. By the turn into the 20th century the number and sophistication of folklore studies and folklorists had grown both in Europe and North America. Whereas European folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogenous peasant populations in their regions, the American folklorists, led by [[Franz Boas]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], chose to consider [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures in their research, and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore. This distinction aligned American folkloristics with [[cultural anthropology]] and [[ethnology]], using the same techniques of data collection in their field research. This divided alliance of folkloristics between the humanities in Europe and the social sciences in America offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folkloristics as a whole, even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Zumwalt|Dundes|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Folkloristics'', along with its synonym ''Folklore Studies'',&lt;ref group=note&gt;The word ''Folkloristics'' is favored by Alan Dundes, and used in the title of his publication {{harv|Dundes|1978}}. The term ''Folklore Studies'' is defined and used by [[Simon Bronner]], see {{harv|Bronner|1986|page=xi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; gained currency in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the [[cultural artifacts|folklore artifacts]] themselves. With the passage in 1976 of the American Folklife Preservation Act, (P.L. 94-201),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/folklife/public_law.html|title=Public Law 94-201 (The Creation of the American Folklife Center, Library of Congress)|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the U.S. Congress in conjunction with the Bicentennial Celebration in 1976, folkloristics in the United States came of age.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"…[Folklife] means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the United States: familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music, play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft; these expressions are mainly learned orally, by imitation, or in performance, and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Added to the panoply of other legislation designed to protect the natural and [[cultural heritage]] of the United States, this law also marks a shift in national awareness. It gives voice to a growing understanding that cultural diversity is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection. Paradoxically, it is a unifying feature, not something that separates the citizens of a country. "We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved, but as a tremendous opportunity. In the diversity of American folklife we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas, a rich resource for Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diversity is celebrated annually at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] and many other [[List of folk festivals|folklife fests]] around the country.

==Definition of folk==

The folk of the 19th century, the social group identified in the [[Folkloristics#From Antiquities to Lore|original term "folklore"]], was characterized by being rural, illiterate and poor. They were the peasants living in the countryside, in contrast to the urban populace of the cities. Only toward the end of the century did the urban proletariat (on the coattails of Marxist theory) become included with the rural poor as folk. The common feature in this expanded definition of folk was their identification as the underclass of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1980|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving forward into the 20th century, in tandem with new thinking in the [[History of sociology#20th century: critical theory.2C postmodernism.2C and positivist revival|social sciences]], folklorists also revised and expanded their concept of the folk group. By the 1960s it was understood that [[social groups]], i.e. folk groups, were all around us; each individual is enmeshed in a multitude of differing identities and their concomitant social groups. The first group that each of us is born into is the family, and each family has its own unique [[Family folklore|folklore]]. As a child grows into an individual, its identities also increase to include age, language, ethnicity, occupation, etc. Each of these cohorts has its own folklore, and as one folklorist points out, this is "not idle speculation… Decades of fieldwork have demonstrated conclusively that these groups do have their own folklore."&lt;ref name="Dundes" /&gt; In this modern understanding, folklore is a function of shared identity within any social group.&lt;ref name="Bauman" /&gt;

This folklore can include jokes, sayings and expected behavior in multiple variants, always transmitted in an informal manner. For the most part it will be learned by observation, imitation, repetition or correction by other group members. This informal knowledge is used to confirm and re-inforce the identity of the group. It can be used both internally within the group to express their common identity, for example in an initiation ceremony for new members. Or it can be used externally to differentiate the group from outsiders, like a folkdance demonstration at a community festival. Significant to folklorists here is that there are two opposing but equally valid ways to use this in the study of a group: you can start with an identified group in order to explore its folklore, or you can identify folklore items and use them to identify the social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|1971|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, a further expansion of the concept of folk began to unfold in folkloristics. Individual researchers identified folk groups which had previously been overlooked and ignored. One major example of this is found in an issue of "The Journal of American Folklore", published 1975. This edition is dedicated exclusively to articles on women's folklore, with approaches that were not coming from a man's perspective.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Contributors of this issue were, among others, Claire Farrer, Joan N. Radner, Susan Lanser, Elaine Lawless, and Jeannie B. Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups that were highlighted as part of this broadened understanding of the folk group were [[Family folklore#Family as a folk group|non-traditional families]], occupational groups, and families that pursued production of folk items through multiple generations.

==Genres: the lore of folklore==
Individual folklore artifacts are commonly classified as one of three types: material, verbal or customary lore. For the most part self-explanatory, these categories include physical objects ('''material folklore'''), common sayings, expressions, stories and songs ('''verbal folklore'''), and beliefs and ways of doing things ('''customary folklore'''). There is also a fourth major subgenre defined for [[Childlore|children's folklore]] and games ('''childlore'''), as the collection and interpretation of this fertile topic is peculiar to school yards and neighborhood streets.&lt;ref name="Opie"&gt;{{harv|Opie|Opie|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these genres and their subtypes is intended to organize and categorize the folklore artifacts; they provide common vocabulary and consistent labeling for folklorists to communicate with each other.

That said, each artifact is unique; in fact one of the characteristics of all folklore artifacts is their variation within genres and types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|Jones|1995|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in direct contrast to manufactured goods, where the goal in production is to create products which are identical, and variations are considered mistakes. It is however just this required variation that makes identification and classification of the defining features a challenge. And while this classification is essential for the subject area of folkloristics, it remains just labeling, and adds little to an understanding of the traditional development and meaning of the artifacts themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Necessary as they are, genre classifications are misleading in their oversimplification of the subject area. Folklore artifacts are never self-contained, they do not stand in isolation but are particulars in the self-representation of a community. Different genres are frequently combined with each other to mark an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So a birthday celebration might include a song or formulaic way of greeting the birthday child (verbal), presentation of a cake and wrapped presents (material), as well as customs to honor the individual, such as sitting at the head of the table, and blowing out the candles with a wish.  There might also be special games played at birthday parties which are not generally played at other times. Adding to the complexity of the interpretation, the birthday party for a seven-year-old will not be identical to the birthday party for that same child as a six-year-old, even though they follow the same model. For each artifact embodies a single variant of a performance in a given time and space. The task of the folklorist becomes to identify within this surfeit of variables the constants and the expressed meaning that shimmer through all variations: honoring of the individual within the circle of family and friends, gifting to express their value and worth to the group, and of course, the festival food and drink as [[Signified and signifier|signifiers]] of the event.

===Verbal tradition===
[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', [[Arthur Rackham]], 1909]]
The formal definition of verbal lore is words, both written and oral, which are "spoken, sung, voiced forms of traditional utterance that show repetitive patterns."&lt;ref name="Dorson"&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucial here are the repetitive patterns. Verbal lore is not just any conversation, but words and phrases conforming to a traditional configuration recognized by both the speaker and the audience. For [[narratology|narrative types]] by definition have consistent structure, and follow an existing model in their narrative form.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]] first defined a uniform structure in Russian fairy tales in his groundbreaking monograph ''Morphology of the Folktale'', published in Russian in 1928. See {{harv|Propp|1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; As just one simple example, in English the phrase "An elephant walks into a bar…" instantaneously flags the following text as a [[Joke#Telling jokes|joke]]. It might be one you've already heard, but it might be one that the speaker has just thought up within the current context. This is folklore in action. Another example is the child's song [[Old MacDonald Had a Farm]], where each performance is distinctive in the animals named, their order and their sounds. Songs such as this are used to express cultural values (farms are important, farmers are old and weather-beaten) and teach children about different domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is folklore in action.

Verbal folklore was the [[Folkloristics#From Antiquities to Lore|original folklore]], the artifacts defined by [[William Thoms]] as older, oral cultural traditions of the rural populace. In his 1846 published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of verbal lore. By the beginning of the 20th century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv| Georges|Jones|1995|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antti Aarne published a first classification system for folktales in 1910. This was later expanded into the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]] by [[Stith Thompson]] and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. As the number of classified oral artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items which had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups and epochs, giving rise to the [[Folkloristics#Aarne-Thompson and the Historic-Geographic Method|Historic-Geographic Method]], a methodology which dominated folkloristics in the first half of the 20th century.

When William Thoms first published his appeal to document the verbal lore of the rural populations, it was believed these folk artifacts would die out as the population became literate. Over the past two centuries this belief has proven to be wrong; folklorists continue to collect verbal lore in both written and spoken form from all social groups. Some variants might have been captured in published collections, but much of it is still transmitted orally and indeed continues to be generated in new forms and variants at an alarming rate.

===Material culture===
[[File:Horse and Sulky weathervane - SAAM - DSC00796.JPG|thumb|Horse and [[sulky]] weathervane, Smithsonian American Art Museum]]

The genre of [[material culture]] includes all artifacts that you can touch, hold, live in or eat. They are tangible objects, with a physical presence intended for use either permanently or just at the next meal. Most of these folklore artifacts are single objects which have been created by hand for a specific purpose. However folk artifacts can also be mass-produced, such as dreidels or Christmas decorations. These items continue to be considered folklore due to their long (pre-industrial) history and their customary use. All of these material objects "existed prior to and continue alongside mechanized industry. … [They are] transmitted across the generations and subject to the same forces of conservative tradition and individual variation"&lt;ref name="Dorson" /&gt; that are found in all folk artifacts. Of interest to folklorists are their physical form, their method of manufacture or construction, their pattern of use as well as the procurement of the raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Vlach|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning to those who both make and use these objects is important. Of primary significance in these studies is the complex balance of continuity over change in both their design and their decoration.

[[File:At a goldsmith's workshop Podhale region.webm|thumb|Traditional highlanders' pins hand-made by a goldsmith in [[Podhale]], Poland]]In Europe before the [[Industrial Revolution]] everything was made by hand. While some folklorists of the 19th century wanted to secure the oral traditions of the rural folk before the populace became literate, other folklorists sought to identify hand-crafted objects before their production processes were lost to industrial manufacturing. Just as verbal lore continues to be actively created and transmitted in today's culture, so these [[handicrafts]], possibly with a shift in purpose and meaning, can still be found all around us. For there are many reasons to continue to hand make objects for use. It could mean these skills are needed to repair manufactured items. Or perhaps a unique design is wanted which is not (or cannot be) found in the stores. Many crafts are considered to be simple home maintenance, such as cooking, sewing and carpentry. Handicrafts have also become for many an enjoyable and satisfying hobby. Last but not least, handmade objects have taken on the sheen of prestige, where extra time and thought is spent in their creation and their uniqueness is valued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Roberts|1972|page=236 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the folklorist, these hand-crafted objects embody multifaceted relationships in the lives of the craftsmen and the users, which is completely lacking in mass-produced items without connection to an individual craftsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/33637|title=Material Culture (review)|first=Michael B.|last=Schiffer|date=1 October 2000|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=41|issue=4|pages=791–793|accessdate=8 October 2017|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the motivation for the handicraft, this is folklore in action.

Many traditional crafts have been elevated to the [[fine art|fine]] or [[applied arts]] and taught in art schools, such as ironworking and glass-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Roberts|1972|page=236 ff, 250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or they are repurposed as [[folk art]], characterized as objects in which the decorative form supersedes its utilitarian needs. Folk art is found in hex signs on Pennsylvania Dutch barns, tin man sculptures made by metalworkers, front yard Christmas displays, decorated school lockers, carved gun stocks, and tattoos. "Words such as naive, self-taught, and individualistic are used to describe these objects, and the exceptional rather than the representative creation is featured."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/folklife/guide/materialculture.html|title=Material Culture: American Folklife Center: An Illustrated Guide (Library of Congress)|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to our understanding of folklore artifacts which are nurtured and passed along in community.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Henry Glassie]], a distinguished folklorist studying technology in cultural context, notes that in Turkish one word, sanat, refers to all objects, not distinguishing between art and craft. The latter distinction, Glassie emphasizes, is not based on medium but on social class. This raises the question as to the difference between arts and crafts; is the difference found merely in the labeling?&lt;/ref&gt;

Many objects of material folklore, big and small, are challenging to classify, difficult to archive and unwieldy to store. How do we preserve these bulky artifacts of material culture, and how do we use them? That is the assigned task of museums. Toward this goal the concept of the [[Living history museum|Living history]] or open-air museum has been developed, beginning in Scandinavia at the end of the 19th century. These museums are here to teach, not just display. Actors show how items were used, reenacting everyday living by people from all segments of society. In order to achieve this, these museums rely heavily on the material artifacts of a pre-industrial society. Many locations even duplicate the processing of the objects, thus creating new objects of an earlier historic time period. These [[List of open-air and living history museums in the United States|Living history museums]] are now found throughout the United States and the world as part of a thriving [[heritage industry]]. This is folklore in action.

This list represents just a small sampling of objects and skills which are included in studies of material culture.

===Customs===
[[Tradition|Customary culture]] is remembered enactment, i.e. re-enactment. It is the patterns of expected behavior within a group, the "traditional and expected way of doing things"&lt;ref name="Sweterlitsch"&gt;{{harv|Sweterlitsch|1997|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A custom can be a [[List of gestures|single gesture]], such as [[thumbs down]] or a [[handshake]]. It can also be a complex interaction of multiple folk customs and artifacts as seen in a child's birthday party, including verbal lore ([[Happy Birthday to you|Happy Birthday song]]), material lore (presents and a birthday cake), special games ([[Musical chairs]]) and individual customs (making a wish as you blow out the candles). Each of these is a folklore artifact in its own right, potentially worthy of investigation and cultural analysis. Together they combine to build the custom of a birthday party celebration, a scripted combination of multiple artifacts which have meaning within their social group.

[[File:Pvt. Evan Allen Dancer, center, smiles as Santa Claus, right, hands gifts to Destiny Hawley and her brother Justin Hawley of Scipio, Ind., during the 3rd Annual Operation Christmas Blessing event at Muscatatuck 111212-A-QU728-005.jpg|thumb|[[Santa Claus]] giving gifts to children, a common folk practice associated with [[Christmas]] in Western nations]]

Folklorists divide customs into several different categories.&lt;ref name="Sweterlitsch" /&gt;  A custom can be a '''seasonal celebration''', such as [[Thanksgiving]] or [[New Year's Day|New Year's]]. It can be a '''life cycle celebration''' for an individual, such as baptism, birthday or wedding. A custom can also mark a '''community festival''' or event; examples of this are [[Cologne Carnival|Carnival in Cologne]] or [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras in New Orleans]]. This category also includes the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] celebrated each summer on the Mall in Washington, DC. A fourth category includes customs related to '''folk beliefs'''. Walking under a ladder is just one of many [[List of unlucky symbols|symbols considered unlucky]]. '''Occupational groups''' tend to have a rich history of customs related to their life and work, so the [[Sailors' superstitions|traditions of sailors]] or [[Lumberjack#Lumberjack culture|lumberjacks]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;The folklorist [[Archie Green]] specialized in workers' traditions and the lore of labor groups.&lt;/ref&gt; The area of [[folk religion|ecclesiastical folklore]], which includes modes of worship not sanctioned by the established church&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; tends to be so large and complex that it is usually treated as a specialized area of folk customs; it requires considerable expertise in standard church ritual in order to adequately interpret folk customs and beliefs that originated in official church practice.

Customary folklore is by definition folklore in action; it is always a performance, be it a single gesture or a complex of scripted customs. Participating in the custom, either as performer or audience, signifies acknowledgment of that social group. Some customary behavior is intended to be performed and understood only within the group itself, so the [[handkerchief code]] sometimes used in the gay community or the [[Masonic ritual and symbolism|initiation rituals]] of the Freemasons. Other customs are designed specifically to represent a social group to outsiders, those who do not belong to this group. The [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States#New York City|St. Patrick's Day Parade]] in New York and in other communities across the continent is a single example of an ethnic group parading their separateness (differential behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|1971|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and encouraging Americans of all stripes to show alliance to this colorful ethnic group. Another multicolored social group, the [[Gay Pride|Gay Pride Movement]], also [[Pride parade|parades]] in communities across the country to show the strength of their culture and demonstrate for recognition of their group within the contemporary legal and social systems.

[[File:Deal Hoodeners, 1909.jpg|thumb|right|Practitioners of [[hoodening]], a folk custom found in [[Kent]], southeastern England, in 1909]]

These festivals and parades, with a target audience of people who do not belong to the social group, intersect with the interests and mission of [[Public folklore|public folklorists]], who are engaged in the documentation, preservation, and presentation of traditional forms of folklife. With a swell in popular interest in folk traditions, these [[List of folk festivals|community celebrations]] are becoming more numerous throughout the western world. While ostensibly parading the diversity of their community, economic groups have discovered that these folk parades and festivals are good for business. All shades of people are out on the streets, eating, drinking and spending. This attracts support not only from the business community, but also from federal and state organizations for these local street parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sweterlitsch|1997|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, in parading diversity within the community, these events have come to authenticate true community, where business interests ally with the varied (folk) social groups to promote the interests of the community as a whole.

This is just a small sampling of types and examples of customary lore.

===Childlore and games===
 [[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 041b.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|right|''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] (1560) shows five boys playing buck buck in the bottom right hand corner of the painting.]]

[[Childlore]] is a distinct branch of folklore that deals with activities passed on by children to other children, away from the influence or supervision of an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Grider|1997|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's folklore contains artifacts from all the standard folklore genres of verbal, material and customary lore; it is however the '''child-to-child conduit''' that distinguishes these artifacts. For childhood is a social group where children teach, learn and share their own traditions, flourishing in a [[Children's street culture|street culture]] outside the purview of adults. This is also ideally where it needs to be collected; as [[Iona and Peter Opie]] demonstrated in their pioneering book ''Children's Games in Street and Playground''.&lt;ref name="Opie" /&gt; Here the social group of children is studied on its own terms, not as an derivative of adult social groups. It is shown that the [[Childlore|culture of children]] is quite distinctive; it is generally unnoticed by the sophisticated world of adults, and quite as little affected by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Grider|1997|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest to folklorists here is the mode of transmission of these artifacts; this lore circulates exclusively within an informal pre-literate children's network or folkgroup. It does not include artifacts taught to children by adults. However children can take the taught and teach it further to other children, turning it into childlore. Or they can take the artifacts and turn them into something else; so Old McDonald's farm is transformed from animal noises to the scatological version of animal poop. This childlore is characterized by "its lack of dependence on literary and fixed form. Children…operate among themselves in a world of informal and oral communication, unimpeded by the necessity of maintaining and transmitting information by written means.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Grider|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is as close as folklorists can come to observing the transmission and social function of this folk knowledge before the spread of literacy during the 19th century.

As we have seen with the other genres, the original collections of children's lore and games in the 19th century was driven by a fear that the culture of childhood would die out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Grider|1997|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early folklorists, among them [[Alice Gomme]] in Britain and [[William Wells Newell]] in the United States, felt a need to capture the unstructured and unsupervised street life and activities of children before it was lost. This fear proved to be unfounded. In a comparison of any modern school playground during recess and the painting of "Children's Games" by [[Pieter Breugel the Elder]] we can see that the activity level is similar, and many of the games from the 1560 painting are recognizable and comparable to modern variations still played today.

These same artifacts of childlore, in innumerable variations, also continue to serve the same function of learning and practicing skills needed for growth. So bouncing and swinging rhythms and rhymes encourage development of [[Vestibular system|balance and coordination]] in infants and children. Verbal rhymes like [[Peter Piper|Peter Piper picked...]] serve to increase both the oral and aural acuity of children. Songs and chants, accessing a different part of the brain, are used to memorize series ([[Alphabet song]]). They also provide the necessary beat to complex physical rhythms and movements, be it hand-clapping, jump roping, or ball bouncing. Furthermore, many physical games are used to develop strength, coordination and endurance of the players. For some team games, negotiations about the rules can run on longer than the game itself as social skills are rehearsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|Jones|1995|page=243–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even as we are just now uncovering the [[neuroscience]] that undergirds the developmental function of this childlore, the artifacts themselves have been in play for centuries.

==In action: performance in context==
Lacking context, the folklore artifacts in the [[Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections|Smithsonian Folklife Archive]] contain as much life as the stuffed elephant down the street in the Natural History Museum. It is only in performance that they come alive as an active and meaningful component of a social group; this is where the intergroup communication lives, where transmission of these cultural elements takes place. "Folklore is folklore only when performed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Abrahams|1972|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without transmission, these items are not folklore, they are just individual quirky tales and objects.

This understanding in folkloristics only occurred in the second half of the 20th century, when the two terms "[[Performance studies|folklore performance]]" and "text and context" dominated discussions among folklorists. These terms are not contradictory or even mutually exclusive. As borrowings from other fields of study, one or the other linguistic formulation is more appropriate to any given discussion. Performance is frequently tied to verbal and customary lore, whereas context is used in discussions of material lore. Both formulations offer different perspectives on the same folkloric understanding, specifically that folklore artifacts need to remain embedded in their cultural environment if we are to gain insight into their meaning for the community.

The concept of cultural (folklore) performance is shared with [[ethnography]] and [[anthropology]] among other social sciences. The cultural anthropologist [[Victor Turner]] identified four universal characteristics of cultural performance. These are playfulness, [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]], using symbolic language and employing the [[subjunctive mood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ben-Amos|1997a|pages=633–634}}&lt;/ref&gt; In performance the audience leaves the daily reality to move into a mode of make-believe, "what if". That this fits well with all types of verbal lore, where reality finds no footing among the symbols, fantasies, and nonsense of traditional tales, proverbs, and jokes is self-evident. Customs and the lore of children and games also fit easily into the language of a folklore performance.

Material culture requires some kneading to turn it into a performance. Should we consider the performance of the production, as in a quilting party, or the performance of the recipients who use the quilt to cover their marriage bed? Here the language of context works better to describe the quilting of patterns copied from the grandmother, quilting as a social event during the winter months, or the gifting of a quilt to signify the importance of the event. Each of these, the traditional pattern chosen, the social event and the gifting occur within the broader context of the community. That said, even in a discussion of context the structure and characteristics of performance can be recognized, including an audience, a framing event, and the use of decorative figures and symbols which go beyond the utility of the object.

===Backstory===
Before the Second World War, folk artifacts had been understood and collected as cultural shards of an earlier time. They were considered individual vestigial artifacts, with little or no function in the contemporary culture. Given this understanding, the goal of the folklorist was to capture and document them before they disappeared. They were collected with no supporting data, bound in books, archived and classified more or less successfully. The [[Folkloristics#Aarne-Thompson and the Historic-Geographic Method|Historic-Geographic Method]] worked to isolate and track these collected artifacts, mostly verbal lore, across space and time.

Following the Second World War, folklorists began to articulate a more holistic approach toward their subject matter. In tandem with the growing sophistication in the [[History of sociology#20th century: critical theory, postmodernism, and positivist revival|social sciences]], attention was no longer limited to the isolated artifact, but extended to include the artifact embedded in an active cultural environment. One early proponent was [[Alan Dundes]] with his essay "Texture, Text and Context", first published 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public presentation in 1967 by [[Dan Ben-Amos]] at the American Folklore Society brought the behavioral approach into open debate among folklorists. In 1972 [[Richard Dorson]] called out the "young Turks" for their movement toward a behavioral approach to folklore. This approach "shifted the conceptualization of folklore as an extractable item or 'text' to an emphasis on folklore as a kind of human behavior and communication. Conceptualizing folklore as behavior redefined the job of folklorists..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gabbert|1999|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;A more extensive discussion of this can be found in "The 'Text/Context' Controversy and the Emergence of Behavioral Approaches in Folklore", {{harv|Gabbert|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklore became a verb, an action, something that people do, not just something that they have.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|Paredes|1972|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the performance and the active context that folklore artifacts get transmitted in informal, direct communication, either verbally or in demonstration. Performance became the [[umbrella term]] for all the different modes and manners in which this transmission occurs.

===Tradition-bearer and audience===
[[File:Walaskie fujary.webm|thumb|Presentation of traditional Wallachian pipes at the [[Wallachian Open Air Museum]], Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Czech Republic, 2017]]
Transmission is a communicative process requiring a binary: one individual or group who actively transmits information in some form to another individual or group. Each of these is a defined role in the folklore process. The tradition-bearer&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ben-Amos|1997b}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the individual who actively passes along the knowledge of an artifact; this can be either a mother singing a lullaby to her baby, or an Irish dance troupe performing at a local festival. They are named individuals, usually well known in the community as knowledgeable in their traditional lore. They are not the anonymous "folk", the nameless mass without of history or individuality.

The audience of this performance is the other half in the transmission process; they listen, watch, and remember. Few of them will become active tradition-bearers; many more will be passive tradition-bearers who maintain a memory of this specific traditional artifact, in both its presentation and its content.

There is active communication between the audience and the performer. The performer is presenting to the audience; the audience in turn, through its actions and reactions, is actively communicating with the performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005 |page=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this performance is not to create something new but to re-create something that already exists; the performance is words and actions which are known, recognized and valued by both the performer and the audience. For folklore is first and foremost remembered behavior. As members of the same cultural [[reference group]], they identify and value this performance as a piece of shared cultural knowledge.

[[File:Bikkessy Heinbucher Táncoló magyarok.jpg|thumb|''Dancing Hungarians'', 1816.]]
[[File:XIX üldtantsupidu 13.JPG|thumb|Some elements of folk culture might be in the center of local culture and an import part of self-identity. For instance [[folk dance]] is highly popular in [[Estonia]] and it has evolved into a sort of a national sport.&lt;ref group=note&gt;See [http://www.estonica.org/en/Culture/The_art_of_dance/Folk_dance/ Folk dance] Estonica&lt;/ref&gt; XIX Estonian Dance Celebration in 2015 that was held together with [[Estonian Song Festival]].]]

===Framing the performance===
To initiate the performance, there must be a [[Framing (social sciences)|frame]] of some sort to indicate that what is to follow is indeed performance. The frame brackets it as outside of normal discourse. In customary lore such as life cycle celebrations (ex. birthday) or dance performances, the framing occurs as part of the event, frequently marked by location. The audience goes to the event location to participate. Games are defined primarily by rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Beresin|1997|page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is with the initiation of the rules that the game is framed. The folklorist [[Barre Toelken]] describes an evening spent in a Navaho family playing [[string figure]] games, with each of the members shifting from performer to audience as they create and display different figures to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=118 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In verbal lore, the performer will start and end with recognized linguistic formulas. An easy example is seen in the common introduction to a joke: "Have you heard the one...", "Joke of the day...", or "An elephant walks into a bar". Each of these signals to the listeners that the following is a [[joke]], not to be taken literally. The joke is completed with the [[punch line]] of the joke. Another traditional narrative marker in English is the framing of a fairy tale between the phrases "[[Once upon a time]]" and "They all lived happily ever after." Many languages have [[Once upon a time#Other languages|similar phrases]] which are used to frame a traditional tale. Each of these linguistic formulas removes the bracketed text from ordinary discourse, and marks it as a recognized form of stylized, formulaic communication for both the performer and the audience.

===In the subjunctive voice===
Framing as a narrative device serves to signal to both the story teller and the audience that the narrative which follows is indeed a fiction (verbal lore), and not to be understood as historical fact or reality. It moves the framed narration into the [[subjunctive mood]], and marks a space in which "fiction, history, story, tradition, art, teaching, all exist within the narrated or performed expressive 'event' outside the normal realms and constraints of reality or time."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|Stephens|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift from the [[realis mood|realis]] to the [[irrealis mood]] is understood by all participants within the reference group. It enables these fictional events to contain meaning for the group, and can lead to very real consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ben-Amos|1997a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anderson's law of auto-correction===
The theory of self-correction in folklore transmission was first articulated by the folklorist [[Walter Anderson (folklorist)|Walter Anderson]] in the 1920s; this posits a feedback mechanism which would keep folklore variants closer to the original form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Anderson is best known for his monograph ''[[King John and the Bishop|Kaiser und Abt]]'' (Folklore Fellows' Communications 42, Helsinki 1923) on folktales of type AT 922.&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory addresses the question about how, with multiple performers and multiple audiences, the artifact maintains its identity across time and geography. Anderson credited the audience with censoring narrators who deviated too far from the known (traditional) text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|El-Shamy|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any performance is a two-way communication process. The performer addresses the audience with words and actions; the audience in turn actively responds to the performer. If this performance deviates too far from audience expectations of the familiar folk artifact, they will respond with negative feedback. Wanting to avoid more negative reaction, the performer will adjust his performance to conform to audience expectations. "Social reward by an audience [is] a major factor in motivating narrators..."&lt;ref name="El-Shamy"&gt;{{harv|El-Shamy|1997|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this dynamic feedback loop between performer and audience which gives stability to the text of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, this model is not so simplistic; there is multiple redundancy in the active folklore process. The performer has heard the tale multiple times, he has heard it from different story tellers in multiple versions. In turn, he tells the tale multiple times to the same or a different audience, and they expect to hear the version they know. This expanded model of redundancy in a non-linear narrative process makes it difficult to innovate during any single performance; corrective feedback from the audience will be immediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; "At the heart of both autopoetic self-maintenance and the 'virality' of meme transmission... it is enough to assume that some sort of recursive action maintains a degree of integrity [of the artifact] in certain features ... sufficient to allow us to recognize it as an instance of its type."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Context of material lore===
For material folk artifacts, it becomes more fruitful to return to the terminology of Alan Dundes: text and context. Here the text designates the physical artifact itself, the single item made by an individual for a specific purpose. The context is then unmasked by observation and questions concerning both its production and its usage. Why was it made, how was it made, who will use it, how will they use it, where did the raw materials come from, who designed it, etc. These questions are limited only by the skill of the interviewer.

In his study of southeastern Kentucky chair makers, Michael Owen Jones describes production of a chair within the context of the life of the craftsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jones|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Henry Glassie]] in his study of Folk Housing in Middle Virginia&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Glassie|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation concerns the historical pattern he finds repeated in the dwellings of this region: the house is planted in the landscape just as the landscape completes itself with the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Glassie|1983|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artisan in his roadside stand or shop in the nearby town wants to make and display products which appeal to customers. There is "a craftsperson's eagerness to produce 'satisfactory items' due to a close personal contact with the customer and expectations to serve the customer again." Here the role of consumer "... is the basic force responsible for the continuity and discontinuity of behavior."&lt;ref name="El-Shamy" /&gt;

In material culture the context becomes the cultural environment in which the object is made (chair), used (house), and sold (wares). None of these artisans is "anonymous" folk; they are individuals making a living with the tools and skills learned within and valued in the context of their community.

===Toelken's conservative-dynamic continuum===
No two performances are identical. The performer attempts to keep the performance within expectations, but this happens despite a multitude of changing variables. He has given this performance one time more or less, the audience is different, the social and political environment has changed. In the context of material culture, no two hand-crafted items are identical. Sometimes these deviations in the performance and the production are unintentional, just part of the process. But sometimes these deviations are intentional; the performer or artisan want to play with the boundaries of expectation and add their own creative touch. They perform within the tension of conserving the recognized form and adding innovation.

The folklorist Barre Toelken identifies this tension as "... a combination of both changing ("dynamic") and static ("conservative") elements that evolve and change through sharing, communication and performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the cultural context shifts and morphs: new leaders, new technologies, new values, new awareness. As the context changes, so must the artifact, for without modifications to map existing artifacts into the evolving cultural landscape, they lose their meaning. [[Joke|Joking]] as an active form of verbal lore makes this tension visible as [[Joke#Joke cycles|joke cycles]] come and go to reflect new issues of concern. Once an artifact is no longer applicable to the context, transmission becomes a nonstarter; it loses relevancy for a contemporary audience. If it is not transmitted, then it is no longer folklore and becomes instead an historic relic.&lt;ref name="El-Shamy" /&gt;

===In the electronic age ===
It is too soon to identify how the advent of electronic communications will modify and change the performance and transmission of folklore artifacts. Just by looking at the development of one type of verbal lore, [[Joke#Electronic joking|electronic joking]], it is clear that the internet is modifying folkloric process, not killing it. Jokes and joking are as plentiful as ever both in traditional face-to-face interactions and through electronic transmission. New communication modes are also transforming traditional stories into many different configurations. The fairy tale [[Snow White]] is now offered in [[Snow White (disambiguation)|multiple media forms]] for both children and adults, including a television show, a video game, and a programming language.

A more generalized analysis of [[Folkloristics#Leaning into the 21st century|folklore in the electronic age]] will have to wait for further studies to be published in the field.

According to the [[Musée d'Orsay]] catalogue, the painting's principal subject is ''représentation animalière'' or the depiction of animals.&lt;ref name="Orsay"/&gt; As suggested by the painting's Japanese name and observed in the contemporary Japanese press, the work draws heavily on [[Japanese mythology]], in particular the episode of the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]]'s [[Amano-Iwato|withdrawal into a cave]] due to her brother [[Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susanoo]]'s improprieties, depriving the land of light.&lt;ref name="Takashina"/&gt;

In the ''[[Kojiki]]'' version, after the assembled [[kami]] took counsel, "the long-singing birds of eternal night" (generally understood as a [[Circumlocution|periphrasis]] for "the barndoor fowl") were enticed to crow, the mirror [[Yata no Kagami]] and string of curved jewels  [[Yasakani no Magatama]] were commissioned, divination was performed using the shoulder blade of a stag and the bough of a cherry tree from [[Yamato Sanzan|Mount Kagu]], and the mirror, string of jewels, and blue and white cloth offerings were hung from an uprooted [[sakaki]] tree. [[Uzume]] then decked herself out before performing a lewd dance upon a sounding-board; the ensuing hilarity finally succeeded in provoking Amaterasu's curiosity. Opening the door to her cave, she was presented with a mirror; opening it further, she was drawn from it by her hand as well as by rope.

==History==
Inscribed on the back of the painting is "Japan · Kawamura Kiyoo, aged 78 · 6th day, 4th month, [[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] 4 (1929)".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;「日本 川村清雄七十八歳 昭和四年四月六日」&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Indologist]] and [[Sanskrit]] scholar [[Sylvain Lévi]] acting as intermediary, the painting was presented on 30 December that year to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Jeu de Paume]], the museum created in 1922 out of the foreign section of the [[Musée du Luxembourg]]. In attendance at the handover ceremony at the [[Louvre]] were minister [[Pierre Marraud]] and ambassador [[Mineichirō Adachi]], as well as Lévi who delivered the celebratory address.&lt;ref name="Takashina"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-collections/painting.html |title=Origins: the Musée du Luxembourg |publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]] |accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painted by Kawamura Kiyoo specially for the French museum, Lévi on his third visit to Japan had originally wanted to acquire one of Kawamura's Venetian landscapes but was persuaded otherwise by the artist.&lt;ref name="Takashina"/&gt;

Subsequently the painting passed from the Jeu de Paume to the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], before being assigned to the [[Musée d'Orsay]], where it was housed between 1980 and 1986, when it was deposited at the [[Musée Guimet]].&lt;ref name="Orsay"/&gt; In 2012/13 it returned to Japan for the exhibition "Kawamura Kiyoo: [[yōga]] painter of the [[Meiji Restoration]]", held at the [[Edo-Tokyo Museum]] and [[Shizuoka Prefectural Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobunken.go.jp/materials/nenshi/203493.html |script-title=ja:「維新の洋画家 川村清雄」展の開催 |trans-title=Exhibition: "Kawamura Kiyoo: yōga painter of the Meiji Restoration" |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Tobunken]] |date=October 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;「維新の洋画家 川村清雄」&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galeyi Beygurt''' ({{lang-az|Qaleyi Bəyqurt}}), also known as '''Galey-Bughurt''' ({{lang-az|Qəley-Buğurt}}) or simply '''Bughurt fortress''' ({{lang-az|Buğurt qalası}}) is a historic monument located 20&amp;nbsp;km north-east of the center of [[Shamakhi]] city.

==Location==
The fortress is located at the summit of the mountain near Galeybughurd village and 1,600 meters above the sea level. The mountain, where the fortress is located is surrounded by Maiden Tower and Cangi mountain from the south, Tana mountain and the Alchalı Pir forest from the east, Mount Ulguc from the north and Galadarasi from the west.&lt;ref&gt;''Ciddi H.''

==History==
It is unknown when the fortress was built.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Ciddi H.'' [http://ebooks.preslib.az/pdfbooks/azbooks/ciddihuseyn_bugrut.pdf Buğurt qalası] / elmi red. R. Vahidov. - Baku : Azərnəşr, 1973. – p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the history of the fortress dates back to XIII century. It is often referred to in the sources of the XV century.&lt;ref name="triptoazerbaijan"&gt;{{cite web|title= Galeyi Bughurt (11th-13th centuries)|url= http://triptoazerbaijan.com/en/things-to-do/galeyi-bughurt-11th-13th-centuries/|publisher= triptoazerbaijan.com|language= en|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===During Shirvanshahs===
The fortress was a shelter for Shirvanshah during Mongol conquest.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It was also used during the period of Shirvanshah [[Kayqubad I of Shirvan|Kequbad]] and [[Kavus I|Kavus]].&lt;ref&gt;Б.Дорн.

The scientific archive of the Institute of History of the Azerbaijan SSR ANAS № 1741, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Ismail I|Shah Ismayil]] attacked Shirvan in [[1509]], Shirvanshah [[Ibrahim II Shaykhshah|Shaykhshah]] was defended at Bughurt fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Həsən bəy Rumlu, Əhsən ət-Təvarix, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1518]] the [[Safavid]] armies attacked [[Shirvan]] under the leadership of [[Alqas Mirza|Alqas Mirza Safavid]]. [[Shahrukh of Shirvan|Shahrukh]] and lawyer Hussein Bey, who retreated into the Bughurt fortress, could resist the Safavids for several months.&lt;ref name="triptoazerbaijan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Həsən bəy Rumlu, Əhsən ət-Təvarix, səh. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Also, at that time, the treasury of the Shirvanshahs was kept at the Bughurt fortress.

===During Safavids===
According to [[Iskandar Beg Munshi|Iskandar Munshi]]’s writings, during these wars both Gulustan and Bugurt fortresses was destroyed by the order of [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]]. During march of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] to Shirvan, [[Abdollah Khan Ustajlu|Abdollah Khan]] was beylerbey of Shirvan. At this time, the head of the Turkish troops, Gasim Bey used Bugurt fortress as a defensive point. It proves Iskandar Munshi’s claim wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''Ciddi H.''

[[File:Grille_du_Coq_detail.jpg|thumb|Gallic rooster on the garden gate of the [[Palais de l'Elysée]] in Paris, the official residence of the [[President of the French Republic]].]]

The '''Gallic rooster''' ({{lang-fr|le coq gaulois}}, ''the Gallic cock'') is an unofficial [[national symbol]] of [[France]] as a nation, as opposed to [[Marianne]] representing France as a State, and its values: [[French Republic|the Republic]]. The [[rooster]] is also the symbol of the [[Wallonia]] region and the [[French Community of Belgium]].

==France==
[[File:Mémorial des soldats et marins de la Charente-Inférieure (16).JPG|thumb|left|Gallic rooster on top of a [[Monuments aux Morts|war memorial]] in [[La Rochelle]]]]
During the times of Ancient Rome, [[Suetonius]], in [[The Twelve Caesars]], noticed that, in [[Latin language|Latin]], rooster (''gallus'') and [[Gauls]] (''Gallus'') were [[homonym]]s.&lt;ref name="Drapeau"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collignon|first1=Alain|title=Drapeau wallon|url=http://www.wallonie-en-ligne.net/Encyclopedie/Thematiques/Notices/DrapeauW.htm|publisher=Institut Destrée [The Destree Institute]|accessdate=13 March 2018|location=[[Wallonia]]|language=French|trans-title=Walloon flag|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the association of the Gallic rooster as a national symbol is [[apocrypha]]l, as the rooster was neither regarded as a national personification nor as a sacred animal by the [[Gauls]] in their mythology and because there was no "Gallic nation" at the time, but a loose confederation of Gallic nations instead. But a closer review within that religious scheme indicates that "[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]" was often portrayed with the [[rooster|cockerel]],{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} a sacred animal among the [[Continental Celts]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Peter Berresford|authorlink1=Peter Berresford Ellis|title=Dictionary of Celtic Mythology|date=23 June 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195089615}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] in ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' identified some gods worshipped in [[Gaul]] by using the names of their nearest [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god rather than their Gaulish name, with Caesar saying "[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]" was the god most revered in Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource|plaintitle=[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]&lt;!-- |language=Latin --&gt;|trans_title=Commentaries on the Gallic War|wslink=Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 6#17|last=Caesar|first=Julius|authorlink=Julius Caesar|others=Translated from Latin by William Alexander McDevitte and W. S. Bohn (1869)|year=53 BC|volume=Book 6|chapter=Chapter 17|publisher=|location=|page=|pages=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish god [[Lugh|Lug]] identified as ''[[samildánach]]'' led to the widespread identification of Caesar's [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] as [[Lugus]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and thus also to the sacred cockerel, the Gallic rooster, as an emblem of France.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Its association with France dates back from the [[Middle Age]] and is due to the play on words in [[Latin language|Latin]] between ''Gallus'', meaning an inhabitant of [[Gaul]], and ''gallus'', meaning [[rooster]], or cockerel. Its use, by the enemies of France, dates to this period, originally a [[pun]] to make fun of the French,&lt;ref name="Drapeau"/&gt; the association between the rooster and the Gauls/French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents: prior to being arrested, Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning. At the rooster's crowing, Peter remembered Jesus's words. Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil. It is also an emblem of the Christian's attitude of watchfulness and readiness for the sudden return of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment of humankind. That is why, during the [[Renaissance]], the rooster became a symbol of France as a Catholic state and became a popular Christian image on [[weather vane]]s, also known as weathercocks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Logo XV de france.JPG|thumbnail|left|The jersey of the [[France national rugby union team|French national rugby team]], with the traditional Gallic rooster symbol]]

The popularity of the Gallic rooster as a national personification faded away until its resurgence during the [[French Revolution]] (1789). The republican [[historiography]] completely modified the traditional perception of the origins of France. Until then, the royal historiography dated the origins of France back to the baptism of [[Clovis I]] in 496, the "first Christian king of France". The republicans rejected this royalist and Christian origin of the country and trace the origins of France back to the ancient Gaul. Although purely apocryphal, the rooster became the personification of the early inhabitants of France, the Gauls.

The Gallic rooster, colloquially named ''Chanteclair'', had been a national emblem ever since, especially during the [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]]. The rooster was featured on the reverse of French 20-franc gold pieces from 1899 to 1914. After [[World War I]] it was depicted on countless [[war memorials]].

Today, it is often used as a national [[mascot]], particularly in sporting events such as [[Association football|football]] (soccer) and [[rugby football|rugby]]. The [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], hosted by France, adopted a rooster named [[Footix]] as [[mascot]]. The [[France national rugby league team]] are known as the ''Chanteclairs'' referring to the cockerel's song.

The popularity of the symbol extends into business. ''[[Le Coq Sportif]]'' ("The athletic rooster"), is a French manufacturer of sports equipment using a stylized rooster and the colors of the [[French tricolour]] as its logo. Moreover, it is the logo of [[Pathé]], a French-born, now international company of film production and distribution.

Another heraldic animal officially used by the French nation was the [[French Imperial Eagle]], symbol of the [[First French Empire|First]] and [[Second French Empire]] under [[Napoleon I]] and [[Napoleon III]].

==Wallonia==
[[File:Flag of Wallonia.svg|thumbnail|The [[Flag of Wallonia|Walloon rooster]].]]

In 1913, the Gallic rooster was adopted as the symbol of [[Walloon movement]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} It represents a "[[Fighting cocks|bold rooster]]" (''coq hardi''), raising its claws, instead of the "crowing rooster" that is traditionally depicted in France. This symbol, also known as the Walloon rooster, was officially adopted as the symbol of [[Wallonia]] (in 1998) and the [[French Community of Belgium]] (in 1991).

==Cocorico==
In France and Wallonia, the [[French language|French]] [[onomatopoeia]] for the rooster [[Rooster#Crowing|crowing sound]], "cocorico" (''cock-a-doodle-doo''), is sometimes used to express national pride.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

'''''Ghost in the Machine''''', originally titled '''''A Good House Is Hard to Find'',''' is a 1981 [[performance art|performance]] created by American artist [[Linda Nishio]]. The work combines written and spoken text, [[slide projection]] and [[film]], sound, [[sculpture]], and the use of an assistant. She originally performed it at [[Franklin Furnace Archive|Franklin Furnace]] in [[New York City]] and performed other iterations through 1983, including at the [[Woman's Building]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Wolv&gt;Wolverton, Terry, "At Home at the Woman's Building: Ghost in the Machine," [[High Performance Magazine|High Performance]], issue 24, 1983, illus.&lt;/ref&gt; Her second performance for the New York nonprofit space&lt;ref name=Apple2005&gt;Jacki Apple, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4488618 "A Different World: A Personal History of Franklin Furnace"], 49(1), Spring 2005 (pp. 36–54), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  was reviewed by [[Lucy Lippard]] for the ''[[Village Voice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Village Voice,'' vol. 26, no.13, March 18–24, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; and included in Lippard's 1984 book, ''Get the Message: A Decade of Art for Social Change.''&lt;ref name=book&gt;Lippard, Lucy, ''Get the Message: A Decade of Art for Social Change'' (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The piece begins with images of a tormented woman, projected with a recording of voices asking "Hey, why are you so tormented?"  With Nishio on stage, wearing a house covering her face and head, a dialectic is created between emotions and thinking, then a recording of Nishio's voice outlines an effort to stay in control while participating in daily life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hile the telephone rings and the dog shuffles by someone knocks at the door. Why don't you just sit down and think, think, think, think.&lt;ref name=Wolv/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A diagram of the artist's head is flashed with the word ''think'' repeated and pointing to various parts of the brain. There is a film of Nishio inside the house that she wears. She performs a [[monologue]] about the thinking process after which she takes off the house and throws across the stage. A [[meditation]] tape is played, and the artist lies down performing the soothing exercises instructed. The final instruction is 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]nside the brain, imagine a huge switchboard. Walk over to it and pull out all the plugs but one. Your only thought is your whole body, feeling quiet, comfortable, relaxed.&lt;ref name=Wolv/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The piece also makes use of Nishio's shadow, and her assistant comes in throughout the performance to put up then take down cutouts of women.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; In the earlier Franklin Furnace performance, the house covered Nishio's midsection.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

==Critical reception==

Of the 1983 performance at the Woman's Building, [[Terry Wolverton]] described it as: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;a fast-paced multi-media tour of the activities of the brain, and of the person who tries to live inside the brain, disassociated from flesh, spirit, emotion ... Nishio plugs her audience into the rhythms of the over-taxed, over-stimulated nervous system.&lt;ref name=Wolv/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wolverton complains about the size of the L.A. performance space lauding the work itself writing, "there's scarcely a superfluous movement, image, or word." She further writes of Nishio's performance, "It is rare to witness a performer undergo an internal process while performing, and this willingness to be vulnerable gives the work a great sense of depth and strength."&lt;ref name=Wolv/&gt;

Lippard in her book called the work "bitterly beautiful," its meanings "layered," its images "striking." The critic interpreted the performance's themes as [[racism]], [[real estate]], and dislocation, and the use of "'interior decoration' as a metaphor for cultural differences."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]] and [[Roman mythology]], a '''harpy''' (plural '''harpies''', {{Lang-el|ἅρπυια}},&lt;ref&gt;Of uncertain etymology; [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin (''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 139).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(/rpuia|ἅρπυια|cite}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''harpyia'', {{IPA-el|hárpyi̯a|pron}}; {{lang-lat|harpȳia}}) was a half-human and half-[[bird]] personification of storm winds, in [[Homer|Homeric poems]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]]. ''[[Odyssey]], Book 20.66 &amp; 77''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descriptions ==
They were generally depicted as birds with the heads of maidens, faces pale with hunger and long claws on their hands. Roman and Byzantine writers detailed their ugliness.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid, Book 3.216''; Tzetzes. ''ad Lycoph.'' ''653''; Ovid. ''Metamorphoses Book 7.4, Fasti, Book 6.132''; Hyginus. ''Fabulae, 14''&lt;/ref&gt; Pottery art depicting the harpies featured beautiful women with wings. Ovid described them as human-vultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vii.4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hesiod ===
To Hesiod, they were imagined as fair-locked and winged maidens, who surpassed winds and birds in the rapidity of their flight. &lt;blockquote&gt;''"...the Harpyiai (Harpies) of the lovely hair, Okypete (Ocypete) and Aello, and these two in the speed of their wings keep pace with the blowing winds, or birds in flight, as they soar and swoop, high aloft."''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Aeschylus ===
But even as early as the time of [[Aeschylus]], they are described as ugly creatures with wings, and later writers carry their notions of the harpies so far as to represent them as most disgusting monsters. The [[Sibyl|Pythian priestess]] of [[Apollo]] recounted the appearance of the harpies in the following lines:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Before this man an extraordinary band of women [i.e. harpies] slept, seated on thrones. No! Not women, but rather Gorgons I call them; and yet I cannot compare them to forms of Gorgons either. Once before I saw some creatures in a painting, carrying off the feast of [[Phineus]]; but these are wingless in appearance, black, altogether disgusting; they snore with repulsive breaths, they drip from their eyes hateful drops; their attire is not fit to bring either before the statues of the gods or into the homes of men. I have never seen the tribe that produced this company, nor the land that boasts of rearing this brood with impunity and does not grieve for its labor afterwards."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]]. ''[http://topostext.org/work.php?work_id=14 Eumenides, 50]'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Virgil ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Bird-bodied, girl-faced things they (Harpies) are; abominable their droppings, their hands are talons, their faces haggard with hunger insatiable"''&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid, Book 3.216 {{PD-notice}}''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hyginus ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"They are said to have been feathered, with cocks' heads, wings, and human arms, with great claws; breasts, bellies, and female parts human."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]. ''Fabulae, 14'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Functions and abode ==
The harpies seem originally to have been wind spirits (personifications of the destructive nature of wind). Their name means "snatchers" or "swift robbers"&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Room]], Who's Who in Classical Mythology, p. 147 {{ISBN|0-517-22256-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they steal food from their victims while they are eating and carry evildoers (especially those who have killed their family) to the [[Erinyes]]. When a person suddenly disappeared from the earth, it was said that he had been carried off by the harpies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]] ''[[Odyssey]], Book 1.241, 14.371''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they carried off the daughters of king Pandareus and gave them as servants to the Erinyes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]]. ''[[Odyssey]], Book 20.78''&lt;/ref&gt; In this form they were agents of punishment who abducted people and tortured them on their way to [[Tartarus]]. They were vicious, cruel and violent.

The harpies were called "the hounds of mighty [[Zeus]]" thus "ministers of the Thunderer (Zeus)".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Valerius Flaccus. ''Argonautica Book 4.425''&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers listed the harpies among the guardians of the [[Hades|underworld]] among other monstrosities including the [[Centaur]]s, [[Scylla]], [[Hecatoncheires|Briareus]], [[Lernaean Hydra]], [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], [[Gorgon]]s and [[Geryon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]]. ''Aeneid 6.287 ff''; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. ''Hercules Furens 747 ff''&lt;/ref&gt;

Their abode is either the islands called [[Strophades]],&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid, Book 3.210''&lt;/ref&gt; a place at the entrance of [[Orcus]],&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid, Book 6.289''&lt;/ref&gt; or a cave in Crete.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius. ''Argonautica, Book 2.298''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names and family ==
[[Hesiod]] calls them two "lovely-haired" creatures, the daughters of [[Thaumas]] and the [[Oceanid]] [[Electra (Oceanid)|Electra]] and sisters of [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'', 265–267. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyginus]], however, cited a certain Ozomene&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]]. ''Fabulae 14''&lt;/ref&gt; as the mother of the harpies but he also recounted that Electra was also the mother of these beings in the same source. This can be explained by the fact that Ozomene was another name for Electra. The harpies possibly were siblings of the river-god [[Hydaspes (mythology)|Hydaspes]] and [[Arke (mythology)|Arke]], as they were called sisters of Iris and children of Thaumas. According to [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius]], Typhoeus ([[Typhon]]) was said to be the father of these monsters&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while a different version by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] told that the harpies were daughters of [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]] or of [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]]. ''ad Aeneid, Book 3.241''&lt;/ref&gt;

They are named [[Aello]] ("storm swift") and [[Ocypete]] ("the swift wing"),&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony 265''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]], Book 1.121-123.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virgil]] added [[Celaeno]] ("the dark") as a third.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, Aeneid 3.209&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] knew of a harpy named [[Podarge]] ("fleet-foot").&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Iliad 16.148&lt;/ref&gt; Aello, is sometimes also spelled Aellopus or Nicothoe; Ocypete, sometimes also spelled Ocythoe or Ocypode.

Homer called the harpy Podarge as the mother of the two horses ([[Balius and Xanthus]]) of [[Achilles]] sired by the West Wind [[Zephyrus]]&lt;ref&gt;Homer''. [[Iliad]], Book 16.150;'' [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]. ''Fall of Troy, Book 3.743 ff''&lt;/ref&gt; while according to [[Nonnus]], Xanthus and Podarkes, horses of the Athenian king Erechtheus, were born to Aello and the North Wind [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]].&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus. ''Dionysiaca Book 37.155''&lt;/ref&gt; Other progeny of Podarge were Phlogeus and Harpagos, horses given by [[Hermes]] to the [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri]], who competed for the chariot-race in celebration of the funeral games of [[Pelias]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stesichorus]]. ''Fragments 178''&lt;/ref&gt;  The swift horse [[Arion (mythology)|Arion]] was also said to begotten by loud-piping Zephyrus on a harpy (probably Podarge), as attested by [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]. ''Fall of Troy, Book 4.569 ff''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
[[File:Harpij - I.I Schipper 1660, graveur Matthius Merian, naar J.Jonstons' "Naekeurige Beschryvingh van de Natuur".jpg|thumb|left|A harpy in [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]]'s ''Monstrorum Historia'', Bologna, 1642]]

=== Argonauts ===
[[File:Harpyie.JPG|thumb|A [[medieval]] depiction of a harpy as a bird-woman]]
 
The most celebrated story in which the harpies play a part is that of King [[Phineus]] of [[Thrace]], who was given the gift of [[prophecy]] by Zeus. Angry that Phineus gave away the god's secret plan, Zeus punished him by blinding him and putting him on an island with a buffet of food which he could never eat because the harpies always arrived to steal the food out of his hands before he could satisfy his hunger. Later writers add that they either devoured the food themselves, or that they dirtied it by dropping upon it some stinking substance, so as to render it unfit to be eaten.

This continued until the arrival of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. Phineus promised to instruct them respecting the course they had to take, if they would deliver him from the harpies. The [[Boreads]], sons of [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the North Wind, who also could fly, succeeded in driving off the harpies. According to an ancient oracle, the harpies were to perish by the hands of the Boreades, but the latter were to die if they could not overtake the harpies. The latter fled, but one fell into the river Tigris, which was hence called Harpys, and the other reached the Echinades, and as she never returned, the islands were called Strophades. But being worn out with fatigue, she fell down simultaneously with her pursuer; and, as they promised no further to molest Phineus, the two harpies were not deprived of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca, Book 1.9.21''&lt;/ref&gt; According to others, the Boreades were on the point of killing the harpies, when Iris or Hermes appeared and commanded the conquerors to set them free, promising that Phineus would not be bothered by the harpies again.  "The dogs of great Zeus" then returned to their "cave in Minoan Crete". Other accounts said that both the harpies as well as the Boreades died.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia. ''ad Apollon. Rhod''. ''i. 286, 297''; Tzetzes. ''Chiliades, i. 217''&lt;/ref&gt; Thankful for their help, Phineus told the Argonauts how to pass the [[Symplegades]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Argonautica]]'', book II; [[Ovid]] XIII, 710; [[Virgil]] III, 211, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzetzes explained the origin of the myth pertaining to Phineus, the harpies, and the Boreades in his account. In this late version of the myth it was said that Phineus, due to his old age, became blind, and he has two daughters named Eraseia and Harpyreia. These maidens lived a very libertine and lazy life, abandoning themselves to poverty and fatal famine. Then Zetes and Calais snatched them away somehow, and they disappeared from those places ever since. From this account all myths about them [i.e., the harpies] started, as was also retold by Apollonius in his own story of the Argonauts.&lt;ref&gt;Tzetzes. ''ad Lycophron, 166, Chiliades, 1.220''; Palaephaust. ''23. 3''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aeneid ===
[[Aeneas]] encountered harpies on the Strophades as they repeatedly made off with the feast the [[Troy|Trojans]] were setting. [[Celaeno]] utters a prophecy: the Trojans will be so hungry they will eat their tables before they reach the end of their journey. The Trojans fled in fear.

== Modern reception ==
[[File:DVinfernoForestOfSuicides m.jpg|thumb|Harpies in the infernal wood, from ''Inferno'' XIII, by [[Gustave Doré]], 1861]]

=== Dante ===
Harpies remained vivid in the Middle Ages. In Canto XIII of his ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Dante Alighieri]] envisages the tortured wood infested with harpies, where the [[suicide]]s have their punishment in the [[Inferno (Dante)#Seventh Circle (Violence)|seventh ring of Hell]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Here the repellent harpies make their nests,''&lt;br&gt;''Who drove the Trojans from the Strophades'' &lt;br&gt;''With dire announcements of the coming woe.'' &lt;br&gt;''They have broad wings, with razor sharp talons and a human neck and face,''&lt;br&gt;''Clawed feet and swollen, feathered bellies; they caw''&lt;br&gt;''Their lamentations in the eerie trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.bostonreview.net/BR18.1/dante.html Translation of Robert Pinsky, ''Boston Review''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104235244/http://new.bostonreview.net/BR18.1/dante.html |date=2014-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Blake]] was inspired by Dante's description in his pencil, ink and watercolour  "[[The Wood of the Self-Murderers: The Harpies and the Suicides]]" (Tate Gallery, London).[[File:Großes Wappen von Nürnberg.svg|thumb|190px|Greater coat of arms of the city of [[Nuremberg]]]]

===Linguistic use and application===
The [[harpy eagle]] is a real bird named after the mythological animal.

The term is often used metaphorically to refer to a nasty or annoying woman. In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', Benedick&lt;!--Benedick, not Benedict--&gt; spots the sharp-tongued Beatrice approaching and exclaims to the prince, Don Pedro, that he would do an assortment of arduous tasks for him "rather than hold three words conference with this harpy!"

===Heraldry===
In the [[Middle Ages]], the harpy, often called the ''Jungfrauenadler''{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} or "maiden eagle" (although it may not have been modeled after the original harpy of Greek mythology), became a popular [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]], particularly in [[East Frisia]], seen on, among others, the [[coat-of-arms|coats-of-arms]] of [[County of Rietberg|Rietberg]], [[Coat of arms of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], and the [[Cirksena]].

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=December 2016}}
Harpies are referenced in present-day culture, especially in fiction and fantasy. They tend to be evil-aligned.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Examples include:

* In [[Carl Barks]]' ''[[Donald Duck]]'' story "The Golden Fleecing" (1955), [[Scrooge McDuck]], [[Donald Duck]] and [[Huey, Louie and Dewey]] meet creatures who are half women and half birds and are named "Larkies", despite clearly being modelled after the mythological harpy birds. He was forced to use this name, because ''harpy'' was also a [[slang]] term for 'street prostitute'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYP2Cj_Gb98C|title=Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: Unmasking the Myth of Modernity|first=Tom|last=Andrae|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Univ.

* In George R. R.

'''Hayward Montague Davenport''' (1874–1959), usually referred to as Hayward M. Davenport, was an English maritime painter and [[pharmacist]]. His most notable work is a large [[watercolour]] entitled ''Oak and Steel'', which was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exhibition of the Royal Academy|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts (Great Britain)|year=1904|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EsgqAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works exhibited at the Royal Academy include ''A View of Hampton Court Palace''.  He painted extensively for commission before 1901, principally for the captains of the ships depicted. In 1901, on the death of his grandfather, [[John Thistlewood Davenport]], Davenport gave up painting to assume his role as Chairman of [[J. T. Davenport &amp; Sons]], a London-based pharmaceuticals company which marketed Dr. J. Collis Browne's [[Chlorodyne]]. His large canvas entitled, ''H.M.S. "Ophir" leaving Portsmouth, March 15, 1901, with the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York on their historic 40,000 mile cruise of the Empire'', sold at Sotheby's in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/Artists/LotDetailPage.aspx?lot_id=15E2AB36853A0FEE Artnet]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Hart Milman by George Frederic Watts.jpg|right|thumb|Henry Hart Milman, by [[George Frederic Watts]], circa 1863]]
'''Henry Hart Milman''' (10 February 1791&amp;nbsp;– 24 September 1868&lt;ref&gt;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica has it as 10 November but the son's history of the father asserts that it was 10 February.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[England|English]] [[historian]] and ecclesiastic.

==Life==
He was born in [[London]], the third son of [[Sir Francis Milman, 1st Baronet]], physician to King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] (see [[Milman Baronets]]). Educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], his university career was brilliant. He won the [[Newdigate prize]] with a poem on the ''Apollo Belvidere'' in 1812, was elected a fellow of Brasenose in 1814, and in 1816 won the English essay prize with his ''Comparative Estimate of Sculpture and Painting''. In 1816 he was ordained, and two years later became parish priest of St Mary's, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].

In 1821 Milman was elected [[professor of poetry at Oxford]]; and in 1827 he delivered the [[Bampton lectures]] on [https://archive.org/details/cu31924029180888 ''The character and conduct of the Apostles considered as an evidence of Christianity'']. In 1835, [[Sir Robert Peel]] made him Rector of St Margaret's, [[Westminster]], and Canon of Westminster, and in 1849 he became [[Dean of St Paul's]]. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1864.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crypt Chapel, St. Paul's Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Milman's original tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral]] 
Milman was buried in the crypt of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], where his grave was marked by an elaborate tomb. When the Chapel of the [[Order of the British Empire]] was created, the original tomb was replaced by a slab in the floor.

==Works==
Milman made his appearance as a dramatist with his [[tragedy]] ''Fazio'' (produced on the stage under the title of ''The Italian Wife''). He also wrote ''Samor, the Lord of The Bright City'', the subject of which was taken from British legend, the "bright city" being [[Gloucester]]. In subsequent poetical works he was more successful, notably the ''Fall of Jerusalem'' (1820) and ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'' (1822, based on the life of [[Saint Margaret the Virgin]]), which was used as the basis for an oratorio by [[Arthur Sullivan]]. The influence of [[Lord Byron|Byron]] is seen in his ''Belshazzar'' (1822). Another tragedy, ''[[Anne Boleyn]]'', followed in 1826.  Milman also wrote "When our-heads are bowed with woe," and other [[hymn]]s; a version of the [[Sanskrit]] episode of ''Nala and Damayanti'';&lt;ref&gt;Available online at [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/19529 Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; and translations of the ''Agamemnon'' of [[Aeschylus]] and the ''Bacchae'' of [[Euripides]]. His poetical works were published in three volumes in 1839.

Turning to another field, Milman published in 1829 his ''History of the Jews'', which is memorable as the first by an English clergyman which treated the Jews as an Oriental tribe, recognized [[sheikh]]s and amirs in the [[Old Testament]], sifted and classified documentary evidence, and evaded or minimized the miraculous. In consequence, the author was attacked and his preferment was delayed. His ''History of Christianity to the Abolition of Paganism in the Roman Empire''&lt;ref&gt;Milman, H. Hart. (1840). ''The history of Christianity from the birth of Christ to the abolition of paganism in the Roman empire.'' New and rev. ed. London: John Murray, vol. 1; vol. 2; vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt; (1840) had been completely ignored; but the continuation of his major work, the ''History of Latin Christianity''&lt;ref&gt;Available online at [https://archive.org/details/latinchristianit01milmuoft Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; (1855), which has passed through many editions, was well received. In 1838 he had edited [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'',&lt;ref&gt;Available online at [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/25717 Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following year published his ''Life of Gibbon''.

Milman was also responsible for an edition of [[Horace]], and when he died he had almost finished a history of St Paul's Cathedral, which was completed and published by his son, A. Milman (London, 1868), who also collected and published in 1879 a volume of his essays and articles.

Milman wrote the hymn, ''[[Ride On, Ride On in Majesty!]]'', often sung on [[Palm Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/r/i/rideride.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
By his wife, Mary Ann Cockell, a daughter of Lieut.-General William Cockell, Milman had four sons and two daughters. Among the sons were [[William Milman]] (1824–1908), Arthur Milman, who wrote a biography about his father, and Sir Archibald Milman (1834–1902), Clerk of the House of Commons. His nephew, [[Robert Milman]] (1816–1876), was [[Anglican Diocese of Calcutta|Bishop of Calcutta]] from 1867 until his death, and was the author of a ''Life of [[Torquato Tasso]]'' (1850).

The '''heroic lay''' is a genre of [[Germanic culture|Germanic]] [[epic poetry]] characteristic of the [[Migration Period]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]]. A lay is a short narrative poem of between 80 and 200 lines concerning a single heroic episode in the life of a warrior from Germanic legend. {{sfn|Hatto|1980|p=165|ps=. "A terse, self-contained, objective, memorized poem of epic-dramatic style imbued with an heroic ethos conveyed with art in a single-stranded plot"}}{{sfn|Gloning|Young|2004|p=42|ps=. "a short poem extolling the valour and nobility of character of a great hero of the past."}} It is distinct from the '''heroic epic''' ([[Beowulf]], [[Nibelungenlied]]) which combines a sequence of episodes into a longer narrative.{{sfn|Heusler|1905}}

'''Josep Cusachs i Cusachs''' (19 July 1851 &amp;ndash; 1908) was a [[Catalonian]] soldier and painter.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Montpellier]], France, while his parents were travelling, but spent most of his life in the area between Barcelona and [[Mataró]]. In 1865, he enrolled at the "Academia Militar de Artillería" in [[Segovia]], became a Captain, and fought in the [[Third Carlist War]].&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/c/cusachs.htm  Biografías y Vidas]: Josep Cusachs&lt;/ref&gt; He retired with the rank of Commander in 1882 to dedicate himself to art.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclopèdies/gran-enciclopèdia-catalana/EC-GEC-0021123.xml Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana]: Brief biography&lt;/ref&gt; His army experience was still an important part of his life, however, and his paintings were mostly on military subjects, especially the cavalry, due to his love for horses. He studied locally with [[Simó Gómez]], and in Paris with [[Édouard Detaille]], an expert on [[military art]].&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

His first exhibition came in 1884 at the [[Sala Parés]], a major art gallery in Barcelona, where he continued to exhibit regularly, with great critical and financial success. Three years later, he participated in an exposition in Madrid, where his painting ''En el campo de maniobras'' (Maneuvers in the Field), was purchased by Queen [[Maria Christina of Austria|María Cristina]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; In 1891, he won a gold medal at the International Exposition in Berlin with ''Maniobras de división'' (Divisional Maneuvers).&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

In addition to his military art, he stood out as a portrait painter, with such notable sitters as King [[Alfonso XIII]], General [[Juan Prim]] and Mexican President [[Porfirio Díaz]],&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; (on display at the State Art Museum of Veracruz in [[Orizaba]]). He also dealt with religious themes, including his well-known ''La huída a Egipto'' (The Flight from Egypt), which is in the [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey]].

In later years, he specialized in paintings of sport riding. The landscapes in many of his works were often entrusted to other painters, as he felt that he lacked the training to execute them properly.&lt;ref&gt;Ricar Mas i Peinado, ''Els artistes catalans i la publicitat (1888-1929)'', Parsifal Edicions, Barcelona, 2002, {{ISBN|84-95554-16-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good selection of his illustrations may be found in ''Military Life in Spain'' by {{ill|Francesc Barado|ca|Francesc Barado i Font}} (Ramirez, 1888).

He died in 1908 (some sources say 1909) in [[Barcelona]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4612">The '''Kaufmann Crucifixion''' is a [[Bohemia]]n Gothic panel painting by an unknown artist that dates from 1340-1360. It was most probably the central part of a relatively small folding altarpiece. 
[[File:14th-century unknown painters - Crucifixion - WGA23514.jpg|thumb|Kaufmann Crucifixion, [[Gemäldegalerie Berlin]]]]

== History of the painting ==
The picture was probably painted in [[Prague]]. It was acquired from the Berlin collection of Richard von Kaufmann (1849-1908) by the Berlin art dealers Pavel Cassirer and F.W. Lippmann along with Hugo Helbing from Munich, who donated it to the then Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin. From there, the picture found its way to the [[Gemäldegalerie Berlin]].

== Description and context ==
The tempera painting on a wooden panel covered with stretched canvas is 67 x 29.5&amp;nbsp;cm in size. It was restored in 1918 and fixed to a fresh canvas base.
In the [[Bohemia]]n context, it is the first known depiction of [[Calvary]] with three crosses and a complexity of events beneath them, which both point to an Italian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Royt J., 2003, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of space and the use of perspectival shortening are also Italian in origin. At the same time, other elements of the painting such as the wealth of rhythm in the figures’ movement, the sharp drawing, the plastic modelling and the Gothic vividness of colour also point to Lower Austrian and western European (French) models.&lt;ref&gt;J. Pešina, 1976, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatically focused naturalism is something of an exception to the otherwise lyrical atmosphere of Bohemian painting.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kutal, 1972, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Although the overall stylistic conception of the picture has a number of features that correspond to the work of the [[Master of Vyšší Brod|Master of the Vyšší Brod Altarpiece]], it is in fact a later work by another artist that represents a progression from mystically religious expression to a dramatic presentation of reality and the intensifying of its effect.
 
Opinion is divided among art historians as to the work’s Bohemian origin, some of them considering it to be the work of an Austrian artist who emerged from the workshop of the Master of the Klosterneuburg Altarpiece (de: ''Meister der Rückseite des Verduner Altars'').&lt;ref&gt;G. Schmidt: Zur Kaufmann’schen Kreuzigung. In: G. Schmidt: Malerei der Gotik. Fixpunkte und Ausblicke. Graz 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This is also connected with the dating of the work that some, in connection with the Klosterneuburg Altarpiece (1331) have pinpointed to the later period of [[John of Bohemia|John of Luxembourg]] (1340)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stavitele-katedral.cz/marek-zagora-jan-lucembursky-ve-vizualnich-pramenech-stredoveku/ Marek Zágora: Jan Lucemburský ve vizuálních pramenech středověku]&lt;/ref&gt; while others judge it to be influenced by Italian art (such the picture The Crucifixion by [[Simone Martini]] of 1342) and consider it more likely to have been painted after 1350.&lt;ref&gt;Dostál E, Umění XI, 1938, pp. 353-361&lt;/ref&gt;

In its form, the Kaufmann Crucifixion is a perfect work that has no parallels in European painting of that period. Several of its motifs were later often adopted, especially that of the man sitting on the ground with one leg bent and the other stretched out. Works inspired by the Kaufmann Crucifixion can be evidenced in surviving panel paintings, though also in [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminations]] in Bohemia and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;J. Fajt, 2006, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kazuyo Sejima'''|妹島 和世|Sejima Kazuyo|born 29 October 1956}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[architect]]. She is known for designs with clean [[Modern architecture|modernist]] elements such as slick, clean, and shiny surfaces made of glass, marble, and metals. She also uses squares and cubes, which can be found in her designs in various degrees. Large windows allow natural light to enter a space and create a fluid transition between interior and exterior. It is this connection of two spaces from which she draws her inspiration.

Kazuyo Sejima, along with and [[Ryue Nishizawa]], has worked on several projects in Germany, Switzerland, France, England, the Netherlands, United States, and Spain. Many of their designs like the [[Rolex Learning Center]] at [[EPFL]] the [[New Museum]] in the Bowery District in New York City as well as the [[Toledo Museum of Art#Glass Pavilion|Glass Pavilion]] for the Toledo Museum of Art involve glass and public open space to interact with the world around the architecture. Such design elements can be found abundantly in their designs.

In 2010, Sejima was the second woman to receive the [[Pritzker Prize]], which was awarded jointly with [[Ryue Nishizawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsdha.co.uk/gridfs/5756b92400dd7c0003000024|publisher=[[Architectural Digest]]|author=Nonie Niesewand|date=March 2015|title=Through the Glass Ceiling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sejima was born on 29 October 1956 at [[Mito, Ibaraki]], Japan. She graduated from [[Japan Women's University]] in 1979. She then went on to complete the Master's Degree course in architecture in 1981. In the same year, she began working with the architecture firm Toyo Ito and Associates until 1987.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoshida|first=Nobuyuki|date=Fall 1999|title=Kazuyo Seijima: Profile|url=|journal=The Japan Architect|volume=35|pages=126-127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After apprenticing with [[Toyo Ito]], Sejima established Kazuyo Sejima &amp; Associates in 1987. One of her first hires was [[Ryue Nishizawa]], a student who had worked with Sejima at Toyo Ito and Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa {{!}} biography - Japanese architects|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Kazuyo-Sejima-and-Ryue-Nishizawa|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working for Sejima for several years, Sejima asked him to form a partnership. In 1995, the two founded the [[Tokyo]]-based firm [[sanaa (firm)|SANAA]] (Sejima and Nishizawa and Associates).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kazuyo Sejima &amp; Ryue Nishizawa Successes stack up for Tokyo design duo: Sanaa interviewed by Japan Times|url = http://architecturalinterviews.blogspot.com/2009/12/kazuyo-sejima-ryue-nishizawa-successes.html|website = architectural interviews|date = 2009-12-28|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Sejima was appointed director of architecture sector for the [[Venice Biennale]], which she curated for the 12th Annual International Architecture Exhibition. She was the first woman ever selected for this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/female-designers-breaking-the-mold-671504|title=10 Female Designers Breaking the Mold|date=4 October 2016|publisher=ArtNet|author=Rain Embuscado}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she was awarded the [[Pritzker Prize]], together with Ryue Nishizawa.&lt;ref name="Pritzker"&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/laureates/2010/textmediakit.html Pritzker Prize 2010 Media Kit], retrieved 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==
When describing Sejima's work, a viewer would notice that she mostly uses glass in all of her work. She likes slick surfaces such as marble, and her buildings mainly display an arrange of curves within the architecture of the building as well as on the surface. Kazuyo successfully combines the building with the surrounding areas. The use of a lot of sheer glasses and clear glass is used, allowing for a person to look at the outdoors, while also looking at themselves and the reflections the outside world creates on the inside of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2010/essay|title = Essay: Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa {{!}} The Pritzker Architecture Prize|website = www.pritzkerprize.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/ss/10/03/0301_most_anticipated_architecture/10.htm|title = The World's Most Anticipated Architecture: Rolex Learning Center - BusinessWeek|website = Businessweek.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2010/essay|title = Essay: Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa {{!}} The Pritzker Architecture Prize|website = www.pritzkerprize.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/ss/10/03/0301_most_anticipated_architecture/10.htm|title = The World's Most Anticipated Architecture: Rolex Learning Center - BusinessWeek|website = Businessweek.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sejima intentionally overturns outmoded stereotypical housing models as they are based on assumptions instead of reality. These assumptions include housing models that illustrate the proper living condition for a nuclear family, etc. Her idea is not to initiate a complete rejection to tradition, but rather to challenge the conventional process of design. Instead of unconsciously applying assumptions to a design, she tries to confront them consciously as best as she can. She thinks it is impossible to let a building completely based on a fictional idea or theory of what something should be.&lt;ref&gt;Sejima, Kazuyo. ''Kazuyo Sejima, 1988-1996''. Ed. C.

The founding members included Edward Asner, Richard Dreyfuss, Hector Elizondo, Harry Hamlin, Julie Harris, Amy Irving, Stacy Keach, John Lithgow, Marsha Mason, JoBeth Williams, and current Producing Director Susan Loewenberg, who joined together out of a desire to create a venue for stage acting in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Your Ears Only: A Conversation with Susan Loewenberg, Producing Director, L.A.

'''''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Luncheon on the Grass'') – originally titled '''''Le Bain''''' (''The Bath'') – is a large [[oil on canvas]] painting by [[Édouard Manet]] created in 1862 and 1863. It depicts a [[female nude]] and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 [[Salon des Refusés]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k114147v Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure, lithographie et architecture : refusés par le Jury de 1863 et exposés, par décision de S.M. l'Empereur au salon annexe, palais des Champs-Elysées, le 15 mai 1863, Édouard Manet, ''Le Bain'', no. 363], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt; where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|title=Art in an Age of Civil Struggle|year=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-226-06328-7|pages=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-7123.html?no_cache=1&amp;cHash=48427e6bdb Musée d'Orsay, Le déjeuner sur l'herbe (Luncheon on the Grass)]&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller, earlier version can be seen at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art#The Courtauld Gallery|Courtauld Gallery]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/gallery/2454912b.html The Courtauld Gallery version]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and context==
The painting features a nude woman casually lunching with two fully dressed men. Her body is starkly lit and she stares directly at the viewer. The two men, dressed as young [[dandy|dandies]], seem to be engaged in conversation, ignoring the woman. In front of them, the woman's clothes, a basket of fruit, and a round loaf of bread are displayed, as in a [[still life]]. In the background, a lightly clad woman bathes in a stream. Too large in comparison with the figures in the foreground, she seems to float above them. The roughly painted background lacks depth, giving the viewer the impression that the scene is not taking place outdoors, but in a studio. This impression is reinforced by the use of broad "studio" light, which casts almost no shadows. The man on the right wears a flat hat with a tassel, a kind normally worn indoors.

Despite the mundane subject, Manet deliberately chose a large canvas size, measuring 81.9 x 104.1&amp;nbsp;in (208 by 264.5 cm), normally reserved for historical, religious, and mythological subjects.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Paul Hayes|title=Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|pages=5–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of the painting breaks with the academic traditions of the time. He did not try to hide the brush strokes; the painting even looks unfinished in some parts of the scene. The nude is also starkly different from the smooth, flawless figures of [[Alexandre Cabanel|Cabanel]] or [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]].

A nude woman casually lunching with fully dressed men was an affront to audiences' sense of propriety, though [[Émile Zola]], a contemporary of Manet's, argued that this was not uncommon in paintings found in the [[Louvre]]. Zola also felt that such a reaction came from viewing art differently than "analytic" painters like Manet, who use a painting's subject as a pretext to paint.

There is much still not known about the painting, such as when Manet actually began painting it, exactly how he got the idea, and how and what sort of preparation works he did.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt; Though Manet had claimed this piece was once valued at 25,000 Francs in 1871, it actually remained in his possession until 1878 when [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], opera-singer and collector, bought it for just 2,600 Francs.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;

==Figures in the painting==
The figures of this painting are a testament to how deeply connected Manet was to ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe''. Some assume that the landscape of the painting is meant to be [[L'Île-Saint-Denis|l’île Saint-Ouen]], which was just up [[the Seine]] from his family property in [[Gennevilliers]]. Manet often used real models and people he knew as reference during his creation process.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Carol|title="To Paint, To Point, To Pose" Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|pages=93–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female nude is thought to be [[Victorine Meurent]], the woman who became his favorite and frequently portrayed model, who later was the subject of [[Olympia (Manet)|''Olympia'']]. The male figure on the right was based on a combination of his two brothers, Eugène and Gustave Manet. The other man is based on his brother-in-law, Dutch sculptor {{ill|Ferdinand Leenhoff|fr}}. Nancy Locke referred to this scene as Manet’s family portrait.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;

==Interactions of the figures==
What many critics find shocking about this painting is the interaction, or lack thereof, between the three main subjects in the foreground and the woman bathing in the background. There are many contrasting qualities to the painting that juxtapose and distance the female nude from the other two male subjects. For example, the feminine versus the masculine, the naked versus the clothed, and the white color palette versus the dark color palette creates a clear social difference between the men and the woman.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt; Additionally, some viewers are intrigued by the questions raised by the gaze of the nude woman. It is indeterminable whether she is challenging or accepting the viewer, looking past the viewer, engaging the viewer, or even looking at the viewer at all. This encounter identifies the gaze as a figure of the painting itself, as well as the figure object of the woman’s gaze.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;

==Inspirations==
As with the later ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1863) and other works, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s engraving ''The Judgment of Paris'' (c. 1515) after a drawing by [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;Ross King. ''The Judgement of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade that Gave the World Impressionism''. New York: Waller &amp; Company, 2006 {{ISBN|0-8027-1466-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael was an artist revered by the conservative members of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] and his paintings were part of the teaching programme at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], where copies of fifty-two images from his most celebrated frescoes were permanently on display. ''Le Bain'' (an early title for ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe'') was therefore, in many ways, a defiant painting. Manet was cheekily reworking Raphael, turning a mythological scene from one of the most celebrated engravings of the [[Renaissance]] into a tableau of somewhat vulgar Parisian holidaymakers.&lt;ref&gt;Ross King, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Antoine Watteau - La Partie carrée.jpg|[[Antoine Watteau]], ''La Partie Carrée,'' (c. 1713)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Scholars also cite two works as important precedents for Manet's painting ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'': ''The Pastoral Concert'' by [[Giorgione]] or possibly [[Titian]] (in the [[Louvre]]) and Giorgione's [[The Tempest (painting)|''The Tempest'']], both of which are famous [[Renaissance]] paintings.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt; ''The Tempest'', which also features a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting, offers an important precedent for Manet's painting ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe.''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rewald]],''The History of Impressionism'', [[The Museum of Modern Art]], 4th revised edition 1973, (1st 1946, 2nd 1955, 3rd 1961), p. 85. {{ISBN|0-87070-369-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pastoral Concert'' even more closely resembles ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe,'' as it features two dressed men seated in a rural setting, with two undressed women. ''Pastoral Concert'' is in the collection of the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] and is likely, therefore, to have been studied by Manet.

According to Proust, he and Manet had been lounging by the Seine as they spotted a woman bathing in the river. This prompted Manet to say, "I copied Giorgione’s women, the women with musicians. It’s black that painting. The ground has come through. I want to redo it and do it with a transparent atmosphere with people like those we see over there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laessøe|first1=Rolf|title=Édouard Manet's "Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe" as a Veiled Allegory of Painting|journal=Artibus et Historiae|date=2005|volume=26|issue=51|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be a connection between ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe'' and the work of [[Jean Antoine Watteau]].&lt;ref name="Fried"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fried|first1=Michael|title=Manet's Modernism or, The Face of Painting in the 1860s|date=1996|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manet’s original title, ''Le Bain'', initially drew the main attention to the woman near the water. This bathing figure alone is quite similar to the figure in Watteau’s ''Le Villageoise'', as both women crouch or lean over near water, simultaneously holding up their skirts. It’s possible that Manet adapted this pose, which is more clearly seen in a sketch of his years before his creation of ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe''.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

==Critique and controversy==
There were many mixed reviews and responses to ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe'' when it was first displayed&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k108159t Fernand Desnoyers, ''La peinture en 1863 : Salon des refusés'', A. Dutil (Paris) 1863], Bibliothèque nationale de France (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; and it continues to yield a variety of responses.  The initial response was characterized by its blunt rejection from the Paris Salon and subsequent display in the [[Salon des Refusés]]. Though many critiques were rooted in confusion about the piece, they were not always completely negative.&lt;ref name="McCauley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCauley|first1=Anne|title="Sex and the Salon" Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Odilon Redon]], for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in [[Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''.
* [[Le Capitaine Pompilius]], a contributor for ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', thought the characteristically "male" colors of the piece brought the countryside into the salon, but thought the painting was underdeveloped.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary|Castagnary]], appreciator of realist works, identified it as a nice sketch but said it lacked sincerity and lost the definition of the anatomy of the subjects. He also described Manet’s painting technique as "flabby".&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Arthur Stevens, contributor for ''[[Le Figaro]]'', praised Manet as a talented colorist but felt that he neglected form and modeling in this piece.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger|Thoré]], Paul, and Louvet loved the energy of the colors but found the brush strokes to be uneven.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;

One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution present at that time in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], a large park on the western outskirts of Paris. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Gartner, ''Art and Architecture: Musée d'Orsay'', 2001, p. 180. {{ISBN|0-7607-2889-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Bois de Boulogne is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century.

=== Critiques of the subject matter ===
* Louis Étienne characterized the painting as a puzzle, while describing the nude female as "a Bréda of some sort, as nude as possible, lolling boldly between two swells dressed to the teeth. These two persons look like high school students on holiday, committing a great sin to prove their manhood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1141487 Louis Étienne, ''Le jury et les exposants: salon des refusés'', Paris, 1863, p. 30.], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Arthur Stevens could not understand what the painting was saying.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Didier de Montchaux found the subject to be "fairly scabrous".&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Thoré described the nude as an ugly and risqué subject matter, while describing the male on the right as one "who doesn’t even think of taking off his horrible padded hat outdoors…It’s the contrast between such an antipathetic animal to the character of a pastoral scene, and this undraped bather, that is shocking."&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* [[Philip Gilbert Hamerton|Philip Hamerton]], an English painter and contributor at the ''Fine Arts Quarterly'', had an affinity for the characteristic photographic detail of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] paintings. Though he did recognize the inspiration from Giorgione, he found Manet’s modern realism to be offensive in this situation. His disapproval of Manet and similar artists was related to the idea of indecency behind "vulgar men" painting nude women.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;

=== General response ===
Though the peculiarity of the combination of one female nude with three clothed figures sparked mixed responses, the lack of interaction of the figures in addition to the lack of engagement by the nude woman provoked laughter instead of offense. Laughter as a response represses the sexual tension and makes the scene rather unthreatening to the viewer in the end.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;

==Commentary of Émile Zola==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the [[Louvre]] there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience.  Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Zola, ''Édouard Manet,'' 1867,  et lps 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.cahiers-naturalistes.com/Salons/01-01-67.html&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dzola%2Bon%2Bmanet%26start%3D10%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3Dpu9%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Dsb%26biw%3D1799%26bih%3D840 Émile Zola, ''Édouard Manet,'' 1867, link to English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zola presents a fictionalised version of the painting and the controversy surrounding it in his novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (''The Masterpiece'').

== Inspired works==
[[File:Monet dejeunersurlherbe.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (Monet)|Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'', 1865–1866, [[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris, France|Paris]].]]
[[File:James Tissot - La Partie carrée.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Tissot]], ''La Partie Carrée'', 1870]]
* In ''L'Oeuvre'', Émile Zola's novel about a painter, a work by his main character, Claude Lantier, exhibited in a fictional salon des refusés, resembles Manet's painting.
* [[Claude Monet]]'s own version of ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (Monet)|Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' from 1865–1866, was inspired by Manet's masterpiece.
* French painter [[James Tissot]], painted ''La Partie Carrée'', in 1870; arguably a tamer version without the nudity of ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe''.
* [[Paul Cézanne]] painted the same theme in his ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'' (1876–1877), [[Musée de l'Orangerie]], Paris. It is not certain, however, that Cézanne was responsible for the title of the work, but it does incorporate many of the same elements of subject in the piece. For example, Cézanne’s clothed female subject poses similarly to the model of Manet in which her chin rests in her hand. The male figure, meant to resemble the painter himself, mimics the hand gesture of the man furthest right in Manet’s piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=Nancy|title="Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe as a Family Romance" Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of Cézanne's painting also bears resemblance to ''[[:File:Nicolas Poussin - Bacchanal - the Andrians - WGA18269.jpg|Bacchanal]]'' (between 1627 and 1628), by [[Nicolas Poussin]], whose works in the Louvre were periodically copied by Cézanne. It is possible that Cézanne's ''Déjeuner'' represents nothing more than the joyful memories of outings in the countryside around Aix-en-Provence, known especially from the testimony of a childhood friend of the painter, Émile Zola.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/pages/page_id19113_u1l2.htm Paul Cézanne, ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'' (1876–1877), Musée de l'Orangerie, Paris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029032121/http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/pages/page_id19113_u1l2.htm |date=2014-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Manet’s painting inspired [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] as he completed the largest concentration of art prompted by a single work during the 20th century, consisting of 27 paintings, 140 drawings, 3 linogravures and cardboard marquettes for sculpture carried out between 1949 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso: Challenging the past'' [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] exhibition book, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso also adopted some of Manet’s techniques involving exploitation of the nude in the foreground as evident in his work ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', 1907.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;
* [[Paul Gauguin]] may have been inspired by this piece in creating his 1896 work ''Where do we come from? Who are we? Where are we going?'', as there is a similarity of Manet’s depiction of the nude woman and Gauguin’s Tahitian woman.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;
* [[Max Ernst]] painted a parody version of this piece named ''Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbre'' in 1944. He inverts the painting, replaces the nude woman with a fish, and adds an 'r' to the title for comedic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/2002.55?collection_search_query=fish&amp;op=search&amp;form_build_id=form-LSCVdx4K6pNGdu3UeD8aED5T32uXqJtj4kV67Am_FPk&amp;form_id=clevelandart_collection_search_form&amp;f%5B0%5D=object_on_view:1&amp;c=1|title=Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbre {{!}} Cleveland Museum of Art|website=www.clevelandart.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The painting inspired the 1959 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052765/ film] of the same name by [[Jean Renoir]].
* It was copied in the cover photo of the [[Bow Wow Wow]] [[LP record|LP]] ''[[See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!]]'', and the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (Bow Wow Wow EP)|The Last of the Mohicans]]''. Controversy arose because the naked girl (lead singer [[Annabella Lwin]]) was only 14 at the time.  
* [[Alain Jacquet]] copied in 1964 the composition of Manet in his ''Déjeuner sur l'herbe''[http://collection.centrepompidou.fr/#/artworks?layout=mosaic&amp;page=0&amp;filters=authors:JACQUET+Alain%E2%86%B9JACQUET+Alain :], a serie of 95 serigraphies portraying the art critic [[Pierre Restany]] and the painter [[Mario Schifano]], one of which was left in the lobby of the [[hotel Chelsea]] in [[New York City]] for payment of his room.

[[File:Giampietrino - Leda and her Children - WGA08952.jpg|thumb|[[Giampietrino]], after Leonardo, ''[[Leda and her Children]]'']]
[[File:Study for the Kneeling Leda.jpg|thumb|Leonardo, ''Leda and the Swan'', drawing on paper, Chatsworth]]
The story of [[Leda and the Swan]] was the subject of two compositions by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] from perhaps 1503–10. Neither survive as paintings by Leonardo, but there are a number of drawings for both by him, and copies in oils, especially of the second composition, where Leda stands.

==First version==
Leonardo began making [[Study (art)|studies]] in 1504 for a painting, apparently never executed, of [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] seated on the ground with her children. Three sketches of Leda by Leonardo exist:
* ''Leda and the Swan'', pen and ink and wash over black chalk on paper, 160 x 139&amp;nbsp;mm. 1503–1507, Devonshire Collection, [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]] (pictured)
* ''Study for kneeling Leda'', black chalk, pen and ink on paper, 126 x 109&amp;nbsp;cm. 1503–1507, [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], [[Rotterdam]]
* ''Studies of Leda and a Horse'', black chalk, brush and ink on paper, 1503–1507, [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library]], [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]]

A completed copy of ''Leda and her Children'' by [[Giampietrino]] is kept at [[Staatliche Museen]], [[Kassel]] (c.{{nbsp}}1520, oil on wood, 128 x 106&amp;nbsp;cm).

==Completed version==
In 1508 Leonardo painted a different composition of the subject. The picture known as ''[[Leda and the Swan]]'' depicted a nude standing Leda cuddling the swan, with the two sets of infant twins, and their huge broken egg-shells. The original of this is lost, probably deliberately destroyed, and was last recorded in the French royal [[Château de Fontainebleau]] in 1625 by [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]]:

''A standing figure of Leda almost entirely naked, with the swan at her and two eggs, from whose broken shells come forth four babies, This work, although somewhat dry in style, is exquisitely finished, especially in the woman's breast; and for the rest of the landscape and the plant life are rendered with the greatest diligence. Unfortunately the picture is in a bad state because it is done on three long panels which have split apart and broken off a certain amount of paint.''

However the picture is known from many copies, of which the earliest are probably the ''Spiridon Leda'', perhaps by a studio assistant and now in the [[Uffizi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Leda Melzi Uffizi.jpg|image]];  Fossi, Gloria, pp. 402-3, ''Uffizi: art, history, collections'', Giunti Editore Firenze Italy, 2004, {{ISBN|88-09-03676-X}}, 9788809036765 [https://books.google.com/books?id=oNE3ofu8psMC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Spiridon+Leda&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kcWYTOuCJoWUjAex24D9Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Spiridon%20Leda&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt; and the one at [[Wilton House]] in England. Other copies by [[Leonardeschi]] include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21026">This article is a list of [[piano]] [[brand]] names from all over the world. This list also includes names of old instruments which are no longer in production.

Many of these piano brand names are "stencil pianos", which means that the company which owns the brand name is simply applying the name to a piano manufactured for them by another company, and that the same or very similar pianos are sold under differing "stencil" brands. This often applies to old brand names, revitalized to give an air of heritage to a new piano line, or to pianos manufactured specifically for individual dealers or shops.  Also, some brand names have models that are manufactured in entirely different manufacturing plants or countries than another model of the same brand.

This is a '''list of video gaming-related websites'''. A [[video game]] is an [[electronic game]] that involves human interaction with a [[user interface]] to generate visual feedback on a [[video|video device]] such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word ''video'' in ''video game'' traditionally referred to a [[raster scan|raster]] display device,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3659285.html |title= Television gaming apparatus and method | accessdate=2008-06-25 |work=United States Patents }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it now implies any type of [[display device]] that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2763">'''Mitákuye Oyás’iŋ''' ('''All Are Related''') is a phrase from the [[Lakota language]]. It reflects the [[world view]] of interconnectedness held by the [[Lakota people]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=François |first=Damien |title=The Self-destruction of the West: critical cultural anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_jtzhrHVA_UC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=Mitakuye+Oyasin#v=onepage&amp;q=Mitakuye%20Oyasin&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Publibook|isbn=2-7483-3797-2|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept and phrase is expressed in many [[Yankton Sioux]] prayers,&lt;ref name=py&gt;{{cite book|last=Maroukis|first=Thomas  Constantine |title=Peyote and the Yankton Sioux: The Life and Times of Sam Necklace|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sW-Q9lvG5N0C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Mitakuye+Oyasin#v=onepage&amp;q=Mitakuye%20Oyasin&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-3649-9|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by ceremonial people in other Lakota communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womennewsnetwork.net/2010/11/02/lakotaelderwomen-1008/|title=US: Indigenous Lakota women face harsh winter wrath under climate change|date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ja&gt;{{cite book|last=Lupton|first=Mary Jane |title=James Welch: A Critical Companion|url=https://books.google.com/?id=t2x6RcaKljMC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Mitakuye+Oyasin#v=onepage&amp;q=Mitakuye%20Oyasin&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-32725-4|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase translates in English as "all my relatives," "we are all related," or "all my relations."  It is a prayer of oneness and harmony with all forms of life: other people, animals, birds, insects, trees and plants, and even rocks, rivers, mountains and valleys.&lt;ref name=py/&gt;

In 1940, American scholar [[Joseph Epes Brown]] wrote a study of ''Mitákuye Oyás’iŋ'' and its relevance in the [[Sioux]] ideology of "underlying connection" and "oneness." He noted how the phrase has been [[Cultural appropriation|misappropriated]] and misused as a slogan and salutation by peoples from outside the Lakota cultures.&lt;ref name=ja/&gt;

Francis White Bird asserts that only Lakota can use this phrase because it applies only to Lakota culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White Bird|first1=Francis|title=Levels of Lakota language|url=http://www.lakotacountrytimes.com/common/PastArchives/1237.html|website=Lakota Country Times|publisher=Lakota Country Times|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless it has become a sign of recognition by all peoples of native ancestry, especially those who are alienated from tribal tradition.

Volume 2''. - Moscow: Iskusstvo Edition, 1972. - pp. 250-251.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists]] and regarded as one of the brightest representatives of the [[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad school of painting]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' Saint Petersburg, NP-Print Edition, 2007. P.48, 359, 384, 388-390, 392, 393, 399, 403, 405-407, 411, 413-416, 419, 421-424.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Veselova was born January 6, 1922, in Petrograd (former Saint Petersburg), Soviet Russia.

From 1934 to 1941 Veselova studied at the [[Secondary Art School]] at the [[Russian Academy of Arts|All-Russian Academy of Fine Arts]], where she was student of [[Vladimir Gorb]], Piotr Kazakov, Leonid Sholokhov, and [[Alexander Zaytsev (artist)|Alexander Zaitsev]].

In 1941, after graduating, Veselova entered at the Department of Painting of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]]. After the beginning of the [[German-Soviet War]], Veselova continued studying in the institute until its evacuation to Central Asia in February 1942.

During [[World War II]] and the [[siege of Leningrad]], Veselova remained in Leningrad. She worked at the plant, an educator of kindergarten, in the lumber camps on the outskirts of Leningrad. In 1943–1944, after breaking through the siege of Leningrad, she was engaged in reviving the [[Tavricheskaya Art School]].

In 1944, after the liberation of Leningrad from the enemy's blockade and the return the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] from evacuation, Veselova resumed classes at the faculty of painting. She studied of Mikhail Bernshtein, [[Genrikh Pavlovsky]], [[Alexander Zaytsev (artist)|Alexander Zaytsev]].

In 1950 Veselova graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in [[Boris Ioganson]] studio, together with [[Evgenia Antipova]], [[Anatoli Vasiliev]], [[Vecheslav Zagonek]], [[Tatiana Kopnina]], [[Nikolai Mukho]], [[Alexander Pushnin]], [[Alexander Ivanovich Sokolov|Alexander Sokolov]], [[Yuri Tulin]], and other young artists. Her graduation work was genre painting named "The award-winning teacher", dedicated to the postwar Soviet school.&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. - Saint Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. p.62.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in the 1950–1954 years, Veselova continued her postgraduate studies under creative workshop by the leading of People's Artist of the USSR Professor Alexander Gerasimov. In 1954 she was awarded the academic degree of Doctor of art-criticism.

After 1939, Veselova participated in art exhibitions. She painted portraits, genre paintings, landscapes and still lifes. A talented portrait painter and graphic artist, Veselova gravitated to the genre of portrait with a developed plot. Her style is distinguished soft plastic, restrained decorative color, and exquisite tonal relationships.

Veselova was a member of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists]] since 1950.

Veselova died in [[Leningrad]] on March 3, 1960. Paintings by Veselova reside in [[State Russian Museum]], [[State Tretyakov Gallery]], in the lot of art museums and private collections in Russia, in the U.S., China, England, Japan, and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25496">'''Fine art nude photography''' is a [[genre]] of [[fine-art photography]] which [[Nude photography|depicts the nude]] human body with an emphasis on form, [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emotional content, and other [[aesthetic]] qualities.

The [[Nude (art)|nude]] has been a prominent subject of [[photography]] since its invention, and played an important role in establishing photography as a [[fine art]] medium.

The distinction between fine art photography and other subgenres is not absolute, but there are certain defining characteristics.

[[Erotic photography|Erotic]] interest, although often present, is secondary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Clark, Kenneth| year=1956| title=The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form|chapter=1. The Naked and the Nude|publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton| isbn=0-691-01788-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which distinguishes art photography from both [[glamour photography]], which focuses on showing the subject of the photograph in the most attractive way, and [[pornographic photography]], which has the primary purpose of [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] the viewer. Fine art photographs are also not taken to serve any journalistic, scientific, or other practical purpose.

The distinction between these is not always clear, and photographers, as with other artists, tend to make their own case in characterizing their work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krosenthal.com/photography.html|author=Rosenthal,Karin|title=About My Work|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavondyss.com/silverbeauty/about.htm|author=Schiesser, Jody|title=Silverbeauty - Artist Statement|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcusart.net/|author=Mok, Marcus|title=Artist's Statement|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the viewer may have a different assessment.

The nude remains a controversial subject in all media, but more so with photography due to its inherent realism.&lt;ref name="Met"/&gt; The male nude has been less common than the female, and more rarely exhibited or published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weiermair, Peter  |author2=Nielander, Claus  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Hidden Image: Photographs of the Male Nude in the 19th and 20th Centuries|publisher=MIT Press, 1988|isbn=0-262-23137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of children as subjects in nude photography is especially controversial.

Those early photographers in [[Western culture]]s who sought to establish photography as a fine art medium, frequently chose women as the subjects for their nude photographs, in poses that accorded with traditional [[Nude (art)|nudes]] in other media. Before nude photography, art nudes usually used allusions to [[classical antiquity]]; gods and warriors, goddesses and nymphs. Depictions of male and female nudes in traditional art mediums had been mostly limited to portrayals as an ideal warrior or athlete (for men) or that emphasized divinity and reproduction (for women),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuan/hd_nuan.htm|title=Sorabella, Jean. January 2008. The nude in western art and its beginnings in antiquity. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early photographic art first engaged these archetypes as well. Poses, [[Photographic lighting|lighting]], [[soft focus]], [[vignetting]] and hand [[Photo manipulation|retouching]] were employed to create photographic images that rose to the level of art comparable to the other arts at that time.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/naked-before-the-camera|title=Naked before the Camera|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main limitation was that early photographs were [[monochrome]]. Although 19th century artists in other media often used photographs as substitutes for live models, the best of these photographs were also intended as works of art in their own right.

Nude photography was more controversial than painted nude works, and in order to avoid censorship some early nude photographs were described as "studies for artists",&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; while others were used as references by artists to do drawings and paintings as a supplement to live [[Model (art)|models]]. [[Eugène Delacroix]] was an early adopter of the practice of using photographs taken specifically for him by his friend, [[Eugène Durieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Two Delacroix Drawings Made from Photographs|author=Van Deren Coke|journal=Art Journal|volume=21|issue=3|date=Spring 1962|pages=172–174|publisher=College Art Association|jstor=774417|doi=10.2307/774417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar Degas]] made his own photographs that he used for painting references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=47047|title=After the Bath, Woman Drying Her Back|publisher=The J. Paul Getty Museum|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
As fine art photography first embraced and then moved passed classical allegorical imagery, both male and female photographers began to use the male nude as another medium to examine issues of representation and identity, sexuality and voyeurism.&lt;ref&gt;Weiermair, Peter (Ed.). (1994). ''The male nude: A male view: An anthology''. Zurich: Edition Stemmle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographing nudes (and particularly male nudes) became a way for women artists to engage the subject of “the nude” from the position of power traditionally reserved for male artists;&lt;ref&gt;Weiermair, Peter (Ed.). (1995). ''Male nudes by women: An anthology''. Zurich: Edition Stemmle.&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, nude self-portraiture allowed men to begin to re-evaluate accepted definitions of sensuality and masculinity by photographing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Massengill, Reed. (2005). ''Self-exposure : the male nude self portrait''. New York: Universe.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alfred Stieglitz ====
[[Alfred Stieglitz]] is a major figure in bringing modern art to America by exhibiting the new genre of art in his New York galleries at the beginning of the 20th century. He is known to the public perhaps more for his relationship with [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], whose nude photos he exhibited in 1921 while married to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2001|title=ART REVIEW: Proselytizing for Modernism|first=Michael|last=Kimmelman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stieglitz used the camera as a kind of mirror. 'My photographs,' he wrote in 1925, 'are ever born of an inner need--an Experience of Spirit. I do not make ''pictures . . .'' I have a vision of life and I try to find equivalents for it sometimes in the form of photographs.' Often he would write of ''true seeing'' and of ''inness''. As O'Keeffe noted rightly, the man she knew so well was 'always photographing himself.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 6, 1983|title=Looking Back at the Seer of the New - Alfred Stieglitz: The Man, The Battle, The Art|author=Paul Richard|page=L1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imogen Cunningham ====
[[Imogen Cunningham]] began taking photographs in Seattle in 1905, in the soft-focused ''[[Pictorialism|pictorialist]]'' style popular at that time; but she is best known for the sharp-focused modern style she developed later. She is also attributed as the first woman photographer to take a nude photo of a man (her husband, [[Roi Partridge]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sampling Imogen Cunningham's Vibrant Diversity|author=Charles Hagan |newspaper=New York Times|date=13 Oct 1995|page=C27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work of [[Judy Dater]], one particular photo, ''Imogen and Twinka'', became one of the most recognizable images caught by an American photographer. It features a 91 year old Imogen Cunningham and a nude [[Twinka Thiebaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Fallis, Greg. [http://www.utata.org/sundaysalon/judy-dater/ Judy Dater], Sunday Salon with Greg Fallis, UTATA.org&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was the first adult full frontal nude photograph published in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine, in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, Bicentennial Special Issue (1976) called: ''Remarkable American Women 1776-1976''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Man Ray ====
After [[World War I]], [[avant-garde]] photographers became more experimental in their portrayal of nudity, using reflective distortions and printing techniques to create abstractions or depicting real life rather than classical allusions.

Beginning in the late 1920s [[Man Ray]] experimented with the Sabattier, or [[solarization]] process, a technique that won him critical esteem, especially from the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Many of the central figures of Surrealism—[[André Breton|Breton]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]]—followed his example in using photography in addition to other media. Other photographers, such as [[Maurice Tabard]] and [[Raoul Ubac]], were directly inspired by Man Ray’s techniques, while photographers such as [[André Kertész]] and [[Brassaï]] were indirectly influenced by his innovative approach to the medium.

==== Edward Weston ====
[[Edward Weston]] evolved a particularly American aesthetic, using a [[Large format (photography)|large format]] camera to capture images of [[Nature photography|nature]] and [[Landscape photography|landscapes]] as well as nudes, establishing photography as a fine arts medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativephotography.org/artists/edward-weston|title=Edward Weston|publisher=University of Arizona, Center for Creative Photography|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 Weston became the first photographer to be awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccp.uair.arizona.edu/item/234|title=Edward Weston Photographs|publisher=Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona Libraries|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725011346/http://ccp.uair.arizona.edu/item/234|archivedate=2010-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a famous example of Weston's work see: [[Charis Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Conger, Amy| title=Edward Weston: The Form of Nude|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=2006|isbn=0-7148-4573-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bill Brandt ====
[[Bill Brandt]] is best known for a series of nudes developed primarily between 1945 and 1961, that are both personal and universal, sensual and strange, collectively exemplifying the “sense of wonder” that is paramount in his photographs. Brandt’s work is unpredictable not only in the range of his subjects but also in his printing style, which varied widely throughout his career. This exhibition is the first to emphasize the beauty of Brandt’s finest prints, and to trace the arc of their evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1343|title=Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diane Arbus ====
Many fine art photographers have a variety of subjects in their work, the nude being one. [[Diane Arbus]] was attracted to unusual people in unusual settings, including a nudist camp. [[Lee Friedlander]] had more conventional subjects, one being [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as a young model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/12/madonna.photo.auction/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title=Nude photo of Madonna goes for $37,500 |date=February 12, 2009 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The distinction between fine art and glamour is often one of [[marketing]], with fine art being sold through galleries or dealers in limited editions signed by the artist, and glamour photos being distributed through mass media.

For some, the difference is in the gaze of the model, with glamour models looking into the camera, while art models do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=Conrad,Donna  | publisher=PhotoVision| title = A Conversation with Ruth Bernhard| newspaper = Vol. 1 No. 3| year = 2000  | url = http://www.photovisionmagazine.com/articles/bernhard.interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glamour and [[Fashion photography|fashion]] photographers have aspired to fine art status in some of their work. One of the first was [[Irving Penn]], who progressed from ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine to photographing fashion models such as [[Kate Moss]] nude. [[Richard Avedon]], [[Helmut Newton]] and [[Annie Leibovitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/annie_leibovitz/|title=Exhibitions: Annie Leibovitz: A Photographer's Life, 1990–2005|publisher=The Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have followed a similar path with [[portrait]]s of the famous, many of them nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/feb/08/photography.art|title=Not naked but nude|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 November 2012|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or partially clothed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/06/miley200806|title=Miley Knows Best|publisher=Vanity Fair|year=2008|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-modern era, where fame is often the subject of fine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/22/andy-warhol-legacy-lives-on|title=Andy Warhol's legacy lives on in the factory of fame|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2012|location=London|first=Alex|last=Needham|date=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avedon's photo of [[Nastassja Kinski]] with a python, and Leibovitz's magazine covers of [[More Demi Moore|Demi Moore pregnant]] and in [[Demi's Birthday Suit|body paint]], have become iconic. The work of [[Joyce Tenneson]] has gone the other way, from fine art with a unique, soft-focus style showing woman at all stages of life to portraiture of famous people and fashion photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Tenneson|url=http://www.tenneson.com/content/bio|accessdate=2013-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nude photographers have largely worked within established forms that show bodies as sculptural abstractions, some, such as [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], have created works that deliberately blur the boundaries between [[Erotic photography|erotica]] and art.

Several photographers have become controversial because of their nude photographs of underage subjects.&lt;ref name="Photo Flap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/1998/05/01/photo-flap|title=Photo Flap|publisher=Reason|year=1998|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hamilton (photographer)|David Hamilton]] often used erotic themes,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Jock Sturges]] celebrates the beauty of people in naturist settings without emphasis on sexuality.&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock and Phillips, Jayne Anne 1991"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sturges, Jock  |author2=Phillips, Jayne Anne |lastauthoramp=yes | title=[[The Last Day of Summer (book)|The Last Day of Summer]] |publisher=Aperture |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock 1994"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sturges, Jock |title=[[Radiant Identities: Photographs by Jock Sturges]]|publisher=Aperture|year=1994|ISBN=0-89381-595-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Mann]] was raised in rural Virginia, in a locale were [[Nude swimming|skinny-dipping]] in a river was common, so many of her most famous photographs are of her own children swimming in the nude.&lt;ref name="Mann1992"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Mann, Sally |author2=Price, Reynolds| title=Immediate family| publisher=Aperture| year=1992| ISBN=0-89381-523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children.&lt;ref name="Powell, Lynn 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell|first=Lynn|title=Framing Innocence: A Mother's Photographs, a Prosecutor's Zeal, and a Small Town's Response|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWshU7qUi-0C|publisher=The New Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59558-626-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body image]] has become a topic explored by many photographers working with models whose bodies do not conform to conventional prejudices about beauty.&lt;ref name="R.Michelson Galleries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmichelson.com/artist_pages/nimoy/pages/MaxBeaut.htm|title=Leonard Nimoy: The Full Body Project|publisher=R.Michelson Galleries|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Public perception===
At the beginning of the 21st century, it has become difficult to make an artistic statement in nude photography, given the proliferation of non-artistic and pornographic images which taints the subject in the perception of most viewers, limiting the opportunities to exhibit or publish the images. When they appear in mainstream consumer magazines such as ''[[Popular Photography]]'', ''PC Photo'', and ''[[Shutterbug (magazine)|Shutterbug]]''; the editors receive sufficient negative response that they tend to reject the work of serious nude-image photographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deitcher|first=Kenneth|year=2008|title=A Figure Study Workshop|journal=PSA Journal|volume=74|issue=3|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children as subjects===
Several photographers have become controversial because of their nude photographs of [[Minor (law)|underage]] subjects.&lt;ref name="Photo Flap"/&gt; [[David Hamilton (photographer)|David Hamilton]] often used erotic themes in books such as ''[[The Age of Innocence (Hamilton book)|The Age of Innocence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hamilton, David |title=[[The Age of Innocence (Hamilton book)|The Age of Innocence]]|publisher=Aurum Press|year=1995|ISBN=1-85410-304-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have caused controversy in both the US and the UK. [[Jock Sturges]] celebrates the beauty of people in [[Naturism|naturist]] settings&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock and Phillips, Jayne Anne 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock 1994"/&gt; and states that his work is not exploitative; however in 1990 the FBI raided his studio and made charges that were later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogallery.com/Sturges_Jock/sturges-bio.html|title=Jock Sturges Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo Lab Sets Off FBI Probe : Art: Jock Sturges' photographs of nude families are at issue|date=July 5, 1990|author=Harold Maass|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the local nature of US laws on the issue, books of both Hamilton's and Sturges' photos have been ruled obscene in the states of Alabama, South Carolina, and Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/08/news/mn-26778|title=Child Porn Fight Focuses on 2 Photographers' Books|date=March 8, 1998|author=J. R. Moehringer|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar controversy emerged in Australia in 2008 when photographs by [[Bill Henson]] were taken from an exhibit due to complaints regarding nudes of a thirteen-year-old girl, but no changes were proved.

[[Sally Mann]] was raised in rural Virginia, in a locale where [[Nude swimming|skinny-dipping]] in a river was common, so many of her most famous photographs are of her own children swimming in the nude.&lt;ref name="Mann1992" /&gt; Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children.&lt;ref name="Powell, Lynn 2010"/&gt; Some writers characterize many of these images as sexualizing children regardless of artistic merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexualizing Children: Thoughts on Sally Mann|first=Mary|last=Gordon|journal=Salmagundi|issue=111|year=1996|pages=144–145|publisher=Skidmore College|jstor=40535995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body image===
[[Body image]] has become a topic explored by many photographers working with models who do not conform to [[Norm (social)|conventional]] ideas about beauty. [[Leonard Nimoy]], after many years photographing conventionally beautiful professional models, realized that he was not capturing individual personalities, so he created a series with women interested in "[[Fat acceptance movement|Fat Liberation]]".&lt;ref name="R.Michelson Galleries"/&gt; Sally Mann's more recent nudes have been of her husband, whose body shows the effects of [[muscular dystrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sally Mann at Gagosian Gallery|last=Kuspit|first=Donald|journal=[[Artforum]]|volume=48|issue=5|date=Jan 2010|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic art===
Many contemporary artists push the boundaries by having work with both aesthetic qualities and [[Erotic photography|explicit sexuality]]. Late in his life [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] created work that was controversial in part by being on display in Washington, DC in a gallery receiving public funds.&lt;ref name="moral"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Art and the morality of the artist|last=Bernays|first=Anne|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=39|issue=20|date=Jan 20, 1993|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a Mapplethorpe retrospective opened at the Cincinnati [[Contemporary Arts Center]] in 1990, [[Dennis Barrie]] became the first American museum director to be criminally prosecuted for the contents of an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]]. Although explicit photos were placed in a separate room with a content warning, Barrie was charged with "pandering obscenity" and showing minors in a state of nudity, but a jury acquitted Barrie and the Arts Center of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ummsp.lsa.umich.edu/content/mapplethorpe-cincinnati-controversy-myth-and-legacy|title=Exhibiting Controversy: From Mapplethorpe to "Body Worlds" and Beyond|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=2013-05-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615164032/http://ummsp.lsa.umich.edu/content/mapplethorpe-cincinnati-controversy-myth-and-legacy|archivedate=2013-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
On the term "paraliterature", [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] commented that "it exists. What I'm saying is that I don't want to ''perpetuate'' this division. So I would always put it in quotes, or do something to show that I'm rejecting a word that I have to use".{{sfn|Le Guin|2008|p=110}}

[[Image:Pi Karlsplatz Pi.JPG| thumb | right | 300px | view the [[Pi|π circular number]] in the Vienna Opera House Passage]]
'''''Pi''''' is the name of a multimedia installation in the vicinity of the [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[Karlsplatz]]. ''Pi'' is located in the [[Opernpassage]] between the entrance to the [[Vienna U-Bahn|subway]] and the subway stop in [[Vienna Secession|Secession]] near the [[Naschmarkt]]. The individual behind the project was the [[Canada|Canadian]] artist [[Ken Lum]] from [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref name="public-art-vienna"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken Lum: Pi|url=http://www.publicartvienna.at/files_e/7.html|website=publicartvienna.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pi'', under construction from January 2005 to November 2006 and opened in December 2006, consists of statistical information and a representation of [[Pi|π]] to 478 decimal places. A more recent project is the calculation of the decimal places of π, indicating the importance of the eponymous media for installation of their number and infinity.

The exhibit is 130 meters long. In addition to the number pi, there is a total of 16 ''factoids'' of reflective display cases that convey a variety of statistical data in real time.&lt;ref name="public-art-vienna" /&gt; Apart from the [[World population]] there are also topics such as the worldwide number of [[malnutrition|malnourished]] children and the growth of [[Sahara]] since the beginning of the year. Even less serious issues such as the number of eaten [[Wiener Schnitzel]]s in Vienna of the given year and the current number of lovers in Vienna are represented.

In the middle of the passage standing there is a glass case with images, texts and books on the subjects of [[population]] and [[Animal migration|migration]].

The scientific data were developed jointly by Ken Lum and the {{ill|SORA Institute for Social Research and Consulting|de|lt=SORA Institute}}. "Pi" is to show that contemporary art is in a position to connect [[art]] to [[science]], [[architecture]] and [[sociology]]. The aim of this project was to transform the Karlsplatz into a "vibrant place to meet, with communicative artistic brilliance."

'''''Pure Pwnage''''' (pronounced "pure ownage")&lt;ref name="pwn"&gt;The word "pwnage" can be pronounced several different ways. The show's creators pronounce it "ownage". Jeremy justifies this pronunciation with the following statements: "When people say [[Pwn|{{IPA|/ˈpoʊn/}}]], they sound like a complete fag, and I'm not cool with being a fag, so I pronounce it {{IPA|/ˈoʊn/}}." {{" '}}Pwn' was originally a typo of 'own', because the 'P' is near the 'O' on the keyboard. The person is still trying to say 'own'." [TeamSpeak chat, December 13, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;
was a Canadian [[web series|Internet-distributed]], [[mockumentary]] series from ROFLMAO Productions.  The fictional series purports to chronicle the life and adventures of Jeremy (played by Jarett Cale), a [[Canadians|Canadian]] and self-proclaimed "[[pro gamer]]".  In 2010, an adaptation of the web series began airing on [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]], a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[cable television]] [[specialty channel|channel]], but the series failed to be picked up for a second season.

== Premise ==
Jeremy (played by Jarett Cale) also known as "teh_pwnerer" is extremely proficient at [[video games]] but inexperienced when it comes to [[Norm (sociology)|normal social interactions]].  Jeremy is only interested in "[[pwn]]ing [[noob|n00bs]]" and making it as a [[pro gamer]] and often comes off as lazy and narcissistic to other people.  Kyle (played by Geoff Lapaire) is Jeremy's brother and an aspiring film-maker.  Kyle decides to film a documentary of Jeremy's exploits as a [[gamer]] and his interactions with the gaming and non-gaming world. In 2012, it was announced that the crew are making a Pure Pwnage film with funding by their fans.

== History ==
''Pure Pwnage'' was created by Geoff Lapaire and Jarett Cale who also play the show's main protagonists.  Originating in 2004, eighteen Internet-distributed episodes of the series have been released to date. In 2007, the series creators estimated their current viewer base to be over three million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Infancy of Internet Television | author = Geoff Lapaire | publisher = Pure Pwnage | url = http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=19150 | accessdate = 2007-11-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215065150/http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=19150 | archivedate = 2007-12-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is filmed primarily in [[Toronto]], Ontario, but has also included scenes filmed in [[Calgary]], Alberta; [[Montreal]], Quebec; [[Aurora, Ontario]]; [[Hamilton, Ontario]]; and the [[Netherlands]].

During an interview, director Geoff Lapaire (although as "Kyle"; Lapaire maintained his "Kyle" identity among fans and media) insisted that all of the characters on the show are not acting.&lt;ref name="teamspeak"&gt;Starting with Episode 8, the ''Pure Pwnage'' cast and crew hold a public [[TeamSpeak]] interview soon after the release of each episode, revealing many details about the show and the personalities involved in its creation. The recordings of each episode are linked in a [http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=54783 post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010003/http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=54783 |date=2007-09-27 }} on the forums.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the personalities on ''Pure Pwnage'' display their true-to-life abilities and eccentricities, and the characters took great pains to maintain that the ''Pure Pwnage'' world is simply an extension of the real world. Lapaire has finally admitted that they are in fact actors. The sixth fanchat with the crew was out-of-character, where the fact that the characters within ''Pure Pwnage'' are exaggerated versions of the actors was confirmed.

On August 6, 2009, it was announced that a ''Pure Pwnage'' TV series had been commissioned by [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV6cjKxZFOM&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the announcement, many members of the ''Pure Pwnage'' fan community raised concerns. The main complaints were that the series was only announced to be airing in Canada, and the assumption that it would be changed in order to appeal to viewers not familiar with [[internet culture]]. Jarett Cale, who writes the show and plays Jeremy, tried to quell the complaints on the ''Pure Pwnage'' forums, saying "We're doing our best to get it broadcast in the USA, UK, Australia, etc., but it's really up to each country's respective broadcasters. ''[...]'' Geoff and I are still the main creative force&amp;nbsp;– we're producers and writers. We've also brought on many new people with experience in traditional television to help us out both story-wise and production-wise. FPS Doug will still be there, and he will still be played by Joel Gardiner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=92459&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1770140 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' forum post |last=Cale |first=Jarett |date=2009-08-06 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054549/http://purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s= |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a user asking if the TV series meant there would be no more web episodes, he said "Nope, it only means there's a new TV series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=92541&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1772872 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' forum post |last=Cale |first=Jarett |date=2008-08-10 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054549/http://purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s= |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the future of the web series was uncertain. Geoff Lapaire, director of all previous episodes of ''Pure Pwnage'', left the show in September 2008 to focus on the then-unannounced TV series, and Troy Dixon, who played T-Bag in the series, died in a car accident on December 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=84552&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1600457 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' forum post |date=2008-12-09 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054549/http://purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s= |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarett Cale announced in January 2009 that work on the next web episode had begun, with him as the director, however the episode has not been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=86392 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' news post |last=Cale |first=Jarett |date=2009-01-27 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720025702/http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=86392 |archivedate=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short Livestream cast on March 15, 2010, a user posted a comment regarding the web series and Jarett replied that the web series is back in production and is in progress. He has not given out an ETA.

On January 19, 2011, Jarett made an announcement on the Pure Pwnage forums that the TV series had not been picked up for a second season. Additionally, the web series has been put on indefinite hold. In his own words, "My hope that Pure Pwnage will see a proper ending to its illustrious web series has nearly vanished. I've let Geoff know that should he be willing at any time to resume some of his traditional, critical roles on the web series I will fly home to Toronto in a heartbeat to help make it happen."

On September 18, 2012 The Pure Pwnage YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "010100100100010101010100010101010101001001001110" which is a binary encoding of the word "Return", signalling the return of the Pure Pwnage.

==Pure Pwnage Teh Movie==
On September 19, 2012, an official [[crowd funding]] campaign was announced to aid in the funding of a Pure Pwnage movie.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiegogo.com/purepwnage&lt;/ref&gt; The $75,000 goal was raised in just over 24 hours, due to overwhelming support from fans all over the world. At the end of the campaign, a total of $211,300 was raised.

On November 22, 2015, the official trailer was released. The movie premiered in Toronto on January 23, 2016 at the Bloor Cinema. Further screenings took place around the US and in the UK.

On May 7, 2016, Pure Pwnage Teh Movie was released for streaming and digital download via Vimeo.

=== Reception and awards ===
Pure Pwnage Teh Movie received the Canadian Comedy Awards 2016 award for best feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canadiancomedyawards.org/awards.php|title=Awards {{!}} Canadian Comedy Awards|website=canadiancomedyawards.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was well-received by general audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lapaire|first=Geoff|title=Pure Pwnage|date=2016-02-03|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4682866/|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spin-offs ==

=== TV series ===
On August 6, 2009, it was announced that a ''Pure Pwnage'' TV series had been commissioned by [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=92459|title=Pure Pwnage announcement: "Project X Revealed"|publisher=ROFLMAO Productions|accessdate=2009-08-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811220757/http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=92459|archivedate=2009-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made in the form of a mini-episode where Kyle tries to convince Jeremy to stop playing on his [[Nintendo DS Lite]] and make the announcement. The series had been teased for several months under the name "Project X". The TV series premiered on [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] March 12, 2010, and premiered on Australia's [[ABC2]] on October 4, 2010. According to creator Jarett Cale, the TV series itself takes place in a fictional world within the Pure Pwnage universe (webseries) where Kyle ironically got a TV series, thus explaining the lack of consistency between shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc2/201010/programs/ZX1389A001D2010-10-04T210600.htm?program=Pure%20Pwnage|title=Pure Pwnage - Life Of A Pro Gamer|accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jeremy's Mail Sac ===
Starting in March 2010, the ''Pure Pwnage'' website began letting fans send Jeremy questions via e-mail.  Jeremy then answered the fan questions in video segments posted on the website titled, ''Jeremy's Mail Sac''.

=== Pro at Cooking ===
{{Main|Pro at Cooking}}
Starring Dave (Dawei) as himself, ''Pro at Cooking'' is a spin-off of ''Pure Pwnage''. A cooking show for gamers with Dave hosting as the main chef. When his female assistants do not perform as expected, Dave constantly fires each one of them usually after every episode. Directed by Davin, it has only aired seven 5- to 10-minute episodes. No other characters from ''Pure Pwnage'', excluding Dave, Davin, and Geoff, appear on the show.

=== ''Pure Pwnage: The Comic'' ===
From February 28, 2006 to March 7, 2007, the ''Pure Pwnage'' website featured a regularly issued comic, of which a new page was released once every two to three weeks. Apparently set in the "real world" rather than in the fictional world of ''Pure Pwnage'', the comic breaks most of the [[fourth wall]] of the show. For example, Dave said in the show that he was leaving it due to unfinished business in China, the comic claims that the real reason was that he had found a new job in [[Vancouver]].

However, both the show and comic clearly contain elements that are either symbolic representations of reality (for example, [[pwn]]ing an opponent with "micro balls" as a possible metaphor for pwning them in an actual video game) or are not based in reality whatsoever.

=== Pure Pwnage: Teh Movie ===
In September 2012, series creators Jarett Cale and Geoff Lapaire announced an indiegogo campaign to raise funds for a Pure Pwnage feature-length film. Within 24 hours of the campaign being launched, the project had received their goal of $75,000, and by the end of the campaign, they had reached a total of $211,300. Despite this being a relatively small film budget, Jarett Cale and Geoff Lapaire have said that with their experience of making the web series with an extremely limited amount of funds, they are confident that they would be able to make a quality film shot in countries across the world, mentioning hopes of filming in South Korea. Pre-production began in earnest in early 2013, with weekly twitch.tv livestreams in which Lapaire, Cale, and guests such as Joel Gardiner (fps_doug) and Miranda Plant (Tagi) discuss the film and interact with fans.

The film premiered on January 23, 2016, in Toronto, Ontario. Following this, Cale and Lapaire took the film to the road, screening the project around the world in a touring limited release.

On May 7, 2016, Pure Pwnage Teh Movie was released for streaming and digital download on Vimeo.

Rahva Raamat is the largest retail and wholesale bookseller in [[Estonia]]. It has 10 bookstores in 7 cities and also sells to most other bookstores, supermarkets and libraries in Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rahvaraamat.ee/t/rahvaraamatust/en|title=About Rahva Raamat {{!}} Rahva Raamat|website=www.rahvaraamat.ee|language=en|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rahva Raamat in Viru Keskus was shortlisted in [[London Book Fair]] Bookstore of the Year award in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.readings.com.au/news/readings-wins-bookstore-of-the-year-award-at-london-book-fair|title=Readings wins Bookstore of the Year Award at London Book Fair|website=www.readings.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahva Raamat has 4 locations in [[Tallinn]], one in [[Tartu]], [[Pärnu]], [[Viljandi]], [[Kuressaare]], [[Rakvere]] and [[Narva]].

== History ==

Rahva Raamat was founded in 1912, when Estonian publisher Gustav Pihlakas opened his bookstore in Pärnu mnt 10, a newly designed house by respected Finnish-American architect [[Eliel Saarinen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kul.ee/en/organisation/building-and-history|title=Building and history {{!}} Ministry of Culture|website=www.kul.ee|language=en|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has always been a bookstore in the same premises.

In October 2002 Rahva Raamat in Pärnu mnt 10 in Tallinn was in danger of being closed down. Hundreds of protesters appeared on the street, which helped the oldest bookstore in Estonia to stay open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maaleht.delfi.ee/news/maaleht/elu/rahva-raamat-muinsuskaitse-alla?id=65398118|title=Rahva Raamat muinsuskaitse alla!|date=1355656802|website=Maaleht|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Supplément au voyage de Bougainville, ou dialogue entre A et B sur l'inconvénient d'attacher des idées morales à certaines actions physiques qui n'en comportent pas.''''' ("''Addendum to the Journey of Bougainville, or dialogue between A and B on the drawback to binding moral ideas to certain physical actions which bear none''") is a set of philosophical dialogues written by [[Denis Diderot]], inspired by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]'s ''[[Voyage autour du monde]]''. It was written in 1772 for the journal ''[[Correspondance littéraire]]'', which commissioned him to review Bougainville's account of his travels, but not published until 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Wikisourcelang|fr|Supplément au voyage de Bougainville&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Bougainville, a contemporary of Diderot, was a French [[exploration|explorer]] whose 1771 book ''Voyage autour du monde'' (''A Voyage Around the World'') provided an account of an expedition that took him to [[Argentina]], [[Patagonia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Tahiti]]. It was the [[utopia]]n descriptions of the latter that inspired Diderot to write his review in the form of a fictional ''Supplement''.

==Structure==

The ''Supplement'' spans either four or five chapters, depending on the edition.&lt;ref name="mcdonald 1976"&gt;McDonald, Christie V. (1976). The Reading and Writing of Utopia in Denis Diderot's "Supplement au voyage de Bougainville". ''Science Fiction Studies, 3''(3): 248-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Each takes the form of a dialogue between two people, but the characters and setting varies. Chapter two features a Tahitian Elder addressing a hypothetical Bougainville; chapters three and four are between a villager named Orou and his European [[almoner]] guest; in chapters one and five, speakers known only as "A" and "B" speak in a literary space apart from Tahiti, commenting on and drawing lessons from the noted differences between Tahitian and European culture.

In each of the dialogues, Diderot aligns one character with European culture and the other with Tahitian culture for the purpose of contrasting the two. This kind of [[nature–culture divide]] was a common strategy to critique aspects of European culture during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="mcdonald 2000"&gt;Ansart, Guillaume. (2000). Aspects of Rationality in Diderot's "Supplement au voyage de Bougainville". ''Diderot Studies, 26'': 11-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Diderot touches upon many popular Enlightenment themes, for example: [[slavery]], [[colonisation]], the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] faith, the relationship between [[morality]] and [[law]], ownership of [[private property]] and human sexuality.   

Two main areas of life arise from Diderot's "Supplement to Bougainville's Voyage" and oppose one another. First Diderot dissects Tahitian society and then compares it to an eighteenth-century French society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Dena|date=1983|title=The Structure of Political Argument in Diderot's Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40372573|journal=Diderot Studies|volume=21|pages=123–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The themes that stem from the comparison deal with the nature of man and the nature of what is known to be an advanced society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald|first=Christie V.|date=1976|title=The Reading and Writing of Utopia in Denis Diderot's "Supplément au voyage de Bougainville"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4239040|journal=Science Fiction Studies|volume=3|issue=3|pages=248–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing these two societies, Diderot is able to produce moral statements about the way that people live. The issue of morality is one of Diderot's major themes. From morality Diderot moves to other themes of ownership and private property, specifically through marriage. Both societies seem extremely foreign to one another and think that each are better, but in reality they are just different.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Theme of Sexuality in ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''[edit] ===
[[File:Paul Gauguin - Two Tahitian Women.jpg|thumb|''[[Two Tahitian Women]]'', 1899, [[Paul Gauguin]]]]

==== Origins[edit] ====
Because of his study of nature and the advancements in life sciences, [[Denis Diderot]] came to the conclusion that universal progress depends largely on Eros.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Alice|date=1986|title=Did/erotica: Diderot's Contribution to the History of Sexuality|url=|journal=Diderot Studies|volume=22|pages=89-106|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Diderot, [[Eros]] is “a priori existence of sexual energy that fuels the universe.”  This concept greatly influenced Diderot’s views on human sexuality.  His involvement in Enlightenment movements such as [[sensualism]], [[vitalism]] and [[materialism]] also helped him developed his ideas about human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He believed that nature had a moral end and encourages humans to have children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since nature favors procreation, laws and rules should not restrain the sexuality of men and women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   Since 18th century French society had many rules controlling people’s sexuality, Diderot believed that French society is not a suitable place for Eros because of its “artificiality and formalism.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For Claudia Moscovici, Diderot’s critique of 18th century French society, especially its rules controlling human sexuality, can especially be seen in the ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moscovici|first=Claudia|date=2001|title=An Ethics of Cultural Exchange: Diderot's Supplement au Voyage de Bougainville|url=|journal=Clio|volume=30|pages=289-307|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diderot’s Views on Human Sexuality[edit] ====
Diderot’s views on sexuality is contained in the ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''. In the book, Diderot uses a dialogue between Orou, a Tahitian man, and a chaplain in order to contrast the French and Tahitian societies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Double Dialectics: Between Universalism and Relativism in Enlightenment and Postmodern Thought|last=Moscovici|first=Claudia|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2002|isbn=|location=United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tahitian people are governed by nature and portrayed as happy and content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They also have less restrictions on their sexual conduct because men and women are not obligated to marry before having a child together.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  People can have sex with the opposite gender in order to procreate, which is nature’s intended purpose for humans.  In Tahiti, women are not considered property of any man and are not ridiculed for having a child before marriage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Claudia Moscovici argues that Diderot uses the Tahitian society to criticize the laws and norms regarding sexual behavior in 18th century French society and Western culture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Unlike the Tahitians, the French are governed by laws and convention.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  They had more restrictions on the sexual behavior of men and women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For instance, it was unacceptable to have a child with someone without being married in French society.  Once married, [[Women in France|family life]] for women was very constraining.  French women did not have much freedom to pursue jobs outside of the home and was considered the property of their husband. In this way, Claudia Moscovici argues that Diderot believed that marriage controlled human sexuality because women and men were bound to one another, prohibiting them from having children with others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For Alice Parker, Diderot also believed this idea because French women were no longer free to satisfy their own desires, especially sexual ones, and had to adhere to the commands of their  “bourgeois patriarchs.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Diderot’s Contradictory Views on Sexuality[edit] ====
While Diderot suggests that women should be liberated and not be property of men in ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville'', Walter E. Rex argues that Diderot contradicts himself when he writes a letter to Angelique, his daughter, on her wedding day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rex|first=Walter E.|date=1998|title=Contrariety in the" Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville|url=|journal=Diderot Studies|volume=27|pages=149-168|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this letter, Diderot discusses how his daughter should act once she is married to her husband.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Instead of reiterating that she is not the property of her husband, he tells her, in a sense, she is her husband’s property.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He asserts that a wife should obey and give pleasure to her husband.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  She should respect him at all times and keep him entertained in order to guarantee that he will not leave her.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Diderot even says that her whole existence is to ensure that her husband is satisfied.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In this way, according to Rex, Angelique does not have the same amount of sexual liberation as the Tahitians in Diderot’s ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Rex argues this idea because Diderot did not give Angelique the ability to act on her own accord but rather, dictated that her actions must conform to her husband’s wishes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  She was not free to act on her own natural instincts, especially those of the sexual kind.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Rex articulates that Diderot controlled his daughter's sexuality, which is contrary to the sexual liberation displayed in the Tahitian lifestyle in ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Walter E. Rex argues that the contradiction occurred because Diderot’s enthrallment with the expedition accounts of Bougainville caused him to overlook the fact that his views on human sexuality contained in the letter to his daughter was different than those explained in ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7522">'''Temporary Services''' is an [[art group]] of three people based in [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] (USA), and [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. Temporary Services has created art projects, public events, publications, and exhibitions since 1998.

On their web site, they state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We champion public projects that are temporary, ephemeral, or that operate outside of conventional or officially sanctioned categories of public expression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Temporary Services states a desire to not preference any type of activity or object as art, or any audience.  They also work against the constructed link between aesthetics and ethics. They view art as activism, and carry on the traditions of [[Situationist International|situationism]].

Temporary services became an [[Artadia]] awardee in the 2004 Chicago cycle.

==Prisoners' Inventions==

A project between the Temporary Services and an incarcerated artist [[Angelo]].  Angelo produced a large body of work documenting in detail the inventions created by prisoners in the United States.

''Prisoners' Inventions'' is a book,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==The Library Project==

The [[Harold Washington Library Center]] in [[Chicago]] was the location for one of Temporary Services' projects.  The group surreptitiously added over 150 books designed by artists and others into the library's collection.  The books are provided with all the same due dates, reference stickers purchased from the same provider used by the library itself.

This project was executed without any permission or input from the Chicago Public Library system. It was an effort to explore the boundaries of archival systems and make library patrons and library staff alike reexamine the notion of where books are categorized and placed in the library. Many books by artists are placed in the library's art reference area by default.

One book by artist and geographer [[Trevor Paglen]] contained a small motion detector to make sounds when a person walks by, effectively serving as a ghost book.  Artists Rob Kelly and Zena Sakowski produced three books which folded out into a jacket, a pair of pants, and a balaclava. Books were also placed in the library by other writers, artists, and activist groups. Many of the books were eventually "accepted" by the library and re-categorized. They were given official library codes and placed into the library's system. Many of the books simply disappeared from the shelves after a few months.

==Public Sculpture Opinion Poll==

Public spaces are meeting points for both the powerful and the powerless.  Governments or businesses select art pieces to be shown in public spaces and the public's response is generally one of passive gossip or direct attack.

The ''[[Public art|Public Sculpture]] [[Opinion Poll]]'' was a direct inquiry into the placement of one sculpture in Chicago at the intersection of Grand and Western Avenues. The sculpture, a large configuration of welded [[utility pole]]s and paint, was officially "donated" to the city of Chicago by a neighborhood [[Chamber of Commerce]] masquerading as a neighborhood community group.

Temporary Services started a public dialogue about the sculpture—why and how did it get there? Clipboards were hung at each corner of the busy intersection, with pens and pieces of paper. The paper had the question "What do you think of this sculpture and why do you think it was placed in this neighborhood?" on the top, along with three small photos of the sculpture itself printed along the bottom.

Members of Temporary Services returned to the clipboard sites twice daily for six weeks, collecting responses and replenishing the clipboards with more printed pages and pens. After the end of six weeks, over 1000 responses were collected ... positive, negative, and all over the place. The responses were then compiled into a booklet and traveling exhibition which has been shared with the City of Chicago's Department of Public Art as a more democratic and populist option for gathering opinions about public space.

==Networking==

Temporary Services through their art pages, community sites, blogs, and extensive network aim to provide a network for the collection and distribution of artistic work going on looking at the line between art and ethics, power and art, and the role of the public.  The critical place of the public, generally dismissed in modernist and post-modernist art, is central to their work which aims at creating projects that undermine conventional politics of art.

'''''The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made'''''&lt;!--This is the title as written on the cover and inside, as well as in book listings online. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE IT WITHOUT A REASON.--&gt; is a  2013 [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Greg Sestero]] and [[Tom Bissell]]. Sestero details the troubled development and production of the 2003 cult film ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]],'' his own struggles as a young actor, and his relationship with ''Room'' director [[Tommy Wiseau]].&lt;ref name=LAT1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruland|first1=Jim|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-greg-sestero-tom-bissell-20130929-story.html|title=Worst movie ever? 'The Disaster Artist' explores 'The Room'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017|date=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, a [[The Disaster Artist (film)|film adaptation of the same name]] was released, directed and produced by and starring [[James Franco]] as Wiseau, with his brother and co-producer [[Dave Franco]] in the role of Sestero.

==Synopsis==
Sestero, an aspiring actor struggling with confidence, first encounters Wiseau in an acting class. Sestero is at first perplexed by Wiseau's over-the-top acting technique, his unusual physical appearance, his unidentifiable accent and his eccentric behavior, which includes a fascination with all things American and a refusal to discuss his past. At the same time, Sestero admires Wiseau's boldness and his genuine enthusiasm for both life and acting. The two form an odd but affectionate bond as Sestero begins to learn of the many contradictions of Wiseau's personality.

As Sestero slowly accrues more acting credits and makes other friends, Wiseau grows jealous and schemes to earn similar acknowledgement (such as earning a [[SAG card]] by producing and starring in a commercial for a company he himself owned), leading Sestero to become uncomfortable with their relationship. After viewing ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' for the first time, Sestero is struck by how similar Wiseau is to the title character and convinces him to see the film. However, instead of recognizing his own behavior, Wiseau is deeply impressed by the performance and becomes obsessed with creating a movie just as emotionally powerful. The result is the screenplay for ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'', which includes a character, Mark, named after actor [[Matt Damon]] (whose name Wiseau had misheard).

Backed by a seemingly endless, mysterious supply of money, Wiseau develops, produces, directs and stars in ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'', despite having no knowledge of filmmaking. On-set relationships are a disaster: the story itself is nonsensical and full of plot threads that are never addressed or resolved (a matter complicated by Wiseau refusing to give anyone a full copy of the script); Wiseau's camera set-up requires two full crews to operate, actors and crew storm off the set, scripts are rewritten in the middle of scenes, sets are broken down only to be rebuilt and re-shot the following day, and at the last possible moment, Wiseau convinces Sestero to join the crew as one of the principal actors, in spite of the role already having been cast. By the end of shooting, the cast and crew, convinced that the film will never be seen, lose their enthusiasm, resulting in lackluster performances and technical blunders that are never corrected.

Sestero screens a rough cut of the film for his friends and family, who are enthralled by its bizarre ineptitude. Their reaction turns out to be prophetic when, eight months later, Wiseau secures a release for the film, beginning its cult reputation as "the ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of [[list of films considered the worst|bad movies]]". The book ends with Sestero's meditation on the power—and danger—of unconditional belief in one's dreams.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|The Disaster Artist (film)}}
A film adaptation [[The Disaster Artist (film)|of the same name]], directed and co-produced by and starring [[James Franco]] as Wiseau and [[Dave Franco]] as Sestero, premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 12, 2017, and was released in the United States on December 1, 2017.

==Audiobook==
In May 2014, an [[audiobook]] version of ''The Disaster Artist'' was released by [[Tantor Audio]], with Sestero reading the story. Sestero's impression of Wiseau in the audiobook has received praise from critics, including ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and [[Publishers Weekly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartsell|first1=Carol|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/27/greg-sestero-tommy-wiseau-impression_n_5399103.html|title=Listen To Greg Sestero's Awesome Tommy Wiseau Impression In This 'Disaster Artist' Audioclip|work=[[HuffPost]]|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Disaster Artist'' audiobook was named a finalist for the 2015 [[Audie Awards]] for Best Humor Audiobook.&lt;ref name="audie"&gt;{{cite web|title=20th Annual Audie finalists announced in thirty categories|url=https://www.audiopub.org/uploads/pdf/2015_Audie_Awards_Release.pdf|publisher=[[Audio Publishers Association]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017|date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In March 2014, ''The Disaster Artist'' (Audiobook) won for ''Favorite Non-Fiction Book of 2013'' at [[Bookish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallucci|first1=Kelly|title=Oscar-Style Nominations For Our Favorite Books of 2013|url=https://www.bookish.com/articles/oscar-style-nominations-for-our-favorite-books-of-2013/|publisher=[[Bookish]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017|date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2014, ''The Disaster Artist'' won for Best Non-Fiction at the National Arts &amp; Entertainment Journalism Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The judges praised the book, stating "''The Disaster Artist'' is not only a hell of a good read, it will make a great film if ever adapted. It's equal parts ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', ''[[American Hustle]]'' and demented ''[[Citizen Kane]]''—with a dash of [[Monty Python]] thrown into the mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Winners - 7th National Arts &amp; Entertainment Journalism Awards|url=http://lapressclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2014-National-Arts-Entertainment-Journalism-Award-Winners.pdf|publisher=[[Los Angeles Press Club]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2015, ''The Disaster Artist'' (Audiobook)  was nominated for Best Humor Audiobook at the [[Audie Award]]s, and was narrated by author [[Greg Sestero]]. The awards ceremony was held May 28, 2015 in New York City.&lt;ref name="audie"/&gt;

On January 23, 2018 ''The Disaster Artist'' was nominated for [[Best Adapted Screenplay]] at the 90th Oscars.

[[File:Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema - The finding of Moses.jpg|thumb|500px|Lawrence Alma-Tadema, ''The Finding of Moses'', 1904, {{convert|136.7|xx| 213.4|cm}}.]]

'''''The Finding of Moses''''' is a 1904 painting by the Anglo-Dutch artist [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].  It was one of his last major works before his death in 1912, but quickly fell out of favour; according to rumour, it was sold in the 1950s for its frame.  After appreciation of [[Victorian painting]] was renewed towards the end of the 20th century, it was described in an auction catalogue in 1995 as "the undisputed masterpiece of [Alma-Tadema's] last decade, as well as a late (perhaps the final?) flowering of the nineteenth-century's love-affair with Egypt".  It was sold to a private collector at auction in 2010 for nearly US$36 million.

The [[Finding of Moses]] had been a popular subject for paintings since the Renaissance, with a revival in the 19th century by [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] artists keen to add authentic archaeological decor to their depictions.

==Background==
The painting was commissioned by [[Sir John Aird, 1st Baronet]] for 5,000 guineas, plus expenses.  Aird's civil engineering business, [[John Aird &amp; Co.]], was responsible for building the first [[Aswan Low Dam|Aswan Dam]].  Aird invited Alma-Tadema to visit Egypt for the opening of the dam in December 1902, and commissioned him to paint a suitable subject to add to Aird's large collection of academic paintings by the likes of [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederic Leighton]], [[Edward Poynter]], and [[John William Waterhouse]], including Alma-Tadema's 1888 work ''[[The Roses of Heliogabalus]]''.   The commission allowed Alma-Tadema to revisit Egyptian themes from his works in the 1860s.

==Description==
The work is a [[Bible|Biblical]] scene based on chapter 2, verse 6 of the [[Book of Exodus]], in which [[Bithiah|Pharaoh's daughter]] comes to wash in the [[River Nile]], and finds the infant [[Moses]] abandoned in a basket in the reeds.  The painting depicts the scene after the infant has been discovered, showing a procession travelling back to the daughter's abode in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the capital of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]].  The [[Finding of Moses]] had been a popular scene for painters, especially since the Late Renaissance.

Shaven-headed male attendant in white loincloths carry Pharaoh's daughter in an elaborately decorated chair.  She wears a pink diaphanous gown and elaborate jewellery, and holds a flail in her left hand, a symbol of royalty; in her right hand, she holds a [[Nymphaea lotus|lotus flower]].  The style and decoration of her chair is informed by illustrations of Egyptian tomb paintings. Her feet rest on a footstool decorated with bound captives &amp;mdash; another symbol of royalty &amp;mdash; and also referring to the enslaved Israelites.  [[Hieroglyphic]] [[cartouche]]s identify her as the daughter of [[Ramesses II]].  It has been claimed that one of Alma-Tadema's daughters sat as the model for Pharaoh's daughter.  Two male attendants wave ostrich feather fans, while two female attendants carry Moses in his cradle alongside.  The cradle has been decorated with lotus flowers, tied on with a pink ribbon.  Another female attendant plays a stringed instrument.

The painting is composed like a frieze, with bright blues and purples of [[delphinium]]s in the foregrounds; the procession passing behind; a space for the river; and then, in the background, on the other bank of the river, teams of slaves can be seen labouring under their dark-skinned overseers, possibly working on the pyramids at [[Giza]] on the opposite bank.  The blues of the flowers are echoed by the [[lapis lazuli]] inlay of the chair, but contrast with yellows, oranges, reds and pinks.

The plinth and feet of a red granite statue are just visible to the front left, possibly copied from a statue of [[Seti II]] in the [[British Museum]].  The plinth bears more hieroglyphics, reading "Beloved of Ra, King of Upper and Lower Egypt,"

==Reception==
Alma-Tadema worked on the painting for two years. King [[Edward VII]] visited Alma-Tadema in his studio while the work was being completed. By the time it was finished, his wife wryly quipped that the infant Moses would now be "two years old, and need no longer be carried".

The painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1905; the same year, Alma-Tadema became one of the first 18 members of the [[Order of Merit]].  The work was received with warm but not enthusiastic praise.

Alma-Tadema's works fell dramatically out of favour after his death in 1912, but provided inspiration for the set designers of Biblical epics such as [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), and [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[Cleopatra (1934 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1934) and ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956) (in 1968 [[Mario Amaya]] published an article in ''The Sunday Times'' entitled "The Painter who Inspired Hollywood").

After Aird's death in 1911, the painting was inherited by his son Sir [[John Richard Aird, 2nd Baronet]], and then following his death in 1934 it was sold by his son [[Sir John Renton Aird, 3rd Baronet]] at [[Christie's]] in London in May 1935, and acquired by an art dealer for 820 guineas.  The painting was sold to [[Sir Jeremiah Colman, 1st Baronet]], and then after his death in January 1942 it was auctioned at Christie's in September 1942, acquired by a different dealer for 260 guineas.  It was sold to F. W. Reeves of Wolverhampton, and then sold at a country auction in September 1950, and acquired by London dealer Newman.

In a widely reported, but probably apocryphal, story, the painting was reputedly sold to an English couple for a small sum.  They had no interest in the unfashionable painting, buying the work for the frame, by [[Thomas Maw]]: after leaving the dealers, they removed the painting from its frame, and the artwork was found minutes later abandoned in an alley in [[St James's]] near the gallery.   Bernard Hart, a director of Newman's at the time, wrote to ''The Times'' to dispute the story: in his account, more prosaically, the gallery failed to find a museum willing to take the picture, even as a gift, and it remained unsold when sent to Christie's by Newman's in December 1960.  It was "bought in" by the auction house, and eventually acquired to decorate the walls of the [[Clock House Restaurant]] near [[Welwyn]] in Hertfordshire.

The painting was sold to the London art dealers in July 1967, and sold on to [[Ira Spanierman]] Galleries in New York shortly afterwards for $8,500; in turn, they sold it on to [[Allen Funt]] for $25,000.  Funt was the producer of ''[[Candid Camera]]'', and a collector  of Alma-Tadema's at a time when his works remained deeply unfashionable.  The painting was included in an exhibition at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York in March and April 1973, entitled "Victorians in Togas". After Funt experienced financial troubles, he sold the painting along with the rest of his collection at [[Sotheby's]] in London in November 1973, for around $72,000.  Reportedly, he kept the original frames and put in photos of the paintings that he had sold.

The painting was bought by a private collector, and then sold to another private collector at Christie's in New York in May 1995 for US$2,752,500, before being sold again at Sotheby's for US$35,922,500 (including [[buyer's premium]]) in November 2010.

'''''The Flageolet Player on the Cliff''''' is an 1889 [[oil painting]] by [[France|French]] artist [[Paul Gauguin]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It depicts a [[Breton people|Breton]] couple on a narrow path precipitously overlooking the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''The Flageolet Player on the Cliff'' is a panoramic view of a rugged patch of shoreline in [[Brittany]], viewed from a dizzying overhead perspective. The unusual point of view and brilliant patchwork of colors make the painting somewhat challenging visually, but it is not an inaccurate representation of the scene. Period photographs show similar wave patterns, and Gauguin wrote that the sand was rose, rather than yellow. On a narrow path stand a boy and girl; she holds a scythe for cutting the wheat represented by the patch of yellow in the lower right corner, while he plays a [[flageolet]], a local flute. These attributes, scythe and flute, represent Gauguin's enduring attachment to "the harmonies of Breton life."&lt;ref name=ima/&gt; The lower right corner is signed "P. Gauguin 89."

==Historical information==
In 1889, Gauguin traveled to [[Le Pouldu]], a remote coastal village in Brittany. Its dramatic scenery evoked a strong response in him. Applying the [[Pont-Aven School]] approach called [[Synthetism]], he merged the actual appearance of the scene, his emotional reaction to it, and his artistic sense of design.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

===Acquisition===
''The Flageolet Player on the Cliff'' was acquired in 1998 as part of a collection of Gauguin and his [[Pont-Aven]] coterie. Samuel Josefowitz, a Swiss collector, amassed the 17 paintings and 84 prints, worth an estimated $30 million. $20 million of that came courtesy of a challenge grant from the [[Lilly Endowment]]. The remainder was raised by the IMA, with an undisclosed amount being given by Josefowitz himself, a museum trustee. He acquired the Pont-Aven collection in the 1950s and '60s, before that period's importance in Gauguin's development was fully appreciated.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith H.|title=Indianapolis Museum Buys 30 Gauguins From Swiss Collector|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/18/arts/indianapolis-museum-buys-30-gauguins-from-swiss-collector.html|accessdate=17 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=18 Nov 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular painting hangs in the Jane H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8785">'''The Mbari Club''' was a centre for cultural activity by African writers, artists and musicians that was founded in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]], in 1961 by [[Ulli Beier]], with the involvement of a group of young writers including [[Wole Soyinka]] and [[Chinua Achebe]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8508079/Ulli-Beier.html "Ulli Beier" (obituary)], ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 11 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mbari-Mbayo-Club "Mbari Mbayo Club"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mbari (art)|Mbari]]'', an [[Igbo language|Igbo]] concept related to "creation", was suggested as the name by Achebe.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; Among other Mbari members were [[Christopher Okigbo]], [[J.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in an obituary of Beier noted that "the Mbari Club became synonymous with the optimism and creative exuberance of Africa’s post-independence era. [[Fela Kuti]] made his debut as bandleader there, and it became a magnet for artists and writers from all over Africa, America and the Caribbean."&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt; In the words of Toyin Adepoju: "Coming to birth in the flux of the preindependence and immediate postindependence period in Nigeria, it brought together a constellation of artists whose work embodied the quality of transformation embodied by the aesthetic of creation, decay, and regeneration evoked by the Mbari tradition."&lt;ref name=Adepoju&gt;Toyin Adepoju, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nkVxNVvex-sC&amp;pg=PA665&amp;lpg=PA665&amp;dq=mbari+club+1961-&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=avMpHGiG_3&amp;sig=hNQYIXg-sskTOIq6wlV1XB5pihQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirprS83OvNAhXHKsAKHVK2AvwQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=mbari%20club%201961-&amp;f=false "Mbari Club"], in Carole Boyce Davies (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture: Origins, Experiences, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely connected with the literary magazine ''[[Black Orpheus (magazine)|Black Orpheus]]'', which Beier had founded in 1957, Mbari also acted as a publisher during the 1960s — considered to be the only African-based publisher of African literature at the time — producing 17 titles by African writers.&lt;ref&gt;James Currey, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/reseafrilite.44.2.8?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Literary Publishing After Nigerian Independence: Mbari as Celebration"], ''Research in African Literatures'', Vol. 44, No. 2, (In)Visibility in African Cultures / Zoe Norridge, Charlotte Baker, and Elleke Boehmer, Guest Editors (Summer 2013), pp. 8–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mbari published early works by Clark, Okigbo and Soyinka, poetry by [[Bakare Gbadamosi]] (''Okiri'', 1961), [[Alex La Guma]] (''A Walk in the Night and Other Stories'', 1962), [[Dennis Brutus]] (''Sirens, Knuckles, Boots'', 1963), [[Kofi Awoonor]] and [[Lenrie Peters]],&lt;ref name=Columbia /&gt; as well as translations of francophone poetry.&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; Brutus was chosen as winner of the Mbari Prize, awarded to a black poet of distinction, but turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Josh MacPhee, [https://justseeds.org/242-mbari-publishing/ "242: Mbari Publishing"], ''Justseeds'', 20 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Brutus, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Mbari+prize+&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xc8hf72JPU&amp;sig=CCSXqnTGthL_lRgo6ZrdD9jM1Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6qtWyhZbXAhUIY1AKHeVyC_UQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mbari%20prize%20&amp;f=false ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''] (edited by Bernth Lindfors), James Currey, 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1961 by a diverse group of writers, visual artists, musicians and actors, and active throughout the 1960s, the Mbari Club was originally located in Ibadan's Dugbe Market, on the site of "an old Lebanese restaurant that was converted into an open-air performance venue, an art gallery, a library, and an office."&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; 

While celebrating the creativity of Nigerian talent in the [[History of Nigeria#Independence|newly independent nation]], Mbari "was an international environment, attracting artists from across Africa and beyond".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/century-city/century-city-lagos-1955-70 "Mbari writers and artists Club"], ''Century City: Lagos 1955–70'', Tate.&lt;/ref&gt; The premieres of Soyinka's ''The Trials of Brother Jero'' and Clark's ''Song of a Goat'' were staged at Mbari, and internationally renowned artists were also invited to play or exhibit their work, including [[Langston Hughes]], [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Pete Seeger]].&lt;ref name=Columbia /&gt; The club also initiated writing competitions.&lt;ref name=Adepoju /&gt;

As recalled by [[Lindsay Barrett]], secretary of the Mbari Club from 1966 to 1967: "We were in a historic, literary setting ... when [[Nigerian Civil War|the civil war]] [1967–70] broke out and disintegrated everything."&lt;ref&gt;Anote Ajeluorou, [http://www.nigerianbestforum.com/generaltopics/echoes-of-okigbos-poetic-legacy-at-ibadan-reading-tour/ "Echoes of Okigbo’s poetic legacy at Ibadan reading tour"], NBF Topics, 13 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 a similar club based on the same concepts, called '''Mbari Mbayo''' (the name this time reflecting a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] phrase meaning: "Were I to see, I would rejoice" or "When we see it we shall be happy"),&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbia /&gt; was developed in [[Oshogbo]] — about 50 miles northeast of Ibadan — by dramatist [[Duro Ladipo]] together with Beier and Mphahlele.&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; Ladipo converted his father's house into an art gallery and a theatre, where he produced his plays.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Artists who emerged from the Mbari Mbayo Club in Oshogbo include [[Twins Seven Seven]] and [[Jimoh Buraimoh]].&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

===Mbari-Enugu===
The Mbari-Enugu Club of Eastern Nigeria was established in 1963 and like Mbari Mbayo was particularly a platform for sculpture, painting and literary performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yYqYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq=mbari+club+members&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c7N9enyDqR&amp;sig=UstZggNo8RuyVuiITZbmiSMBNgw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnvqyFs4LPAhVJKMAKHflOBbwQ6AEIbjAU#v=onepage&amp;q=mbari%20club%20members&amp;f=false "Common Objectives and Ambitions"] in D.

'''Tombs of the Sanhedrin''' ({{lang-he-n|קברי הסנהדרין}}, ''Kivrei HaSanhedrin''), also called '''Tombs of the Judges''', is an underground complex of 63 [[Rock-cut tombs in Israel|rock-cut tombs]] located in a public park in the northern [[Jerusalem]] neighborhood of [[Sanhedria]]. Constructed in the 1st century A.D., the tombs are noted for their elaborate design and symmetry. They have been a site for Jewish pilgrimage since the medieval period.

==Name==
The Tombs of the Sanhedrin have been known by different names among Jews and Christians. In 1235 Rabbi Jacob the Emissary called them the "Tombs of the Righteous", writing that the tombs housed the remains of "many wise men".&lt;ref name=jlife&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jlifeguides.com/en/sights/other/tombs-of-the-sanhedrin-13528/view-details.html|title=Tombs of the Sanhedrin |publisher=JLife |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first called the Tombs of the Sanhedrin by Rabbi Joseph Halevi in 1450,&lt;ref name=jlife/&gt; and have been known by that name among Jews ever since.&lt;ref name=Arieh39/&gt;

In Christian literature, Joannes Cotovicus mentioned the tombs, without naming them, in 1598.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; In 1611 English traveler [[George Sandys]] called them the "Tombs of the Prophets".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; They were named "Tombs of the Judges" &amp;ndash; referring to the "judges" of the [[Sanhedrin|Great Sanhedrin]] &amp;ndash; by [[Franciscus Quaresmius]] in the early 1600s.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; This is the name they are known by among non-Jews.&lt;ref name=Arieh39/&gt;&lt;ref name=muni/&gt;

[[File:Sanhedrin1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An 1893 encyclopedia illustration of the [[Sanhedrin]] in session.]]
In the absence of identifying plaques or other indications as to the ownership of the tomb, historians speculate that the name "Tombs of the Sanhedrin" was applied because the tombs contain nearly as many burial niches as the number of members (71 to 73) of the [[Sanhedrin]], the Jewish Supreme Court in the era of the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=cotton&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MK_spizMQwC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=tomb+of+the+sanhedrin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=seJ7KD9qJp&amp;sig=J7QKQlnkyrTyq1tP5EzzUb4N8qs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ev91UMiOI8Or0QWc7oDgCw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20the%20sanhedrin&amp;f=false "Sanhedriya &amp;ndash; 'Tomb of the Judges' or 'Tomb of the Sanhedrin'"], in ''Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae'', Volume 1: Jerusalem, Part 1, 1-704. Cotton, Hannah M. et al, eds. 2010: Walter de Gruyter, {{ISBN|3110222205}}, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many archeologists refute this correlation.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eDxQk0MjhcC&amp;pg=PA492&amp;lpg=PA492&amp;dq=sanhedrin+tombs+bodies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IgpSzxe_Cu&amp;sig=EE91s1cSdIiB718vP6eQvj_jL9w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_eCCUKebOvKb1AWmhYDwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sanhedrin%20tombs%20bodies&amp;f=false |title=The Lands of the Bible Visited and Described |volume=1|first=John |last=Wilson |publisher=White |year=1847 |page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=james/&gt; In ''Durchs Heilige Land'' ([[Basel]], 1878), a journal of travel in the Holy Land, Swiss theologian [[Hans Konrad von Orelli]] said he believed that the Tombs of the Sanhedrin and the [[Tombs of the Kings (Jerusalem)|Tombs of the Kings]] (''Kivrei HaMelakhim'') were not necessarily connected to the names people associated with them.&lt;ref name=Arieh39/&gt; Instead, this could have been a burial cave for a wealthy Jewish family.&lt;ref name=Rahmani3&gt;"Ancient Jerusalem's Funerary Customs and Tombs: Part Three Ancient Jerusalem's Funerary Customs and Tombs: Part Three, L. Y. Rahmani, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 45, No. 1 (Winter, 1982), pp. 43&amp;ndash;53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tombs of the Sanhedrin have been a site for Jewish pilgrimage and prayer since the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=bhol/&gt; Since medieval times, Jews considered the tombs holy and would not pass by them without stopping to pray there.&lt;ref name=Arieh39&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben-Arieh |first=Yehoshua |script-title=he:עיר בראי תקופה: ירושלים החדשה בראשיתה|trans-title=A City Reflected in its Times: New Jerusalem&amp;nbsp;– The Beginnings |language=Hebrew|publisher=Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi Publications |location=Jerusalem |year=1979|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1800s, the tombs were demarcated by a huge boulder that guided pilgrims to the site.&lt;ref name=Arieh38&gt;Ben Arieh (1979), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Sanhedrin tombs 2.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Forecourt and outer entrance to the Tombs of the Sanhedrin.]]
The tombs were constructed on the site of an ancient [[quarry]], with a forecourt at one end and the burial caves excavated out of the other end. The forecourt has benches hewn out of the rock for the benefit of visitors. The forecourt opens onto a small courtyard, walled on three sides.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; An elaborately carved Grecian&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2diqr_IIm8sC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=tombs+of+the+judges&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W55k18y-D5&amp;sig=0eScICBLg1ufg0ziKxFUCuCoV7Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jrl5UN3oLYKt0QWD24HwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tombs%20of%20the%20judges&amp;f=false |pages=186&amp;ndash;187 |title=The City of the Great King |first=James Turner |last=Barclay |year=1858 |publisher=Arno Press|isbn= 0405102259}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pediment]] above the large, square entrance is decorated with plant motifs, including [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus leaves]] entwined with [[pomegranate]]s and [[Ficus|figs]], representative of [[Judeo-Hellenistic]] burial art of the 1st century.&lt;ref name=golden&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z2cFY9iGqgC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=sanhedrin+tomb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oNlYD2A71w&amp;sig=DeCa31FtmXW4wqYGCYPqYy1Kpak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=abN5ULrUMYO40QXB5ICgBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sanhedrin%20tomb&amp;f=false |pages=107&amp;ndash;108 |title=Golden Jerusalem |first=Menashe |last=Har-El |publisher=Gefen Publishing House |year=2004 |isbn=9652292540}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner entrance to the tombs is topped by a small pediment&lt;ref name=jerome&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3Yy9FDcT8gC&amp;pg=PT139&amp;lpg=PT139&amp;dq=sanhedrin+tomb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hu7xYxVDN3&amp;sig=MRoCK3LgdC9SLg8kyamYZhS6zjc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Yax5UJ7THIb80QWv_oBo&amp;redir_esc=y |page=139 |title=The Holy Land:An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700 |first=Jerome |last=Murphy-O'Connor|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0191647667}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally sealed by a stone door.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt;

The facade of the tomb appeared differently in medieval times. One report describes a "beautiful structure" containing "caves within caves". A 1659 drawing shows an entrance with a grand, arched [[colonnade]].&lt;ref name=jerome/&gt;

[[File:Sanhedrin inside.jpg|330px|right|thumb|Burial niches in the main chamber.]]
Inside are four burial chambers on two levels.&lt;ref name=cotton/&gt; The largest chamber, just inside the entrance, contains 13 arched [[Loculus (architecture)|loculi]] (burial niches) arranged on two tiers,&lt;ref name=james/&gt; one atop the other, with [[arcosolia]] dividing the niches into pairs.&lt;ref name=jerome/&gt; Each niche measures {{convert|50|cm}} by {{convert|60|cm}}.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; A further 9 burial niches are located in a second chamber off the first, and 10 to 12 more niches can be found below-stairs from the main chamber in a chamber on the second level.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; A fourth chamber on a third level appears as an independent entity with its own entryway.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; The burial niches are arranged differently in each chamber, although each chamber is designed with an eye to [[symmetry]].&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; Stone [[ossuary|ossuaries]] were found in rock-cut vaults within the complex.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; All told, there are 63 burial niches in the tomb, along with several cubicles and niches for bone collection.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;

In his 1847 book, ''The Lands of the Bible Visited and Described'', English archeologist John Wilson describes his exploration of the Tombs of the Sanhedrin:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"From the [[Tomb of Simeon the Just]], I proceeded further on, to the Tombs of the Sanhedrin. These, like the former, are under ground, hewn in the solid rock. The entrance here is still lower, and I was obliged, in some parts, to lay flat down and slide in; but when once inside, I found large vaulted chambers. I counted sixty-three niches where sarcophagi had formerly been placed. In each of these three tombs there were numberless names written on the walls by devout Jews who had visited them".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Opinions differ as to how the bodies were placed in the niches. According to Har-El, Jews placed their deceased either in stone [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in the niches or in ossuaries in vaults.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; Williams and Willis quote an archeologist who opines that the bodies, swathed in burial clothes, were placed directly into the niches, which were then closed or sealed with a stone slab.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-o7AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA152|pages=152&amp;ndash;156 |title=The Holy City: Historical, Topographical and Antiquarian Notices of Jerusalem, Volume 2 |first1=George |last1=Williams |authorlink1=George Williams (priest) |first2=Robert |last2=Willis |year=1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 a French archeologist investigating the tombs discovered a sarcophagus inscribed with the name ''Yitzchak'' (Isaac) in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Over the protests of local Jewish residents, the archeologist took the sarcophagus back with him to France, where it was displayed in the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre Museum]].&lt;ref name=muni&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_main/openTable.asp?src=/jer_sys/tour/vir_tour/show/results_heb.asp?Tour_Spons=4&amp;cont=510 |script-title=he:קברי הסנהדרין|language=Hebrew |trans-title=Tombs of the Sanhedrin |publisher=Jerusalem Municipality |year=2008 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day==
Following the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948, the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem was captured by the Arab Legion and was only reconquered by the Israelis in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967. Throughout that 19-year period, many ancient graves were off-limits to Jewish visitors, and the Tombs of the Sanhedrin became an oft-visited site as a result.&lt;ref name=muni/&gt;

Through the 20th century, the tombs were open to the public. In the 1930s, a young [[Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)|Shlomo Moussaieff]] claimed he found ancient coins in the caves and sold them to support himself after his father threw him out of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/a-man-of-good-fortune-1.71559 |title=A Man of Good Fortune |date=10 October 2001 |accessdate=10 October 2012 |work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, access to the Tombs was restricted due to vandalism and a gate was placed across the entrance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''"Welcome to Holland"''' is a prominent [[essay]], written in 1987 by [[United States|American]] author and social activist [[Emily Perl Kingsley]], about having a child with a [[disability]]. The piece is given by many organizations to new [[Parenting|parents]] of children with special needs issues such as [[Down syndrome]]. As a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name "Holland".&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Far From The Tree]]|date=2012|ISBN=9780743236713|first=Andrew|last=Solomon|authorlink=Andrew Solomon|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]|pages=169–179, 223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emily Kingsley is the mother of [[Jason Kingsley]]. The younger Kingsley is an [[actor]] who has appeared on programs such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and enjoyed a varied [[career]], despite the family being told early in his childhood that his struggles would prevent him from having a meaningful life. "Welcome to Holland", written in the [[Second-person narrative|second person]], employs a [[metaphor]] of excitement for a [[vacation]] to [[Italy]] that first becomes disappointment when the plane lands instead in [[Holland]] and then contentment at the happy events which they experience instead.&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;

==Background and contents==
{{quote|"Holland?!?" you say. "What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy.}}

The metaphor is that the trip to Italy is a typical birth and child-raising experience, and that the trip to Holland is the experiencing of having and raising a child with special needs.

{{quote|But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say "Yes, that's where I was supposed to go. That's what I had planned.}}

In the end, however, the reader sees that the "trip" is still well worth it:

{{quote|But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things ... about Holland.}}

Author and social activist [[Emily Perl Kingsley]] wrote the piece based on her experiences with her son, [[Jason Kingsley]], and her changing beliefs through [[Parenting|parenthood]]. The younger Kingsley was born in 1974 with [[Down syndrome]]. Their doctor labeled the child as a "[[Mongolian idiocy|mongoloid]]" that would fail to learn to speak or walk and instructed the parents to act essentially as if the birth hadn't happened, with the mother sent to receive [[Tranquilizer|tranquilizing drugs]] preventing [[lactation]]. She recounted that she [[Crying|cried]] for several days straight.&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;

Although such medical attitudes were consistent with the [[prejudices]] of the time, the distraught family resisted and determined to provide the boy with as intellectually stimulating an environment as possible. Accounts of widespread [[Child abuse|abuse]] as a result of controversial [[institutionalization]] policies served to spur them on even more. The younger Kingsley has worked as an [[actor]], appearing on programs such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and otherwise enjoyed a varied [[career]] despite various challenges.&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;

==Responses and influence==
As a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name "Holland".&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt; In 2004, Will Livingston wrote a song loosely based on the story. He also used the title "Welcome to Holland".

Critical analysis of the work and its influence has compared it to [[poet]] [[Robert Frost]]'s piece ''[[The Road Not Taken]]'', which also discusses the human tendency to look back and fret about 'what might have been' after people make decisions.

A response essay describing the possible toll that parenting can take on a family's welfare, such as raising children with severe [[autism]], was created titled "Welcome to Beirut",&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt; with the later piece alluding to the suffering from the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. "Welcome to Holland" has also attracted some amused, humorous responses from individuals living in both [[Holland]] and [[Italy]] in contrast to the original story's [[United States|American]] perspective.
